than we were in Munich by the time we
landed an hour and a half later we're
already filming we had a cram a lot of
stuff into a really short period of time
we've had a lot of really cool
opportunities to TechnoBuffalo but one
of the coolest is definitely when BMW
asked us to go out to Munich to check
out their all-new x5 x dr-40 ii so while
BMW was nice enough to fly us out to
germany all the opinions in this video
are my own it's a cool opportunity to
get to go to Munich to drive the car on
European Munich roads to experience
Bavaria to try the food try the beer
just to experience the culture what's up
everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here I
don't generally like to drive more than
30 minutes from my house for anything
let alone travel clear across the world
to Munich without a good reason but
behind me I think I've got a good reason
this is the BMW x5 x drive 40 e and that
little e at the end tells a pretty cool
story
uh.if missiles inside of this guy is a
9.2 kilowatt hour battery pack it's
gonna give you a pure electric range
about 1820 miles depending on how you
drive you want to play a game of spot
the e Drive differences are really
subtle on the left-hand side though this
is the biggest hell this is where you're
going to charge your car and I'm out
here battling the elements to show you
all the cool things I think this car is
going to have so where you're going to
charge it and will charge up on level
two in about two hours
forget a home charger at 120 little
longer I've got a really cool LED
illumination ring around there let you
know what you're doing it'll change
colors depending on what's your state of
charge us at night would you kilowatt
hour battery pack is going to live in
the back without any loss of storage
space oftentimes when cars have an
electric pack you end up with a weird
battery hum or you'll lose storage
through W actually designed the xix your
comment that battery pack from day one
so no issue at all to go ahead open up
this back
looks unremarkable like the back of
nex-5 and again that's part of the idea
oh it did include a handy spot for you
to keep your cables so the bmw x5 comes
with a lot of stuff already in it
whether it's connected drive or the 9.2
kilowatt hour battery pack really the
one accessory you want one John Rhett
injure per car there's also plenty of
space in the trunk so with about an 18
to 20 of my electric range you might
want to control how the car is using
that battery pack and you can do that
with this II drive button I like to push
buttons I'm going to push that guy and I
have three separate ways that car can
use a battery pack the first one is safe
it's going to save the energy in that
pack whatever you want to use it for
later
the other one is max e Drive and that
should be pretty obvious it'll use a
battery Packer first maybe you've got a
short commute you don't want to have to
worry about burning any gas you can use
that next one is Auto II drive that's to
let the car do all the thinking for you
and it with a car this smart probably a
pretty good way to go
yeah just lady with the chainsaw it's
cool
so I've got a straightaway right ahead
that seems like a fun time to try the
acceleration let's go in to change the
drive modes
it's just throw to sport see how it does
fast we weren't entirely sure we wanted
to film so while we're on the Autobahn
we took the closest house part which
means exit and is not a city in Germany
we found a really cool almost abandoned
dirt road that had a farmhouse at the
end of it usually with cars that have
some sort of electric component there's
almost always a premium BMWs done with
the x5 X Drive 40 ease that it's almost
the same price as the base x5 model so
you get all the benefits of the electric
drive without having a shower any extra
bucks the car is also going to come with
xDrive BMW versions of four-wheel drive
and since there's a battery component
you're also going to be reducing your
co2 emissions
controlling pretty much everything this
car is I drive this is definitely the
best version BMWs ever made there's now
a new touch pad on top lets you write in
letters or numbers when you're putting a
navigation for me I prefer the
touchscreen option which BMW is moving
towards though with the new 7 Series BMW
ConnectedDrive has some cool
internet-enabled features if you want to
send a tweak you can do that doing
schedule meeting you can do that too you
wanna use a concierge service and have
them tell you a story they can do that
also talking about it's one thing we
figured we'd actually try it so we
hooked up Ron's phone and sent out a
tweet that was completely in German if
you speak German you can tell us what it
says like all BMWs with connected Drive
it also comes a remote app but hybrid
cars also get some pretty cool new
features I'll pull up a map and show you
charging stations if you're running low
on electricity you want to make sure you
are fully charged up you can also have
some fun with the efficiency you can see
how well you're driving in different
modes and how much lectricity you're
putting back in the car or how much
you're draining if you just want to
floor it one of the reasons BMW thought
of us to drive as cars I've been a big
proponent of electric cars in general so
as curious how this 9.2 kilowatt hour
battery pack is going to work in a giant
SUV the transition from battery only to
gas is actually pretty smooth and lot
smoother than I expected you're thinking
though about driving this car and not
plugging in and maybe just using like a
regular hybrid don't do that you're
carrying around several hundred extra
pounds of battery that is going to hurt
your mpg so if you want to pick up a car
like this you definitely wanna make sure
you have a chance to plug it in on a
nightly basis in comfort mode not
surprisingly the car is comfortable to
drive and sport mode though you might
think it's going to drive like a
3-series and it's not it's gonna still
drive like a big SUV while you are gonna
feel bump suspension can be tightened up
you're not can get the handling love
that you get from something like a
smaller smaller sporty car this car is
more cameras than we do in our studio
it's got a front camera rear camera
cameras under each mirror give you a
full 360-degree view from the top down
so you can see everything going on
outside your car you can see exactly how
close you are to the curb you can see
how close you are to another car in
front of you to make sure you just
ever run over anything again don't run
over anything despite having all these
cameras
I initially forgot they were there and
then these tight European roads I ran
over a curb I was just happy I didn't
damage our car
I was able to check out the traffic jam
assist essentially turns a car into
almost autonomous driving in certain
conditions on the freeway or Autobahn if
you're lucky enough to live near one in
electric mode not surprisingly it drove
like an electric car meaning it had a
ton of torque and it was very silent I
was impressed with how quickly and
seamlessly the gas engine kicked on I
don't know what the actual mpg is going
to be in actual usage we did get a
chance to drive the car and that long so
for all the experience was a lot of fun
I never been to minute before I only
been lucky enough to been to Berlin once
for the IFA show well the Germans are
known for making really good cars
getting a chance to try the beer and
drink the coffee made the trip worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
