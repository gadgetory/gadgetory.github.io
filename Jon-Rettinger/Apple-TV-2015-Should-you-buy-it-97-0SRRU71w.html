to you by domain.com dot ninja and long
last we have a significant update to the
Apple TV it's now a bigger black box in
the last gens smaller black box if
you'll think back the last time this guy
got an update was when I finally got
1080p so lots changed no more microUSB
now we've got USB C on the back got its
optical audio but it is all brand new is
this guy
serene able touchscreen remote that's
charging via lightning cable Apple's
hoping this is how you're going to
control your new Apple TV and not use
universal remote $149 for 32gb is a
$1.99 for 64 there's a lot of
competition and it's out of that impulse
buy category but is it worth watching
your movies your Netflix or Hulu on it
let's go ahead and find out there's one
thing Apple loves its rows and rows of
icons and that's the way your new Apple
TV is going to look it should be very
familiar to anybody who's used any Apple
product or any electronic over the past
few years DUI is very simple to navigate
although now you can have more and more
icons if you want from the all-new App
Store so we're going to go to download
your Netflix your Hulu HBO apps but I
can also download games in a ton of
other third party apps and things that
aren't necessarily TV focus real estate
apps for example are on here if you want
to get your Crossy road on you can do
that now here as well the UI though is
not where the real storage with the
Apple TV I think the real story is with
the remote and what it can do it how you
can interact with your set-top box so
the first thing you'll notice that
there's a microphone button living on
the rainbow that of course you can take
advantage of that noise cancelling mic
to go ahead and use Siri and of course
you can ask your usual Siri questions
but you can also ask it to play a show
or play a movie and has universal search
to go through and find the movie not
just for my tunes but other third-party
video players some give an example play
house of cards you have to hold down the
microphone button while you're talking
and give you the option to our house of
cards is so here's the house of cards do
your original British version I go ahead
and click that it'll pop up menu tells
me I can either buy it from iTunes or
watch it from Netflix how many students
are available and go ahead and do that
right here so while the remote is
presumably very useful it does have a
few odd things first charges via
lightning with no indicator when it's
fully charged so plug it in wait a while
and hope
charged enough for me though I see
universal remote at home and I configure
my Apple TV to using Roesel remote so
this fancy new Siri controller to live
in a drawer I'm not gonna take advantage
of it I'm going to use the Apple TV like
I use the old Apple TV except now with
apps so you got to ask yourself what
kind of user are you do you like having
multiple controls the ability to have
Siri on a remote and that's the selling
point for you that's kind of the selling
point of the new Apple TV there's a lot
of other options out there so asides
from just finding what you want to watch
so you can also help you recommend
things you want to watch let's say
you're in a comic book mood go ahead and
ask Siri show me comic book movies show
me superhero movies superhero movies
ah play superhero movies so is the Apple
TV worth 150 to 200 bucks the question
only you can answer for me I do almost
all my streaming via my Xbox one or
Playstation 4 there's nothing new here
that I can't already get with those
since the remotes gonna live in a drawer
but if that's going to be something
you're going to want to use is something
that's going to live in your hand go
ahead and pick up the Apple TV you know
exactly what you're getting no surprises
here with it what do you guys think
about the Apple TV you kind of want to
hear your thoughts I don't we have a
comment down below with importantly
