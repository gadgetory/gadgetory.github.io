to you by Squarespace what is going on
everybody I'm Noah kravitz this is asked
the Buffalo today's Monday August
twenty-ninth 2011 in this episode of
techno Buffalo is brought to you by our
friends at Squarespace jon rettinger is
that what is not on vacation he's
working hard but he's in Europe prepping
for fifa over in berlin germany with a
little bit of a sightseeing reader
meetup some other stuff going on there
in London and in Paris before he heads
over to Berlin or is going to be meeting
up with some of the other rev3 folks to
bring you just all kinds of hands down
the best coverage possible from Aoife so
stay tuned for that in the meantime I'm
stepping in not that I could ever Phil
John's shoes or his chair what could
probably feels cherien Hugh's but I'm
stepping into host to ask the Buffalo so
let's get right to it thanks for all
your questions posted to the site and
also via Twitter
all right fusi wants to know a few SC I
if you see a few shape did I press that
correctly wants to know what is your
favorite gadget that you either lost or
had it stolen from you my favorite
gadget that was ever lost or stolen
first thing that came to mind and I'm
gonna run with this one unless I think
of something else first that came to
mind was my discman my sunny discman and
my they weren't like super high-end but
they were kind of fancy DJ style over
the ear earphones that I had stole
stolen from me out of my own house I
used to live in Brooklyn and we had a
house party one night and let's say
things got a little out of control some
people just kind of came into the party
and nobody knew who they were but nobody
asked and I don't know whatever in any
way some people wanted up hanging out in
my room upstairs my backpack was on the
floor end of the night my backpack is
gone and had my discman and my earphones
and I wish I could remember what CD it
was it was probably like Kenny G's
greatest hit sir no but I that's the one
that comes to mind first my favorite
gadget that was either lost or stolen
I've broken a bunch of gadgets in my day
but that's a different story see Kim 33
615 wants to know do you think anybody
will ever make an android phone called
data I hope so man that is a fantastic
idea I totally I want the data Jake
pride asks do you ever jailbreak any of
your apple mobile devices yeah I have
jailbroken iPhones and iPads in the past
myself currently I have an iphone 4 that
is not jailbroken i have an ipad the
first generation ipad one that is
jailbroken and i jailbroke it
specifically so i could test it out with
the ik do I have the I kid I'm the I kid
right here the little plug for the icade
this thing won't even fit in frame I'm
too far away it's a video game cabinet
that it's Bluetooth controller and then
it's just got a little plastic holder
here to put your iPad in and so this
thing works got a joystick and what like
eight buttons there this thing works
officially with Ataris greatest hits so
yes I have jailbroken devices before
currently iphone 4 not jailbroken ipad 1
jailbroken let's stay on the tablets
here mr. uber duck
wants to know do you think current
honeycomb tablets will be able to run
Ice Cream Sandwich and later versions of
Android yeah I believe that most if not
all of the current honeycomb tablets are
going to be eligible for an upgrade to
ICS android 4 we think it's gonna be a
droid 4 but ice cream sandwich when it
debuts officially later this fall not
all but I think most of them and
definitely this newer generation of dual
core honeycomb tablets will be as for
beyond that you know these things seem
to have a shelf life of maybe two
generations worth of devices are
eligible for the latest upgrade so
that's kind of a rough rough estimate
there's got to be is there a name for
that like Moore's Law can we call it
tonight did I Quinn it can we call it
crabbies law that new gadgets now have a
shelf life of two major OS releases
before they're no longer supported I
don't know is that actually true anyway
I would think you're going to get ice
cream sandwich support and then you know
they'll be a bunch of incremental
updates the way that you've had froyo
and gingerbread neo 22 23 or whatever
you'll see if they call it 40 you can
see some some dot updates in there that
you'll be eligible for when the next
giant release comes along whatever that
is you know we'll have to wait and see
depends how long it takes to get there
Josiah swans to know what our youth in
the nexus prime having a 720p screen
when Apple said there's no need to go
higher because the human eye can only
see so much will it slow down the phone
yeah so the nexus prime which is rumored
said all but certain to be the next
Nexus phone it'll probably be the first
on one of the first Ice Cream Sandwich
phones coming out sometime this fall
probably in October and the rumors are
that it's going to have a 720p display
1280 by 720 on a cell phone screen now
the thing is when Apple's talking about
the retina display and the human eye can
only see so much detail that kind of
thing it's not just the number of pixels
but it's the size of the screen and so
you do the math and you figure out you
know at a screen of whatever three and a
half inches you've got a resolution of
you know
800 x 600 is making these things up and
you do the math and you come up with a
number of pixels per inch ppi or DPI
dots per inch so the whole retina
display thing is based on the numbers of
pixels per inch what I've been hearing
about the nexus prime is that yeah it's
going to have a 720p display but it's
going to be a really large screen
somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.6 4.7
I may be hearing a specific number four
point six five inches certainly greater
than four and a half inches what I'm
hearing so auto display that big you're
not necessarily pushing the boundaries
of the whole retina thing like you would
be if you cram that many pixels into a
smaller screen like Apple did with
iphone for the three and a half inch
display that being said 720p HD on a
cell phone awesome on paper how's it
kind of fly in person or people even
going to be able to tell the difference

koala asks how did you meet Noah Kravitz
and John quach so I think the question
directed at jon rettinger i want to flip
it around how did i meet John and John
through doing this I actually used to
work I used to work at phoneDog some you
may know and I actually used to work
with John Q sometimes add phoneDog he
did some stuff for phoneDog as well and
so I knew him through working together
there and jon rettinger and I met
through YouTube basically I you know he
was he obviously has been doing the
youtube thing for a long time under John
for lakers before technobuffalo launched
I was doing YouTube originally on my own
channel crabby crab which then I gave
way to the phoneDog channel and John
reached out to me oh man as a couple
years ago now i guess and i said hey man
you know i'm a fan of your stuff and I
was like yeah me too and you know we've
got some it's interesting we've got some
crossover audience some it's not cross
over but you know let's let's do a video
together let's come with an idea and do
some kind of a video together and you
know see what happens so I think the
first video we did was like an apple
rumors prediction thing right that makes
sense and we did that project together
he's a super great guy as its John Q for
that matter junk you may be the nicest
person on earth he might be I'll think
about it my mom probably before him but
it's close and john r is not far behind
either i mean just really lucky to work
with the Buffalo folks good people
anyway point being John and I got to
know each other a little bit from doing
that project we stayed in touch and then
you know when I left my old gig wasn't
sure I was going to do next John and I
got to talking and it was like wow
there's a chance to work together let's
do it and the fact that John Q was
already here you know made it all the
sweeter so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
