out there and it can be tough to figure
out which one to get you want the same
phone your friend has you want to stand
out in the crowd I just wanted moments
gonna work for whatever let's say two
years you're gonna have it I've got two
but I think are the best phones out on
the market I've got Samsung's Galaxy s7
edge all all dolled up and gold which is
my favorite color and act the latest
from HTC comes back with a vengence with
the HTC ten so I figured let me tell you
which one I would pick I'm not gonna get
too much into specs and they're both
fast they both have almost exactly the
same specs II both have Snapdragon 820
s4 gigs of ram they're both very quick
phones there a few things that make each
of these unique let's start with the
Samsung a few reasons that you might
want to pick up this phone first if you
are clumsy you live where rain to drop
it front on the toilet or you just want
to take it swimming with you IP 68 is a
huge reason to get the galaxy s7 or the
sm an edge it works well we tested it a
lot of proofing is absolutely incredible
on it also the edge screen it doesn't
add much the utility department but it
really looks I think very cool and also
optics so megapixel camera on the back
is really incredible the pictures can
look little oversaturated but overall
one of the best camera if not the best
camera if you want to know how it
compares to the iPhone 6s we got a whole
video that talks about that one of the
killer reasons that you would want to
get the s7 and s7 edge is the screen
screen is absolutely incredible Samsung
has the best displays on the market 5.5
inches of q HD glory and also now has
expandable storage but there's a big but
surprisingly maybe to some this would
not be the phone that I would get my
current fickle heart goes with the HTC
10 there's a lot of things to like about
the HTC 10 so let's start with that
little slot right there HTC does a
killer job with their speakers and the
new boom sound speakers on here but
there's a powered amp living inside of
the headphone jack so you're going to
get absolutely killer audio there is
that headphone which is a nice thing to
have now well the galaxy s7 does have
quick charge and does have wireless
charging whereas HTC 10 does not this is
quick charge 3.0 and USB see it's going
to charge very very fast I can get all
technical with you but just suffice to
say you plug in for five minutes you're
gonna plenty of juice to get through
almost
old dates it seems almost like a magic
trick so I don't talk much about this in
reviews usually but this front facing
five megapixel camera has oh is built
and demonstrated in our review and it is
really good so if you do a lot of
vlogging or you want to take videos of
yourself walking around actually the
first phone I believe that is OAS built
into the front-facing sensor and it's
absolutely incredible
speaking of cameras the 12 megapixel
ultra pixel 2 camera is also really good
and I don't think it stacks up to the
camera on the s7 but it is really close
and I can leave it there being a little
bit inferior I wish it launched faster I
think the s7 launch is incredibly fast
but if you're worried about G C's camera
do not worry they have done a killer job
with the camera on the 10
so I mentioned ip68 on the s7 edge but
the HTC 10 as well as every HTC phone
comes with a protection if it gets water
damage if the screen breaks they will
fix it for you for free you get one free
oh and they'll send you a new phone but
if you don't break it it want to get
other HTC phone give you $100 towards
that which is also very cool both phones
have expandable storage but HTC gives
you adoptable storage which is great so
what that's gonna mean it's gonna
essentially treat it like one giant mesh
of storage not two separate drives not
we have internal not what you have
external just one giant storage makes a
lot easier I think filiz for me for
managing apps and pictures and music and
other miscellaneous media the big reason
for me is software HTC worked with
Google to eliminate a lot of duplicate
apps and a lot of blow where this is
really close to stock Android it also
means you're gonna get updates I think a
little bit quicker than what Samsung has
done in the past and a little bit spotty
with their updates HTC is claiming they
will be months of first to get updates
available as they come out if there's
you that like to routes this is a go-to
version I think unlocked bootloader if
you buy the phone unlock from HTC is a
huge reason I think to get the HTC 10 if
like the tinkerer customized so there's
a lot to like about both phones for me
though if I had to pick one up into
combination of minimal software on here
is the reason that alone I would choose
HTC 10 having said that the s7 is
probably my second favorite Android
device out there you pick one of these
suckers up your dock be disappointed
what do you guys think do you agree or
disagree with my vs. in comparison am I
just gonna get screamed and yelled out
in the comments leave it down below do
videos thumbs up we always appreciate it
till next time
