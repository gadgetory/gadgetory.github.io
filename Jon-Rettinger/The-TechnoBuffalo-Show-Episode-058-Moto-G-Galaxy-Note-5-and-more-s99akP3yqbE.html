Buffalo show online you're two hosts for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton hey everybody how
are you doing this week Todd I'm good
that is a good thing so not a whole lot
going on this week but we are of course
heading into a lot of things happening
big one being next week we assume still
folks we have to just assume because we
don't know for a fact that the galaxy s6
and the s6 edge+ Boogaloo whatever
they're calling it will be a Todd we
cannot hear you you've needed your mic
somehow I see the little mute symbol on
you but so while we're way for Todd to
learn technology unmute himself so yeah
we've got a lot going on next week for
sure and then of course we're going into
September which is traditionally iphone
month so there will be a lot of stuff
upcoming and act okay there there he is
so yes as I would say a lot of stuff
coming up but right now I know Todd you
want to end folks this is not an
official review yet he's working on that
but I know you had some comments you
wanted to make about the Moto G yeah we
talked about the Moto G last week and I
have it here still and I'm seriously
loving it it's crazy 189 dollar start
price but I have the 16 gig model with
two gigs of ram so I think it goes up a
little bit little over two hundred bucks
but it's crazy i was using the galaxy s6
and I like that a lot but the battery
life wasn't great the battery life on
this is a little better I've seen
reports online saying like you know it's
amazing and I wonder if they're using it
as a daily driver which I am now and you
know it plays all the games i think last
week i said i want to play vainglory on
it i have been so even though it's got
the snapper
in for 15 or whatever that it's holding
up perfectly well for multitasking and
everything I'm kind of showing it to
everybody and then the last weekend I
took it in the pool for fun because its
water resistant I was taking some
pictures underwater it was perfectly
good there to the only thing i guess and
i had mentioned this last week tues you
really got to make sure the back cover
snapped on you can see I just snapped it
so it wasn't just now before you go in
the water and really it's ipx7 resistant
so that's typically for saltwater so
it's really not supposed to go with a
pool but I always sort of just you know
test these phones take it there anyway
and and trust you you can do and then
the camera is fine it's the 13 megapixel
same as nexus 6 according to Motorola
it's not the best but it's something I'm
willing to sacrifice for everything I've
been using it on AT&amp;amp;T speeds are great
all kinds of stuff the only thing is and
I've been using it pretty much as my
daily driver actually entirely as my
daily driver last night I put my sim
into the Nexus 6 because I got into the
the project 5 program finally so well
yeah that's coming soon and I just
wanted to sort of get used to Nexus 6
real quick again get all my apps back on
there I had to update it to the android
5.1 point one manually so i was flashing
that last night so doing lots of nerdy
stuff but then i'm going to put it right
back in the Moto G I think and use
project fight on that I'm just I'm
really loving this phone i can't believe
it costs that much I mean you can sort
of get it because it's plastic and the
screen 720p and you're like oh it's not
the best book I don't know there's I
have really no complaints with it what's
the screen size on the G again ah that's
a good question i don't know it off the
top of my head i want to see something
like 47 maybe larger yeah that's my it's
great Mother's finally getting a
smartphone and so we got him a 5s
refurbished and I sang it up for him the
other day I was like how how did I ever
do this it was so tiny it's a school
yeah I did have to get used to that a
little bit but I was coming from the
galaxy s6 which is fine
look up that uh yeah I'm just curious
i'm sure you would you know I'm going to
England again and you know as I've
discussed on the show many times I get a
sim all of them over there mm-hmm from
three and so I'm thinking you know
depending on the screen size this might
not I mean my mega 6.3 is getting pretty
old at this point you know so I'm
thinking maybe I pick up g and make that
my yeah you travel phone on a travel
phone it's great for travel and I think
even like I found even at home here on
this spectral yeah because about the
only thing I really do when I'm out and
about is like Google Maps if I need to
make local UK calls you know or local UK
texts and so on right so I'm just
curious a ok and with Google Maps you do
want a decent screen size so you can
read it yes they're not like panning in
all the time and all that exactly where
I'm trying you know the problem is you
write up so many leaks ahead of time
that you're sort of like my brain is
going to the leaked specs I'm like it
was that the final spec yeah no I fully
amazing how are you I could just go to
the product page on tight that's what I
did with my so i'll have it in just a
second here sorry and it's the same as
last year so I guess that's funny Here I
am saying like it must be 4.7 that would
feel really small any of these days yeah
all the time five inches were huge
phablet things in this feels tiny but
yeah exactly exactly but speaking of
phablets so you know we're hearing all
these rumors about the galaxy note 5
which we presume is being announced next
week I the big one of course this week
was the rumor that it's not going to
have a removable back though no
removable battery and no microsd support
yeah and that's that's kind of a bummer
to me I mean sort of because if you look
at it this way it's it's just they offer
enough storage I'm assuming you're going
to go up to 128 so if you need the
storage fine get it but I think in the
past no users have sort of been those
our take everything with you kind of
users hmm that always like I had a taxi
driver once we were talking about
podcasts actually and you know so he
told me he was a tech fan and he
introduced me to the brand anchor which
we both love for batteries but the gist
of the stories this is he carried this
extra battery in his wallet all the time
for his note I think it was a note to at
the time and then I started doing that
too and so you have these fans that do
that and sort of that's the attraction
to the note and now Samson was kind of
pulling that away and I think that's I
forgot to turn off my air conditioner so
go ahead and would just like to continue
yes so I think that's the thing that's
crazy to me is that in the past you have
the note users that wanted the battery
wanted expandable storage and you know
for the same thing the market for the
galaxy s5 and that was was the same and
I think a lot of people were like oh
Samsung stitching that but I feel like
one place they should have kept it's
probably the note except i guess the
trade-off and it's right off i'm sure
that samsung will use in its in its
speech is like oh well we wanted to go
for this industrial design and people
aren't saying they want expandable
storage anymore and etc etc but if you
look at what HTC is none they have a
metal design they're able to slide a
microSD card slot there no problem and
then I think maybe it's it's ignorant to
say that people don't want them
removable batteries on the microSD
because Samsung's Galaxy s6 and s6 edge
sales weren't where they wanted them to
be so is that the right path that
they're going down and did they make
another mistake here as they admitted in
the past they've made mistakes sort of
with with budget materials but you know
this phone was probably in development
long before they knew what their galaxy
s6 hillsborough well here's what I was
wondering though because like you know
one plus is saying that NFC wasn't that
important because that many people don't
use ahead but you know people such as us
in our listeners you know we all felt
that was important right so the question
is is maybe are we overestimating the
importance of micro SD yeah I mean I
think in some cases we are on the m9 you
know the nexus 6 the gal
six for the most part I don't really
worry about it but on this phone the
Moto G I value it because it only has 16
gigs of storage so that's going to take
the bulk of my apps because when you
store your apps there the bulk of its on
the local storage and then micro SD I
can just you know jam up with all the
offline videos and music and stuff like
that but you'd run out of space pretty
quick at least I would with 16 gigs of
storage just not enough for me they're
60 16 gigs of storage once you consider
the size of the OS is nothing yeah yeah
there's like nine gigs usable or
something but but thankfully samsung is
not going to have a CI doubt a 16 gig
note 5 so they'll be probably 32 64 128
again 32 you're at you know you're in a
little better place I think you can get
your apps there and then you can store
some music and stuff like that and again
these days in the thinking for all these
manufacturers is that everything's in
the cloud so like yeah you save a couple
albums offline but you don't need your
whole library offline because anytime
you have a connection then you're good
to go yeah I'm with you I like to save
huge amounts of music offline because I
don't know what I want to listen to you
on a flight or I don't know what I want
to listen to you on exactly exactly and
people why do you take everything with
you I don't know what mood I'm gonna be
in from oh yeah that's the name exactly
like Oh what if I want to watch this
movie at that point I don't know maybe
I'm not gonna feel like a comedy and
that's why my 32 gig ipad is starting to
drive me nuts hmm I because you know and
most with my apps on there i get like
three movies onto the thing right you
know so i've tried to put them on there
like at the last second because I'm like
okay what mood to my in at this very
moment right on the same way with
everything apps like games I have
different like what if I feel like a
puzzle game or what if I feel like an
RPG or something I think I like to have
as much on the phone as possible then
sometimes it starts to slow it down
which gets annoying no that's why i
still like ipod classic I all my musics
on here all my podcasts are on here you
know it's great you know i just i can
take everything with me and listen to it
anytime I want anywhere I want right
but yeah i don't know i mean the i think
what i think is happening with the
microsd thing and this is pure
speculation you know well if you think
you need that much storage we probably
should get you into this phone yes it
costs more right right you know and the
price is far more than it would cost you
to buy a microSD of the same size right
exact thing microsd cards are so cheap
now especially if you want to get a 64
gig it's like probably twenty-something
box may be cheaper something right we
finally see the 128 SAR dropping yeah
exactly yo so I don't know I I think
that this is somewhat of a little bit of
a scam by the companies and again this
is all speculation and just me speaking
out of turn as I usually do but it's
just beginning to feel and of course
they can also look at a pond go well you
guys let Apple get away with us yeah I
know that's the thing but it's it's it's
not that we're letting Apple get away he
said Apple never gave us the choice and
I think that some people might have I
mean you have to wonder how many people
were sticking with Samsung or these
other makers because of micro SD
removable battery I mean that was a
that's a big argument when you go into
any Android verse iOS argument you know
is that oh well I can do all this with
Android and then some of its now sort of
being taken away yeah well we have a
question from such a ball is the galaxy
note5 worth it even if it doesn't have a
micro SD card slot and removable battery
you know as I always say with any time I
get a question about OSHA I get this
phone should i get that phone yo and so
on it's totally up to your use case
situation yeah you know I think once you
decide on your OS I mean if you decide
on iOS oh you have a whole plethora of
choices but if you decide on Android you
know just go into the store or see if it
feels good in your hand does it do
everything you want you know weigh the
pros and cons for yourself I mean we we
can say all day long this phone's better
than that
phone but it may not be the better phone
for you yeah exactly you know I like
well I would tell most people right now
if you're getting an android phone you
know look at the g4 and the s-sex
probably right now that's what I would
say but but for me and for some people
now I would probably say well maybe also
look at the Moto G which is not a phone
i expected to fall in love with as i
have so really yeah it does it depends
on your use case what you want and and
what the phone can do I mean this goes
back to the last week to this doesn't
have NFC so I actually went to go pair
it with my speaker recently and I was
like oh yeah it doesn't have NFC and I
was kind of bummed by that but you know
but in a 189 dollar phone you can kind
of expect that yeah I'm like okay
whatever and you know it doesn't have
wireless charging you know you've got in
pay for that so yeah exactly oh yeah
this is reviewed I should be found and
pay for this one at all but yes I don't
know it's interesting I own I I think
that some point the phone manufacturers
are going to have to realize also that
they can't continue to charge us what
they've been charging us yeah you know I
the price is that's starting I think
we're starting to see that like you do
bones or dropping in price they even
look how quickly now t-mobile just
discounted I don't know if the stories
up on the site yet but just discounted
the s6 and s6 edge by like a hundred
bucks and 200 bucks so the 32 gig 64
dropped by a hundred bucks in 128 models
drop by 200 bucks so actually if you're
hunting mobile or shopping for a phone
you go there and it's I want to say like
something like 584 32 gigabyte phone and
then 64 128 or price the same so you
should definitely go with the 128
because they dropped the price of 128 x
200 which is incredible so there's no
point to buy the 64 gave my line yeah
exactly i I don't know it's I think
we're going through a transition period
phones you know and I'm going to be
really interested to see where we are
probably in like two years because one
year you know the stuff that's coming
out over the next year is all set
already yeah the problem with and you
know I guess it's our responsibility to
help tell this story is that i remember
when people are like should I get the
new iphone or should I get last year's
model because the new ones 200 bucks
that's way too expensive i'm just gonna
spend a hundred dollars and it's crazy
to me that people don't realize they're
buying these full-fledged computers that
are worth 900 bucks right all right it
costs the company to you wanted
something to build it but the fact is
it's still a very expensive product no
matter you know who built it or what it
is and so that's going to be a tough
pill for some people to swallow when
they don't understand the whole contract
is thing isn't there and maybe they just
buy this unlock phone but it's 400 bucks
and it's still not the best out there
like there you suspending a hundred
bucks for the second best or two hundred
bucks for the best and here we are you
know just not paying any subsidies but i
think that's that's the issue that
carriers and you know consumers they're
going to come up against united states
even though it's better for everybody
lower lower costs service you're not
stuck in some contract you can move
around carriers you can switch your
phone whenever you want you know I a new
one if you want to or sell this one etc
I really wonder though how many people
switch carriers all that often you
probably not that often but you have at
least the choice whereas you know
there's people who are like oh man like
I still have another year Suckley I have
a buddy who last summer went in the pool
with his iphone and used his mom's up
created verizon right because he's on
the family plan and there was an upgrade
available and he's like I'm taking hers
so I don't the payout of you know wasu
for the new for another iphone so he
used her upgrade and got a phone and now
this year he was going to use somebody
else on this family plans upgrade and
and of course he can't because his mom
wants that and he's now stuck with
horizon for at least another two years
from last year so another another one
year and like you get into this forced
cycle of upgrades and stick
with a carrier and I feel like I'm like
t-mobile CEO right now but it's true
kind of like you're just sitting there
waiting until you can buy another phone
that's not going to cost you 900 bucks
where you know you don't have to I'm
sorry Todd we will never confuse you
with yeah look at like you're tied down
with those old carriers yeah you're
wearing a barn too little magenta yeah
so we have a two took them two blocks to
say this let me get through this whole
thing from andrew thomas i keep seeing
reports that then an iphone 6 iphone 67
the 5c was considered a quote-unquote
budget smartphone because it was cheaper
and contract the newest apple's flagship
and the 5c didn't do particularly well
if i recall considering Motorola's
surprising unlocked price tag for the
new Moto X should Apple compete with
that four hundred dollar price point for
the six see do you think apple will have
issues even selling its flagship set
such high price going forward thanks
guys oh boy well I think it would be
wise for Apple to probably do something
in the unlock market at a price like
that but of course you can always buy
these from Apple's phones you know
off-contract if you want to it's just
they're sort of marketed with you know
depending on the carrier either these
new AT&amp;amp;T next kind of plans or just
regular to your contracts I think it
would probably be smart though to have
an option like that though we saw I
guess the most recent reports are now
saying second half of 2016 for the 60 or
something like that so not for herb
maybe it was first half of 2016 so not
like in September we're expecting me
yeah which is really weird yeah you
would think they would want to get a
budget leo kouda budget phone apple for
the holiday shopping season yeah I think
so too end but I was reading reports
today sort of apple's share price has
fallen a little bit recently and people
are worried about you know our i found
iphone sales going to start falling sort
of the way ipad has and I think and
they're looking at China for expansion
but that's where a phone like the 6c is
sort of
should help in China in places like that
but also here in the United States as
you as you do have these new competitors
like the Moto G so for example though in
China huawei and show me are now are
sorry reverse that show me and Wale are
now the top two apples and third and
those guys are selling really budget
phones so Apple does need to play in
that market but typically in the past
it's just used its older models to do so
and I don't know if that's what people
want maybe they do I think it's not I'm
sorry you lost me after you said how I
and show me because it sounded like a
Chinese sitcom I just pictured like
opening credits I don't know it's gonna
be interesting to see I think Apple does
need to compete in the budget area
especially in the emerging markets if
you look at India China Brazil parts of
Africa yeah Brazil certainly that's
where these companies are killing it
yeah the Moto G is the number one
selling phone in Brazil right now and so
Latin America is important India is
important for all these people and if
apple doesn't get into that field I know
they want to protect their brand image
and all that but I'm sorry if you don't
get into that arena you're going to
start to lose traction because as those
markets do emerge as they do get bigger
they're going to remember oh I love my
show me yeah yeah exactly they're like
oh I love this brand I've been with them
for a long time i'm just going to
continue buying those products i mean
people do that with cars and stuff too
yep like you get your first car and then
you're like oh I love that you know
beater Ford I had all buy a new Ford
this time in yeah we've got a question
from Alexandra my toes at which this is
funny I was just good just like Al show
I need to ask pot about this i have a
galaxy samsung galaxy s5 but i need a
dual sim mobile phone is the 1+2 a good
choice if not what should i buy i was
actually just saying her going you know
i wonder if i should just get a dual sim
yeah dual sim phones are awesome is the
one the what the regular one plus two is
that dual sim here that there's no I
don't think
so I think there is going to be another
model with it but uh I don't think it
will check like I said I've we've been
covering so many phones recently it's a
whoo I'm like they're good folks like
Todd said it's hard for us sometimes
because we've gone through so many
rumors for us to recall right off I know
the room you will sim and then and then
there's always like us version and then
an international one will have it so
like we wrote up a rumor today the
galaxy note 5 which will you know be
announced like most likely August
thirteenth in New York City there's a
rumor that there's going to be a galaxy
note5 duos but Samsung's almost
certainly not going to even bring that
up at the event so if I was you I might
wait and try to see what they're doing
with that the screen size is too big you
know then no but this is why I've never
understood and by the way if you pretty
much every samsung phone that ends in
duos means it's a dual sim so there's a
lot of duos samsung and actually I've
never had any of these phones cross my
desk sometimes I see them at the events
but that's really it but you have to
agree why don't dual sims ever get
released in the US yeah I don't know I'm
trying to think none of even I was
thinking like maybe the Windows Phone
ones but no I don't think so because
they did like a 640 in 640 XL but those
the dual sim versions i don't think came
to the US i don't know i think it's in
other markets where people share phones
and stuff like that but I I wouldn't
mind playing around with one for a bit
just to see what it's like yeah I mean
now in Europe yo you you can they cross
country borders like we cross state
borders yeah perhaps that's a different
reason yeah but you know with more
people having a work phone and a home
phone it'd be nice to throw tool to set
I mean the whole part of the reason I
carry two phones is one's work one's
home ones also Android ones iOS but
sometimes you know like say I'm going
out for the evening which never happens
I'd love to throw both Sims into one
phone and then all I have to carry one
fun with me right yeah so it was funny I
did I opened up a second line I was like
one will be my word
moanin one will be my private line and
they're both just both now it's whatever
phones handy Yeah right like if I need
to call John about something just like
whichever phone comes out my my shoulder
bag first yeah and then I my google
voice number which once upon a time many
years ago was my work number is now
going to be active on the project five
phone so maybe that'll become my work
phone I don't even know anymore I didn't
know you got project fry yeah no I got
it I got the invite at when I saw it it
was like eight o'clock last night oh I'm
really excited to hear what you yeah cuz
the guys in irvine have it but i don't
know if we've covered it much out there
i know t mobile's not john just did a
thing you know a post on which carrier
should you use and I know he has issues
sometimes with t mobile coverage so
perhaps it's not great out there but I
think t-mobile supposed to be pretty
good around me so yeah I'm really
excited to see what it's like well we've
got some other questions rolling in here
from morning glory 95 so with some leaks
of the new ms Lumia 950 XL do you
honestly think that they have a chance
of getting into the market in the u.s.
there late to the party well I think the
same advice for a long time they've been
late for a long time but one plus was
late to the party you know and look at
how much it took off I I still say the
whole problem with windows phone is
their app store I don't care how many
times they come out and say it's getting
better the mindset is there that they
don't have the apps yeah but the thing
is and this this will help a lot as as
developers make desktop apps for Windows
10 computers those they have the option
to use that code to scale it right so
they can scale as you would on your dust
it's called continuum you can you know
you drag the the far corner and make it
smaller and bigger and it'll just adjust
the size and if you take for example on
Windows 10 the Photos app and scale it
down to as small as it'll go it looks
like it's about 4 inches that's exactly
what the Photos app looks like on a
Windows 10 phone and the cool thing
about that is so you can have a nap way
Twitter which just released its Windows
10 app and i'm not sure if it'll work on
mobile but ideally i think that's
supposed to be the idea is that then all
of a sudden you can you install that
awesome app on your phone and then if
you use a feature like continuum where
in microsoft hasn't said how the
hardware will work but the leaks for the
950 XL you're referring to you have put
us bc we're perhaps you like a wireless
display technology you then hook that
phone up to a monitor and you get the
full screen experience the exact same
Windows 10 app that you have on a
desktop PC and then that to me is
awesome and I think that's going to be
the big selling point but whether
consumers have already sort of shrugged
off when do this phone is as dead or not
is I think the real concern so they have
to have this killer hardware it looks
like it's going to be pretty sweet I you
know the leaks are showing the quad HD
display I know the back was covered but
there's renders that look pretty awesome
so I think it'll be a lot about that and
you know if they can show you that you
take your phone and you and you show up
at a desk with a monitor and you know
have a keyboard and mouse travel
keyboard and mouse I mean those things
are awesome and you have a full computer
like that's pretty cool or at least a
pretty good experience because outlook
is one of the ones that will scale like
that that's a Windows 10 app like I said
photos I'd have to check on Twitter but
I have Windows 10 running on my phones
but I don't know if it's you we still
have until like october i think until
windows 10 for for phones is really
ready so they might not be optimized yet
but there's a lot of potential at least
more than i've ever seen and the other
thing is when I talked to Microsoft and
meetings about Windows 10 before it
launched their really bullish on people
making windows 10 apps that work across
them because they said you know they
have 1.5 or 1.4 billion people around
the world using Windows so that's that's
huge and they want developers to realize
that and so ya know and I think that is
going to be a big point for when for
Microsoft at this point yeah I don't
know half and I want to just call the
company windows I think I was no
particle recently where the guy was
calling it a Microsoft 10
and so I know I I think this is good for
Microsoft but it's going to be hard for
them to get over the stigma because once
a idea is planted in people's heads it's
the hardest thing in the world to get it
out yeah it's BlackBerry's problem too
yeah oh no blackberry has a lot of
problems well they have a lot of
problems but I think one of them was was
consumers were like who uses
BlackBerry's exactly from such a mahal
have you guys been to the google HQ also
known as googolplex I've never have of
you know I haven't I've been to their
new york headquarters right that's not
the good things John's I know a couple
of the guys and how I know I think
John's been there yeah I think there was
an IO up there yeah but nope Todd and I
have not been I had nothing we're not
cool enough from xpat rest's what do you
think about the oneplus 2 OS oxygen OS
you know a lot of people were facing
touchscreen and many issues before with
one plus one yeah um that's all the
reason I'm not getting it too I think
it's I think going with oxygen was
probably a good move for them I mean I
love cyanogen and I think that was
probably a big selling point for the
oneplus one but they said you know now
they have more control over the updates
it can push that stuff faster and if
that's true and if they really do it
then that could be a benefit for end
users as for the actual experience I
haven't played with get one yet but you
know the gestures and stuff are still
there looks pretty cool yeah and
actually this is our last question I
you're all being quiet today please if
you have questions feel free to submit
them from such Mahal how do you feel
about the 1+2 auctioning off one plus
two invites for charity I'm always good
with anything done for charity I'm
always good with charity too i think
that's cool idea and you I don't know it
seems a weird that anybody would be
against that but well I think part of
the problem I don't you're like paying
your way up the list yeah well it's
going to a good cause
so yeah well the other thing is to the
first couple I'm sure will arrive right
on ebay and people will pay their way to
grab those you know exactly I this whole
invites is I I have a bigger problem
with the once you get invite you're able
to invite somebody else and that pushes
people behind you down the list yeah
it's like you you got to go find friends
that own 1 plus to use your hangout in
the forums or something like that I
don't know yeah it's very odd I I don't
quite understand why they're doing it
that way but that is their right so
since we actually for once are through
all the questions although we have a lot
of viewers so please if you have a
question ask it yeah we're going into
the fall uh-oh I think the thing we
haven't been asked about that I'm
surprised about you know we're always
asked you know what do I what do we want
to see out of a iphone or out of this
android phone what do you want to see
how the ipad this year oh boy I think
I'm most compelled by an ipad pro that i
can use as a work machine as sort of
like that i can actually do something
with like I know people say you can use
iPads but for me you know i have the
ipad mini and I've considered a regular
ipad but I just can't really do
everything that I need to do for work if
I could get a real multitasking machine
and I don't just mean to app side by
side that would be probably the most
compelling for me so I don't and I don't
know what the answer is maybe it has to
have you know like a desktop
environments or something like that I
kind of want to see and I don't think
it'll ever happen but you know how you
have the new Windows 10 what do they
call cloud books i think they're called
they're taking on the Chromebooks i
almost want to see Apple go into that
arena with like an affordable macbook
that's you know maybe in on an atom
processor until atom processor it has
like a lighter version of of OSX maybe
I'm crazy and it'll and I know it'll
probably never happen but that's what i
mean by like a work experience something
i could do you know the ipad is still
way too much about just plain old
consumption yeah because I could get a
you know like another netbook I my foot
windows head on it and it's like not
supported yet so it doesn't even like
let me get the new full version and it's
really buggy so that was dumb move on my
part but I kind of want like a a new
either Chromebook or war Windows 10
light machine and I'd like to I guess
I've already said this but i'd like to
see apple do them yeah so and I well
we've got a couple questions I've come
in thank you everyone from Christopher
Jimenez have you ever asked mkbhd to be
on the show we actually have not asked
anyone outside of technobuffalo to be on
the show because we have a hard enough
time coordinating those of us that are
in technical photo to be on show it
maybe someday down the road we have a
very friendly relationship with them and
yeah i actually just met him at the
motorola vet last week is very nice I
know John's metem you know quite off I
know they talk actually on a regular
basis I've met him at CES once or twice
very nice guy absolutely no problem with
you know maybe someday him be on the
show it's just at this point we have
hard enough time coordinating two of us
you're in the company and I might comes
on pull in yeah and then your clamp top
one charge this morning and yeah from
I'm not even gonna try Zhi arw is HTC
dead why are they so quiet uh-oh uh-oh
protect me um Todd you deal with their
dad I think quiet I think they because
they sort of i mean they've they've
already iterated on the phone but i
think they kind of launched something
that they thought initially was going to
be really great and here comes samsung
and LG with phones they're arguably
better from a lot of angles and I I
don't know I think they're upset by that
they probably sales or way below
expectations and I don't think they had
anything really ready on deck to go I
mean when you're a company like that how
do you have to flagships and development
at once like that was there 2015
flagship
so now what I don't know I think that's
why they're quiet probably going to try
to build something else but you also
have to wonder how can they spend that
money I don't think so no it's kind of
unfortunate please come out we like the
folks at HTC we love you know they make
great products you know I just we would
like to see them you know the one m9
every I love everything about it except
for the the camera it's like really bad
yeah that's the problem with a lot of
phones because you know what phones
weren't meant to have cameras oh come on
I think HTC should have done something
better i don't know maybe they couldn't
get the modules they wanted initially or
something put well we have a question
from X Petraeus what what do you think
about nexus 5 2015 you think it will be
a hit or miss or are as we know there is
a moto and one plus is available in the
same range I don't think google really
worries about the nexus line being a hip
yeah I don't think so either it doesn't
seem like that's what they're going for
and I guess the specs we've seen for
nexus 5 2015 sound like it's sort of a
mid-range phone and you're right
probably you're in the Moto range though
i don't think the moto x plus or what
are we calling it the Moto X style Moto
X pure is mid-range I think that's more
flagship but the one plus yeah I think
they're both I think the moto and the
oneplus are both more powerful than what
we're expecting from the nexus 5 2015 so
then we'd otherwise look at the hallway
nexus which I think supposed to be
larger and sort of two flagship Nexus
and I'm excited to see that but really I
don't think we know much on them and we
won't until probably closer the fall
from brazen franco and brazen we already
talked about the all that stuff on the
note 5 if you want to go back and listen
to the episode once it's released on the
various podcast methods but also from
brazen is there any there another
collaboration video with Linus coming up
if there is I haven't her
about it I know John and he enjoyed
doing it but you know honestly John
handles all the video stuff and quite
often I know about it once it's filmed
yeah it's going to say we're sort of the
editorial side of the site so we haven't
always know what's going on with video
sometimes we collaborate especially on
like reviews and stuff but we don't
really know what's going on yeah oh
let's see we got time for one more here
from kira Yuki what upcoming phones are
you guys the most excited for and why
for me I would say the Moto X pure
addition I just really want to try that
out um yeah geez I think I'm excited for
the new at five but then I'm also kind
of not excited for it because I'm one of
the one of the guys that usually likes
expandable storage at that price the
Moto X is neat but I'm not sure I want
to spend that much and the iphone 6s 6s
plus i'm excited but i really want to
see what happens more with iOS 9 and
what's going on with force touch and
that kind of stuff so i don't know i'm
not none of those phones have me like
whoa so hopefully it somebody has
something a lot more exciting coming I
don't know yeah I'm I'm kind of at the
point we're like we're like the s6 it's
pretty sweet and the g4 is pretty sweet
and the Nexus 6 is pretty sweet even
still and so like what am I like what
are we going to do that really pushes
this category because I feel like Moto X
puters and really push it the 1+2
certainly doesn't push the category so I
want to see like what's that next big
step like who's going to do that no and
it might not be until we see like the
galaxy s7 or you know until next year
okay let's not start talking about the
s7 I'm saying like I feel like yes six
for me push the boundaries in a lot of
ways you get this super sharp quad HD
display on that size of the screen works
with gear VR so the gear VR thing won't
be as impressive to me with the note 5
since I worked with the note
or yeah the the double wireless charging
Sochi and PMA I thought that was really
cool the quick charge stuff is faster
than ever so and the design was a big
change so for me that was a big push and
now I feel like almost whereas in the
past the note was was the one that
introduced all these new features this
year it's sort of now can I just fall in
line with the s6 and look more like that
with the larger display new S Pen
features and stuff like that but i don't
know maybe Samsung has a lot of
surprises of course this is a question
we get quite often from sahaja why isn't
John on this show a couple reasons the
biggest one being that when we tried to
find what we thought was a good time for
the show unfortunately is at nine a.m.
pacific which means he he's usually in
the office well before nine but he's
just starting his day so he's got lots
of calls to make emails to catch up on
and all that sort of stuff we don't
really want to move the show later in
the day because then it gets too late
for the east coast so we're kind of in a
pickle of when we record of course of
course it's not that we don't want John
on the show we would like John to be on
the show and he will be at some point
he's been on in the past and he will be
on again it's just pretty much
impossible for him to be on a regular
basis from wayne glass glow and this
will probably be the last question we
actually covered this a little bit a
couple episodes ago what do you all
think about chrysler cards being heck do
you think it's the downfall of having
that much technology your vehicle to the
point where it can potentially
compromise your safety yes yeah I think
it's terrifying and I think the recall
sort of says how huge that is shows how
huge that is so yeah it needs to be
addressed yeah yeah yeah um we got time
for one or two more quick ones for Manu
Suresh what was your experience with
samsung galaxy s2 what it was released
that was actually the first samsung
phone i used i believe ha i've used them
on all the galaxies i'm trying to add
more what that won't even look like it
was it was a slab it was
just a plain slab yeah but was that the
capacity capacity or whatever it was on
ATT or was that the first one well no I
actually wait my first I used the s2 and
started with a see oh I can't remember
what it was kapat yeah that's the one
I'm talking about yeah I was like with
the metal body yeah what was that the
second Jenna yeah it might have been
that was a mess too yeah I like to come
up that phone it was after this too but
before the sky rocket yeah I can I'm
dating it now added like LTE or
something or is that the skyrocket turbo
I don't remember hey mast who was where
everything went nuts okay the last
question will go out on entertainment
question for Morning Glory 95 I think
you've answered this on your website but
what do you think of the trailers of the
movie the Martian I think it looks
amazing it's awesome Ridley Scott when
he is on his game is untouchable when
he's off his game previous it's a
disaster so I I'm tentative but very
hopeful no but oh well Prometheus oh the
trailers look awesome and I haven't read
the book but apparently that's very good
I've bought the book i have not had time
to read it yet yeah it's been on my
kindle for each me to read it at some
point but i believe that is going to
