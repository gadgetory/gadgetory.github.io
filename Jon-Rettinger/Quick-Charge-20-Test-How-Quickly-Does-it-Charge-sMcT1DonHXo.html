from TechnoBuffalo and today we're gonna
quickly talk about qua comes quick
charge 2.0 technology which has started
to become more widely available in
devices released over the past few
months now why should quick charge
technology really matter to us that's
what we're here to find out we're seeing
more powerful devices all the time
thanks to improved display technology
and faster processors but sometimes our
Need for Speed comes at the expense of
battery life which has become an
increasingly important topic
now even though today's devices do have
larger battery they're still being
depleted by high-definition displays and
quad-core chips the larger the battery
the longer it takes to charge a Qualcomm
quick charge technology is designed to
reduce the overall amount of time it
takes to recharge your device there are
quite a few devices out in the market
that are compatible with Qualcomm quick
charge technology like the Nexus 6
Xperia z3 HTC One m8 Moto X and more so
what I have in front of me are the new
Moto X the Droid turbo the Nexus 6 and
the Galaxy Note 4 now for the note 4
we're using Samsung's adaptive fast
charger and a regular charger with the
Nexus 6 since it sports the same size
3220 million battery this should give us
the best idea of whether or not quick
charge 2.0 does make a major difference
or not for the Moto X we'll be using its
own standard charger and then Tessa
would Motorola's turbo charger to see if
one is better than the other welcomes
technology is designed to work best when
a battery significantly depleted and the
charging rate will actually slow down as
charging progresses all of these devices
are at around 10 percent battery life so
we're going to charge them up for about
15 minutes and we'll let you know what
be fine after charging the note 4 for
about 15 minutes using the faster
charger we went from 10% to about 32%
and using a standard charger with the
Nexus 6 the device went from 10% to 19%
which is 13 percent less than what we
could have achieved using the turbo
charger the Droid turbo charges 3900
milliamp battery meanwhile went from 10%
to roughly around 30 percent using
Motorola turbo charger for the Moto X it
got up to about 25% in 15 minutes using
a conventional charger and actually ran
the Moto X back down about 10 percent
battery and charge it back up this time
using the turbo charger and
fifteen minutes I got about 40% which is
a pretty big jump over the 25% we got
earlier now the question is this quick
charge 2.0 technology make a difference
judging by our results we were able to
get more battery quicker and if you're
only by an outlet for a few minutes like
it layover between flights quick charge
technology is definitely useful and will
get you a few extra hours compared to
conventional charging technology thank
you guys so much for watching this video
and if you guys would like to see more
make sure to hit that subscribe button
down below
and we'd like to play video games every
now and then in this office so make sure
to check us out at twitch TV slash
TechnoBuffalo and we hope to see you
guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
