Lakers and I wanted to give you guys my
impressions of my first 24 hours with
the iPhone 3G this is not my full review
the full review will come after I've
used it for a week or so but I wanted to
just let you guys know what up and
thinking when my first day first thing
having 3G is really nice I went out to
dinner last night and I was able to log
into the website check my email all in
all most broadband like speed so that's
really handy I tested out the GPS while
I was outside and was able to find my
location very quickly I'd say maybe five
seconds and I was pinpointed and then it
followed me as I was moving down the
street which is very cool that's a nice
feature but it doesn't have full
turn-by-turn directions with voice and
speaking you the directions supposedly
TeleNav or TomTom are coming out with
something but there were some
limitations in Apple's SDK so we'll have
to you will have to see one thing that I
did notice immediately was a screen
looks a little bit yellowish compared to
the original screen I only noticed that
when you're looking at something with a
white background well I'm feeling a lot
of people noticed the same thing and I'm
saying gadget spoke with Bob Borchers
who is the senior director of product
marketing for Apple on the iPhone and
had some kind of cool things to say
about the you know the yellowish green
phenomenon according to him the screens
color temperature has been purposely
altered on the new iPhone to produce
warmer more natural tones sharper images
and deeper blacks the company is saying
that the first gen iPhone screens
appeared colder and less defined in the
mid 10 adjust some adjustments in the
new model and I will say when you're
viewing images on the new screen the
images do look much much much brighter
which is very nice and when you're
outside and you can view the screen much
easier than you could on the first
generation iPhone so I guess that's why
Apple one head and did that and they
made it a little warmer I guess what
they're calling it so if you have a
phone and you're saying it screen looks
a little bit different it's supposed to
be like that I compared it with three
other iPhone 3G screens they were all
the same so yours is not unique call
quality while on 3G sounds absolutely
amazing
Gizmodo set it right on the bat if it
sounds
difference between somebody speaking to
you their hand over their mouth and then
then taking it away it just sounds so
clear and so loud it's fantastic call
quality over edge network is the same as
the first generation the speaker on the
new phone down there is really loud when
I used to watch YouTube videos in the
first generation I'd have to turn it all
the way up to hear it over my fan or
whatever noise I had in the background
now I have to have it almost half way
down I get the same volume all the way
up is almost too loud so if the speaker
volume was an issue for you on the first
one second one's gonna be a very worthy
upgrade and much like everybody thought
the back is definitely a fingerprint
magnet
you know that's expected Apple went
plastic because the radios inside give
better reception and I've absolutely
noticed that I can get a Wi-Fi signal
now when I'm down in my garage whereas I
would lose it almost when I walked at my
door so that's a pretty big difference
so Wi-Fi even though it's using the same
radio with the plastic back really
strengthens a signal so that's really
nice now notice that I'm getting a
better reception I'm an edge only areas
then I did it the first generation so
that's why they went ahead and you know
put the plastic back on there I had the
8 gig version it's also really nice to
put all the music on here and still have
like a loving gigs free umm so I'm
looking forward to that I haven't tested
out the putting headphones in there or
anything else haven't really played a
fit terribly much just last night miss
afternoon but I wanted to give you guys
my first impressions I'll recap all this
when I do a review look for that coming
up and for more information be sure to
