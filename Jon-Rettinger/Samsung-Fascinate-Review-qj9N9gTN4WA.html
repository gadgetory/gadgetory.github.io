from TechnoBuffalo here's a full review
of Verizon's Galaxy S offering the
samsung fascinate let's go ahead and get
started
the name Galaxy S is starting to become
synonymous with Android phones it is a
branding technique that is being seen
across all major carriers in the US and
this is Verizon's version of it the
samsung fascinate so Before we jump into
the review let's go ahead and recap some
of the specs and see what you're about
$200 on contract is going to get you
first it's gonna get you a four inch
Super AMOLED touchscreen with a
resolution of 480 by 800
what Super AMOLED means you're gonna get
very darker darks you're gonna get
brighter colors you're gonna get better
visibility in the sunlight essentially
what it does is it takes the touchscreen
mechanism on the phone and puts it
actually into the glass as opposed to
putting it right on top it's gonna give
you a little bit better visibility
overall it features a five megapixel
autofocus camera with flash it's capable
of shooting HD video at 720p it's also
one of the fastest smartphones around
featuring Samsung's 1 gigahertz cortex a
hummingbird processor which shares a lot
of architecture
I would apples a4 chip same thing that's
in the a iPhone 4 and the iPad is
running Android 2.1 commonly called
Eclair with Samsung's custom skin on it
would you see you right now
call TouchWiz Samsung has said that it
will be upgraded to 2.2 Froyo in the
near future said it come with 2
gigabytes of internal memory and a 16gb
micro SD card installed it's also
compatible with Verizon's 3g mobile
hotspot potentially going to turn your
phone into a mic by device so it'll suck
in Verizon's EVDO network and kick out
Wi-Fi you can connect to up to five
devices so now that we've recap the
specs let's talk about the phone itself
no matter how good a phone is or how
many features it has or what touchscreen
technology uses it doesn't make good
phone call it's not going to be
much used to you and it typical to most
Verizon phones that I reviewed call
quality on the fascinate is really
fantastic
I had no white noise on my in colors
have no white noise on there and there
was gonna be popping I experienced zero
drop call by using this as my daily
phone and it really just worked very
nice so it almost sounds like the
landline quality something to keep in
mind this is a fantastic device but
actually was able to pull in a
relatively strong signal where I usually
maybe got one or two bars of Verizon a
video signal generally has pulled in a
little bit more where I am right now
sometimes they don't get any ride and
signal and I'm getting two bars as we
speak let's talk about battery life
that's one of the negatives of the phone
and there aren't many negatives battery
life is not the greatest you really need
to do some decent battery and memory
management with your phone in order to
get through a full day I'm a pretty
heavy phone user I use the browser quite
a bit I'm making a lot of phone calls
and using email a lot and at a hard time
getting through a full day I have to
always find a charger to plug it in one
of the nice things about the Galaxy S
though it does feature a removable 1500
milliamp hour battery so if you're a
power user you can always pick up
another battery if they even have a
fully juiced and ready to go alright so
let's talk a little bit about TouchWiz
interface I'm sure you're probably
familiar with Android and what it looks
like this is a bit different this puts
four rows of icons on the bottom which
are customizable and serve keeps them on
each screen go ahead and view and see
each screen here and you do have
actually seven home screens you can
choose to have more or less but seven
are really what Samsung gives you I'm
not the biggest fan of touch with it
does have some nice enhancements more
the nicest enhancements that it has is
right on top you get controls for your
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and airplane mode
and when you're in a phone call you
actually get the speaker buttons right
there and a call soon I have to actually
jump into the phone menu do that you can
just slide down the notification tab and
you get all your information right there
oh it really is a handy feature TouchWiz
also features when you're in your
contacts you slide your finger to the
right to make a phone call and slide it
to the left to send text they are
something nice enhancements their
applications look a little bit different
that's sort of encapsulated in these
squares and then go ahead and scroll
through whatever you'd like and you
download apps from the marketplace they
still show up
these squares you can customize these
pages any way that you like the
captivate does or the suti the fascinate
does feature four capacitive buttons
across the bottom and I'm not the
biggest fan of capacitive buttons
oftentimes I had to sort of tap them
twice to make sure it works or once to
light it up and wants to register the
touch that's a little bit of a small
detriment to the Galaxy S series of
devices but certainly not any huge
negative running this hummingbird
processor this phone is blazing fast
probably one of the fastest phones that
I have ever tested really just works
quite well on speaking of speed that's
going to take a look at the browser
because a browser is really fast on this
device and as you can see right there
there's a big flash logo unfortunately
this does not yet support flash 10.1
that will supposedly come with the
upgrade to 2.2 its Android 2.2 Froyo
which will support flash it does have a
fantastic multi-touch browser though
which really capable of great pinch to
zoom and I think this is really where
you see the processor speed a lot of
times with multi-touch device to pick up
an Android the phone is underpowered
you're going to see a little bit of
delay I'm going to use your multi-touch
gestures here it is almost instantaneous
and just works very well
all right you can see probably that the
screens got a bit of a tint to it that
is one of the I think downsides of Super
AMOLED display it's got a bit of a blue
tint to it which is going to give you
better visibility and Rec so I'm like
some people might be positive for me
it's sort of hinders the experience of
using this gorgeous screen but not
nearly enough that it hinder it that I
wouldn't want to use the device there's
something to keep in mind it's gonna
make the pictures and the text look a
bit warmer I suppose let's go ahead and
jump back here
one other thing to notice about the
samsung fascinate is the back of it
features a plastic back which I found to
actually come loose every now and then
if that after you snap it back into
place perhaps that the product is my
review unit you can see right there
there's a little speaker the
speakerphone volume is not incredibly
loud as when they tested many phones
with a better speakerphone volume so if
you rely on speakerphone when you're in
a car you might want to
best in a Bluetooth headset it's usable
when you're in a quiet environment but
you have ambient noise around it's gonna
be a bit more difficult to use the phone
is very very very thin and very easily
pocket but I think this 4 inch screen
may actually be the perfect size it
doesn't create too much bulge in your
pocket and you put in your purse knife
and take up too much room really just
worked it very well overall I'm
extremely thrilled with the samsung
fascinate definitely representative of
my view on the galaxy s Sousa device as
a whole if you don't like the way this
phone looks with TouchWiz with Android
being open you can customize it to your
heart's content and really make it look
and feel your own just one of the really
big selling points of Android I've been
a big fan of the phone I enjoy the phone
I'm actually using the phone as my daily
driver and I can recommend it
wholeheartedly so on one to five scale I
gave this phone a very very very solid
4.75 almost 5 just due to some build
quality issues that was fixed there's
going to be a very solid 5 and I can
completely recommend this with two
enthusiastic thumbs up if you're a
Verizon user in the market for an
Android phone you definitely owe
yourself to take a look at the samsung
fascinate I'm John renters and
