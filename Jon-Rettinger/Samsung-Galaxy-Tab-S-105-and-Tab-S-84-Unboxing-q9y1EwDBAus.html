TechnoBuffalo here and very few things
make me as happy as unboxing so much new
technology I've got the latest from
samsung I've got the Samsung Galaxy Tab
s 10.5 I got its little brother but same
SPECT 8.4 version mono let's go ahead
open these things up and see if they
look like it supposedly they are very
slim super-powerful right so here are
the Galaxy Tab s don't call them the
Samsung Galaxy Tab even though I'd
ethically have two of them this is the
all-new Tab s took a lot of cues from
the galaxy s5 so both of these have
almost exactly the same specs but
different screen sizes and they pack
quite a big punch the 10.5 in addition
to the 8.4 of crazy resolution here 2560
by 1600
both of these are octa-core to do that
by using two quad-core processors a 1.9
in a 1.3 they have the fingerprint
scanner was built into the galaxy s5
eight megapixel autofocus camera on the
back and 2.1 on the front so let's pick
we do choose-your-own-adventure which
one should we unbox first over here for
this one over here now we're gonna pick
one let's do this
smaller 8.4 first this is the size I
really like in in tablets I can go ahead
and pull this up from the back thank you
to the folks at Samsung for sending
these our way and that is it this thing
is crazy thin I will do the size
comparison here in a minute so you can
sort of appreciate the design that went
into it looks well it definitely looks
galaxy s5s pushed it out this I have a
quick second see else you're going to
have in the box not much else power
cables book push all that stuff off to
the side this is really nice looking
device
so go ahead will unbox it's a big
brother and little power of both of
those suckers on we could have just a
multi tablet experience so let's bring
in the 10.5 here don't do the same thing
it's like open it from the back
there we go pull this out of the box and
just as thin and just as galaxy s5 ish
see there's somehow something new and
fancy in the box that we didn't same
same stuff don't expect like candy in
here cuz that that is not gonna happen
so push all that stuff up to the side
here our both of the tablets I'm gonna
go ahead and power these on and we'll
take quick look at the OS all right so
we've got the big Galaxy Tab s 2 10.5
all powered up and it's hard to show on
camera what a screen will actually looks
like on a device this one looks awesome
as you'd expect from a resolution of
2560 by 1600 considering regular HD is
1920 by 1080 this is super-high
resolution here you're gonna get a lot
of things in the Box I'm not officially
in the box but they're gonna come on the
tablet which lives in the box so you're
gonna get access to three free months of
Marvel unlimited so download all the
comics you want a year free Google
Wireless six months free Wall Street
Journal 23 months free New York Times
not kinds of other free stuff in here
looking at the main story here is how
Fitness device is it is really really
thin 0.25 6 inches it's just absolutely
tiny when you look at it you're probably
saying yourself hey Jon how'd they do
that well it's an AMOLED display which
means they have no backlight so it can
make it thinner AMOLED also means it can
use less battery so it can also be
smaller the battery on this guy there
the big one 7900 on its little kid
brother it's a 4900 milliamp hour
battery so pick which one is going to be
best for you take quick look here we've
got the Samsung experience stuff we
expect the multitasking stuff is there
if you swipe in from the right-hand side
we've got go ahead and jump into all of
your files and you kind of very quickly
here if you like that little folder on
the icon the left looks like all of your
apps gonna come built in here there's
some kind of cool stuff that's gonna
here happen here so side sync is going
to work with the galaxy s5 line of
devices so that's that's five in the s5
active if you get a phone call or text
message and you have a Galaxy s5 you can
reply and they'll show up here right
the device if you have another Samsung
device you still get sort of
functionality but not survive I think is
the coolest reply and answer phone calls
right from your tablet so anyway bear
that in mind
so else we're gonna have here you got
Evernote built-in Flipboard built-in
there's your business week stuff Chrome
Netflix rest of stuff you kind of expect
probably download right away not so much
in the way of bloatware cuz this one's
not on a carrier which is always kind of
nice jump into settings real fast go
down to the bottom go to about device
see what we're going to have Android
4.4.2 right out of the box and again
just really really thin but I think of
thin tablets your mind might immediately
go to something like the iPad air let me
show you guys just how thin these two
are when next to each other and it is
really really incredible so go ahead and
just do a tablet sandwich here
and you can see the thinness of the
Samsung it's really I mean incredible to
see just how thin this device really is
a super tour of all the buttons and such
that are going to live around it so
you've got your multitasking button
right there
go ahead and okay I hear anything you've
got open
you've got your main home button your
back button both of those flaking in our
capacitive on the left-hand side speaker
grille i'm 3.5 millimeter headset jack
on the top power lock IR port and on the
right that's where you're going to
charge your microSD card slot and also
another speaker on the back you might
notice something a little bit weird
addition to 8 megapixel camera you've
got these two little holes and those two
holes might be more pronounced here I'm
small over and you can see it now on
either side that's going to be for the
coverage they're gonna offer two covers
for this either a book cover or a simple
cover let's go ahead and show you the
book cover here first
and it's called a book cover because
well you can guess covers it like a book
the idea here is that it's not going to
connect to the device by wrapping around
the screen they want to keep that thin
profile so it's gonna connect by using
these little ports that plug in so let's
go ahead and drop it and see how easy it
is put it into the book oh it's kind of
easy to see how that goes
come here there we go stamps right in
closes right up and you're off to the
races with it so very very thin and
keeps that profile you also get what
they're calling the simple cover which
is just really a screen protector cover
go ahead take a look at that guy all
will be available in a variety of colors
as well so pull that off this guy over
here and see how it connects so again
those two little holes is sort of new
Samsung's new a connection standard here
video play in the background line them
up push it in and you are I'll connect
at least in theory you really got it
pushing hard and got a video plan there
hey you see the screen looks like
beautiful alright so get the simple
cover install then it just covers the
front and you can see what it does on
the back creates a little bit of an
uneven surface not much though and keeps
again that really slim profile looks
like Samsung's got another very solid
tablet offering here but of course we
will put it through its paces and review
the big guy and a little guy and see
which one's or if any we recommend any
questions or comments leave in the
comments down below until next time I am
