TechnoBuffalo here we see the Galaxy Tab
numerous times been released on every
major carrier in the US however this
particular Galaxy Tab has a trick up its
sleeve you can use it as a phone this
guy can actually make regular phone
calls just as you would on your iPhone
Android device whatever it is you've got
in your pocket right now you can use it
for this now it has not been a hardware
issue why we haven't seen regular Galaxy
Tabs be able to make phone calls
carriers you're actually restricting it
and Samsung has been slow to release OAM
models which have this capability so
I'll show you what it looks like to make
a call on what's perhaps the world's
largest phone let's go ahead and get
started for this test I'm actually going
to call my wife and we'll say hi to her
on camera I'm gonna pull this off to the
side so our number hasn't pop up there
there is the dialer can see what it
looks like you got dialer logged
contacts groups in favourites and there
is the phone number you got voice funky
abilities as well to use that
front-facing camera I'm gonna go and
dial it right here
well they're called
and see if it works so I'm covering up
some phone number business there hey
babe we are testing the phone call
capabilities of this tablet on camera
say hello how do we sound how do we
sound sounds clear awesome thank you
very much
bye go ahead and hit end and that's it
you can make phone calls quite easily on
your Galaxy Tab not sure why this
feature was restricted if you've got a
SIM card in there or you've gone an EVDO
modem certainly would make sense that
you can use it to its full capabilities
however that has not been the case I do
just have a standard AT&amp;amp;T SIM card in
here I'll pop it out and show you that
there's nothing sort of fishy going on
here no weird clients if I can get my
nail in there pop it out
just a 18t card of course on camera it's
always harder to do there we go
so just a normal 18 TCM popped in there
and you could go ahead and make phone
calls and use your plan as you would
like to so it's gonna go ahead and
reboot when you pop in a SIM card and
that's it just a short video did you
hear what it was like to make holes on
the galaxy tab so you're not gonna put
this guy in my pocket and head on off
with it but you could if you wanted to
you know it certainly would make
something like the Dell Streak look tiny
by comparison hey guys is something that
you would ever use you know would you
want your galaxy cat to be able to make
phone calls at least give you the option
to decide whether or not you want it and
use it like you hear a back from you
anyway I'm John Rhett intervene
