TechnoBuffalo here I've been out of the
office for the past week and a half
hanging out with my wife and my new baby
boy Nathan but there are a few things
that would get me back in the office and
this right here is one of them
it is the Galaxy Note 3 for AT&amp;amp;T we took
a look at the unlocked Galaxy Note 3
last week now we've got it all dolled up
and carrier colors let's go ahead take a
look and see what comes in the box so
here we've got the box for the Galaxy
Note 3 sometimes carriers I'll throw in
a few extra so we'll see if we get
anything fun and surprising go ahead and
open this guy up we've got some AT&amp;amp;T
QuickStart guides and to refresh your
memory this is a 5.7 inch 1080 display
it's 1920 by 1080 giving it a ppi of 386
drops it aside for just a quick second
we've got the white version 18 t is also
getting the black version and
internationally there is a pink version
as well or maybe some carriers might get
it it's like the folks 18 to you sent us
this took off the back sticker already
they probably threw in a SIM card will
peel this back we've got Galaxy Note 3
we've got I don't know what that is
that seems weird you can figure that out
we've got a pretty gigantic battery of
size 3.8 Volt Lithium Ion how many
milliamp hours 3200 milliamp hours and
we've got just your regular Wallwork
charging sync cable nothing surprising
so the mystery of what these guys are
tips for the stylist so that will you go
with the s-pen which lives right down
here I never would have guessed what
that was but looking at that tip it all
makes sense to me now so let's go ahead
and run through the specs here on the
Galaxy Note 3 so Android 4.3 I launched
the Super AMOLED screen 3 gigs of ram
storage 32 or 64 with external storage
options via micro sd 13 megapixel camera
on the back 2 megapixel shooter on the
front 802 11 ABG and
see Bluetooth 4.0 does have NFC onboard
does not ship with wireless charging but
I believe they'll be a wireless charging
capable back just I don't think it ships
with wireless charging I really hope
that it does NFC of course is onboard
for Google Wallet anything else you want
to do with your tap e type stuff and
it's going to weigh 168 grams
so go ahead and pop in the battery see
what the sucker looks like I should say
though that's there's a lot of questions
on whether not the back is actually
leather same plastic back we've seen on
other Samsung devices but it's a little
bit more textured it does feel better in
the hand but it's still that same
plastic so love it or hate it it's still
here let's pop in the battery alright we
got this guy all booted up and are ready
to rock and it looks a very typical
Samsung it's go ahead go into apps see
it we've got here a ton of AT&amp;amp;T add-ons
that ever carry you get this on I'm sure
it'll have similar offering the GT code
scan or Drive mobile Locker Navigator
all kinds of other stuff we got some
games in there a lot of Samsung specific
stuff it does come with polaris office
pre-installed which is quite nice and
the ton of other applications here a lot
of the S apps that Samsung is known for
going to settings real fast will scroll
down see we've got here screen mirroring
nearby device is an S beam if we go on
over to general go down to about device
we can't see it as Android 4.3 it's got
and pull out this S Pen which now is
reversible you could I know the jokes
are gonna come you can put it in both
ways this way or that way and there's
all kinds of other stuff we covered it
when actually was in IFA but you can do
all kinds of other stuff with it you've
got Air Command scrapbooker screen right
s finder and pen window pen windows kind
of neat so I'm not actually touching the
screen when I do this I should mention I
go to pen window and I just get that and
I just draw a window on here it's gonna
pull up certain the shortened shortcuts
for applications that I can select to
put in there which is kind of neat
although I probably won't take me that
long just to do that and find what I
need but hey it's cool to get a draw on
the screen with stuff I know it this is
the new S Pen it certainly feels much
much much better there's a button on
there as well you can use to activate
things and draw on it and all kinds of
other sort of stands and Pacific stuff
we'll talk about all that in the full
review when I do my testing I'll be
using it in conjunction with this guy at
the galaxy years
these two are best friends right now
this is really only useful with the note
3 I know two of my favorite phones of
last year so I'm hoping the note 3 is
going to be the same way but I'll put it
through its full paces and let you guys
know but until then let me know if
