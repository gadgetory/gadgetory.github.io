from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of the newest super phone
in Verizon's lineup the Motorola Droid X
so let's start this review with what
this phone is meant to do most and that
is make phone calls and it does it
extremely well call quality is crisp
clear it sounded like a landline
I had no drop calls there was no white
noise or buzzing or clicking on my end
or the callers other end the
speakerphone quality on this thing is
fantastic it is loud and works really
well and I shall give you a quick
demonstration of it you can hear it
serves the quality of the speaker that
Motorola put into this is really just
very nice and that is probably the
loudest speaker that I've seen on any
service smartphone and certainly I've
tested a fair share so that definitely
goes to the quality of the hardware that
Motorola put into the Droid X so if call
quota is issue for you no need to worry
as far as the radio in here that as far
as the reception that it gets it doesn't
get the best reception I've tested many
other Verizon phones the exact same
location and had maybe between three and
four bars of EVGA grab a service with
the Droid X here I tend to hover between
one and two and not to say I can't hold
on to a call of you by just holding one
bar of 3G service here I never
experienced a drop call but if you are
in a fringe area something that you're
going to want to keep in mind all right
so let's jump into probably the other
most important thing about this phone
and that is it's monster monster 4.3
inch TFT screen oh the resolution of 480
by 854 which makes it one of the largest
phones now on the market and the screen
is just gorgeous the resolution gives a
bit of a taller resolution so there's
less scrolling through web pages and I'd
ever say this in a lot of other previous
videos but it just works very well the
screen is bright it's vibrant it sort of
shows what you're looking at and shows
where you're looking at very well so if
you're worried about scrolling through
menus you know Android is very menu
so looking at you know applications you
can now see more on one row which will
reduce your scrolling as you go through
the menus so the screen is absolutely
gorgeous it's bright its crisp tex looks
fantastic it's very responsive to
multi-touch so when you're on the
browser you can do any pinching and
zooming it'll work quite well for you so
I'll go ahead and jump to a web page
right here just give you a quick example
I'll jump to a TechnoBuffalo comm and if
you sure wondering or comparing this
with other phones I did do some head to
head with the iPhone 4 and the Evo 4G
I'll put links to those in the underbar
and in Ephesians sort of right around
here so you guys can see all right let's
go ahead and sort of keep jumping along
here spec wise this thing is really
expected the gills
using Texas Instruments OMAP 36:30
processor which clocks in at 1 gigahertz
so we keep hearing 1 gigahertz processor
you generally heard a Snapdragon or
Apple's a for the certainly is a third
entry and this entry does not disappoint
it handles things very quickly
multitasking works very well it's a snap
as far as how quickly it loads content
loads of programs and such it just works
very very very well so you're not going
to any sort of slowdown and that's also
due to the 512 megabytes of on-board ram
which is quite nice as well so let's go
ahead and sort of continue and talk
about the rest of the specs here it does
have 8 gigabytes of internal storage you
can up that all the way up to belief 40
with a 32 gigabyte card of a 16 card
will be included in here it's got sort
of the included things you'd expect
Wi-Fi certainly 3g gps and bluetooth the
web browser is very good certainly I
think it's sort of stock Android works
very very well
I think androids come a long way as far
as web rise and they really have a very
nice experience multi-touch as I mention
is implemented really well here let me
give an example of what the web browser
looks like I will jump on over a
TechnoBuffalo I could try to show before
and it just looks smooth scrolling is
very fast the physics engine seems to
keep up with the pages you don't get
sort of that checkered pattern that you
get when you scroll through web pages
very quickly it just works really well
it's smooth multi-touch implementation
it's certainly work
not present here though is flash no
flash content is going to be available
at launch on the Droid X alone motorola
and Verizon has said that Flash 10.1
will be coming sometime in 2010 in
addition to Android 2.2 Froyo so this is
running 2.1 in case you're wondering and
so you can go of running 2.1 it is not a
stock 2.1 it's actually running a
brand-new updated version of motoblur
now don't cringe if you've seen other
motoblur phones you're probably going to
know that motoblur is look cartoony it's
been sort of a clumsy implementation and
i should specify that motoblur is
actually a skin that sits on top of
android well the new mode of blur is
fantastic its unobtrusive and it adds to
where it needs to be added for instance
to get these new icons across the bottom
to jump to your phone your contacts or
your programs really works quite well to
go through your home screens you get a
new server right at the bottom you can
jump to each you can see those sort of
dots help you pick where you want to go
they've added a ton of really helpful
widgets here as well now you can see
that I've got sort of some indications
here on or off
whether I've got mail and calendar and
search and the new such a ton of new
icons which make it a very easy program
and easy
skin to navigate through now motoblur as
you see here it comes with a lot of
widgets but there are it's hot anymore
let me to show you very quickly what
some of those widgets are Bluetooth
toggle calendar GPS you can sort of see
that there are quite a few here to
choose from so let's talk about design
you're looking at a screen this big you
know that you're gonna be dealing with a
large phone now it's the closest
competitor the only phone we've even
compared this sort of similar screen is
going to be the HTC EVO 4G which is by
no means a small phone however when you
pull in the Evo next to the Droid X the
Evo looks downright small the Droid X is
a large phone you can see if I put them
right next to each other to remind up at
the bottom there is definitely a
difference in
and you stack on top of each other you
can see that there's a bit of a
difference there as well it's got that
bit of a hump for the camera now that's
not to say this is going to be a giant
phone I won't be able to fit in your
pocket
certainly it is pocketable but for all
of you skinny jean emo kids out there
you're definitely going to be able to
notice a very very square or rectangle
looking package in your pocket something
to keep in mind now that being said I
don't mind the design the hump on the
back actually makes it nice to hold when
you're making a phone call it's a spot
to rest your finger the camera quality
works fantastic got a eight megapixel
sensor with dual LED flash video shoots
720p and it really is 720p the
microphones that are in there do a very
nice job of sort of limiting background
noise and the audio fidelity seems to be
very good especially for a camera phone
so if you're out recording some video
you can leave your flip at home and you
can just rely on your Droid X because it
really just does a overall very
fantastic job in conclusion I've been
really impressed with the Droid X I
haven't been the biggest fan of
capacitive buttons on phone that like
that these are actually physical buttons
that you can touch the built quality
feels really good really good and I'm
shocked to say that I like moto board I
was never a big fan of in the past that
new implementation is really solid and
well done so if you're looking for a
super phone on horizons network look no
farther than the Droid X it really is a
great option during the reigns as the
king of the hill and the carrier's
lineup but if you don't want a 4.3 and
you don't you want a more traditional
screen size the Droid Incredible is
similarly specs built by HTC running HTC
Sense UI which is another breaks get a
pop up Android so there are two really
good options for Android and Verizon
slide up not to mention the original
Droid so if you're looking for Android
and your carriers Verizon you have a ton
of fantastic choices if you don't mind
the size you're not going to go wrong
with the Droid X on a one to five scale
I give it a very very very solid 4.75
when it finally gets Android 2.2 and
flash content that may actually bump it
up to a five this is close to a perfect
phone as
is anyway guys I'm John Rhett enger'
