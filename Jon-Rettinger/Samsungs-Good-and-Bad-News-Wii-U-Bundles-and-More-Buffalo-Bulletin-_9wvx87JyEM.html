bad news and ex EA CEO has some choice
words for game prices Nintendo's got a
new Wii U bundle and we contemplate John
Legere work so far as t-mobile CEO it's
Buffalo bulletin time hello internet and
welcome to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recap five major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i mentioned on the
show please check the description for
links or click on the graphics for each
story if you have annotations available
and toggled on I'm Ashley sceva here
your top stories jo sung had some ups
and downs this week so we'll start with
the good news CEO JK Shin announced
Samsung has shipped more than 40 million
a galaxy s4 unit since the phone's
initial launch six months ago that puts
them on track to unload more than 50
million s4s by the end of this year
though we aren't 100% sure if those
figures include variants of the s4 like
the s4 mini s4 active and s4 zoom either
way pretty good numbers that easily
justify Samsung's massive marketing
campaigns unfortunately samsung also had
some bad news according to a report from
Taiwan's fair trade commission Samsung
paid students to write and post negative
reviews about HTC products while
praising Sam someone's ex the Commission
could have dinged samsung up to eight
hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars
but chose to find them approximately at
three hundred and forty thousand dollars
well some argue though that the damage
has already been done which is a real
shame for HTC as HTC one is a beautiful
device in gaming former EA CEO john
riccitiello sounded off on the price of
video games in fact he put it pretty
frankly when he said quote sixty dollars
is a giant fu to a very large number of
people and quote Wow very strong words
he talked a lot about free-to-play
models and variable pricing plans
instead of a one price fits all
mentality I will see if anything
actually comes from his opinion but I
find it a little bit funny how he didn't
seem to have a problem with exorbitant
game prices when he was EA CEO just
saying nintendo announced this week it
would be dumping the nintendo land
deluxe wii u bundle but
are replacing it with something a little
more appealing on November first you'll
be able to pick up the Mario and Luigi
deluxe set for the Wii U which includes
a 32 gig console in black and both new
super mario brothers you and new super
Luigi u that's a pretty decent bundle
for just 2 99 and just in time of course
to compete with the xbox one and
playstation 4 when they launch next
month lastly our wildcard piece this
week is an editorial from our very own
Todd Hazleton who wrote about t-mobile
CEO John Legere impact on a cellular
industry thus far into his tenure he
says llegara is the CEO t-mobile needed
and that it was refreshing to see
somebody intent on shaking up the way
all of the big four carriers do business
here in the US if you're a fan of old
legs it's a great read and yes my
nickname for John Legere his legs deal
with it that's the buffalo bulletin for
today if you enjoyed the show a thumbs
up would be so awesome of you and if you
want more a great TechnoBuffalo video
