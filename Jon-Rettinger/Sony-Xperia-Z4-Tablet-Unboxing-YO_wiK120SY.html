TechnoBuffalo here I'm taking a look at
the latest from Sony this is the Xperia
z4 but maybe it's not the z4 you thought
or hoped it is the z4 tablet I've been
really excited to see this guy ever
since it was unveiled at Mobile World
Congress earlier in the year in fact I
was so excited I just went and bought
this one myself I've been an Android
tablet user for almost a year now and
I've really enjoyed Android s all for
the tablet front and I think that this
one might be the best version of what
Android can do so let's take a look at
it I bought it from eBay so I can't
guarantee it's even going to turn on
it's not available yet in the u.s.
available in select markets pricing
items can be all over the board paying
on where you go trying to import it but
between seven eight hundred dollars go
ahead and pull off the top there was no
plastic here which makes me a little on
the nervous side this is the black
version there's a white version as well
so Lisa came with the tablet that was
nice actually in the box go ahead and
pull this out the big selling factor
here is first it is incredibly thin and
I'll talk about how thin but spoiler
alert 6.1 millimeters it's also
waterproof or will be close to
waterproof we'll talk about that more
later push it off to the side real
quickly inside upset box
we've got booklets I believe that is in
Japanese I cannot read that beautiful
language but unfortunately I have not
endowed with the ability to speak it
we've got it will charge from a hard
time trying to plug this into
fortunately it's just a USB charger I
have a lot of those and this does not
look like a new cable to me so see if
this tablet actually is indeed new but
it's just micro USB cable so so let's
get to the fun part if the tablet
actually turns on I will take out of the
plastic which looks like it's been open
looks clean on the back and there's a
plastic on the front so that's good do a
quick tour around it then I'll turn it
on on the left-hand side you've got your
power and the lock button you've got
your volume control up and down as well
on the left side sort of weird to see in
this orientation usually you see a
tablet in landscape not in portrait you
put a five millimeter headset jack i've
got this handy little reference guide so
I've got a sim slot keys this is a
cellular model LTE and
a microsd card slot up 228 gigs and
you've got a charging port its micro USB
and cameras on the back we'll talk about
all that kind of stuff as we get along
good and pull-offs plastic power it on
I'll run through all the specs I promise
you guys that was like a mildly
satisfying whooshing noise let's see
this thing turns on which I probably
good at 50/50 this is actually going to
turn on or is actually a real Sony
Tablet its made by sony
alright so it turns on that's a good
sign you're looking at a 10.1 inch
display it is qhg so if you can give
yourself your geek cred check you know
the resolution is due to 2560 by 1600
you sir or madam are correct the screen
here is really bright four percent
brighter than they already pretty nice
Xperia z2 tablet it's an IPS screen with
Sony's triluminos tech baked right in
scratch this in glass and they
fingerprint coating we'll see I'm going
to I'll leave like some french fries
I think powered by the Snapdragon 810 so
that's 64-bit and octo cores big thing
here though despite having open ports
I had his waterproofing dust tight so
that's IP 65 and 68 so they took out of
the beach watch a video in the bathtub
taken in the shower if you're so
inclined
keeping this thin tablet powered up is
six thousand milliamp hours so hopefully
that'll last while somebody says it'll
get you about 17 hours of playback
I feel like tablets and phones out were
just showing off but this thing has
three gigs of RAM which I imagine is
unnecessary but it's got it built in
there anyway it has cameras on the back
although really don't don't take
pictures with your tablet but if you
decide to it's 8.1 megapixel sensor on
the back and it also has a tenth digital
zoom it's got a 5.1 megapixel sensor on
the front I mention incredibly thin 6.1
millimeters which is the same as the
iPad air 2 it weighs in feels like
they've gotta put the batter in here it
wastes your hundred eighty nine grams
and then for reference the iPad air 2 is
437 grams so less than that and if
you're wondering what grams means this
thing weighs less than a pound so it is
really really light so he's done a
decent job of
d skinning what used to be a really
heavy skin their old Timescape and
Mediascape interface so now that really
looked like they've let Android the
Android with a few additions here so you
can see you don't have the white
background that says running a lollipop
he got some custom menus that pop up and
go to the side you can run apps on top
of each other like little little sort of
mini apps we've seen before but other
than that you're looking at Android a
bleep 5.0 point one but I wish there was
a way you could just check that oh we
can let's go to about tablet we are
running Android 5.0 point two so it's
0.01 better than I thought
and I'll go through and use this and see
what other additions we've got here
seeing a phone icon a tablets a little
bit weird maybe this is like gonna be
like the Galaxy Note like eight would be
like hello
I can't hear me I like to talk to you or
maybe not I don't know cancer just can
get really big to fit this in it but I'm
excited to use it excited to try it and
to see what Sony has to offer and if you
guys want to see about the z4 tab but
let me know I like to answer your
questions we could talk about our
discussion and see if I wasted my money
or if it was a good purchase
you guys been following my tablets the
stories I was using a nexus 9 and loved
it got a little buggy after five point
one we had one on the Dell Venue tablets
the Android version in the office I use
that but enjoying it but I just really
wanted to try this guy out so I'm going
to and the guys want to see be sure let
me know leave in the comments down below
of course subscribed we love to have you
until next time I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll talk to you dear
friends in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
