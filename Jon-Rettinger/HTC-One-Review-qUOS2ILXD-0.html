TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of the HTC One this is the latest
flagship from HTC they've put a lot of
hopes and R&amp;amp;D dollars into making this
phone a reality let's go ahead and put
it through its paces and see if deserves
a spot in your pocket for the next two
years alright so let's go ahead and get
started we've got a lot to talk about
here with the HTC One we're going to
talk about specs call quality build
quality screen a lot about Sense 5 the
camera boom sound performance battery
what I don't like about the phone and
give it a full conclusion so let me give
a disclaimer I'm gonna start doing this
on all my phone reviews this device was
used for nine days as my daily driver
the first five were tested using a
pre-production unit and the last four
were tested using a full production
model this is not support LTE in the US
but it was tested on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ network
aspects let's go and run through what
this guy's packing its got a lot what
you're looking at here is a gorgeous 4.7
inch full HD screen so it's 1920 by 1080
giving it a crazy 469 pixels per inch
which I believe is the highest of any
phone currently on the market it's
running Android 4.1.2 at launch
powering it is a pretty beastly 1.7
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core
chip it's a Snapdragon 600 it's got two
gigs of RAM be available in two
different storage sizes either 32 or 64
no room for external storage card so
leave those microSD cards at home a lot
of talk has been about the camera the
back has a four ultrapixel camera we'll
talk plenty about that the front is a
two megapixel affair it's got Wi-Fi all
the ones you'd expect 802 11 ABG nn but
also something new here 802 11 AC on up
anything even test AC with but this does
make it a little more future-proof over
the next 12 or 24 months bluetooth 400
all the rest of stuff you'd expect
giving this guide to juice is a 2300
million power battery which we will talk
plenty about and it weighs 143 grams or
5.0 4 ounces all right so call quality
works pretty well I didn't have any drop
calls on it during my usual round of
tests I did have several drop calls
though
my nine days with it but nothing more or
less than the other phone any other
network it worked very well call quality
was pretty solid alright so let's go
ahead and jump right into build quality
that's a big part of the story with the
HTC One this phone feels absolutely
incredible in the hand this is one of
the best if not the best feeling phone I
have ever used every inch every nook
every line of this phone you can tell
was given a crazy attention to detail
HTC absolutely hit this one out of the
park the phone feels incredible we pick
it up in the morning it's got that cold
feel through the full aluminum body
HTC clearly learned phone by phone by
phone you can see the evolution look at
their previous Evo models all the way
back to the first Nexus they got better
and better in each phone this is a
culmination of years of knowledge and
they nailed this one
absolutely this is one of the best built
devices I've ever tested this is one of
those phones actually enjoyed picking up
that's such a weird thing to say but the
way it feels in the hand and the cold
feeling on it just absolutely
outstanding I can't say enough about how
well this phone is built everything
about it just screams quality next let's
jump to the screen this thing is an
absolute beauty
I thought the screen on the DNA looks
good but Wow
469 PPI is absolutely incredible and
it's a little bit higher than the DNA
code it's only a 4.7 inch screen and not
a 5 inch screen this is the best screen
I've ever seen on a phone including my
limited testing with the galaxy s4 and a
full battery of tests the Xperia Z
iPhone 5 and including the Droid DNA so
screens are important to you if you want
beautiful pictures you want beautiful
video this is really the phone to look
at and saying it's incredible doesn't
really do it justice pictures and text
all just pop out of the screen now
looking forward to comparing this to of
course the galaxy s4 more detail when we
get it but if screen is important to you
you're gonna have a very hard time
finding anything that's better than this
alright so next let's talk about Sense 5
HTC Sense 5 really gets out of its own
way of just recruitment really nice I
liked a new lock screen you can
personalize a little bit and they have
different themes you could pick from to
find the best one for you
they really did a nice job with it it's
not as heavy as Sense foreign previous
versions used to be some few nice things
do we organize apps is kind of nice you
can see the weather widget right on top
you pull down a little bit you can pick
either alphabetical custom or most
recent you control the grid size here if
you want to however you want to have it
shown if you want 3 by 4 or 4 by 5 I
like showing more per screen so I've
selected 4 by 5 but you can customize
that very easily a blinkfeed is also a
nice addition I've got mine set to tech
but you can show it to pull in all kinds
of other information you want I think of
it as like Flipboard for your homescreen
I did not choose to set it as my default
home screen my main when I moved it two
screens off to the side you cannot turn
blinkfeed off HTC said it's essential to
Sense 5 but if you choose not to use it
you can move it off to one screen and
deactivate all the feet so you can see
what it looks like right here I'm you
click an article that you want to read
doesn't launch a web browser per se it
launches a sort of a mini browser where
you can see the content right there so
it's nice you have to wait for it to
really queue up ITC did a very nice job
with that
so since five doesn't really add
anything you couldn't get from
third-party apps or launchers but for
the first time really doesn't detract
from the overall Android experience it's
really the biggest compliment I can give
to an Android skinned HTC also nails
their email client here I love the way
it looks the way it performs performance
right similar it's the native Gmail app
but with a unified inbox which for me is
really huge they also have a new backup
system which is pretty cool actually
will do full backups of your phone which
you can download from another HTC device
you can log in either via HTC zone
portal or via your Facebook Ranchos and
I got a test this when I switch from my
pre-production unit over the production
model and it worked very very well you
can also move from other phones and made
it very easy from an iPhone or a Samsung
device or any other manufacturer they
made it really simple to transfer
everything over so if you've been
worried about how to kill your contacts
don't want have to deal with Google
syncing HTC has you covered here another
thing that I really liked was since five
is multitasking if you double tap the
home button here we'll talk about that a
little in a little bit I love the way
the multitasking window looks you can
see nine icons here and you can pick
which one you want to use previously and
sense for you can only see one maybe two
off on the side you can close things
here if you want by just swiping it
right off the screen and it works pretty
well
swipe off and you are good in close
applications that way as well so a
really nice addition here to sense five
right so let's next talk about the
camera there's been a lot of talk about
ultrapixels whether that's a marketing
term or what it means the HEC really
proved at least for me that it's not
about the megapixels we did a huge
camera comparison post we compare this
to really pretty much every other major
carrier release smartphone so the major
phones that are out on the carriers in
the US
we compared the cameras the agency once
camera really did a nice job even so far
as to say it's amongst the best cameras
on a carrier phone now really on par
with the Lumia 920 it did an incredible
job in low-light the ultra pixels means
it's got a bigger sensor it's able to
pull in much more light those images
looked great in places where other
phones sort of showed pixelation or
darker this camera really did a
wonderful job HD video also looked great
we did a few video comparisons I will
say though on the video comparison we
did there was a bit of popping noise in
the audio and that was done using the
pre-production model when we switched to
the production version that popping
noise was gone but it looked great that
we would expect with a 1080p camera one
of the downsides though digitally zoomed
image and start to show the lack of
megapixels oh so you plan on doing a lot
of digital zooming or if you want to
blow this up to giant sizes you may want
to test it before you that but if you
just want to print out normal size
images you want upload to Facebook or
Instagram this is going to be a great
camera for you one of the other really
cool features on the HTC One is right
down here
it's called boom sound is incredible
speaker and when compared to other
phones it's not just front-facing
speakers and make it sound so good
HTC said there's a lot of proprietary
technology that went into there
including of course Beats Audio but
algorithms and how it interprets sounds
but if you compare it to another phone
you can really hear a difference we
compare it to the iPhone 5 for example
you can definitely hear how well the
sounds
you're a big speakerphone user as well I
really gonna appreciate having that
speaker built-in oftentimes I heard some
jokes on Twitter for other reviewers
that were saying neighbors call to
complain the music was too loud and they
were playing music three years and its
really does incredible job obviously
that's an exaggeration but these are the
best speakers I've ever heard on a phone
alright so next let's talk about
performance it's pretty much what you'd
expect without any lag repeats you see
sense just quite nice
this guy's got a beastly quad-core
Snapdragon processor most applications
don't even take advantage of quad-core
yet at all but this thing is an absolute
beast and it screams everything moves
quickly there's no scroll lag when
you're using a browser whether using
Chrome or the built-in browser that
comes with it everything about this
phone is fast from games floating
applications to scrolling things just
come along very quickly did get a
quadrant score of 11850 it's not the
most scientific test but I do use that
as a benchmark for other phones so
certainly scored very high there as well
so do not worry about performance we're
getting incredible performance out of
this phone all right so let's talk about
battery life using this phone for nine
days I feel I'm very well educated on
battery performance and how well it
works so again it's got a 2300 million
power battery let me run you through my
daily usage so you at least get some
appreciation for what my numbers mean
usually comes off the charger around
7:00 a.m. usually about two to three
hours of talktime I have two emails
being pulled down checking every five
minutes brightness I don't have auto
brightness set I like a bright screen so
I've got it sent to generally around 80%
the amount of internet I do varies on
the day but there's internet Twitter
Facebook text and Instagram all kinds of
other stuff going on
blink feed is running the background and
usually I'll put it on the charger
around midnight ish and usually I've got
right around 35% of battery life left
when I put on the charger and for me if
I can get through a full day with 20%
plus I consider the dialog to be pretty
decent the moral is it's on par with
really anything else out there if you
were worried about battery life from
nature
you see one don't really worry you can
get through a full day I use my phone
pretty heavily and those include some
gaming time in there as well if you want
to play games for three or four hours
you're not gonna be able to get through
a full day I did watch youtube videos on
here and really had no issue at all
getting through a full day but
definitely note this does not have a
replaceable battery on at least one
that's easily user replaceable so your
Argan app - either carry an extra charge
around or monitor your battery use
alright so I've been very positive with
HTC One I really like most things about
the phone but it's far from perfect
there are some things that I don't like
about it first I really don't like the
button layout here I had to keep
reminding myself about the first days
that HTC logo is not a button that is
just a logo having only a back and a
home button the home button scoot off to
the right
took a while to get used to I really
would have liked a dedicated multitask
button I found having to double tap to
get to the home button get the
multitasking a little bit on the
annoying side to go ahead and access it
by doing that um another negative GPS
had a hard time locating me when I went
to New York back home I definitely took
much longer than expected for to realize
I was in another state almost a full 12
hours I could do it manually and I could
let it know but doing Auto updates it
should have picked my location out a
little bit quicker than that
also another negative here it doesn't
have room for expandable storage so if
you want more than the 32 or 64 gigabyte
size you're going to get you're going to
be out of luck I can forgive though not
removable battery for design but for
some that could definitely be a negative
so keep that in mind depending on your
usage you figure out which phone is
right for you so what's the conclusion
on the HTC One if you couldn't guess
already I really like this phone and is
getting one of the highest reviews and
highest compliments I've ever given a
phone it gets a really solid nine point
five on the TechnoBuffalo reviewing
scale this is one of the few phones I've
really been excited to use every day and
that says a lot we test a ton of phones
here it could be a bit of phone fatigue
this one really got me excited about the
future of the mobile industry again
after saying phones released to the past
few years it weren't anything flack
tricked to get excited about it's really
refreshing to see the HTC One here the
best compliment I can give it is it's
the first phone that I would be willing
to sign a two-year deal on my own with
since the iPhone 4 so if you're worried
about getting a phone or you want one
that's really going to be an outstanding
to use
this is the one to get HTC slogan is
quietly brilliant and with this phone
they should be a little louder about it
everything about this phone is
incredible
HTC hit this one out of the park I can
say unequivocally the HTC one is the
best Android phone I have ever tested
and it may be the best phone I have ever
tested period if you want to get
something that's going to work for you
for the next two years you want build
quality you want a gorgeous screen and
you want cutting-edge specs the HTC One
is an incredible choice
