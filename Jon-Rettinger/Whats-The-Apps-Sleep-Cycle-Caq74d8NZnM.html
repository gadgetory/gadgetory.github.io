to you by Hostgator hello there
everybody's John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps for this episode I'm going to be
taking a look at something called sleep
cycle and it's an application that'll
help you sleep which is why I'm in my
bedroom and I'm wearing my jammie-jams
cuz I thought it would be clever and
cute yes sleep cycles a pretty
interesting application my friend
actually told me about it about 1 or 2
years ago so I thought I'd share my
thoughts and my experiences with you
guys sleep cycle is basically a highly
sophisticated and scarily smart alarm
clock after you've set a time just like
you would any alarm clock the app that
measures your movement activity whilst
you sleep it uses that information to
calculate your various stages of sleep
you know light sleep deep sleep and so
on to figure out when would be the ideal
time to wake you up allowing you to have
that happy-go-lucky feeling of well
rested miss oh my god that sleep of
amazing just to give you an idea of how
sensitive it is there's a placement test
which makes noise every time there's
movement on your bed it even works on
the floor which is pretty ballin they
have quite a few stock alarm tones and
they're much more pleasant than those
that come with your advice you can also
pick a song from your music library if
you want to wake up to some Metallica or
whatever works for you but I personally
prefer the sweet sounds of warm breeze
or to wake up embracing the abstract and
subtle sounds of morning mist or sunrise
you can also play around with the snooze
option wake up phase vibration and
various other things there's a stats
section where you can check out your
calculated sleep cycles a bunch of mine
were deleted want to update it to iOS 5
but you know you get the idea you can
also share your charts with your friends
if you want to you know if you want to
show off how much deep sleep you get
every night speaking of charts there are
a few downsides though this app can't
really calculate the ideal time when
you're nap as seen here but I can still
function as a regular alarm clock you
also have to keep the app running all
night because quote due to iOS limit
Asians sleep psycho cannot be run in the
background not a big deal though
considering you're asleep it's also
recommended that you keep your device
plugged in all night personally I don't
think this is necessary I had some
nights where I didn't plug in my phone
and you know the battery didn't go to
zero or anything so yeah
you'll be fine and speaking of whatever
I was just rambling about imma take some
time to thank our friends at Hostgator

cycle time for the big question okay
does this work honestly I don't know I
mean when I use it I feel well rested in
everything and when I don't use it I
don't but then I don't know if that's
because you know I think that it's
working therefore it's working so it's
kind of like when I use the app I'm like
oh yes I'm gonna have a good day today
with you know the hand gesture voice and
the complete package and everything plus
personally I'm pretty good at waking up
when it comes time to waking up I don't
you know I don't complain I don't moan I
don't kick things I don't yell hateful
things into a bar of soap I just wake up
oh my god that's loop of amazing but I
suppose if you think about it if I feel
better when I use it therefore it's
working so with that I'm gonna give this
app a 5 out of 5 $0.99 is a really small
investment for a good night's rest
especially if it comes with wickedly
awesome super soothing alarm tones that
for a brief moment make you feel like
you're in a magical jungle or something
tried for yourself there's actually
another app called smart alarm clock
that says I can do the basically the
same thing but it's free and again if
there are any applications that you'll
like me to check out let me know my
commenting this was
John Q from TechnoBuffalo thank you very
much for tuning in and I wish you all a
very good night ladies
morning mist or sunrise sunrise why what
I say like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
