Monday June first and it is also day one
of III the electronics entertainment
expo which is really one of the big
conventions for video games and video
game entertainment really in the world
so today was highlighted by a Microsoft
keynote and they gave a ton of info on
updates to the xbox 360 so keep thinking
tune with my recent videos of whatever
reason Microsoft related then give me
some updates on the xbox 360 before I go
into this and say what they updated and
give my impressions keep in mind that I
own a 360 by no means an Xbox fanboy if
you want to call it i also own a ps3
which i'm very happy to have and really
enjoy using so with that little caveat
disclaimer let's go ahead and get
started the first thing xbox announced
in microsoft in particular is now they
can have full retail game delivery on
demand checks your really exciting
meeting you can sign into your xbox live
download a full game not just demos
which is actually really cool it's going
to launch august 30th with 30 titles and
fills you that don't like to microsoft
points idea you'll be able to buy these
games with a credit card is quite nice
and the price will be the same retail
price it's going to go to market like I
said on August 30th with 30 titles and
more to follow they didn't announce if
it's going to be for new releases or how
many more games you're going to add on a
regular basis but just know soon you
will be able to download games right on
demand which is very nice a question was
asked to Microsoft whether or not this
was going to open the door to video game
rentals on the console and Microsoft's
have really applied that that was an
interesting idea so it don't hold your
breath for video game rentals anytime
soon although how awesome that may be
able to rent a game right out here comes
we'll play it for a week two weeks beat
it and just delete it so the next thing
the answer they announced it really the
big announcement is what they're calling
project natal like neonatal like a baby
and it is a peripheral that plugged
directly into your TV and xbox and it
can sense a full range of mode
for you and people you're playing with
without views of a controller so think
we remote without the remotes if you're
playing a boxing game you just make a
fist and punch and it'll sense that and
punch for you or if you're riding a
skateboard game or snowboarding game you
can lean back and forth and it'll set
your movement move your character
accordingly if you're playing a racing
game hold your hands like this like
you're holding a wheel and turn it'll
recognize that for you it actually is
very cool and it's really doing away
with the controller for some of the
motions certainly I think you're always
going to need something physical in your
hands for more accurate movement on the
screen but this is a really cool
advancement using gyroscopic technology
and accelerometers to really sense
motion so I'm very excited about this
the downside however is that this is not
coming any time in 2009 this is a 2010
technology she's also interesting to
show that Microsoft is really trying to
prolong the lifespan of the xbox 360
launched I believe in 2005 it's already
had a four year lifespan really that's
like to trying to extend that quite a
bit further are indeed two new consoles
very expensive I'm not so sure that the
next generation is even ready to be
developed right now you know what xbox
use blu-ray would they use digital
downloads you know the Xbox does a lot
of potential up to tap as does it ps3 so
I'd expect this generation of consoles
to have another few years worth of legs
and the next thing they announced as if
that wasn't enough was full 1080p video
streaming and download via the new zune
branded marketplace which is actually
really cool to be delivered they claim
almost instantaneously if you have a
quick enough internet tension via some
proprietary technology the microsoft
owns which is actually really cool i
mean 1080p right on your TV that you're
downloading you can it'll be available
for movies and TV shows if you're using
a player like the voodoo box for dick
when you want to download 1080p movies
it got essentially leave it for almost
overnight to downloaded videos so this
is really impressive that Microsoft is
doing this we've got some bit rates and
some fancy things going on knocking
getting tea but just know that it will
be very quick so the next thing speaking
of xbox live is I'm going to be
integrated with facebook I got some new
your Facebook Twitter and last FM are
going to be included so be able to check
your facebook status post tweet listen
to some music on last FM which is really
cool this is sort of furthering the
evolution of making the Xbox more than
just a game console but also making it
more of a media hub where you can really
do almost everything that you would want
to do although still missing from this
announcement was a browser which the ps3
has I think the Microsoft definitely
benefit from including a browser the
next thing they announced was full
netflix queue management and felicity
that use netflix on the xbox don't know
that all you had the ability to do was
just watch what was already in a queue
now you can actually browse and select
move put in your queue right from your
ex book which is really nice so to get
the same neck netflix on demand sort of
service eight would get on your desktop
you'll now get it on your xbox so I
really it were a lot of announcement
that Microsoft put out today really
highlighted by that project natal the
full motion sensing technology I'm
really excited to get a chance to see
that although unfortunately we're all
gonna have to wait for quite a while so
what do you guys think about these
announcements for the Xbox this project
natal make you want to get next box this
is make you happy you have one make you
wish you didn't get a ps3 or you want to
wait to see what Sony's gonna announce
at their event which I assume will
probably be the PSP go mostly so what do
you guys think leave your comments down
below and very excited to hear what you
say I know these video game videos get a
lot of bickering back and forth so try
and keep it civil anyway guys I will see
with the next one for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter.com / John for lakers see you
guys in the next video bye bye hey guys
