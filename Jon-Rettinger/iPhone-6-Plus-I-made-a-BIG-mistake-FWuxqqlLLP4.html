from TechnoBuffalo and in today's video
I wanted to talk to you guys about why I
switch from an iPhone six-plus to the
smaller iPhone 6 now if you were in the
same scenario as I was and we're tired
of holding a huge phone maybe this video
will help you make a decision about
whether switching to the smaller iPhone
6 will suit you better or not first
we're going to talk about what made me
think about switching now I bought the
iPhone 6 plus on launch day because of
its battery life screen size and camera
coming from an iPhone 5s I wanted
something I could use in a place of a
tablet or laptop if I ever need to
quickly catch up on videos or reply to
emails I wanted to use one device
instead of relying on multiple
personally the screen size and form
factor is what did it for me I thought
the iPhone 6 plus was great in the
beginning but my hands aren't that big
so when these got a hold of the iPhone 6
it just felt easier to hold I've use
plenty of large Android phones including
the note 4 but iPhone 6 plus always just
felt unmanageable to me like it was
going to fall out of my hands and it
just look obnoxious in my pocket which
made carrying it around a hassle more
than anything but of course there are
some big trade-offs when making the
switch the big ones are battery life
screen resolution and camera quality one
of the iPhone 6 plus is biggest selling
points is its camera has optical image
stabilization which helps a ton during
low-light conditions and when filming
videos oh is on the phone is great and I
think every phone should have it but is
that really enough reason for me to not
switch to an iPhone 6 no iPhone 6
doesn't offer oh is but after switching
I didn't really notice much of a
difference in terms of photo quality
moving on to screen and form factor sure
the iPhone 6s display isn't qHD nor
1080p for that matter but it's good
enough for everyday use it's only 4.7
inches but I think it's the perfect size
for me I've been using Nexus 5 and
iPhone 6 as my two daily drivers for the
past month and to be quite honest I
don't see much of a difference in
regards to screen quality the Nexus 5
has a 5-inch 1080p display while the
iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750
screen it's slightly higher than 720p
moving on a battery life one of the
reasons why I went with a 6 plus in the
first place was the huge battery it's
not joyed turbo-huge but it was the
biggest it was available on an iPhone at
the time battery life was all I was
looking for since my 5s wasn't cutting
it for me but a few days after I
switched to an iPhone 6 I noticed that
real life was bad it's not horrible but
it wasn't six-plus good if that makes
any sense when I was using the six plus
and we get to work with a hundred
percent battery life and the end of a
work day around 5:30 p.m. to you 6 p.m.
I would have about 75 to 80% battery
life which is amazing not once if I
charge my 6 plus at work or in my car I
just didn't need to
so after switching to the iPhone 6 I
definitely saw a difference in battery
life after a busy day of email texting
social media taking photos I have about
forty to fifty percent battery life
around 6:00 p.m. which isn't horrible
but it just wasn't as good as the six
plus just be aware that there's
definitely that change if you're
thinking of switching from the six plus
to an iPhone 6
does it bother me that the battery life
doesn't last as long as the six plus for
me not really I have a charger in my car
at work at home and I even have a
battery pack for my six so it doesn't
really affect me as much but your answer
might be different depending on how
often you use your phone of course after
switching to the iPhone 6 after months
of using 6 plus it felt weird that I
wasn't holding a ridiculously big phone
I'd be lying if I said I don't miss a
screen size at times it was awesome for
watching movies playing games and
browsing the web it's really great for
media consumption and I do miss a larger
display every now and then so at the end
of the day I don't regret switching to
the smaller iPhone 6 it feels
comfortable to hold the form factor and
screen size is just right the camera
without OIS isn't a big deal for me I
know my limits when taking photos with
an iPhone battery life isn't the best
but it does get the job done if I ever
run low I can grab my battery pack or
charge my phone and let it be so what

switching from an iPhone 6 plus to the
iPhone 6 or maybe you're the other way
