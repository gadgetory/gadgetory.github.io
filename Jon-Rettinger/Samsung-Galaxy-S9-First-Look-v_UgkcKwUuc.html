this one's been linked for a while so
this shouldn't be a giant surprise if
you follow the tech or rumors but let me
tell you everything there is to know
about these phones let's start with some
of the differences the s 9 is now not
just a smaller version of the S 9 plus
the Plus version is going to get two
extra gigs of rams it's going to have
six that's going to have double the
cameras so that's gonna bring it up to
two the main sensors are the same 12
megapixels they now have dual apertures
so it's mechanical you can actually see
it open and closed they showed us some
example of how that's going to reduce
noise tested it did seem to do that
although real-world usage will determine
it we get this in their offices will of
course test it they're also capable of
taking an insane 960 frames per second
slow-mo video at a pretty awesome 720p
we tested it and they look absolutely
incredible and at fun fact about these
phones they actually now have RAM built
into the camera system so it could
handle all those crazy frames that are
coming in the Plus version though gets a
second camera of course for the zoom
stuff that you'd like other than that
things are pretty similar from lash in
the screen size they're still a five
point six point two the bezels have been
slimmed down just a little bit the
screens were already really good with
the s8 but now they're better this time
around
they are 15% brighter and we tested this
the screens did look really bright that
should be nice and bright sunlight when
you're outdoors it's going to gonna be
able to see the screen if there could be
two knocks on the galaxy s 8 that I was
pretty vocal about it was the silly
finger print reader location that's now
been fixed and no dual speakers that has
also now been fixed the earpiece is a
speaker it gets pretty loud in fact it's
about 1.4 to 1.5 times louder than the
s8 so they're really proud of it for
music and if I use it for speakerphone
it's just louder now one of the things
that I liked about the node 8 was it
kind of flattened out the edges so the
phone felt more substantial in her hand
didn't feel kind of as thin as the s8
was and it that same thing here at the
galaxy s 9 did it the note it's got kind
of a flatter side to it so it does feel
better in the hand if you like the way
the note felt you're gonna love the way
the Galaxy S 9 is gonna feel
Samsung loves to be first with stuff
this is the first phone out of the gate
shipping with a Snapdragon 805 so it's
gonna be incredibly fast for processing
for gaming for a lot of VR and AR and
you're better on the battery as well on
those sizes are the same as last gen at
3,000 and 3,500 but again the plus has
the 60 gram versus the regular that has
a 4 so so bear that in mind I know
you're gonna ask
i I asked Samsung bixby button is still
there
it still does bixby things but it's a
little bit better now you get some sort
of like a our makeup see what looks like
a different makeup on now we're gonna do
real-time translation if you hold it up
to words that are in different language
and also if you hold it up to food
they'll tell you what an estimated
calorie counts one thing that is
definitely new here with the SI and the
s9 plus all right animated emojis if you
ever made it like a Nintendo me but you
wish it was more high def and could map
your face that's what we've got right
here is kind of cool it's actually gonna
take a picture of your face and it's
going to make it you can customize some
stuff your skin tone hair and clothes
but it does work actually really well I
did a test with each eyebrow going up
and down is able to see those things
smiling is able to see those things turn
your head see those things it's able to
map your face really well of course if
you want to just put yourself into other
sort of emojis like like bunny rabbits
and other things we might be used to
those are here as well and they'll work
on third-party apps it actually will
just save it as a picture if you want on
the software side the UI is going to
look similar to lashed and actually I
really like what Samsung has done on the
software side but it is Android Oreo
based in fact it's based off of 8.0 and
I think all the things that make Samsung
phones stand out are also here you can
run through the list of flagship specs
as check them off one by one
expandable storage is here quick
charging here wireless charging is here
samsung pay is here ip68 of course it's
here as well
all that stuff that makes you generally
Samsung phones awesome or of course
packed into the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus
the u.s. is getting some good launch
colors finally it's gonna be midnight
black coral blue lilac purple there's an
awesome looking gray one that's only
going international so that's it that's
the s9 in the s9 plus it doesn't at
least appear to be a giant upgrade when
I
think was already peak smartphone with
the s AP for coming from an s7 is a
giant step forward coming from a note
eight you might want to give it a second
thought before we decided whether or not
to upgrade but it looks awesome we're
gonna get one in the office of course
the test put it through its paces I'm
excited I like to last Jen's
this one looks like a really nice
improvement on that but we'll we'll be
the judge and you guys want us to see
particular about the s9 the s9 + even
the comments down below and let us know
because we do a thumbs up we appreciate
it of course it's a subscribe button so
you get notified when new videos are
coming we're have a lot of s9 coverage
coming your way until next time John
