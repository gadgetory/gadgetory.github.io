to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm your host John wrenchers the
show you could ask me any question
you've got from the wide world of
technology and sometimes even outside of
this week it's all about the K is for K
Thunderbolt Display is 2k phones when is
Android going 64-bit and what kind of
computers will use here in the offices
this is ask the Buffalo but let's start
asking the Buffalo first question comes
from Fiat Ruggiero asked John think
there'll be a new Thunderbolt Display
really soon with a 4k screen and
Thunderbolt to sing as OS 10.9 point 3s
coming out soon with more 4k support
it's a good question I've been saying
that should be any fun Thunderbolt
Display for a while now and certainly
would make sense to be a thinner design
at this point it's thicker than the iMac
which makes very little sense because
they're both the same resolution 27-inch
displays but I would say we are going to
see 4k very very very soon you know
currently the Mac Pro lineup supports 4k
stand becoming to other Mac's yes I
think it makes sense especially if
they're desktops are already supporting
it you know like the Mac Pro's
presumably it'll make its way down to
the iMac line as well yes I absolutely
think it's coming I think it's going to
be coming this year and probably have a
4k price tag to match that bork a
resolution is not going to be cheap at
all Apple puts a premium and all the
products right now about $1,000 or so
for current one I'd expect probably you
know maybe double so probably 2500 not
for tabs making a joke they're probably
2500 3000 will be the price that will
come in at I probably the same size 27
inches so yes I think it's coming
Thunderbolt 2 that one is really up in
there but that Apple wants to support
that or nada just continue to pushing
Thunderbolt they currently have I think
probably you'll see Thunderbolt 2 on
board there as well but you know that
one is really anyone's guess next
question comes from Bauer wants to talk
chipsets at John for Lakers since
Qualcomm just introduced a Snapdragon
810 808 chips that are 64-bit would you
recommend to an iOS users or cleansin
switch to Android to wait for 64-bit
chips
Google may make the Android OS 64-bit
this year but really
the m8 and the s5 so this is the big
question I say absolutely jump on board
use it for a year or two years and
presumably at that time you know Android
will be 64-bit apps are to be supporting
it'll be set but the waiting game is
going to kill you and I get these
questions all the time should I wait
should I not wait if you like what's
available right now I say jump on board
need to pick up the MA or the s5 let's
jump back to the case Lucas when Zell
asks hey John why don't we see a big
Android manufacturer jump on the 2k
display bandwagon so Artie sort of some
2k phones are coming to the market but
really the big question I think because
when is either LG Samsung HTC or Apple
going to do a qk phone that's probably
you mean by major manufacturers on I
think we're gonna see it this year
probably later into the year rumors of
sort of a premium version Galaxy s5 I
think that the Galaxy Note one's always
sort of been the generation ahead of
what we've seen with the Galaxy S line
so perhaps maybe the note 4 might go to
K we've heard rumors of ultra Retina
display on Apple devices maybe their 5.5
inch phone if ever comes to fruition
will have a 2k resolution the big
question is not what not that can do it
but not they can keep that display
powered while resolutions have gone
crazy high and processors have gotten
more cores battery technology hasn't
really changed that much so that's one
of those manufacturers can do something
crazy with battery you're gonna have
like a nine minute life on your device
so that's really been the big question
if you see battery life start to change
and technology start to change
I think the displays will come with it
but I will say we'll probably see it
sometime later on this year and how long
it's gonna last really anyone's guess me
exhale for a quick second take a break
and think our friends and overall good
people at lynda.com they offer thousands
of engaging easy to follow video

better yourself when the comm is a great

creative or business skills membership
starts in just 25 bucks a month and give
you unlimited any time of day even like

access
totally learn at your own pace from
either teeny tiny tutorials or sort of
giant comprehensive courses and things

programming photography business audio
and visual 3d animation you wonder how
to run your own business your own how to
start
the business this is really good
resource to try give lynda.com a free
trial for seven days by visiting
lynda.com/tekzilla Buffalo
that's ly NDA comm / check no Buffalo
and the last questions comes from
Twitter at Jian lock proc 22s at John
four Lakers well computer to use on a
daily basis is it Mac or Windows so back
when I used to do all the video editing
I did it all in Final Cut so I used an
iMac I still use that same iMac for
pretty much everything at I use my main
video editor now Ron uses a PC I use
Adobe Creative Cloud in the Adobe suite
to do all the videos so you can use that
on either Mac or PC if you can sort of
take your pick there but I use Mac's
primarily of God a MacBook Pro at home
and I traveled with same reason for
video editing but if you don't do video
editing you and I could very easily use
a Windows 8 device I use a surface pro
quite a bit when I'm at home sort of
fiddling around but if I had to pick one
computer to use I'd probably be a Mac
over that home and your question so
