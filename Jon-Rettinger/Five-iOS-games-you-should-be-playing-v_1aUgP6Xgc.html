it from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be covering five addicting
games were playing right now on iOS we
did a similar video showing you guys
what we were playing on Android so if
you guys haven't seen that video yet
make sure to check out the links down
below so the first one on our list is
javelin masters now this game actually
reminds me so much of the old-school
button-mashing olympic game I used to
play when I was a kid the game itself is
very straightforward there really isn't
much to it first you'll need to aim the
angle of the javelin and then tap the
screen with your fingers or thumbs as
fast as you can and trigger the throw
when you're ready you can unlock new
items and accessories to help you run
faster or throw farther but it
definitely takes time to unlock those
you'd have to play every day to set a
new record and earn super skills javelin
masters is free and you can grab it now
in the App Store
number two is hell Rider hell Rider is
an interesting endless runner game where
the players have to ride their bike and
smash skeletons it's a really neat game
and I was hooked after the first five
minutes the controls are fairly easy
just to tap in either side of the screen
to change the bikes direction and to
avoid the lavas and other obstacles that
gets in your way to earn points in Hell
Rider you would have to take down the
skeletons by running them over unlike
other endless runner games how rider
features boss battles that can be a bit
tricky to be tapping on a screen to
change directions avoiding obstacles
while trying to take them down is a bit
challenging but once you get the hang of
it it'll be pretty easy overall how
writers are really fun in the dicking
game and it's free so download it now
number three is fast and furious legacy
are you fan of The Fast and Furious
franchise have you seen all seven movies
and the short film yes there is a short
film if you haven't already you're gonna
one download this game fast and furious
legacy features super simple controls
and interactions it's not your typical
racing game unlike real racing or
asphalt although that would be cool too
this game is very similar to CSR racing
where you would have to rev up the
engines shift and hit the nos all at the
right time in order to win the race
these races take place in a few
different locations like Rio la Tokyo
Miami and feature most of the characters
from the movie franchise there's a few
different race modes you can choose to
play drag race treat race and drift
while the game itself is fairly easy to
play with simple left and right controls
and swipe based gestures I still enjoy
plague because of the franchise it's not
a unique game at all but the story and
the characters is what we reel you in if
you enjoy the fast enough you're a
series then this game is a must-have
number four is boom dots now if you guys
have ever played dots or two dots while
this game is completely different from
those two boom dots is a one tap dot
destroyer it's a super simple game would
one main objective to destroy the dot it
may sound boring to you but the game is
actually really addicting once you play
it the dots above you are slow at first
but think it's super quick and becomes
really slow again after a certain amount
of points there's a total of 200
missions to complete in this game so
there are plenty of challenges but the
game is super easy to pick up and play
probably why this game is super
addicting once you get the hang of it
the last one on our list is last voyage
which is going for $0.99 now from the
get-go there are obvious comparisons to
Monument Valley from the elements to the
sounds to the gameplay but the graphics
and experience are different last voyage
is a five-part puzzle and arcade game
with each chapter varying in style some
are more skill based and some are more
relaxed casual puzzles but the only real
problem with last voyage is that there's
nothing overly challenging or complex
about the game some sequences require
very little interaction which makes it a
perfect game to pull up while waiting in
line at the checkout counter nonetheless
if you're looking for a puzzle game
similar to Monument Valley while
experiencing something new then check
out last voyage
anyways let us know what you guys are
playing on your iOS device if you found

a thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
