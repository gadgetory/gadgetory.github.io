from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of a successor to was
arguably one of the flagship Windows
Phones this is the HTC Titan - we have
putting this guy through a battery of
tests let's go ahead dig in and see if
it's the worthwhile to Gracie your
pocket for the next two years so first
announced at CES 2012 the Titan 2 is
coming at at $199.99 with the obligatory
two-year contract that is running
Windows Phone mango 7.5 that's the
second release meaning it's got LTE
onboard so in full disclosure this is
the second HTC Titan 2 that we've had
the first one had some trouble
connecting to LTE and experienced more
drop calls and really any other AT&amp;amp;T
phone that I've tested over the previous
six months and ii you know however
didn't have any such issues able to
connect to LTE right away we haven't had
any abnormal dropped calls so whether or
not it was unique to our first unit and
we're gonna give HTC the benefit of the
doubt let's go and talk about what makes
this phone unique from the Titan 1 the
first obviously being LTE it's here and
we'll talk about that a bit more in the
full review the second though is that 16
megapixel camera on the back pictures
look very sharp in normal light below
average in low low light but HTC is done
you've given you really awesome manual
controls you've got face detection
you've got smile capturing white balance
that you can set to auto which I always
prefer first is really solid as well so
it doesn't Lee take 720p video 1080p is
not supported the video quality was just
about average for a smartphone
despite that really nice sensor video
was about we'd expect it is on par with
most other mid to high range smartphones
right now he's looking for a phone that
shoots great pictures this is really
going to fit that bill quite nicely it
is typical HTC build quality it feels
really nice and solid in the hand who
the mentioned standpoint we're looking
at five point two inches by 2.7 inches
by a very thin point four inches from a
weight standpoint it is five point two
ounces it's just the right weight
without feeling overly heavy let me know
you're using a high quality device HTC
has amongst the best build quality
industry and the titan ii is really no
exception there as opposed to the titan
one we now have a soft touch back as
opposed
to the metal that we saw on the first
version got a non-removable battery now
it's been ups to 1730 milliamp hours the
sim door now is part of the antenna
system so this guy right here you go
ahead and open this up all that's part
of the antenna meaning that when you
pull this out the phone is going to turn
itself off and reboot when you plug it
back in so don't think you can swap SIM
cards without turning your device off
chipset not much has changed a Qualcomm
1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s 2 single cork
Windows Phone currently doesn't support
double core but you have a 1.5 here it's
clock speed so we've got now a pretty
standard 512 Meg's of RAM internal
storage is a non expandable 16 gigs
we're not gonna talk that much about
Windows Phone 7.5 mango we talked about
it quite a bit but you do get a typical
Windows Phone experience here nice part
about the Titan 2 you're getting a big
windows fun experience the screen and
this guy is pretty much all screen is a
4.7 inch WVGA resolution Super LCD
display so for those of you keeping
track at home that means it's got a 480
by 800 resolution which right now is the
maximum resolution that Windows Phone
allows and for you math to whizzes
that's a hundred 99 PPI so the live
tiles look huge the messaging little
smiley guy looks like he is smiling
right at you internet explorer is a
giant e things just look super-sized so
for the generation that likes an extra
value meal and things a little bit
bigger this is going to be a great
choice I love the original Titan one for
that reason I like the size my
eyesight's not the best and things were
huge in the lower resolution made things
even giant err it looks great tiles are
bright and vibrant pictures appear to be
nice but when you start digging in you
start looking at tax that's really where
you see a difference it can equate this
to going to a big box store and looking
at televisions we've got two decks for
each other a couple thousand dollars
difference going to notice a huge
difference in fixture however once you
get that lesser model home and on your
wall if you look pretty decent you're
gonna forget about the higher resolution
model the same thing is here too while
using this phone but daily driver I
didn't mind the resolution but when I
picked up another phone that I was
testing or compared it to the HTC One X
or the iPhone 4s the screen you
definitely notice they're low resolution
if you think texture is fine but when
you zoom in you can definitely see a
little bit of pixelation this is
probably though one of the better
resolution
looking displays and I've seen and that
includes the Lumia 900 if you want the
Windows Phone experience you got to live
within those resolution limitations
screen on Titan 2 does look quite nice
pictures look really good on here as
well despite that low resolution and
video as well looks very nice you're
gonna get a relatively decent text
picture and video experience from the
HTC Titan
to HTC has a few tweaks to the phone
which you know I've arguably improved
experience can't really do much to the
windows so Nokia's the only manufacturer
has the right to sort of change the UI
HTC I sort of lived within those
limitations so what they've done is
created the HTC hub the HTC hub is gonna
look very sense UI issue if you're
familiar with it on Android there are
several HTC applications as well though
which are gonna give you an improved
functionality and you can only download
them if you're using HTC phone LTE
speeds were pretty reasonable to what
I've seen on other AT&amp;amp;T LTE devices
certainly it's kind of vary depending on
where you're located
but speeds that are getting we're about
five point eight ish down and one point
for up and again that's just in Southern
California where you are now your speeds
are going to vary so running a test here
live on camera and I'm getting almost
exactly the same speeds that I just
mentioned battery life has been much
improved actually over the original
Titan one I'm able to get seven and a
half to eight hours of talktime when I
call a radio station on a full charge
and leave it on hold until it dies it
was just shy of eight hours using the
phone as my daily driver pretty
regularly so with two emails being
checked an hour two phone calls some
text going through and some pretty
decent web browsing and video views by
end of the day is able to get about
twenty to twenty five percent battery
remaining taking it off the charger
about 7:30 in the morning and plugging
it in and around eleven o'clock at night
so you definitely get a full day usage
out of the HTC Titan 2 despite its large
screen and LTE battery life is still
staying pretty solid I like this big
screen I love big screen phones
I love the galaxy note I love the Titan
one and I love the Titan two it's a big
benefit to me but it might not be a big
benefit to you that's something you're
gonna want to try the phone see if you
can live with a phone of the screen size
I really like HTC's industrial design I
can appreciate the work that went into
it I like the intuitive UI as well on
the big fan of Windows Phone 7 I think
the live tile interface is really well
done and the camera also was pleasant
surprise at 16 megapixel sensor at HTC
tweaks really did a nice job and took
some pretty impressive pictures alright
so what do I dislike
out the phone it's got a relatively weak
antenna with other devices when I was
getting five bars of LTE this one
generally held on to four are oftentimes
three at one 9999 it's tough to
recommend this phone over the 99.99
lumia 900 which for a short period of
time has $100 of rebates coming with
that on top of it the Lumia 900
represents a really nice package of
design and price the Titan 2 if they
were the same price it'd probably be a
toss-up but when you put these two next
to each other start the justify spending
the extra hundy for the Titan 2 this is
something that I keep lamenting on in my
Windows Phone reviews why can I charge
this device while it's powered off I
find to be extremely annoying I know I
can turn it on airplane mode or change
profile settings but it's just a huge
irritation for me that I can't turn my
phone off at night and charge it I do
wish that we would have a user
replaceable battery for me it hasn't
mattered but I know a lot of you guys
like to carry extra batteries with you
if you charge that's something you're
gonna want to consider based on personal
usage I do wish memory was expandable as
well we're stuck with 16 gigs I can find
any place to put your microSD card and
certainly the last knock on this phone
and Windows Phone as a whole is the
resolution 480 by 800 just doesn't cut
it anymore especially when you're
looking at HD displays by competitors so
let's give this phone a score I don't
know if you guys are familiar with our
new phone scoring system a5 is a
perfectly usable and feasible phone with
no real glaring flaws a 10 is something
that's being reserved for phones that
are absolutely incredible so very few
devices or tablets should ever get that
score this gets a pretty solid 6 it's a
great phone that's like particularly
Wong with it it works well it works well
with the Windows Phone 7.5 but it's hard
to recommend because of the price
especially when the Lumia 900 singer
right next to it offers almost exactly
the same feature set for a lower price
point so you guys agree or disagree the
review of the HTC Titan to is it the
next phone to grace your pocket love to
