from technobuffalo here we are in a
breezy San Francisco afternoon where
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
double W DC just wrapped up we saw the
launch of the usual suspects with a few
surprises highlighted by the change from
OS 10 to now called Mac OS iOS 10 has
been released for beta soon to
everything that has to offer as well as
updates to watch an Apple TV let me tell
you about the highlights let's start
with the big ones and iOS 10-year lock
screen is going now get infinitely more
useful first when you lift up your phone
to your face you can see the
notifications don't have to push a
button to see what's in notations you
are going to see are going to be much
much much richer and you can interact
with them much more than you could
before message for example give a 3d
touch press the keyboard pops up to
reply can view videos now directly from
your lock screen most things you can do
in app you can now do directly from the
screen a lot of new views here as well
things like control center gotta redo
widgets are now in the today view series
getting way smarter here I'm gonna spear
you the developer API business what to
say Syria is now hopefully going to be
catching off with competitors from
Microsoft and Google hundreds new
additions iOS if you want to know more
about and we've already gone
technobuffalo I'll go into ton more
detail my favorite when we spent the
most time on is messages it is getting
way better they spent a lot time talking
about emojis you can now make emojis
three times bigger inside you can emerge
fi words if you type let's go get pizza
tomorrow and then see a movie it'll
recognize those words they can find a
mode used for automatically put them in
for you if you want new ways to reply to
you can do handwritten messages a cool
thing with invisible ink you want to him
the message you can sort of wipe it and
it'll slowly appear if you want to say
like I love you and have it have a
little bit of an impact you can do that
as well they're full screen effects to a
new thing two messages for iOS 10 or
bubble effect you can make them big
small sort of convey your moods doesn't
all just look the same the look and feel
of iOS 10 is very much iOS there's
improvements that things that we know
and we use and it's gotten incrementally
better the messages being the key
highlight there and we will see iOS
debut in the fall presumably with the
iphone 7 public beta will be coming out
in July for developer you can download
it today next to jump into OS 10 which
got a rebrand is now appropriately
called Mac OS and this version is mac OS
Sierra ton of new features here as well
the highlights are Ottawa mock you can
use your Apple watch your phones unlock
your
macbook universal clipboard so you can
copy something from your phone on your
iPad and paste it on your laptop or
desktop a lot of time focusing on cloud
storage here as well so app will
actually go through your hard drive
things they can store on the cloud to
save you space you can pay with Apple
pay now available on the web sites
picture and pictures if you watch a lot
of videos you can minimize them in the
bottom right-hand corner or left corner
wherever you guys want and that'll be
there as well so you can move them
around and resize the window but
probably the biggest highlight the one
that's been missing from previous
versions of OS 10 now Mac OS is Siri
Siri is here on a desktop client she's
gonna work very much what you'd expect
the best feature for a lot of people's
can be contextualized search you can say
send me emails at Rob free to set me
last week and go even further to that
and send me emails that Ron sent me to
talk about camera choices can get much
more granular now with your searches
it's like finder to the next level voice
finder but series here with Oliver jokes
and personality on board every year
double-double you see I keep hoping it's
gonna be new hardware I think like a lot
of people do but I forget that it's a
developer's conference and that's what
we got a lot of stuff for developers so
if your developer for Apple you're
probably lots really happy your consumer
that one's just more things to consume
you might be a little bit disappointed
whatever slatted spectrum you fall on a
lot of these things be available in the
fall so do you guys think what emos
