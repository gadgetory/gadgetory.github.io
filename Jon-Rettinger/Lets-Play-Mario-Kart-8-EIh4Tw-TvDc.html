editor from TechnoBuffalo nice to see
you guys here on the main channel if you
don't know we have our own gaming
channel it's technobuffalo plays you can
hit that the link that probably just
popped up on your screen or in the
description below we do just gaming
videos there i'm here with mario kart 8
we've had this game since early may I'll
review published yesterday again there's
a link and again below in the
description schemes pretty awesome I've
got this on 150cc playing as lakitu he's
one of the new unlockable characters
that's the cloud guy that tells you
you're going the wrong way in the game
you know lucky to fan favorite actually
he is one of my favorite racers in this
new game which is pretty awesome I'm
someone who really likes you she and
koopa troopa he's right in league with
those guys so i'm gonna get out of the
way really quickly this is 150cc don't
have planes it's one of the retro
courses that's making a comeback and i
have the item set to frantic that's
something you can do in the versus mode
you can set items to frantic standard
there's other limiters too but that's
why i get some weird stuff and you see
some weird stuff in this race also sorry
I'm not that great at Mario Kart I mean
I'm I'm okay
so if you haven't been following mario
kart 8 at all you might be wondering
what the coins do the coins basically
there's a cap at 10 you lose them when
you fall off the track or you get hit by
objects in the race what you want to do
is you want to pick them up because they
add to your top speed so the more coins
you have the faster you can go and you
also want to pick them up once you reach
10 because it keeps your opponents from
getting coins they disappear for a
little while and every 50 coins earns
you a car part I still haven't unlocked
all them and I have well over a dozen
hours played earning probably the cap
every time and this is Mount Wario it's
my other problem with my favorite
courses in the game instead of being a
three laps it's three sections split
down one course and you drop out of a
crazy helicopter which is hilarious
you
alright so for some visual statistics
this is 1080p running at 60 frames per
second and that holds when you go into
split screen with two players and the
music in this game is also building a
lot of it was reported with live
instruments in an orchestra setting
which is great this is the anti grab
stuff so you see that my wheels are blue
and they kind of like flipped up on
themselves that's when you're driving on
walls are upside down doesn't really
happen too much in this race and as you
saw in the other race didn't happen at
all so it's not a constant thing when
you do have anti-gravity vated if you
bump into another racer you get a boost
so that makes for some really
interesting stuff if you're trying to be
competitive and catch up with others or
if you're doing a team race in versus
mode you can actually join up with a
partner kind of boost off of each other
just to gain momentum intersection blue
shells are back obviously if I had a
super horn niggas call the super I could
deflect that blue shell it's actually
kind of the first really major canceling
item for it I could also get away from
it with a really well timed mushroom I
have been able to do that myself I've
seen videos of other reviewers doing it
I just I don't have I don't have those
timing skills I guess but I'm nearing
the end of this race so one last plug if
you like what you see here we do this
kind of gaming thing all the time the
TechnoBuffalo plays made the executive
decision early on like and we're not
going to overpopulate the main channel
with game stuff but we'll drop in every
now and again but if you do like this I
do several videos a week their head over
subscribe I'm nice maybe I don't know
try to stay active in the comments and
such so if you do come over you'll see
me hanging around thank you guys for
watching we'll be back soon with another
episode of this maybe down the line on
the main channel who knows let us know
if you want more and for TechnoBuffalo
this is joey davidson with another blue
shell that's too long see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
