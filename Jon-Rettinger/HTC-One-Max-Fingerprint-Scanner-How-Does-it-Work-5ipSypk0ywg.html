TechnoBuffalo here a few days ago we
posted our written review of the HTC One
Maxx and the biggest question you have
is in regards to that little black
square right below the camera the
fingerprint reader I'm gonna walk you
through how it works how well it might
not work what about the placement how it
works below the lens and all kinds of
other business that has to do with that
guy right there
let's go and get started so this little
black square is the fingerprint scanner
on the HTC One Maxx so first let me show
you how it works and I'll walk you
through the setup process what it can do
and I'll show you how easy or not easy
it is to you so first location it is
located directly below the camera lens
to make this work you have to swipe your
finger you can't just leave your finger
on there you got to swipe down so you
inevitably have to swipe your dirty
greasy french fry fingers all over that
lens which never makes for good pictures
so the phone is locked right here if you
try and unlock and normally and you
swipe up its gonna say a swipe your
finger to confirm so it's pretty easy to
do something you can know where the
fingerprint scanner is if you go ahead
and swipe your finger right down it
unlocks and it locks very quickly and
almost the first time every try actually
I haven't had any false unlocks or
haven't happened how to ask me to redo
it it works really really well the
tricky part here though the phone is so
big it's figuring out where that
fingerprint scanner is and you fit on
the back it feels very similar to the
lens soft sometimes you're swiping your
finger just on the lens let me show you
the settings and what it can do cuz it
does more than just unlock the device so
I'll jump into settings will go to
fingerprint scan it's gonna ask me for
my fingerprint I'll turn it over do a
little swipe and here we go so I've got
it set four different fingers you can
have it set for a few different ones if
you'd like you can also have it do
different things let's go ahead and
learn your fingerprint sided set for my
right hand will do my left hand here so
you go to continue and we'll ask you
which finger you want to use so I want
to use my left hand this time so you go
ahead and tap the finger and you swipe
it over three times I'm gonna do it
right here two vibrates each time one
two three and one more time rather four
times
successful and then it's going to ask
what we want to settle for so assign an
app to quick lunch so it's very cool you
can use different fingers to watch app
so I can use my right hand to unlock the
phone in my left hand to launch an app
you can do pretty cool things with it
let's say you wanted to unlock the
camera and make that work where you can
choose from different apps and unlock
your really a ton of choices that you've
got or launches apps immediately but the
camera one makes the most sense so we
just did left index finger so you don't
want that to unlock we wanted to go to
camera so go ahead hit apply go and go
back home let's say the phone is locked
I want to unlock it I can use my right
finger and swipe and the phone will be
unlocked all right so if I want to
launch the camera or use a different
finger you have to go ahead and tap that
power and lock button find the right
spot on the phone do a little finger
swipe action and you get the camera tool
in there nap situation I did have
actually errors the first time I've seen
that happen on the film but I swiped it
a few more times I was able to load the
camera interestingly though when the
phone is unlocked and you're just using
it and you try and swipe your finger
there it's not going to be active and
it's not going to watch a camera you got
to do it from your sort of pre lock
screen but it does work very well here
the big issues are since a phone is so
large it's really hard to find you got I
almost turn that thing over and swipe
your fingers the utility and the ease of
use really aren't there it comes to
security HTC said the same thing that
Apple does they're not sending your
fingerprints anywhere they're stored
encrypted on the device but you can
choose well not you want to use it or
not use it it's up to you I prefer to
not use it because it's so big but if it
was on the front its integrated to the
home button for example or something
similar to have touch ideas I think it'd
be really really useful but the way it
is right now it's just too hard to use
and almost impossible to find but you
choose to use it or not use it it's up
to you the placement makes no sense to
me especially right below the camera
lens but whatever it's worth there is a
demonstration of the fingerprint scanner
on the HTC One Maxx I'm Jen reading your
