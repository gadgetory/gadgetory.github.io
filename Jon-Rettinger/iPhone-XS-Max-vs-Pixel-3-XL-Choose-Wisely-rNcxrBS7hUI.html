group of weirdos that I am proud to call
my friend but like my friends sometimes
they are quick to anger and in that
spirit get ready to be pissed I'm about
to drop more verses and Kanye I'm gonna
battle the behemoth get your rage faces
on it's a fight of the flagships with
the other surly long names the Big
Brother battles let's make like a
courtroom cool and put Apple against
Google this is the iPhone 10's max vs. a
pixel 3 XL and oh yeah no cop-outs their
will will be a winner and if you are a
fan of either of these be sure to
subscribe
giveaways are coming super soon so the
idea here is simple both of these phones
are on a table and I could pick only one
which one would it be
Beauty gate scratch gate not kid son
Gaiden I made that last one up these
phones did not necessarily come out of
the gates problem free I can we evaluate
these phones based on how they're
performing right now with the current
software so something new drops will
update this video so with all of that
out of the way let's anchor some people
early and start with software this about
as clear-cut a battle of Android versus
iOS you can get no third party skin
action happening this is Andrea's google
intended I guess as how they intended it
on the pixel at least iOS at this point
is like an old car manufacturer trying
to make itself look new with slight
refresh as over the years apples added
some new features sure but iOS 12 looks
way too similar to iPhone OS on the very
first iPhone the counter there those if
it ain't broke don't fix it Apple
literally sells a phone every 1/3 of a
second
I may have made that up but you get the
point people clearly don't care about
iOS being stale think about iOS while it
might be boring it just works and
perhaps because it worked so well it
kind of fades into the background and we
start to think that it's boring in the
first place the gesture based UI fridge
did introduce on iOS 11 for the iPhone
10 is super elegant Apple's backup and
restore system is low-key amazing and of
course you know iMessage that's not to
say it's perfect it can still be
frustrating that I can't place icons out
of the grid
want a nap on the bottom row above the
dock and I still can't add a direct
dialogue to my home screen without
creating a multi-step shortcut
customization is still crazy limited and
I'll honestly probably always will be
for me it boils down to this
iOS does almost everything I needed to
do it just does it the way Apple wants
me to do it so Android is on the other
hand lets me do things the way that I
want to pie in the pixel 3 is kind of in
a mixed bag it's been more buggy than
I'm used to on a pixel device the bugs
aren't huge for the most part things
like the search bar accidentally
overlapping with the doc pics aren't
saving but what was a big deal was
endless bootloop that happened right
after I filmed our review forced me to
do a hard reset these issues might be
isolated to me
they definitely impacted in my usage and
the bugs are crawling though pi has been
pretty smooth with everything you'd
expect I'm still not a huge fan of its
RAM management but I haven't impressed
the granular level of customization on
Android pretty much everything the user
sees interact with can be customized in
some way and that is incredible in the
exact polar opposite of iOS if it didn't
have all the bugs this round could have
been much different but for software I'm
going with the iPhone 10's max we do
camera next I mean it's important with
these phones if you weren't pissed yet I
gotta I got a doozy for you
cameras are the big reason people would
upgrade to either these phones from
their predecessor we actually did a
whole video comparing the two but here
are the highlights see what I did there
okay camera bun oh I'll see myself out
so apples been pounding their chest like
Russell Westbrook after a monster dunk
about the smart HDR which essentially
just retains photo detail both the
highlights and the shadows this effect
can be a little too much sometimes and
to my eye especially in dark situations
sometimes brightens up the darker parts
in a photo while the pixel 3 leaves them
adding a nice bit of contrast the iPhone
tennis max sent to shoot photo is a
little warmer while the pixel shoots and
cooler pixel 3 typically has more
contrast in their photos and saturation
although sometimes the sharpest could be
a little too much
photos can look a bit over sharpened in
some instances portrait mode is another
big difference here pixel 3 does all of
its portrait mode processing and
software because
you know just a single sensor the iPhone
note uses a combination of info from
both lenses and software telephoto lens
can be beneficial in a lot of these
situations giving the iPhone a slight
edge in tricky situation when a person
is close to the background the pixel
there's a lot of things well things like
super zoom is pretty nice it retains
more detail than the 10s although 10s
can get close to your subject a night
shot out of this filming is still not
official but on the unofficial apk hot
damn that's like a bunch of magic so
this want to be pretty easy you just be
like both phones take awesome pictures
so it's a tie so let's just let's just
do that
no fine both bones took really good
looking shots but the pixel three will
probably take a shot that looks better
and ready to share even if it is a
little sharpen overprocess for some the
iPhone 10s may need a little bit
tweaking to get it looking right smart
HDR can be sometimes too much
I was picking one of these to take based
only on camera
I'm grabbing that sweet pixel 3xo so the
screen is a big one for me no matter how
good a phone is if the screen is garbage
user experience is gonna be degraded
fortunately neither of these screens are
bad in fact they're both pretty damn
good although what is better don't at me
on paper though these two look almost
identical 6.5 inch all wet on the Mac
and a 6.3 inch OLED on the XL and thence
they're all LEDs you can guess blacks
look super black colors look super
vibrant whatever you're watching or
doing they're gonna look good the pixel
does have kind of a slight bluish hue
but it's something you're gonna forget
about really quickly so it feels good to
say this but the screens on both of
these are so good it's no longer a
reason not to pick a pixel try to say
they come on fast if you just look at
the three XL screen on its own you're
gonna be thrilled but if you hold it up
next to screen on the max you can start
to see a difference if Samsung who
actually made the Excel screen had
pulled a display from the note or Galaxy
S 9 supply chain this would have been a
wash but just being made by the best
essentially mean it is the best mentum
and this is swinging back to the iPhone
just not by as much as you would have
thought so the screens are pretty good
the backs on both these phones are glass
and are insanely prone to scratches
cracks and drops it's good form to
protect your investment we've been
rolling here in the office with D brand
skins on both for protection the amount
of customization you can get is pretty
awesome I'll link to them down below but
I especially love giving our white pixel
3xl that camo look it's pretty hot so
intangibles is my catch-all category so
you know doesn't turn into it 17 our
Odyssey ending with me just crashing on
the floor in exhaustion like every
single thing above both these films
bring a ton of intangibles the iPhones
got incredible design except for notch
emic notch face face ID which I really
dig and wireless charging iMessage Apple
pay Apple stores would really matter for
you to repair the phones carplay ip68
great battery life eastin support kind
of for dual-sim action and apple's
ecosystem which if you're already in is
really nice
I wish Apple would go for USB C for
charging there's no headphone jack and a
five watt power brick in the box
makes me laugh and probably the greatest
tech trick ever play to the consumer
Apple somehow many people think it's
totally acceptable to pay over $1000 for
a phone so on the other side of the
aisle the pixel side there is a ton to
like aside from just that camera
wireless charging is here it's at
minimum $200 less expensive than the
cheapest iPhone 10s max it's got Android
pay Android auto uses USB C awesome
battery life unlimited cloud storage
super underrated organ omits on the
not-so-good side but not just still deep
and ugly lady do stop noticing it after
a while the back scratches like crazy
hence the D brand while both phones have
four gigabytes of RAM I worry about the
pixels slowing down in a few years more
than do about the iPhone especially
besides I keep it that long google also
ditched a headphone jack here as well
which is just kind of sadly accepted
nowadays so the winner for intangibles
comes down to what we're all working for
money 256 gigabyte iPhone and I'm using
is 1,250 bucks meaning there's a 350
dollar difference between the two that
I'm using for those vs. think about what
you could do with that money it all so
don't be fooled by the financing
mumbo-jumbo you still end up paying the
same full amount just over time for
intangibles I'm keeping the money in my
pocket I'm going with the pixel so can I
just call it a tie here move on no we
don't do that here at TechnoBuffalo
these are too well matched phones with
amazing screens great cameras and latest
software for their makers have to offer
but put these two phones on a table and
forced me to pick one this is what I'm
going with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
