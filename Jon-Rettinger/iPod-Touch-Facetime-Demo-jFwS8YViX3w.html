John rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
here one of the coolest new features of
the ipod touch the addition of FaceTime
thought it would be fun to turn to take
a call here and show you what FaceTime
is going to look like on the ipod touch
using the front-facing camera and the
little guy on the back let's go ahead
and see if this works also has the
ability now to vibrate you get ringtones
so the phone rings when you're getting a
FaceTime phone call kind of cool let's
see if we get a phone call coming in and
there it is look at that Mark Watson mr.
soldier knows best is giving a phone
call you can hear it ringing a little
vibrate as well accept it connect
there we go mark how are ya I'm doing
well so mark and I were talking about it
would be fun to sort of do a
demonstration on FaceTime and figure
each of us we're gonna make a video
showing how is gonna work anyway
might as well do do one together and
also we asked our audiences some
questions on Twitter so we're gonna
interview each other a little bit could
be could be fun so mark how would you
start you must get that question all the
time to the very short answer is no I am
far far far from rich I work hard for
what I got and fortunately the cool part
about being a tech reviewer is that you
can use the products that you buy as a
write-off but no I am definitely far far
from rich so mark next question I have
for you you are getting married very
very soon to to the beautiful Chris
Starr the question that people want to
know is what are you doing for your
bachelor party
yeah what's going to make it different
from a regular Vegas trip have you got
have you gotten used to same fiance yet
it's we I still get it's still strange
to say wife now like it just changes so
quickly so fast it would be the honest
answer someone offered a million dollars
to my YouTube account yeah I would sell
it
absolutely absolutely yes yeah I'll tell
you what if I was gonna make another
YouTube you can't have it think very
closely about what I was gonna call it
the name John for the Lakers clearly I
didn't think I was gonna be doing
technology reviews
would you sell yours for a million
dollars yeah alright so I got a question
do you hate each other I guess it's
talking about you and me do we hate each
other I I couldn't agree more I think
competition drives people makes me
better I'm sure that you know makes mark
better and mark and I have met before
met in Vegas and we've hung out here's
there there's no bad feelings at all I
think the more success he has and the
more success anybody any other tech
reviewers have give more validity to
what we do
I agree it's different takes on the same
product so you just cuz you're filming
an unboxing of the iPod Touch and I got
something similar yeah that different
takes on the product you know different
experiences different opinions to pull
from we need to when we met face to face
for the first time at CES last year but
we met just I I made a video the first
time that I saw you this must have been
about two years ago I made a video that
was called tech reviewers you don't know
our tech your best tech reviews you
haven't heard of and Mark I think a you
just started out at the time and did
that we're doing us an awesome job I
mean the quality the content you when he
first started was outstanding that's how
I first started talking I think I
reached out sent you an email and then
we just sort of started talking talking
from there yeah yeah it's not three
years ago so it's probably right about
you know it's it's crazy I mean see like
the the success that you've had
yeah and assess other youtubers have had
it's really kind of cool to see people
sort of live their dreams I mean what we
do I mean how cool is that
I wake up I wake up with a smile every
day you get to do something we love so
those are all the questions that I had
this is a demonstration of a face time I
guess I can switch cameras and you know
same sort of array of icons that you get
when you're using it on the iPhone 4 you
can switch cameras to to the back and
you can see it's right now what's going
on over there
see mark switched I switched morphs got
a much nicer angle and idea though
go ahead and move back you can move the
little picture anywhere you want yeah
that was about exercise fun champ for us
to just say I did hide of each other
thanks for the call mark bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
