technobuffalo here with a silly unboxing
for you of starcraft two wings of
liberty I make these videos as I love
technology and i'm a huge nerd at heart
and the original starcraft game always
always suspect replacing me I remember
spending hours and hours playing it in
college and I'm just really excited
about the second one so I know it's just
an unboxing of the box nothing terribly
exciting but I will try to make it as
far as I can so for those of you
starcraft fans hope you enjoy alright
let's go ahead and get to be unboxing
like I said in the intro I love
starcraft I play the original game all
through college a much more than I
should have probably when I should've
out I don't know dating but starcraft
with just a blast of a game I really
loved it i'm looking forward to
starcraft 2 so here it is wings of
liberty many many years later 60 bucks
if you want to get the standard version
of I such a special vision for ninety
nine dollars so in case you're all
curious e here's a box starcraft two
wings of liberty picture of a dude it is
rated T for teen this is a RTS or
real-time strategy game I'm a big fan of
genre i was even like halo wars and a
lot you guys weren't two biggest fans
there's a picture of a dude it's all
horror picture more dudes and a lot of
other guys we can find waldo in there
you can win a prize just some sort of
graphic art on the back you've got some
more you're going in enough of that
let's see we're going to get in the box
with your standard starcraft to purchase
go ahead and rip this open and i assume
it's going to be a very exciting affair
probably cardboard and a few little
discs all rights go ahead and pull this
out and see if we're right it is indeed
just distance like there's a serial
number there too so I'm gonna have to go
ahead and cover it up with the old
finger and here we have starcraft two
wings of liberty here's the disc and it
is a disc go and push that off and
probably are some more books and we do
indeed have books so there's a book here
is invited guest
a starcraft for the free guest pass key
play for you for ten days I'm going to
put the I'm never going to use these I'm
going to put these online first one to
use them can I can have them so here is
invite a friend here is 10 days of World
of Warcraft here is another free guest
pass here's another free 10 days a world
of warcraft so if those you decided to
watch it unboxing of just a box and if
you were one of the first ones to watch
this you can go ahead and try and claim
these if you were the first ones to try
here they all are alright so as I
usually do together or you get a notepad
as well it's kind of corny others guys
want it dead or alive i'm assuming we'll
probably find him dead so what would an
unboxing be without a size comparison so
here we have the starcraft 2 disc it's
really on the thin side it's not
necessarily pocketbook because it's wide
but it's a little bit thinner that i'd
like for a size comparison next to I
don't know some of its competitors at
here we have the iphone four you can
clearly see the iphone 4 is thinner but
certainly a bit less wide go ahead and
sort of see that comparison if you want
to bring in some other sort of
comparison things for purposes
comparison purposes here we've got a
palm pre plus you can see Sir there's a
big difference here also I don't know
how you use this as a phone of a hole in
the middle of plumbing can be bit
difficult to dial but it is there any
guys hope you enjoyed this very short
unboxing of starcraft 2 i'm going to get
my game on if any you guys want to claim
that stuff go ahead hope you enjoy hi
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo and
i will frag in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
