TechnoBuffalo here is an early seven
o'clock in the morning California but I
wanted to let you know that the rumors
we talked about yesterday about new
imacs new cinema display his new macbook
pros are confirmed so let me go ahead
and run through what the updates were
all right you see me look down so they
got some notes in front of me here so
going to run through of what we have so
first the low-end imac is now 1199
dollars 21 inch display at the
resolution of 1920 x 1080 it's now has
the core i3 chip as we expected a three
gigahertz core i3 cpu four gigs of ddr3
RAM hgi is radeon 4670 GP with 256 Meg's
of video ram and a 500 gigabyte hard
drive of course the slot loading super
Drive and the rest so that's actually a
pretty beefy computer now for out for
the base there's also a new 1499 21.5
inch model that includes a 3.2 bigger
its core i3 ati radeon 5670 512
megabytes of video ram and terabyte hard
drive in 4 gigs of ram along with sort
of the usual things that we just
mentioned there is a 1700 model for the
27-inch friday with a 215 Wow 2560 x
1440 LED backlit display 3.2 g very core
i3 cpu 4 gigs of ram and ati radeon 5670
and a one terabyte hard drive i can also
include upgrade back to the core i5
we're at a 256 gig solid-state drive
which the new option and the flagship of
all is a two-thousand-dollar 27 inch 2.8
gigahertz core i5 packing with eight
megabytes of shared l3 cache for your
bike's ddr3 memory ati radeon 5770 with
1 Giga gigabytes of video ram one
terabyte hard drive and available
options for a core i7 2 terabyte hard
drive you couple that with a solid state
drive we also saw the release of apple's
magic trackpad it is a seventy dollar
accessory which is not going to be
bundled any I'm
it's going to be a standalone
essentially is a glass trackpad that
we've seen in the macbook macbook pros
but external it was exactly the same
thing according to reports that's going
to run you $79 really to the surprise of
noah as well apple also refresh their
cinema display 27 inches with a 16 by 9
aspect ratio however this is not going
to be for the faint of heart it's going
to come in at just about a thousand
dollars this have resolution though of
2560 x 1440 which is really really nice
you know case you were wondering so
let's go ahead and take a look at some
other things that we got next is the mac
pro finally got a long long long overdue
update however will not be available
until august it now has 12 processing
cores and you can set you back about
five thousand dollars which is crazy so
here's what you are going to get for
4999 dollars the quad core sonic price
is still well that same price was still
with two thousand four hundred ninety
nine dollars eight core machines or
jumped to three thousand four hundred
ninety nine dollars with both variants
getting my own speed bumps to 220 gigger
it's the 2.4 respectively perhaps though
the preserve is looking most forward to
the grad school front we now have a
radeon HD 5770 taking up the mantle of
the default GPU i go ahead and upright
all of that even get to know that 12th
Corps promising vehement so those were
the updates through pat what everybody
expected what we expected pretty much so
much exactly to the knows what was being
reported to get so what are you looking
for personally i need upgrade to my imac
in the back i am definitely looking at
one of those new 27 inches rumor has it
they may actually be in store today
including a magic trackpad but odds are
probably tomorrow thing we'll all be
there so are you guys gonna go get a new
mac or imac for cinema display or really
one of the behemoth macbook pros are
just running back pros rather kind of
hear what you guys have to say leave
your comment down below i'm jon
rettinger and i'll see you in the next
video grab a cup of coffee
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
