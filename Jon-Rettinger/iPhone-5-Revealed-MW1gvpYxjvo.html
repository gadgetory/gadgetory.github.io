technobuffalo here the iphone 5 is
coming and it's leaking faster than a
baby's diaper which is a gross analogy
but true stick around let me tell you
what you can expect so what began a few
months ago as the most boring parts
reveal ever we saw a headphone jacks and
camera modules of what's going to be the
next iPhone we're calling it iPhone 5
chances are apples going to call it the
new iphone with they did with the ipad
but finally we have something
substantial by the folks at 9to5 mac
broke out the big boys today with back
casings from what's going to be the next
generation iphone or presumably what's
going to be the next generation iphone i
it is made of metal so you have two
different colors black or white they're
also saying we might have two additional
colors so kind of cool to see what that
might be I've got that two-tone look
that we had at the very initial I
phonics and now you've got plastic on
the top and the bottom definitely a
different look than what we've seen in
the past but it does reveal a bigger
screen size presumably going to be four
inches the camera is still in the same
spot but what's moved is the headphone
jack is now on the bottom similar to
where it is on the ipod touch we now
have a smaller dock connector so goodbye
30-pin hello I don't know 10 pin or
whatever Apple decides to call it saving
space in that dock connector is going to
allow them to beef up the speaker so the
speakers look to be much larger in the
next generation iphone we don't know
much about the camera module is going to
be or what features might be in it
although this is all lining up very
nicely for a presumed announcement at
WWDC coming up in June eleventh which is
now just a few short weeks away the tech
world widely of student Apple is going
to wait until the August to October time
frame to unleash a new iPhone on the
world but seeing all these leaks this
close to production kind of lends some
credence the rumors at WWDC might not be
just about updates to the macbook pro
and imac line it might be about the new
iphone as well and hopefully iOS 6 so
you guys think of these new designs
whether or not the real or not real yet
to be seen take this all of the grain of
salt
I love to know what you guys think if
you like to look do not like to look I'm
happy that just looks different coming
from the iphone for the iphone 4s
certainly the internals were beefed up
the phone just looked the same i'm happy
to have something that's going to look a
little bit different get a little bit of
a bigger screen and hopefully iOS 6
please we'll have some new features i
need widgets or information at a glance
looking at square icons just isn't doing
it for me and I guys let's hear what you
have to say I'm drowned rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo see the next video bye
