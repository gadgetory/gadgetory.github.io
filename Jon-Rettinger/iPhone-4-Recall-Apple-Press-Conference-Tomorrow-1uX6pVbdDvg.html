technobuffalo here if I can quote the
fake Twitter account of apple CEO steve
jobs we're holding a press conference on
friday and i hope you don't hold it
wrong so Apple is holding a press
conference this friday it's not a
keynote I don't believe it's to announce
any sort of new products it is to
address the iphone 4 antenna problems
which Apple has been very very silent
from other than one sort of very quick
press release pretty much saying don't
hold it that way so we're not really
sure what's going to be sick although
far to wait your guess I wouldn't bet on
a full-scale phone recall i would assume
everybody's going to get a free bumper i
would probably be the result here i
think that there's going to be a bit of
a mia koopa i think steve john will take
the stage and say they made a mistake
certainly as I demonstrated on video the
iphone reception problem is real it does
happen but if you hold your phone a
little bit differently but certainly you
shouldn't have to you can sort of
mitigate those problems however being
the phone should be able to hold it any
way you want and clearly the iphone 4
does have its problems summers day
that's even a feature you wanna hang up
from someone you just hold your phone
but clearly a mobile phone shouldn't
have that problem so what kind of should
be interesting to see what Apple does
things have rumored from a full-scale
recall which could cost upwards of 1.5
billion dollars to just a simple bumper
give away maybe there'll be a credit
given to Apple customers we've seen
Apple do that the past hundred dollar
apple gift cards when they drop the
price of the initial iphone really not
sure what to expect but I would assume
if I wager bet the whole we are going to
see is a bumper giveaway so this is
going to be tomorrow which is Friday the
16th of july at 10am of course we'll be
covering it all on technobuffalo and
i'll be doing live updates on twitter as
well sort of let you know what's going
on at twitter.com / john for lakers i
give me a follow and if you're in class
however you might be you'll get minute
to minute updates from what is going on
so have you guys had to do such
issues I demonstrated that they do exist
I actually got my phone coated in a sort
of invisible shield type substance all
the way around the side as well and i
still have the reception issues so you
really do need almost a bumper in order
to get those things to go away but who
knows maybe everybody we getting brand
new phones the mail soon yet to be seen
so many guys I even jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and I really will see you
tomorrow goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
