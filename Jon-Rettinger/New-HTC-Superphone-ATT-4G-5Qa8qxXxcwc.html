am all a CES up i just left the ATT
developer summit where they had the AT&amp;amp;T
keynote they announced a ton of new
android devices all their 4g plans were
laid out and in the backstage area was
HTC a very small booth that was
demonstrating the LTE prowess on an
unannounced a prototype phone so i was
able to get some footage of it they give
a demonstration of speeds which are
really fast you'll see in a minute but
pay special attention to the phone
because it is an unannounced prototype
they wouldn't tell me much of it but I
did try and get some footage of its hope
you guys enjoy ton more CES footage
coming up see the next video bye bye
so we just wrapped up the 88 depressive
that we're taking a look here at an
unannounced prototype from HTC to
highlight a tease new LTE network I will
take a quick look here at the device
it's looks to be about a 4.3 inch screen
this one this one is but this particular
one is it's just as nothing just a
prototype of the structure take a look
at the phone it's got a typical array of
Android buttons you've got the menu back
and search button again the impetus is a
prototype it is running sesh is just a
new version of sense that we've shown
that we can tell ya okay can I just
can't say this will cost either sighs
yeah my way there's nothing that at HCC
can really tell me I can see the Vice
your most of it is covered up cameras
which is peridot buttons on the side of
cover-up but it is a first demonstration
of a 4g LTE network you can see that it
does say 4G LTE knit is a 4g LTE network
so i'm going to let the folks here at
HTC give us a bit of a tour of advice
and of the 4g LTE network at AT&amp;amp;T is is
offering feel we are going to them using
the UDT to demonstrate the bounding
through put over the lt1 so you're going
to show us the downloads BTW okay so we
are doing good
and you can move the screen on the big
money so this is what we're watching
yeah okay
so this is live we're getting 42
megabits per second down yeah we can go
up to 15 20 60 in fancy and these are
real real test answers with nobody on
the network what sort of network speeds
do you expect one network has been used
by directly we can go up to send it bye
week like ten percent overhead for TCP
IP header pocono is properly like 6316
sir without c'mon so what kind of speeds
up can users expect on their mobile
devices on the network launches and
everybody's using the network you mean
because it's just a sure maybe a circuit
this say this is an AT&amp;amp;T u-verse kinda
queasy a test on upload tweet as well we
are not sure I'm not sure I'm not
showing up on speed so we're getting a
real world to your tests of 60 55 to 60
megabits per second on a 4G LTE network
which is a extremely impressive and then
we've got again some of the working
prototypes here that are demonstrating
that this is indeed video 4G LTE a shoe
looks like that we can so we're going to
try and stream a YouTube video to see
how quick you know W to this you can see
the speed here on this prototype it's
loaded extremely fast see how quick like
these are opportunities thing is loading
very quickly the quality looks extremely
beautiful certainly what's me HD
displaying on this type device a little
they have told me they can't say
anything about that for the phone that
we're looking at here anything else you
guys want to show me on the phone that
can demonstrate the LTE Prowse
so that one went through can we can we
run a speedtest on the device no I was
worth the aspirin
so you got some awesome movie quotes
here to see
1280 by 720 p the 1280 by 720 people see
the downloading process and what seemed
to see the bar is going it is extremely
fast this this is faster than most
people's hangovers here yeah whom what
we're democrat this is fantastic
anything else that you guys can show me
on the device as far as little so you
can do that's the right the dispute is
very impressive guys thank you very much
every good times with no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
