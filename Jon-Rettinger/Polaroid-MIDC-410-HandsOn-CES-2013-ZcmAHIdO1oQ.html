I'm at CES 2013 not like anything's
changed in the past probably two hours
between the last video and this one
how's it going guys am Aaron Baker from
TechnoBuffalo and there's another tablet
surprise surprise
at CES 2013 this is the polaroid MIDC
410 that really needs to have a better
name for it MIDC 410 10.1 inch Android
powered tablet and it's got some
specifications got some specifications
who have not had my coffee of course has
some specifications it's got a 1.5
gigahertz processor it's got 1024 by 600
resolution on its 10.1 inch just
planning granted I'm reading off the cue
card right now or 1 gigabyte of memory 4
gigabytes of internal storage 1080p
output you've got USB 2.0 connectivity
you've got a lithium battery
congratulations we need to look and see
some of the more detailed specs on this
device but you're running what looks to
be a pretty stock build of Android 4.0
apps and widgets as you can see up here
and you've got your notifications bar
down here in the bottom with no internet
connection and we see it wearing 100%
this is the white version there's also
black version over here right beside me
up top you've got your power button and
your volume rocker camera over there on
the side and on this side you've got
your HDMI port you've got some other
ports it looks like a USB 2.0
connectivity Oh interesting enough I'm
seeing Android 4.0 on the screen but
looks like
yeah as Google announced it's got to
have at least Android 4.1 so that makes
no sense scratch what I said earlier
it's got Android 4.1 although the spec
lists you can see here just to show you
that I was not wrong clearly says
Android 4.0 but another tablet from CES
2013 Polaroid what we see it in the u.s.
we see it manufacturer what we see it in
stores like Best Buy
I almost said copy USA clearly I'd not
have my coffee
Best Buy Amazon places like that we'll
find out keep it locked up for
continuing coverage of CES 2013 keep it
locked at TechnoBuffalo I'm Erin C Baker
on twitter the company's a TechnoBuffalo
we're on Facebook as well at
facebook.com slash TechnoBuffalo much
