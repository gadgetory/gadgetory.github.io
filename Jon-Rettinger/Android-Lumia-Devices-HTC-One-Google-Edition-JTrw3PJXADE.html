to you by AMD welcome back to their
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm your host
Jon register to show where you could ask
me any question you might have from the
ever-expanding world of technology and
sometimes a little bit outside of it up
this week we can talk about nokia p'raps
putting out an android device we're
gonna talk about the personal things
what I might do in the future we talk
about a delicious stock version of HTC
One a few other tech goodness things
this is a Sabbagh flow let's get asked
the Buffalo a first question comes from
twitter user Kyle whole asks at John for
lakers do you think Nokia will ever go
to Android if Windows Phone never really
takes off a lot of people thought nokia
was going to go to android when there's
symbian platform that they were backing
started to flail and falters really
popular around the world they weren't
eating traction against iOS and Android
they surprised everyone when Microsoft
swooped in like a romantic Fabio and
pick them right up off their feet and
whispered sweet nothings and said
windows phone is gonna be the next great
operating system we should give you a
ton of cash you should put it on all
your phones and of course nokia was all
oh my hero and they did so you've had a
few fruits of that labor of course we
got the Lumia 900 the mean I 2925 928
927 points25 and all the other Lumia
phones yet to come sorry they ever gonna
go to Android driven rumors that they've
had some Andrea prototype chicken around
for a while my bet though is no they
have too much microsoft money line their
pockets to ever let that happen but I've
been wrong before just ask my wife but I
wouldn't bet on happy any time at least
in the next five to six years hopefully
that helps answer questions this one
comes from Twitter as well user alex md
to ask at john for lakers career plans
after TBH i hope that i'm doing TV for a
very long time please don't get rid of
me at least not yet i am love doing this
i do this out of passion and i still
can't leave that it's a job so i hope
that i'm doing this for a very very very
long time but years down the road there
things i like to do in addition
doing this assuming I can still remain
relevant first I always mentioned
earlier that I love to run for political
office ideally I think that I would like
you probably just a one-term congressman
who could tell very clearly what was
going on in Congress and I could say I
was offered a bribe today or hey this
happened knowing very well I'd probably
would never get reelected but at least
pull back the curtain shed some light on
what's going on in the world and
especially with our own government here
in the USA look it needs to be a voice
for a younger generation that's just not
been represented and I would love to try
and be that voice also having started a
small business and sort of had going
through that struggle looking for
funding I love to start you know
technobuffalo fond aura whatever jon
rettinger venture capital from where i
can invest in small startups you don't
need a little bit of money with some
great ideas to hopefully take off I
would love to be able to give other
people the opportunity that um that was
given so those are the two things that I
would love to do addition to having
hopefully a huge family someday
hopefully had hoped aunt your question
alright the next one comes from Benjamin
nickel a Jew who asks at John for lakers
what inspires the team aside from the
audience I can't speak for the rest
technobuffalo staff um but I can't say
for what has sort of inspired me and
gets me moving every day and got me out
of bed during the bad days we tried to
launch technobuffalo we crashed and
failed uh and that is I hate to lose I
am insanely competitive to it fault
there's a site that's bigger or there's
a youtube channel that's larger I need
to compete I don't always have to win
but I always got to feel like I am doing
my best to fight and sort of get up
every day and do the best that I can and
if I don't want I feel really bad about
myself I coming to work and I don't film
I don't get cancer everything I want to
do it I go I'm feeling really crappy on
all honesty so that motivates me also
the ability certainly provide for a
family is a big motivating factor for me
as well also the ability may make a
difference even it's a small way out of
some folks out there you know picking a
cell phone is a nice choice making the
best tablet is a nice way to help but
maybe I can inspire someone to be a
little nicer to a kid at school or you
know maybe have an outlook little bit
different or you know perhaps inspire
someone start their own business um
that'd be ways I like to try make
difference and doing things like that
even if only one or two times throughout
my entire career online I think it'll be
worth X which
013 who asked at John for lakers what do
you think about the HTC One Google
e-edition well that just got announced a
few days ago after weeks of hcc saying
nope you're gonna do that don't look
over here we don't have an HTC nexus
google edition phone and then they said
yeah we do i'm super excited about it
but it begs a very interesting questions
so when HTC is trying to sell the HTC
One and Samsung China so a galaxy s4
this like the software features samsung
is saying hey look at all of our awesome
s stuff that we got going on and then
they're singing maybe you don't want to
do that you just want the phone itself
in sitting at HTC they're saying a our
sense is awesome we got blinkfeed but
eight years an option to not have that
the kind of makes you wonder how
effective those marketing campaigns are
going to be if the companies are trying
to sort of undermine themselves we had a
big debate here in the office in our
company chat room about all that stuff
so there's a lot of interesting things
about it either way though I think
anytime is choice for the consumer to
pick the best device for them I think
that works out well 600 bucks is
definitely an expensive proposition it
almost double the cost of the Nexus 4
but people want to buy it it's gonna be
there I can't wait to check it out I
would love an HTC one with stock Google
not having a root good for anything like
that I think it'd be pretty cool so just
from a geek stamp way I'm kind of
excited what you guys say you excited
not excited I would love to hear your
thoughts so take a minute to thank our
friends at Andy so we've already checked
out with amd's a series processor can do
when it comes to games we played some
serious left 4 dead kicked up the
setting is 1080p and I'll handle didn't
no problem but what about stuff that you
do on a regular basis maybe you don't
play games every day but you want to do
your word processing and maybe some
light games from the Windows Store let's
go ahead and check out how that works so
we've got microsoft office 365 all
loaded up here i use microsoft word the
most so let's go ahead and launch that
guy see how quickly it load switches on
over to desktop mode go to open up a new
blank document and you are good to go as
quickly as you can type is as quickly as
it will show up there so there's no
delay no lag anything you want to do it
can absolutely rock it let's go ahead
and close on out of here don't save and
all the rest of the Microsoft Office
suite opens up really quickly let's go
ahead and open up for example excel so
first time it's ever been opened on this
computer actually and boom we are good
to go what about some like gaming as
well let's say you want to play some cut
rope we had that one I'll queued up go
ahead and hit replay and you can feed
the omnom as much as he wants and
everything just works fast and that's
really the moral here you don't even
notice that it's using very little power
dead quiet anything you want to do in
the computer just works it's really the
best compliment I can give this machine
so anything you throw at it it can just
rock and handle and it doesn't dead
silence like hearing an electric car
drive by it just to say you don't hear
anything and really got to give this
thing a ton of credit let's go ahead and
try one more about some fruit ninja to
go ahead and open that sucker up right
and we can play some ninja you can see
on any touchscreen that worked when this
comes in tablet form at a queer spill to
play it right on the touchscreen and
then just work fast fans aren't even
loaded up on this guy everything just
handles it pretty well so can handle
games they can handle Word Excel
PowerPoint can handle photo editing
anything I want to do this guy can
absolutely rock it Oh while delicately
sipping juice and saving you battery
life which of course important so the
answer is can it play yeah can it edit
yeah can I do everything absolutely so
even these a-series chips that for the
way to go thank you guys for watching
