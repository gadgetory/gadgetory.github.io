this year but the tech giant shows no
signs of slowing down shares are well
above the three hundred dollar mark
stocks up sixty-two percent in a year as
Apple holds another event in about two
and a half hours it's in California it's
called back to the mac and although
there are rumors about what Apple has in
store for consumers there always are
people live and exist simply to gossip
about Apple's plans it's all speculation
until this afternoon Jonathan vengers
editor-in-chief of TechnoBuffalo dot-com
use some insight into what Apple might
be announcing you're one of those folks
who spend a whole lot of time thinking
about what they might say what do you
think I absolutely do these Apple
conferences are the tech equivalent of
rock concerts and Steve Jobs very rarely
disappoints so the back to Mac implies
that finally the company is going to be
shifting their focus away from their iOS
centric devices so meeting the ipod
touches the iPads and the iphone lines i
think what we're going to see and sort
of what reports are coming out or three
definites in one probable what's going
to qualify as a almost definite would be
a redesigned macbook air when the
macbook air first launched it was thin
it was a engineering marvel but it was
too overpriced for a mainstream consumer
and it was too underpowered for everyday
use some sort of sitting there in a in a
tech limbo this new design MacBook Air
suppose it going to come in two sizes
going to have an 11.6 and a 13.3 11.6
supposed to have an entry price point of
just over nine hundred ninety-nine
dollars of putting it just about three
hundred dollars more than the highest
SPECT iPad and also similarly specs on
netbook so you're really gonna be
getting a mass market a consumer laptop
but I thought the whole point of the I
mean I understand the iPad may not be as
good as a laptop yet but clearly it's
going in that direction and once it gets
there why would I want a laptop at all
when I can just use my little tablet see
that's that's a great question a lot of
people that are reliant on desktop
applications so the Microsoft Office
suite for example is coming out on Mac
next week sort of access to a full suite
of ward applications more robust to
video editing that the iPad just can't
do it
that certainly has mobile versions of
these desktop applications but they're
not as full featured as you're going to
get on a laptop computer Jonathan if I
want to really make money and Apple what
I really want them to do is to not just
sell quite high margin products to media
types on the East Coast I need them to
sell around the world and I need them to
sell in emerging markets and I need them
to sell at lower price points and I need
them to have a distribution system to do
that do you see that coming you know
this 999 macbook air certainly and as
you're mentioning with every Apple
products has been what's been called an
apple tax where there's a premium
associated with these pieces of hardware
this 999 price point i think is Apple's
really first foray into a mass market
product which almost falls in the line
of a impulse purchase for a lot of
laptop buyers so this may be the product
that's going to be scalable perhaps for
emerging markets they're supposedly
going to be utilizing a new memory
system I called an SSD card which is
going to look similar to stick of ram
that can possibly be scaled down and
made less expensive for emerging markets
through interesting alright well John
thank you very much two and a half hours
and all the Apple phones will be very
excited yes what they get to be huge on
Power Lunch I suspect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
