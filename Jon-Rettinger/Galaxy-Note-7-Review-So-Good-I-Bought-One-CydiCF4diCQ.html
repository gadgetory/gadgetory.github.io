coming out about every six minutes and
some tick some boxes some takeo thers
but very few going through and take
every single box of what would make an
almost ideal smartphone and the Galaxy
Note 7 looks to be one of those devices
so instead of testing in a vacuum I
wanted to use it as I would any other
phone so a few days after this device
came in I was off on a family vacation
with my sisters and my parents there
were seven kids under 70 years old
including my three-year-old and six
month olds you're gonna get a chance to
see what things are like behind the
scenes and actually see the phone get
tested and by angellist review I
launched the question should you buy the
Galaxy Note 7 let's go to Maui if you
want any more information on anything
I'm going to talk about like software
hardware or even detail and specs hit
the link down below and check out the
full written review by Todd Hazleton
whenever I test a new phone the first
thing I always noticed is how does the
phone feel in the hand is make you feel
anything does it look like a generic
slab does it feel premium the note 7
absolutely feels incredible
completely coated in Gorilla Glass 5 the
dual curved edges this phone looks and
feels absolutely premium I love the way
the curved edges look on the table
I like the way it feels when you pick it
up now the curved display is of
questionable utility I don't really use
the edge panels all that much maybe
maybe you do but for me it's totally at
settings and I think it really works
here say what you will about Samsung
with you love them Hayden we're a
totally ambivalent they make the best
displays in the market and the note 7
display is their piece de resistance it
looks incredible it almost looks like a
sticker on the phone as opposed to an
actual display that does stuff it worked
really well it was even pretty visible
in direct sunlight which is better than
I've seen on previous gen Samsung
devices
Samsung has got a few tricks up their
sleeves as a note 7 one of the big ones
is the iris scanner built-in and it
works it was easy to set up but when you
started going out in direct sunlight
having sunglasses on it got a bit
squirrely so I ended up using it in
conjunction with the fingerprint reader
and that was a pretty good combo also
oddly my son likes to set timers so it
has that built in to that time of five
minutes one of the coolest things for me
about the note and reason I think it
fits well into my lifestyle is it as
ip68 and things around me are constantly
getting dropped wet and generally thrown
around what better way to test this with
water proof I've actually taken the
water COF does in the ocean did happen
video coming out of that 12 megapixel
sensor looks awesome this is exact I'm
eating carrots
you want to say buddy what is that girl
doing pictures look incredible
I think this is still one of the best
cameras I've ever tested and I said that
when it was found in the galaxy s7
galaxy s7 edge when you've got great
light the photos look really bright
vivid and vibrant even you've got low
light it just look really good and
you've got sort of Ishi
light and then that's a word maybe not
great the camera still manages to find
that sweet spot the Maino controls are
there and they're nice I mostly had this
thing in autos it's trying to snap
pictures of my kids as we were running
around I also really liked oh is so if
you constantly chasing little ones
around or maybe got to shake your hand
you can appreciate that here as well
some folks might be disappointed with
only a thirty five hundred million power
battery and I'd love to tell you I
conducted thorough video tests running
down the battery and I left it on hold
for five hours see how in Haynesville
but the reality is my kids were napping
for hours at a time so mostly I was just
playing pokemon go on the patio to deal
with this guy and the battery was decent
but not great I generally by end of the
day I was down to ten fifty percent
usually about 10 percent lower than it
ordinarily am now with new phones
additionally we hit him harder than you
ordinarily do and as the week wore on
the battery did tend to get a little bit
better fortunately though quick charges
here and when plugged in I almost got 1%
of battery life per minute one thing to
note though while using the phone
whether you're playing games or watching
video or just making a phone call the
phone does get warm and it's noticeable
in your hand it's not gonna fry off your
junk in your pocket but if they're gonna
feel a little bit of warm and hope
Samsung is shielding that radiation
since it's so close to your heart one of
the other big selling points for the
note 7 is the s-pen this time around
it's also waterproof which I I never I
never used but you can write notes now
underwater the S Pen works very well and
it's got thousands and more points
sensitivity and that just means when
you're right on the screen actually
doesn't have any sort of lag there's no
delay and it almost looks like one to
one as you move a little bit
makes a little bit of a note on the
screen I like it the s-pen doesn't add
any extra bulk I didn't use it too much
but that's add some cool features you
can magnify you can translate things in
real time if you're big on taking notes
or you want to stylus on your advice the
s-pen this generation is pretty solid
and also you can't put it in backwards
they don't they don't like a lot stew
made about the phone scratching how
Gorilla Glass 5 is going to perform I'd
any scratching issues I took it at the
beach and I had sand on it which
ordinarily would scratch most phones and
this thing came out looking really
unscathed by the time the trip was over
I was ready to go home
chasing kids around especially a cranky
toddler who was 3 hours at her timezone
is exhausting spoiler alert he needed a
nappy so if you couldn't tell I really
liked the note 7 my favorite things
about it I didn't have to think about
how to use the phone I wanted to take a
picture in the water I could take a
fixture in the water by drop doesn't
have to worry about it cracking I felt
really good using it in fact the best
endorsement I can give a phone is to put
my own money behind it and I did I
picked up a galaxy note 7 for myself if
you find yourself drawn to note 7
features but don't want to pay the
astronomical almost 900 bucks after
taxes you might want to look at a
discount of galaxy s7 or galaxy s7 edge
what do you think about the note 7 is it
for you did you pick one up leave in the
comments down below if you want to see
more note 7 coverage give the video a
thumbs up to let us know until next time
