technobuffalo here we've covered pretty
much every aspect of the ipad 2 we've
covered the cameras we've covered the
screen covered build quality thinness or
thickness depending on how you want to
look at it but we haven't really talked
about is how to protect your five
hundred dollar plus investment apple
offers smart covers then i'll do a
decent job of protecting the screen but
it's not going to help you if you drop
your ipad and certainly not the
protected the back of your device so
when I carry my iPad 1 or when I did
carry my iPad 1 I always used a case
from the folks at a case and they were
nice enough to send me a sample a
preview sample actually of their case
for the ipad 2 which brings all the
stuff that i liked about the first one
but just number two's it up here so let
me go ahead and show you what we got so
first the ipad is going to be secure via
strap on the side can see it's got some
nice leather stitching right there you
still have access to your volume
controls and your mute rotation lock
switch depending on what you have it set
for on the left side you've got sort of
a swedish feel and that's also i'll pull
that strap back it's also it's going to
be protecting the ipad on the bottom as
well to keep the aluminum or aluminium
however you want to pronounce it safe
and secure with that same swedish feel
very easy to put in here you just lift
up the straps push it on over and your
ipad slides nicely on in and most
importantly will be secure on the left
you've got these eight little raised
rectangles which will also help to prop
the ipad up i'll show you in a minute
but they also keep the sort of swedish
back to like i just talked about from
touching the screen if you have oils on
this from your hands or if it just gets
dirty from being put in your bag you're
going to sort of have a chance to
protect that from getting on the screen
also if you put your ipad and a backpack
or suitcase where there's a lot of
pressure this is going to sort of
protect the screen from bearing the
brunt of that pressure go ahead and
close it up it's got a nice leather SQL
to it you can see the high marks i guess
on it it's got a nice clasp on the back
I'm always paranoid when I walked my
iPad I'm going to hold it the wrong way
and it's gonna slide out this definitely
addresses that with that bit of leather
that we showed and now the snap and if
you want some extra protection to make
sure your iPad's in there you've gotten
elastic strap and go ahead and put
around the side similar to what we saw
actually from Amazon's cover for the
kindle go ahead and pull that right on
back there we go you've got a slot for
or an opening rather for the rear facing
camera and you're not gonna have any
problem accessing or 3.5 millimeter
headset jack right there or also the
lock and power but you just have to push
your finger right in you can access it
very easily there's my iPad on or off go
ahead and close this up so I've only had
this for a few days but I already feel
like I've got the same protection that I
had with my iPad 1 which is really nice
actually dropped my iPad one once and I
had the similar case for the ipad one on
this and it didn't do any damage
actually hit right in the corner I was
very happy to have that protection a
little bit of buffering right there so
if you're worried about dropping your
iPad 2 you want to make sure you've got
the extra protection for it and sort of
ensure that your investment is going to
be nice and secure you might want to
look at the ak's case there'll be links
down below in case you want to check it
out um also be links for the ak's folks
down below in case you want to chat with
them on facebook or whatever else it
might be one last point that I want to
bring up if you liked the design of the
ipad 2 case but you are more squarely in
the Android camp they also have cases
for the zoom and I'm sure they'll have
cases for a lot of the upcoming android
3.0 honeycomb devices so be sure to
check out all of dem links down below
including their facebook page if you
want to talk to me about tablets and
stuff i will be active on there
