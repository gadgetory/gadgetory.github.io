tablet with a little bit more creative
name this time if pm10 how's it going
guys some Aaron Baker for technobuffalo
here at CES 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada the
Polaroid booth in a central hall in good
old vegas nevada my lips are chapped you
know how it goes with the dry air lips
your chat probably gonna get sick at the
end of the week but you know what we
bring it to you because it's all in the
name of technology and that's the name
of the game over at TechnoBuffalo let's
take a look at this tablet though m10
not too different from the one we just
took a look at down at the other end I
have a little kiosk thing on the end of
the table here but this one a little bit
different looking feel you've got the
front facing camera here in the middle
and the specs are a little bit better
than what we saw down on the other one
and this thing is packing a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera a 5 megapixel rear
camera 16 gigabytes of internal storage
connectivity Wi-Fi what's great about
this MSRP is somebody that you know
maybe once a tablet but not really
comfortable going into the tablet world
don't want to spend 499 for an iPad not
use it at 229 this is a great option to
get your feet wet and see if tablets are
for you I also really like this a lot
because I can see this appealing to a
demographic that have let's having to
feel to before quick easy buttons Wi-Fi
setup settings online help power and
more gives you easy access to android
4.1 here in a stock build of jelly bean
at that you can see very easy to use
very fast your processor here is in quad
core cortex a7 so you've got a nice fast
cpu you got your menu button over here
which is kind of nice and kind of
different for an android 4.1 tablet you
have a standalone dedicated menu button
you can see out when i click it it
brings it up over here near the
notifications area you do not get this
really obnoxious likelier or these
fingerprints with your new tablet
although your fingerprints will probably
be on it after a after a few days and
that's a good thing right your
fingerprints good these fingerprints
grimy nasty and that's what contributes
to us getting sick at the end of the
week after we cover CES you get you
really a clean-looking tablet here with
your camera on the back
full red logo see over here on the side
i have a two-tone look and feel with
hdmi USB sim card slot dcn and of course
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack volume
rocker and a power buttons are really a
functional tableting and keeping in mind
the MSRP for this device is 229 keep it
locked on TechnoBuffalo for continuing
coverage not just for Polaroid before
CES 2013 in general we are weak we're
going to cover it for you follow me on
twitter aaron c baker and the company at
TechnoBuffalo thanks so much for
watching i'm going to try to refill my
coffee because clearly i need it i'm
aaron baker from TechnoBuffalo we'll see
you next time
