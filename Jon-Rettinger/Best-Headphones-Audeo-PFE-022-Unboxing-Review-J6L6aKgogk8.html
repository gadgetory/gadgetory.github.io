technobuffalo here with an unboxing and
follow up review for you of the audio
PFE 022 headphones from phoning these
are extremely light headphones clocking
in at just 14 grams that offer over the
ear compatibility so when you're running
or at the gym or just walking around you
don't get that sort of earbuds swing
that you get if you've ever used another
pair of headphones supposedly these
offer very good bass offer a decent
amount of noise reduction and really
just put pull together to offer very
nice sound quality or so uh the company
is claiming i want to put these guys to
the test and see if they live up to the
hype let's go ahead and get started
alright so you're going to set you back
just about $149 from amazon or any other
retailer picture of the headphones on
the front and the information on them on
the back that take a quick look here
only what fits perfectly can sound
perfect so you can see right here they
actually go over the ear and they do
have a built-in microphone i believe
they come in with the microphone version
without a microphone version they've
already use these with your phone it'll
be a very nice compliment let's go ahead
and dig on it looks like we can lift up
top and you can see the headphones right
there a little bit more about it perfect
base perfect fit in a ton of different
languages that I personally cannot
understand but maybe you can to go ahead
and rip these guys open and of course we
will use send your stabby for box
opening purposes and hopefully not
finger slicing purposes now I make that
joke all the time but every time I use
that I'm a little bit frightened alright
so go ahead and open this up it's like
there's a little plastic tray inside
here we have another plastic piece like
a tea is trying to get to it but I
cannot alright so there's another tray
under here got some instructions and
warranty information and somehow someway
we will actually get to the headphones
they're there ton of different ear tips
for all your different sizes for you
folks fattier skinny years in between
years you're gonna have some options
here are the headphones themselves go
and pull that out see the little inline
mic these guys are very very very small
the weight of these is only 14 gram so
you're not going to feel the pressure
pulling down on ear but I'm circus they
can put the nice technology into
headphones at waist so little can see it
a little microphone there as well so i'm
going to go ahead and use these give
them a shot and i will follow this up in
a day or two with my review stick around
alright guys so it's been the better
part of a week and i've been using the
PFE twenty-twos as my daily headphones
for the gym using it as i walk around
with the microphone and sort of a mixed
bag so let me start with how you wear
these guys you can see that I've got it
in in my left ear here it wraps around
the ear so you can put it on you have to
take it around here wrap it and put it
inside now it's a bit strange to get
used to and it took me a good two or
three days to get used to the feeling of
having the cord a wrap around my year
what that is going to give you from an
advantage standpoint is you're not going
to have the cord sort of swinging around
and hitting you like you have with the
standard pair of earbuds one of the big
problems I've had with other headphones
i've reviewed is that they fall out when
i'm running they fall out when i'm
walking because it sort of will be
weighed down and pull right out of your
ear it's only stuck in by just a little
bit of a tip by putting these all the
way around the ear you've got a bit of
an anchor and it also takes the pressure
off the inner ear from holding the
headphones down for example when I use
the apples or earbuds that come with
everything about an hour and a half I
start to get a bit of ear pain for the
pressure of the headphones actually
pulling down on my ear not so with these
once I got used to wear IAM they were
extremely comfortable I was able to wear
them for upwards of two three hours time
is really when I stopped it wasn't
because of discomfort is because I had
nothing else to listen to these are a
fantastic pair of headphones from a
comfort standpoint I really like that
they are extremely lightweight and
you'll hardly even notice they're there
one of the other great
about these headphones it's actually
they are a little bit of noise reduction
the tips they have at the top of you
find the ones that right from your ears
actually will cut out a lot of noise I
actually took these with me on a flight
and I listened to music for part of
flight but I put up in my ears just to
block out the engine noise from the
airplane sort of another surprise use
base was extremely rock solid with this
the audio quality was fantastic I wish I
could show you on video what the audio
sounds like out of here unfortunately I
can't really do that but suffice to say
the audio is fantastic for $149 pair of
headphones you'd expect fantastic audio
for that price I've tested much much
much more expensive headphones that I
haven't been a fan of and these really
about performed the other ones that I've
tested one of the bit knocks on it
though is the inline microphone that's
built in here that was not the best
quality when I was using it for phone
calls people heard scratchiness there
was a bit of noise topic I'd actually
take the microphone out a few times it
does work you have to sort of fiddle
with it I tried on a few different
phones make sure it wasn't just a device
I was using I sort of had that across
the board however if you're not going to
use it for Mike you control your audio
tracks listen to music you know by a
tapping or double tapping for next track
so from an audio standpoint these are
some of the best headphones that I've
used I really like that they're light
they don't hurt the ear it will take
some getting used to with that sort of
weird hook wrap around but you're gonna
be able to wear these the gym where I'm
walking around and wearing them running
without them sort of swinging down and
getting pulled out of your ears and also
causing a bit of pain so these are
highly highly recommended if you're
looking for something that's going to be
used primarily as a microphone for your
cell phone you may want to look
elsewhere if you want something that
sort of adds just a microphone feature
to have occasionally you're going to be
a great pair of headphones to pick up I
can definitely recommend them and give
them my seal of approval these are the
audio PFE twenty-twos i'm jon rettinger
TechnoBuffalo i'm gonna get my rock on
but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
