from TechnoBuffalo Here I am taking a
look at the just announced new freshly
redone invidious shields no longer is
little flip up guy with the screen new
controller now it's got android TV on
board we've got the 16 gigabyte model
right here it's going to retail for $199
also coming soon will be a 500 gigabyte
version it's going to sell for hundred
bucks more for $2.99 but also come with
Borderlands so not mature in the box you
got a picture of the device on the left
hand side showing you some of the
accessories which I have with me so I'll
show you at the end of the unboxing this
is where a lot of the information is
gonna happen
so Android TV if you don't know it's a
smart TV platform it's new connected
platform it's available being built into
some television sets and then for some
standalone boxes but when the videos
done is taking a standalone box and
added there's a ton of sort of features
that kind of only in video can add so
first Android TV get access to all of
your Google Play content we've got voice
search here on board so you can say you
know example oscar-winning movies or
launching tube you could do that also
you can stream 4k here experience Dolby
7.1 surround sound past and of course
you can do gaming through in videos
really awesome video grid system but the
app that I was excited about is Selene
TV this is a cord cutters dream to be
able to sort of stream and get all of
your content through one box and also
get all of your television now without
having to worry about any long-term
contract a their satellite or cable got
some specs on the side I run you guys
serve one thing to remember when we
talked about the ports it's HDMI 2.0 so
you can do 4k Ultra HD with 10-bit color
which is pretty impressive so if you
want to stream from 4k or something like
Netflix you'll be able to do it as long
as your TV and HDMI port can handle it
let's go ahead and dig in I've got the
just unnecessary knife here I recognize
there pull tabs go ahead and open this
but I don't know cutting stuff is much
more fun so we will slice the seal open
on this guy and we will do this on the
other side here as well let's go ahead
and see what this guy looks like I have
not seen one of these yet in person goes
ahead and opens up if it is done a
really nice job with our hardware I
really liked the shield tablet this is
sort of the latest in that shield
lineage go ahead and pull it out of the
box it's got a decent amount of heft to
it it feels significant without being
sort of big or bulky but sure
to the side real fast he'd also going to
have inside of the box underneath that
plastic tray we have your controller
onboard front buy an extra one you can
do so for just about 60 bucks
looks like the Nvidia shield controller
the newer version of it but it's
optimized for all things you want to do
with your Nvidia shield with Android TV
on board to push all of that off we're
also going to have a power brick with
the us adapter to it so plug that in
goes into the wall push that off we've
got a HDMI cable included it's nice to
see that usually those are not included
and then we've got a micro USB cable
here as well a little bit of a booklet
getting started in support guide and
that friends is it let's push all it off
the side take a look at the Nvidia
shield itself so here it is it's got a
slanted design you got sharp angles on
it to pull off all the plastic and run
through the ports of plenty because
there is a lot here on board starting
with your capacitive power bug so let me
explain a little bit more about what
this is I think this is a product that
needs some explanation so it's based on
Android TV the Nvidia shield is
supposedly a really powerful Smart TV
platform Nvidia claims it can be able to
deliver the best Android TV experience
with personal entertainment
recommendations instant access to your
entire Android media collection
supposedly really powerful voice support
as well on 4k capabilities that
supposedly are again the best in the
industry and of course all that within
videos gaming prowess you should get a
really solid set-top box it also
includes a new app called live channels
enables you to seamlessly connect to a
TV tuner box and view over-the-air local
TV channels with full program guide
functionality or something I know a lot
of you core cutters have been looking
for it's being powered by just the
ridiculously powerful Tegra x1 so the x1
is the highest performing mobile
processor and delivers almost 35 times
higher performance and competing
streaming devices and those are the Roku
is your Apple TV and boxes of as such
alright so let's take a look at the
ports how's this guy going to hook up
you've got power right here there is
your hdmi gigabit ethernet but of course
it's got Wi-Fi
2 USB 3
Point OHS microUSB that's 2.0 and a
microSD card so I can actually load apps
onto that SD card slot as well if you're
deciding what storage option you want to
get other accessories I mentioned gonna
come with it we've got the shield
controller here if you want to buy a
remote it's not included it's gonna be
$49 here is what it's going to look like
feels really nice then also if you want
to stand your shield up you know there's
a stand it's also gonna be available for
29 bucks
our very own editor-in-chief Sean Ani
just recently cut the cord he said
relationship with his long term
satellite provider and has been trying
to find the best solution for watching
TV without a contract so this is going
to go to him to try and review he is the
perfect person to review this think this
is who it's aimed at as well so anything
you want us to see in the full review of
course demonstrations in the such we'll
be sure to show you anything that you
want Sean to test let us know with the
new Nvidia shield and I think you guys
for watching hope you enjoyed till next
time I'm John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo
see you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
