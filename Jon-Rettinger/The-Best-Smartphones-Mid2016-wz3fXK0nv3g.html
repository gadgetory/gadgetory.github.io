hard to find a phone that isn't good
anymore no matter what price you want to
pay but there are some phones that are
better in certain categories than others
and to help you decide we've got eight
categories and the phones that are best
in them before I jump in and tell you
what's best I want to thank our sponsor
graphics doc if you run a website or
youtube channel looking for the best
royalty-free images look no farther than
graphics up we actually use these guys
all the time on TechnoBuffalo they've
over 300,000 graphics photos vectors and
images most websites are gonna charge
you per images and cost as much as 30
bucks
but with graphic stock you get unlimited
downloads with your membership you want
to give it a shot try it free for 7 days
go to graphics Ofcom slash YouTube or
just just click the link down below to
get your 7 day free trial
check out the folksy graphics on let's
start the category that's most important
to me the best screen and that
resounding Lee goes to the Samsung seven
lines of phones so that's the galaxy s7
galaxy s7 edge and the galaxy note 7
resolution aside by this 1440 by 2560
Samsung Super AMOLED panels look
incredible we've got great viewing
angles the colors look really bright and
vibrant the blacks look really dark take
it outside and they look a little less
awesome but if you are inside be
hard-pressed to find anything that looks
better than Samsung's screens you no
longer have to spend the almost 900
bucks to get a flag to your phone to get
a really good phone the best phone under
$400 is my daily driver right now the 1
plus 3 it is an incredible combination
of features and price we've got a
snapdragon 820 and insane 6 gigs of ram
1080p screen which may not be the
highest resolution but it helps with a
really stellar battery life it is one of
the best well rounded phones I have ever
tested and I'm proud to carry it in my
pocket so next what about the phone with
the best build quality maybe you're a
little rough on your phone's if you want
a phone to just feel premium in your
hand that goes to the Apple line of
phones the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s
plus Apple has been at the smart phone
game for a while and their 7000 series
aluminum feels incredible in the hand
and for just Rob build quality he'd be
hard-pressed to beat the Apple line of
phones but a very close runner-up to
this would have been HTC's 10 so what
about multimedia
maybe you play a lot of games maybe
virtual reality is important to you this
one was a very easy category to pick
this also goes to the Samsung 7 lines of
phone so the galaxy s7 galaxy s7 edge
and the note 7 the incredible high
resolution for VR and 360 video coupled
with Samsung's own gear VR make it a
killer powerhouse for multimedia and the
note 7 also got support for mobile than
HDR if you travel quite a bit and going
from country to country it's hard to
find the phone it's gonna work wherever
you go the Nexus 6p is the way to go
first it's got a ridiculous amount of
bands it's old unlocked and it's one of
two phones that support Google's project
Phi which is going to give you
international data anywhere you go a
close runner-up would have also been in
the other Nexus device the 5x
if Nexus devices aren't your thing and
you travel quite a bit you might want to
look at one of the phones and t-mobile's
lineup as well their international data
is also really stellar camera I know is
important to a lot of you've gotten to a
point where almost every camera is good
but still one camera still stands out to
me as the best and that again goes to
Samsung's seventh series of phone so the
s7 s7 edge and the note 7 12 megapixel
sensor might not be the highest
resolution but the pictures look
incredible Samsung software which gives
you manual controls or makes it really
easy for a novice all of that coupled
with their f1 points of an aperture is
one of the most well rounded cameras
I've ever tested a close runner-up
though would have been the camera on
Apple's iPhone 6s plus so what about the
best phone to last two years maybe you
want to spend the money for a premium
phone but you don't want to upgrade
every 6 12 18 months you want something
that's gonna last you two years or
longer look no farther than the iPhone
6s for the iPhone 6s plus all of your OS
allegiance aside Apple currently is the
only manufacturer that makes the
software and the hardware which means
they can make sure the OS gonna be
optimized for whatever future hardware
they might have coming out and Apple has
been really good about supporting
devices two to three generations back
and the best phone for audio I know this
is important to a lot of you should be
no surprise this goes to the HTC 1024
bit DAC high performance amplifiers all
a couple with their boomsound speakers
heck even the earbuds they include in
the Box are hi-def everything about this
phone screams audiophile
if you want a phone for the best audio
experience out of the box go pick up the
latest from HTC do you guys like the
style of video if you do give it a
thumbs up to let us know and we'll
update this every quarter any other
categories you want to see us cover in
upcoming videos let us know down below
in the comments
I hope you guys enjoyed till next time
