welcome back to the lowdown and we've
covered many big leaks on Android phones
here on the lowdown probably the pixel
3xl and the note 9 being the biggest and
though Apple may wish their iPhones
would remain shrouded in secrecy and
told their official launch they are
definitely in no way immune to leaks and
rumors about them flying around online
so let's take one last look at those
rumors kind of compile everything
together about these phones and take one
closer look at everything we know about
these trio of new iPhones before they
become official in just about two weeks
here's the lowdown
so let's start with the basics there's
gonna be three new iPhones announced
this fall a new five point eight inch
update to the iPhone 10 which is gonna
look pretty much identical in design and
build and everything else to the current
iPhone 10 we've got a larger 6.5 inch
plus bottle that's gonna be similar to
the iPhone 10 but it's gonna have a
larger screen and then kind of the wild
card the one that we're most excited to
see this quote-unquote budget 6.1 inch
iPhone with an LCD display that's gonna
be the lower end model but let's cover
the two premium models first this is
going to be an S year for Apple meaning
the design of these new phones is going
to remain largely unchanged from the
current iPhone 10 and most of the new
improvements and changes are going to be
on the inside with the internals both
the 5.8 and 6.5 inch iPhone will have
the more expensive higher-end OLED
displays with that iconic notch still
there but this time it's gonna house
hardware for face ID version 2 which
presumably will be faster to unlock work
in multiple orientations and may being
the key word may even allow for multiple
faces to unlock your phone so that's
still being highly speculated the phones
will retain the glass and stainless
steel design it'll have the Lightning
port on the bottom and the same
vertically stack dual camera system on
the back though that will be getting an
upgrade to this time around like every
year the new iPhones will most likely
feature a faster more powerful and
efficient processor this year it's gonna
be that Apple a12 chip with some kind of
futuristic Bionic sounding name and it
should improve performance and battery
life you don't expect a whole lot more
to change with these new phones or a
whole lot of new features that's kind of
gonna be it we had originally heard that
these two premium model iPhones would
have Apple pencil support so seemingly
take on the no 9 but now we're hearing
that's not gonna happen after some
internal Apple testing dubbed it to be a
poor user experience the big difference
between the two premium models besides a
larger screen and presumably a larger
battery in that larger model is that the
6.5 inch iPhone may be able to run apps
side-by-side in landscape mode the more
interesting of the three iPhone models
is really this new 6.1 inch iPhone it's
gonna sit between the two premium models
as far as size goes but rumors suggested
it's gonna have less premium internals
to make it a lower-priced quote-unquote
budget iPhone in the lineup this x-point
1 inch display will be an LCD panel
instead of the higher an OLED one found
on the two premium models and
rumored to come with face ID version one
tack a single rear camera you'll have a
glass back and will come in a variety of
different colors the phone was reported
to be experiencing some production
issues with some light leakage coming
from the display so it may not ship
sometime in September but maybe push
until October and your reports confirm
this week of that still on track to be
delayed so don't expect this phone to
come out until sometime in October
according to recent reports all these
phones will run the same brand new a12
processor they'll have the same camera
system but the 6.1 inch lower and iPhone
will have a smaller battery less RAM and
that LCD display and not the OLED -
presumably keep costs down and also
worth noting we're hearing that the Plus
model that 6.5 inch version and the 6.1
inch budget model will both come in a
dual sim variant for specific countries
and specific markets about the only
thing we don't know right now is naming
and price it's being reported that
there's some turmoil going on in
Cupertino right now Apple has put itself
in a weird spot for naming with the
iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 so it's gonna be
pretty interesting to see how this all
plays out as for price rumor has it that
the lower end iPhone will be priced
somewhere between $5.99 and $6.99 again
this is Apple's version of budget not
budget budget at the 5.8 inch model may
get a price drop from last year from the
current $9.99 price down to $8.99 while
the larger 6.5 inch model would take its
place with a starting price tag of 999
bucks the event where all of this will
become official is rumor to take place
on Wednesday September 12th pre-orders
should start that Friday September 14th
and the phone should start being
released to the world on Friday
September 21st so what are your thoughts
on Apple's new 2018 iPhone lineup is a
6.1 inch iPhone the sweet spot for
iPhones do you upgrade on the S cycles
or do you wait for the bigger changes to
happen and also are you gonna buy one of
the three iPhone models leave a comment
