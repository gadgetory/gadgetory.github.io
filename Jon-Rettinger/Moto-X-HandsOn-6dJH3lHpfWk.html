technobuffalo and the motive ax is
finally here and we're looking at a
bunch of colors but let's go through the
device itself first it's going to launch
on five major carriers in the United
States that's verizon AT&amp;amp;T tmobile
sprint and US cellular right here we'll
go through some of the features this is
obviously running on AT&amp;amp;T and I think
the first thing you'll notice is that
you can have the customized designs and
that includes everything from these
accents that's anodized aluminum on the
volume controls there in the power
button to the back that's a tad
megapixel camera top that's a 3.5
million the headphone jack and of course
you can change the face this is a white
model but there is a black one floating
around here somewhere let's see to get
final I'll show you in a bit 20 case
you're looking here it's Android 4.2
point2 jelly be really relatively bare
skin you've got the 4.7 inch screen here
720p you've got a Snapdragon s4 pro
under the hood and again the the
software experience here is relatively
bear one of the cool things is the
camera it is a 10 megapixel camera but
check this out power it off if you pull
it out of your pocket you sort of shake
the device 12 twist there we go it
buzzes a little bit and then the camera
launches which is really neat and it has
a google spent a lot of time on the
autofocus so sorry Motorola spent a lot
of time on the autofocus but you can
also of course go in and change the
manual controls or chtr flash touching
the screen so you can focus on a
specific area it's like slow motion
video pinpointing it
and morph and you've got the the
controls are always on the bottom of the
screen there check out messaging so
really just relatively bare skin like I
said another thing is it has this wake
function where if you turn the phone
over we'll just show you the time but
sometimes it will show you text messages
or you know facebook status or something
like that right there you can launch
into one of those alerts by swiping up
typically this one doesn't have a
message on it right now like I said it's
available it's going to launch at the
end of this month on eighteen t Verizon
Sprint t-mobile and US Cellular 199 with
the with 16 years of storage 249 with 32
gigs of storage you can go online to
this moto x maker and customize your
device because otherwise it's going to
come in in black or white at the
carrier's like I said there's a ton of
customizations let's look through some
of these here this one's need you can
see the anodized aluminum around the
camera has been turned to yellow got the
white face but also the yellow accents
on the volume control is there check out
this one this is pure black the carriers
will have a different model it's got a
textured back instead of the beer show
you out these you can see all these
colors right here here's a black faced
with the white back and the silver sides
and a bunch of accessories to match you
can see all these headphones that will
be available as well all its video
you've got the this one's not powering
on any case the nice yellow back you got
the front facing camera there too so
anyway that's a quick look here at the
moto access is Todd Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo stay tuned for a couple
other videos because I want to compare
it to the HTC One a little bit hopefully
the iphone 5 and i'll show you the
portal where you can customize the
colors to how diesel super TechnoBuffalo
