from technobuffalo and this is what are
we up to move the third installment this
little series we're running on tips for
aspiring bloggers and vloggers and tech
reviewers and journalists and and such
and i'm going to try i actually shot
this video a couple times a couple weeks
ago and just it didn't quite come out
right and if you've watching my videos
you know i have a propensity to ramble
on and on and and boots are like I'd
shot like 20 minutes of me just going in
circles so I'm trying it again answering
trying to answer one of the questions
that I get asked most and John everybody
else I know who works in this industry
which is how do you get the products to
review
and there's not a simple answer to it
and also the answer has changed in the
you know 10 or so years I've been doing
this I've been covering yeah I've been
with TechnoBuffalo for about five months
now or so before that I was with
phoneDog for close to five years and
before that actually worked for a
website called powerbook central that
covered APPL related stuff yeah I can
hear all you out there now like I'll see
I told you as a fanboy and before that a
couple of other publications so on the
answer is definitely changed over time
especially as blogs that become more
popular and more and more people are
able to publish their own stuff whether
written or video and you know therefore
have an audience and and then approached
the companies and say hey I want to get
on your reviewers let's head out how do
I do it so here are a few tips like i
can i can give you that that you know
it's not a one two three connected out
to answer about a few tips that i think
are valuable and hopefully will help
first of all i said this before but I'll
say it again you need to just get start
you need to just just whatever you are
interested in covering if it's reviewing
products you need to find a way to start
to get some products to review them
without people giving them to you so you
need to buy them or borrow them or you
know whatever it is or get into covering
stuff that that's sort of like on that
on in the ecosystem of what you want to
cover so if you want to cover
smartphones and you can't find a way to
get them start covering apps start
covering cases you know that kind of
thing and then build up an audience but
you have to do it yourself first when i
first started when i was at powerbook
central i was writing columns and then i
started approaching companies about
doing reviews and eventually got some
stuff headed my way and then eventually
a pair review i did on a pair of
earphones got picked up by gizmodo and
then that really helped and so you just
have to kind of keep at it when i was at
phoneDog i started out i reviewed my
phone and then i borrowed a friend's
phone and that i bought a phone and sold
it i reviewed that one and then i traded
that one on craigslist and a couple
times i bought a phone in a carrier
reviewed it and then
within the 30-day trial period so you
have to just figure out ways to do that
if you don't have the money or if you're
smart and you don't want to spend you
know thousands of thousands of dollars
just to get going because you might do
it for a month or two and decide you
don't like it or not build an audience
or you know might lead you doing
something else so you want to try to not
lay out a ton of money you know right
off the bat if you don't have to that
being said if you're going to buy
something to review be strategic about
it and spend your money on i would say
spend your money on something that you
think is going to get a big audience so
you know as much as i'm going to open it
up for family jokes again there's no
doubt that Apple products get a big
audience whether you know lover items
think they're great think they're not a
review of the brand new whatever it is
the brand new iphone the brand new ipad
you know will get a lot of traffic on
YouTube a lot of traffic on the web it's
almost guaranteed there are some other
products that are like that as well but
not that many so that might be a safe
bet if you have a limited budget and
you're going to spend money on a product
now when we're talking about how to get
stuff for free again first of all
remember we're talking about getting
loners I'm not talking about having
companies send you stuff for you to keep
that does happen once in a while that a
company will offer that if we decide to
keep something for whatever reason we're
bound by our own ethics and also now by
the law to disclose that online but the
vast majority of the things that you see
me reviewing you see now on techna
Buffalo etc are loners especially in the
cell phone industry again so if you want
to get into that a couple of tips one
learn how to present yourself
professionally and i'm not talking about
shaving before you go on camera I'm
talking about writing learn how to write
a good email introducing yourself get
him to the point saying who you are why
the people in the other end should care
spell check it proofread it if you're
not so sure about your writing skills
get somebody else to help you out really
what you can do is you can write the
email your the body of the email once
that talks about who you are and who
your audience is and then you can just
kind of use that and customize it you
know
who you're sending it to make sure to
include traffic stats if you have an
audience if you have subscribers if you
have a website and you have good traffic
if you have a lot of Facebook followers
a lot of Twitter followers you know
whatever it is if you don't have stats
that you think can compete with the
larger outlets look at what makes you
unique maybe you are the president of
you know the AV club at your high school
or maybe you are an independent
consultant who you know does technical
support and advises people on what
phones to buy and you have a bunch of
clients and so you have influenced that
way you know whatever it is find your
unique angle and and sell yourself that
way so you need to you know write a good
email or a couple of them and then go to
the websites of the company you're
interested in look for the press or
media section and find out you know what
the address is a lot of times you'll
have kind of a generic address you know
like press at blah blah blah calm or
something like that that's who you send
it to be very cordial make sure to
include your contact information if you
don't hear from them you know in within
a week let's say follow up but follow up
politely and don't you know you can be
persistent but don't don't overdo it
don't people get these people get emails
you know tons of them a day asking for
free stuff so just be you know be
persistent be polite let them know
you're interested in reviewing but also
say you know you'd like to get on their
press list you'd like to get you know
more information about the products and
and start that way and that leads into
the next thing which is developing
relationships with people is huge so if
somebody does send you something make
sure to say thank you make sure to be
polite I'm shocked in this industry I
mean I can be a jerk sometimes believe
me I know but I'm shocked at how many
stories I hear of people who think that
you know they're just they're rude to
the PR people or whoever it isn't the
other end the media people because they
feel entitled you know I've got a blog
so you have to give me what I want you
know we're people would let you know
treat somebody nice and they're more
likely to treat treat you nicely in
return so you know if somebody does send
you something even if it's just a letter
saying you know thank you for your
interest we can't we've a look at a
number of review devices available but
will you know we'll keep you in mind for
the future
right back to that saying thank you you
know ask them if if there's anything you
could do or if it's okay if you follow
up with them in a month or something
like that the next thing is if you have
the chance go meet these people in
person if there's an event in your town
if you live near you there's going to be
a trade show or you know you're able to
get to somebody like CES or ctia or if
one of the larger sites is having a
reader meetup that kind of thing a lot
of the sites you know have these events
there's a Gidget event in San Francisco
pretty soon you're where I live and a
lot of these events I've done some very
small events and we have sponsors and so
there'll be people from the companies
whether their cell phone companies or
accessory makers or software companies
or whoever it is and you go to these
events and you can meet people and those
oftentimes are the people who you know
or either the media PR people who they
work with those people and then all of a
sudden you've met somebody and once you
meet somebody and you know it's not just
an email it looks like everybody are all
the other emails that you get every day
but you've actually met the person and
you can remember something about them
that goes a long way so if you have that
chance you know get to one of these
events again it doesn't have to be one
of the huge shows you can look for
whatever's going on if there are
usergroups related to you know whether
it's a if it's directly what you're
interested in again if you're interested
in like cell phones and tablets if it's
directly related that great but maybe
its peripheral maybe it's like a flash
developers group and then through that
maybe you can meet somebody who has an
association you know with Adobe because
adobe works with a lot of these cell
phone makers now to put flash on their
phones or you know maybe maybe Google or
you know who knows maybe somebody
related to Apple whatever it is and then
the second thing kind of with that is
back to the whole ecosystem thing you
know even if you're not necessarily
interested in reviewing cell phone cases
and you really want to review cell
phones cell phone cases not only do the
people who make the cell phone cases
often work with the cell phone makers
themselves because in order for a
company like spec to make a phone that's
going to fit the new HTC incredible too
you know they have to be working with
the people at HTC and Verizon to get the
dimensions of
phone and get it right so not only
sometimes might those people know people
who eventually you can meet but also
it's a lot cheaper and easier for a case
maker to give you a twenty-dollar case
to review than it is for a wireless
carrier to give you you know a phone
that retails for six hundred dollars off
contract that also has service on it you
know like they have to there's a
different level of trust going on there
and they just have you know fewer those
to give out then a company might have
cases to give out so you might be able
to get your foot in the door doing
things like that you know doing coverage
on the big devices getting your hands on
them when you can reviewing them when
you can and then in the meantime doing
lots of stuff like cases and apps and
accessories and kind of building up an
audience that way because once you have
an audience then you're able to say to
you know the PR manager at you know
whoever apple or sprint or whoever it is
you're able to say hey look I have this
many subscribers I have you know this
big of a Facebook following I've been on
my local TV news as as the gadget expert
you know whatever it is and when you
have that kind of following then they're
going to say hey you know it actually
would be worth one of our 100 devices to
send out across the country it'd be
worth it to try one of them on this
person because you know she's got a
following on facebook and there's
there's going to be a legitimate return
on investment there so I'm so those are
kind of my basic tips again you know get
started anyway you can first of all ah
be willing to get stuff on your own
don't wait to start getting free stuff
or loaner stuff sent to you find a way
to do it on your own try not to spend
your own money at the beginning if you
have to spend your own money or you want
to spend your own money be very
strategic about it look for something
that's going to get you you know a big
high interest item again you know the
appellate immersion our are Hugh of huge
interest tablets are big right now you
know it but when you're watching this
video if the year from now it might be
different and then definitely the thing
i didn't mention but you have to
self-promote you know once you get if
you get a little bit of a buzz if
something you did gets picked up when I
had that earphone review picked up by
gizmodo years
ago you know I jumped on it and that was
my chance to start hitting you know
sending emails to other companies saying
hey I reviewed these earphones and they
got a lot of buzz and they got picked up
by you know this place in this place I
would love to check out your earphones
to compare them so you know do things
like that and then develop relationships
with people whenever you can other
bloggers other vloggers PR people you
know go out to events introduce yourself
in person whenever you can have business
cards when you meet people in person
write a very professional email
follow-up politely be nice you know
those are the best steps that can give
you and and it's harder honestly than it
was a few years ago because there's so
many more bloggers and video bloggers
out there who are asking for these these
review units I get all the time I get
phone calls and emails from the PR
people i know at these companies saying
hey you know Gino uh Jerry Smith because
we got an email from Jerry Smith saying
that he he worked for you and we
couldn't find his name anywhere there's
all kinds of scams and stuff going on
and so that the people who have the
devices to send out or a little more you
know they have to be they have to choose
more carefully than they used to as well
they should so there's more competition
but there's also you know more
opportunity since blogs have become a
main you know a big force in the media
today and and believe me the PR people
take it seriously they know that you
know it it's less is Noah going to give
it a good review or not then it's what
what's the audience going to say you
know the audience on whatever site is
those are the ones who they really want
to reach they want to reach them you
know through me through John through
whoever it's you guys and girls so
anyway hopefully that's helpful
definitely you know hit us up on
technobuffalo on the video channel over
on social media with more questions and
we'll definitely try to answer them and
I am getting John John to participate
we're going to do like I said we're
going to do a video on some production
tips and techniques I'm gonna try to get
John Q to talk about that because you
know he's got a dlsr he shoots on I
shoot on a little camcorder so he knows
what's up way more than I do anyway till
next time I'm Noah thanks for watching
and good luck just keep at it if you
love
what you're doing find a way to make it
work see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
