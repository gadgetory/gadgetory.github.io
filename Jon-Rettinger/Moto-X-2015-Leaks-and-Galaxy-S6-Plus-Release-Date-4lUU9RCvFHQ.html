Sangin from technobuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup we'll be
talking about the Moto X 2015 the iphone
6s and 6s plus and the galaxy s6 plus
this is rumor roundup let's go ahead and
get started Motorola already confirmed
plans to launch a Moto X 2015 later this
year but now we're getting a first look
at the alleged device total tech claims
to have gone its hands on some photos of
the third-generation Moto X along with a
list of specs for the flagship phone it
turns out Motorola may actually offer
two different versions of the Moto X
2015 the phone will reportedly launched
with a 5.7 inch and 5.2 inch variance
and both will apparently feature a qHD
display a Snapdragon processor 3
gigabytes of ram and stereo speakers the
new device may also be one of the first
new smartphones with a reversible USBC
port hmm USBC in other news the new Moto
X will allegedly be available in wood
leather and plastic along with a new
mysterious material may be metal we
probably still have a few months before
motorola makes the Moto X 2015 official
last year's model was announced in early
September so we're guessing that's when
a new flagship phone will be unveiled as
well the iphone 6s and 6s plus aren't
expected to get much of an upgrade when
it comes to the design but the new
smartphones may still pack plenty of new
hardware a fresh report from Chinese
site Feng claims Apple will include the
latest flagship level displays in its
upcoming iphone lineup according to
anonymous supply chain sources apple
plans to upgrade the iphone 6s to a
1080p panel while the larger iPhone 6s
plus could boast a 2k pixel resolution
that's a pretty big improvement
concerning the current iphone 6 only
offers a resolution of 750 x 1334 while
the iphone 6 plus comes in at 1080p the
report also claims to confirm previous
reports that apple will upgrade both
handsets to a 12 megapixel camera source
from Sony it is possible Apple is
considering these high-end displays but
we're not sure the company will actually
make the switch Apple never really cared
about keeping up with the spec wars that
often drove android phone development
and the current iPhone resolution looks
pretty good as is so we don't think
apple will pack more pixels into the
iphone 6s and 6s plus unless has a very
good reason and the last room over the
day goes to samsung ND galaxy s6 plus
the galaxy s6 plus could arrive way
sooner than expected according to one
new report Italian site HD blog claims
could in vail the super-sized flagship
phone within the next few weeks citing
several reliable anonymous sources the
device will allegedly be a bigger
version of the galaxy s6 edge and Sam
mobile ads that it may come equipped
with a 5.4 or 5.5 inch curve AMOLED
display a Snapdragon 808 processor a 16
megapixel rear camera a 5 megapixel
front facing camera and 32 gigabytes of
storage it apparently won't support
Samsung's S Pen Stylus however and
speaking of which the long-rumored
galaxy note5 is still expected to arrive
later this year at IFA which takes place
every September in Berlin the flagship
phablet is apparently still in
development and could offer either a 2k
or even an insane 4k resolution display
along with a new XE no 7422 octa-core
processor it seems unlikely samsung
would rush out a new device especially
after recently calling the galaxy s6 and
early success it is possible the company
thinks it needs to rush out a direct
competitor to apple's iphone six-plus
though for now we definitely treat these
rumors with suspicion if Samsung does
announce the galaxy s6 plus this month
will have all the news / technobuffalo
calm though we don't really expect any
new high-end devices from Samsung until
IFA kicks off in September anyways
that's it for this episode of rumor
roundup anything that I talked about in
