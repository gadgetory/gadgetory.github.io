technobuffalo here I want to give you a
demonstration of the full flash capable
HTML browser found on the HTC hero
running Android let's go ahead and get
started I'm going to go ahead and unlock
the device and if you're curious about
this unlock screen stay tuned to the
channel for a full you I overview and
i'll show you how all this works go
ahead and unlock slide that down now
here i am on my youtube channel let's
youtube.com / john for lakers and i'll
show you load speed in just a minute but
i want to give you a demonstration of
how the browser works it's probably very
going to be very familiar to most of you
you can pan around with your finger
let's say you want to read some at small
text you can just double tap and it
zooms it and actually rescale the self
which is quite nice if you want to zoom
in even further take advantage of the
multi touch capabilities zoom in and
zoom out actually it's a pretty nice and
relatively fluid implementation and if
you want to zoom out some more you can
double tap and you zoom out to where you
want you can keep zooming on out so gone
is that little magnifying glass in his
multi-touch there's actually quite nice
and a really good implementation so this
also has flash capabilities meaning that
you should be able to play things right
from the browser although as you can see
here my youtube video should be playing
and it's not quite working i found the
flash on this to be sort of gimmicky and
not quite fully functional sometimes
work and sometimes doesn't as you can
see right here on this YouTube page it's
clearly not working let me show you load
speeds and I should mention that I am
just on Wi-Fi this has not come with us
3g stay tuned to the channel i'll be
doing some head to head comparisons with
other phones showing load speeds on
Wi-Fi and even on edge so i'm gonna go
ahead and load up another website here
alright so i've got pocket now all ready
to go this has never been loaded on this
device before i'm gonna go and hit the
big green Go button and it is off using
just Wi-Fi I love being stuck now with
edge speeds I forgot how slow and pokey
edge was I'm so happy to
have 3g in my area unfortunately that
did not make its way out to this device
but at least it does have Wi-Fi so it's
off pocketnow comms loading you've got
that sort of green bar across the bottom
the content is showing up and again I'll
do a full head data comparison with
other devices primarily the iphone so
you guys can see how this works if
you're in the UK your country or this is
released and will support 3g you know
the iphone and sort of similar devices
are probably going to be what you're
going to be comparing so it's almost
loaded so taking a little bit of time
and there we go it's all done and like
we did on the youtube channel you can
pan around zoom in or zoom out and I
should also mention that this has a
built-in accelerometer meaning that as
you rotate the screen it'll rotate
accordingly for you let me show you what
that looks like here and you can see the
speed of it screen sort of goes a little
bit grey and then it rotates a little
bit grey and rotates the speeds not too
bad other speed is mostly a software
thing rotations not too shabby on it and
you can continue to navigate in
landscape mode as you could in other
modes as well you can do this whole
pinch and zoom that I just showed you so
on this channel for example there's a
youtube video and this time it says play
where isn't the last time it didn't so
let me show you what this looks like
when it plays or doesn't play in most
cases we're going to go and hit the play
button right in the middle and curiously
enough it's an HTC hero video that
pocket now calm has loading up so it
doesn't actually play within the browser
it just opens it up which is kind of
curious so there we go it's applying and
again I'll do a demonstration on the
video capabilities of this as well but
you can see that doesn't actually play
within the window like you would expect
like you would find on a typical desktop
experience it does open up another
browser like you will find on other
so guys just say a real quick browse or
overview of the HTC hero I hope you
enjoyed for more on the device be sure
to stick around to the channel youtube
com select John or for lakers or doing
having a hero coverage blowout in the
coming days so definitely stay tuned for
exclusive content including the other
ways and sneak peeks at new videos here
to give me a follow at twitter.com /
john for lakers and to learn more about
TechnoBuffalo make sure you check out
technobuffalo calm and both all those
links will be up in the sidebar I will
see you guys the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
