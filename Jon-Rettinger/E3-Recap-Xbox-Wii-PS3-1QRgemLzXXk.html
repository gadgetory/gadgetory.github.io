with a recap for you of the keynotes
from this year's e3 from Microsoft
Nintendo and Sony so without further ado
let's go ahead and get started microsoft
made a big splash by introducing
something called project natal and that
is full body motion sensing for the
console and the big thing with this was
it's all done without a remote using a
whole really myriad of sensors that
detect your body from head to toe so if
you want to do a driving game kinda like
you're holding the steering wheel if
you're doing a boxing game you actually
punch skateboarding game you turn
yourself sideways really it takes a
controller out of motion controlling and
it executed properly i think really
could push the next generation of
consoles and really set the bar quite
high microsoft also introduced videos
videos playing on demand and 1080p with
almost instant play which is actually
very cool you can now download your
games on demand which is actually very
neat no rentals yet but you can download
games from xbox live right to your
console they only announced 30 titles at
launch but they expect more to be coming
later i think i'd be really fantastic
especially if they can announce some new
releases so day game comes out hit
download and you got it right there I
think it would be nice in conjunction to
if perhaps it came with a voucher to
pick up the hard copy of the game at
gamestop best buy or another brick and
mortar retail center that way really got
two copies of of the game of digital and
a physical copy just my two cents
microsoft also demoed some some new
games but the big announcements were
project natal the game downloads and
1080p so next thing we're going to recap
we will go over sonia's keynote until
you introduce a lot of very interesting
things most of them were actually
hardware-based the introduced first a
new PSP go to the surprise are probably
no one it's a thin slider PSP we
actually this particular model is
completely um vive les
so there's no physical optical drive in
the unit at all you download all your
games from the PlayStation Network and
that certainly seems to be a theme is
downloadable games sort of doing away
with physical media the PSP go does look
very nice it's got bluetooth 16
gigabytes of hard drive space a ton of
other things but the big news is slider
UMD less sony also introduced the new
playstation motion controller which they
clearly showed in poet eck form because
it looked ridiculous it's like a black
bar with a red circle on top it looked
like a strawberry ice cream cone but it
is true one to one motion so as you move
you know your hand over a millimeter or
an inch the cursor on the screen or
wherever you're controlling to move
exactly that much Sony's not expecting
that to come until 2010 much like
Microsoft's not expecting project natal
to come until 2010 but it is nice to
know that all three major game companies
are moving towards motion controls
through they won't be used for every
games up to developers but some games
will have the ability to control it via
motion which is actually quite nice so
some other sony announcements announced
a lot of games a new exclusive from
rockstar called agents some updates to
PlayStation Home really just a lot of
games that showcased in addition to the
new hardware so Nintendo keynotes
actually had a lot of very interesting
things as well the wii motionplus which
is an add-on to the wiimote which
actually enhances its accelerometer
reading abilities from the panel that
attaches to the bottom or the top of
your television screen for again true
one to one motion so again you move it
over a little bit it'll move just the
same some new wii sports games or client
wii resort some updates to the wii fit
calling Wii Fit Plus with some new games
some improved balance boarding really
nothing terribly exciting there but they
did show a lot of new games they showed
a couple new mario games some sides
growing some RPGs to showed a new
metroid game so we're like a classic
Metroid
is not a first-person computer called
other m which is very cool but what was
missing from e3 were price cuts we
didn't see price cuts on any of these
consoles which really was a bit
disappointing certainly component costs
have dropped Nintendo is certainly
making a profit on every console
although they are still selling quite a
quite a bit could've made a bigger
splash I think dropping the price and
Sony certainly the price of a
PlayStation still definitely hurts
coming in at four hundred dollars us
we're also were expecting some
announcement of a PlayStation slim Sony
certainly slims down all their consoles
that did it with the PlayStation 1 did
with the PlayStation 2 and we expect
them to at some point do it with the
PlayStation 3 it was more of a non
announcement certainly but there have
been leaks trying it box design we
didn't see any event under the price
another price cromby Xbox really would
have been nice as well but what are you
gonna do it was very exciting III with a
lot of really cool announcements
hardware and game wise so it really was
very nice for for gamers to know what's
coming up for the rest of this year and
leading into 2010 and I guys just a
recap of III hope you enjoyed leave your
comments down below is what you think of
the announcements are you excited about
anything you're not excited about
anything I do one of the three companies
not announce something that you wanted
like a new zelda game for example for
nintendo very curious to hear what you
guys have to say for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on twitter twitter
com / John for lakers I'll see you guys
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
