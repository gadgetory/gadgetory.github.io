from TechnoBuffalo here you guys know
that I've got a penchant for talking I'm
gonna try and give you a review of the
sidekick 4G for t-mobile in under seven
minutes let's go ahead and get started
give you a real quick refresher of the
specs it's got a 3.5 inch capacitive
touchscreen the resolution of 480 by
1800 weighs five point seven ounces
being powered by Android 2.2 it's got
pretty cool slide-out QWERTY keyboard
it's got Samsung's cortex eight
Humminbird processor same processor
that's powering the galaxy s lines of
phones and it's got a Samsung processor
cuz it's built by Samsung on the back
it's got a three megapixel camera on the
front it's got a VGA camera for video
call alright so let's go ahead and jump
right in with reception this phone does
quite a bit but not gonna make good
phone call it's not gonna be of much use
to you in my xx call tests around
various areas of Southern California
where I'm at I experienced almost
perfect so the first one I've had
perfect reception on not one dropped
call not a pop call quarter is
absolutely fantastic people couldn't
tell if I was on a cell phone or a
landline the transition from 4G to 3G
was not a problem at all and
surprisingly for your speakerphone fans
the speakerphone
works quite loudly on this guy so that
won't be a problem for you alright so
let's go ahead and talk about the design
because it is sort of interesting design
if you've ever seen a previous
generation sidekick this maintains that
form and fuel meaning you've got four
buttons on the corners phone is a bit
awkward to hold up to your ear because
it is a little bit on the thicker side
it's not a thick foam but the design
feels a little bit strange being held up
to your head and it took me about two
days to get used to it'll probably take
you just around the same so the four
buttons here actually found to be
extremely annoying using many Android
device in the past where the buttons are
lined up across the bottom that's what I
was used to I thought that I would get
used to this after four or five days and
I never did so you have your typical
sidekick buttons or there's typical
Android buttons you've got your menu
your back and your
home so you're gonna have to navigate
where those are you also have a new jump
button we'll talk about in just a minute
the button RA continues to annoy with
the power and lock button on the bottom
right hand side of the phone oftentimes
you don't know where it is if you've got
the alignment to the side sort of hard
to tell which way you're holding that
phone which way you're looking at it all
the times I pull out of my pocket I'm
trying to slide the screen up backwards
or looking for a lock button and it just
wasn't there I would have liked it
definitely on one of the ends either the
top or the bottom depending on how you
hare holding the phone something to keep
in mind if something that I got used to
eventually but it really did become a no
mance to me so this jump key that we
talked about is sort of keeping up with
the sidekicks social media and messaging
features of the phone all it allows you
to do is open up shortcut so if I were
to slide is open and I hit the jump
button and it shows you what you can do
here by it the jump button held down a
I'd go right into contacts you can set
all kinds of different shortcuts here
for that jump key it is a nice feature
and something that actually comes up to
play in the lock screen as well when you
unlock the device if you slide it down
you get access to your jump menu
settings so out one more time no you get
access to your jump menu settings
actually slide it up fly it the other
way you'll go right into the phone
itself kind of interesting alright so
let's go ahead and continue the sliding
mechanism on the sidekick we don't have
to swivel out that we've seen on
previous generations what we've got is a
slide out and it's a pretty cool
mechanism that works very very well I
wasn't worried about build quality I did
this thing about 20 30 times in a row
continue to feel solid I didn't have any
sort of dinging noise in the spring or
any sort of looseness that came up when
the screen does pop up were Dill's a
keyboard which is hands down the best
keyboard I have ever tested on any
mobile phone any phone that's come out
in the past probably about two and a
half years I've reviewed about 80% of
them and this is hands down the best
keyboard the keys are spaced nicely at
they're spaced evenly they've got a
great tactile feel to them if you are a
heavy email or texture and keyboard as a
paramount importance to you you are
going to be hard-pressed to find any
keyboard physical or on-screen that is
going to be better than the sidekick for
geez is absolutely amazing the screen
resolution here was kinda blah 480 by
800 screenings look a little bit washed
out but it was okay looking for a
beautiful vibrant screen the sidekick 4G
is not going to be for you speed it was
relatively fast does have the cortex a8
processor in there it is single core but
it's a very capable processor something
that we've seen power like Galaxy has
series of devices so I'm not going to go
into too much detail this one can handle
multitasking can handle HD video without
any problem on the 4G network I got
pretty fast beats them depend on where
you are I got about three point five
megapixels down or three point five
megabits per second rather down this is
by no means a slow phone you're getting
some high-end features and sort of a
lower end s package so you're getting
that cortex a8 hummingbird processor
which is quite nice but you're
sacrificing on the camera department it
takes average pictures at best a through
megapixel sensor you're not gonna want
to use this to become Ansel Adams there
are some OS tweaks as well to the
Android operating system to sort of make
this sidekick s let me go ahead and show
you what those are first you got the
three buttons right here you can jump
right into apps you can see there are
some quick messaging features a lot of
what makes this a sidekick was actually
found in the widgets let me jump right
in and show you some of these and these
are really nice features I'd like to see
make its way to other Samsung build
Android devices so we've got things the
standard once you've seen group texting
here's a really nice feature lets you
text directly to groups and one of the
other features that I really liked
actually it's something called sticky
message if you ever receive the text
with directions in it or a recipe you
know I have to keep referencing back to
messages you can actually sticky that
right to your home screen really a very
nice feature the home screen you've got
options for to move to move the screens
around if you'd like you've got your
typical array of Android screens here
and the response was actually pretty
good battery life was very nice on this
device as well be able to get through a
full day even with live wallpapers
overall this phone definitely is a
worthy worthy phone to be in your pocket
if messaging and email is important to
you if you're looking for an absolute
powerhouse the dual-core and the latest
and greatest specs this is not gonna be
the one for you if you just want a phone
that's gonna work this one is the way to
go I'm John Rhett enjoy from
TechnoBuffalo and this is at 6 minutes
and 49 seconds I'll see you the next
video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
