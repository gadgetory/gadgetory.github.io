Fisker emotion this is the latest
generation of car from Fisker although
it isn't the same company it's now
Fisker inc so that karma that wasn't so
successful yeah this is a different
company altogether so the car isn't
all-electric super sports sedan and it's
rather striking swooping lines big
capsule in the middle with a small trunk
and hood huge wheels and tires crazy
hinged doors this car is full of design
there's still very much a prototype but
Fisker said production plans are aiming
for late 2019 and when it does come the
company states a four hundred mile range
and a $130,000 price tag this definitely
isn't meant to be the cheapest car but
an entry for those still hesitant with
getting electric car if you can afford
and of course now on the inside the
emotions has screens everywhere in the
front and back and in the back seat you
have the option to get this huge monitor
which is probably the biggest I've seen
in any car and you have things like a
glass roof bucket seats in the front and
back the interior overall seemed like a
nice place to be
one interesting touch is the doors when
getting inside I really thought it'd be
a challenge because you have the doors
right above you so you kind of have to
duck down to get in but that's not
really the case you can't stand up
straight and then just get in the car
like normal so even though the back door
has this crazy hinge to open upwards
there's still space to stand up and get
out if the interior doesn't feel the
most spacious but definitely more room
than it seems looking from the outside
but really the story here at least prank
now is design design design the built in
lidar is integrated into the body rather
than just being plopped on the body
lines flowed throughout the car the
trunk swoops up to have an integrated
spoiler the tires stick out in the back
because quote they just look cool
interesting design is everywhere with
this car design isn't everything though
and there's still a lot of questions
about how this car will work and it's
still a long road ahead for emotion but
at least now we have an idea of what to
expect so what do you think about the
Fisker key motion be sure to let us know
down below and also hit the subscribe
button and hit the
notification bill to see when new videos
