to you by netflix what's up everybody
walk back the episode of ask the Buffalo
I am back and i'm your host jon
rettinger you could ask me any question
you've got from the world of technology
whether it's what cell phone you should
get with laptops coming up to us of
personal questions or things about
behind this into technobuffalo this is
the place you can do it and if you want
to ask set questions every tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo calm and put but articles
saying ask your questions and quite
obviously just put them in the comments
or you prefer social media can send it
to me at john for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo ask your question and use
hashtag ask the be so i can find it up
this week we can talk about phone
upgrade choices iphone 6 and Google
glass this is at the Buffalo let's start
asking so our first question comes to
the name Poppins debo I kind of want to
say that again papads debo at John for
lakers asked to be i've never had an
android phone before I currently own an
iphone 5 do you think it's a good idea
to go for the galaxy s5 part of me just
wanted to say ask the commenter see what
they have to say should you trade your
iOS device for galaxy s5 leave it in the
comments if you're asking me I don't
know that's really such a personal
choice iphone 5 certainly will still a
very good phone certainly considered
last Jen's technology if you want to try
Android I'm going to could certainly be
a good choice to go for switch if you
want a bigger screen switch if you want
to go to see information a little more
quickly with the ability to have widgets
do not switch if you're fully ensconced
in the apple ecosystem tend to be quite
a pain to go back and forth really
couldn't be come down to personal
preference do you want to change i've
been using iOS for a while I want I
something fresh then yeah give it a shot
see if you like it I've really just sort
of want something new then you might
want to wait to see what Apple comes out
with for the iphone 6 you know to see if
maybe that might be a good choice so
really answer for you is I don't know
it's gonna be your decision speaking of
iphone 6 user at Travon s at john for
lakers win d expect apple to release the
iphone 6 and wait
gonna have to do with it to compete
against Samsung well I think we're going
to see a similar release cycle though
we're conflicting reports that we might
see the iphone 6 way way early as early
as May or June I think though we're
going to see the iphone 6 come out
sometime in August September usually
traditional timeframe fingers crossed
we're going to see a bigger version
either 4.5 at 4.7 even is crazy a rumor
that it might be 5.5 inches even though
that wasn't your question I'm just
excited for it I probably say maybe
early q4 into q3 I'll be when we'll see
the iphone 6 I want take a minute to
thank our friends and sponsors at
Netflix I have a Netflix problem I've
been watching so much netflix i think
i've got some of the best original
programming out there we've been
binge-watching on house of cards orange
is the new black season two is coming
back on you should check out netflix you
can get it on almost any platform most
phones and tablets all the consoles your
we use your xbox as your Playstations
get netflix you really just should do it
right now stop watching the video go to
netflix.com slash buffalo to get your
free 30-day trial you're missing out on
some awesome Emmy award-winning content
again that is netflix.com slash buffalo
head back to the video next question
comes from the website the appropriately
named techno lover I hope that's because
you have a love of Technology not like
you're literally a techno lover asks hey
I got offered by google to use glass
should i wait for the consumer version
instead so Google glass you could
essentially beta tested for fifteen
hundred dollars that is really really
really expensive so assuming Google
didn't offer you a free pair of Google
asked if they did did yes absolutely
take it I think at this point you're
probably better off waiting Google ass
has been around for quite a while now
during the second iteration I would
assume that they're probably getting
closer to a consumer release version
which hopefully will have a much much
much lower price point if though you
like to be on the cutting edge you want
to wear is Brandon wrestle calls a face
computer google glass certainly I think
still the best out there it's very very
much still in beta the utility of it is
still to be determined but I say hold on
g for 300 bucks invest it put it in the
bag under your mattress save it and
probably keep half of it for the
consumer version keep the other half to
buy yourself some nice by your mom
something nice
and you should probably call it too it's
been been way too long thank you guys

Buffalo I hope you guys enjoyed I am
