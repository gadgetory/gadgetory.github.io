of new things some good some bad but new
phones are coming and there's a company
that needs a hit right now it's Samsung
and the Galaxy s8 is coming sometime in
the March April timeframe so in
preparation for its announcement and
ship date the phone that I can't wait to
see I figured I would count down the
eight things to expect about the Galaxy
s8 you've had a litany of rumors coming
out over the past few months think we've
got a pretty good sense but the phone is
allegedly going to be these you're not
particularly where I just number them
because if numbers are fun so number one
almost bezel list design on the sides
the top and bottom this thing is going
to look like almost a screen in your
hand even Samsung themselves leaked a
picture that shows almost just screen
with a I need a little bezel on the top
and the bottom get in my get my hand
come unit number two two different sizes
we've had a ton of different rumors
ranging from five point one to five
point seven things need to be settling
down at a maybe five point one and a
five point five to five point seven inch
larger galaxy guest eight dubbed the
Galaxy S 8 Pro so it should have two
different sizes the actual screen sizes
themselves though have been all over the
board but whether you want a smaller
phone or a bigger phone looks like
Samsung is going to have you covered
commit number three and this one's true
is probably think the most exciting a
totally hidden home button so because
the bezel on top and the bottom are
getting really thin Samsung's
traditional place into their home button
kind of right in the middle of a phone
it's going to be totally gone allegedly
Samsung's gonna use technology from the
synaptic it's actually in bed I guess
the home button of sorts directly into
the screen so you place your finger
right on the screen it would read your
thumbprint and unlock your device which
is really freaking cool can't wait till
maybe the Galaxy S nine actually see the
cameras Bilt's behind the screen that's
a really new technology that's gonna
allow Samsung it's actually you software
for the home button to go home in the
back and multitasking I don't think
we're gonna see a home but on the back
like LG and others have done I think I
think it's gonna be the screen just
pretty damn cool can we number four meet
Bixby Bixby is a brand new AI from the
same company of that design Siri I start
gonna compete with Cortana obviously
Siri and even Google's own
Google assistant it's gonna be pretty
advanced a gaya from what we hear and
there might even be a separate button
that's going to pull up Vic's feet how
it's gonna be used to sort of up in the
air you've even heard rumors that it's
gonna be able to search the photos just
by using your voice so I guess they find
pictures of Evander Evers and a little
search for pictures of him and we
integrated with Samsung's hardware which
would be kind of cool to see coming at
number five something you'd expect from
Samsung awesome cameras most recent
rumors have Samsung sort of following
the trend and putting dual cameras on
the back the megapixel a Joe has been a
bit all over the board we've heard eight
and twelve night that's a sensor before
12 and 13 April sensors on the back so
don't know but there will be two
allegedly on the back well the coolest
things about the cameras for the s8 I
think it's going to be on the front
according to et News Samsung's
essentially bringing the camera module
from the s7 and just smacking it on the
front of the s8 and if that seems a
little far-fetched it should at least
have the really quick autofocus thing
that we saw with the s7 so your selfie
is there any picture that you want to
take holding your hand up farther than
you should I should look absolutely
awesome on the upcoming SI Kobe number
six this should be no surprise blazingly
fast will be rocking at least in the US
a Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540
GPU so gaming should be honest on
performance should be incredible
we're also hearing six to even eight
gigs of RAM I'm this thing to make it
hum along don't know how the 35 is going
to handle power sometimes Qualcomm
processors sit power and every
generation or so you'll get one that
just eats it all so hopefully it's it's
the former not the latter and battery
life is going to pretty damn good here
number 7 USB see we haven't seen the USB
see on any of the Galaxy S line of
phones we first thought the view on the
now-defunct - note 7 so expect us be
seeing a USBC stuff to come with it
including support for quick charging and
a beret this one a little
tongue-in-cheek expected - to not smoke
and explode because Samsung knows it I
know it you know what they're gonna have
to deal with a ton of negative press and
people leaving comments on YouTube
videos being like when is it going to
explode and smoke I would wager that
Samsung tested this thing more than any
other phone to make sure not only is it
not going to smoke not going
to explode but it's not going to have
any other problems that could plague
smartphones things like a reception from
oddly placed antennas or how you hold it
but foam that's going to be very well
packaged and probably very durable as
well so you have it there are eight
things to expect about the Galaxy s8
eight seemed like a good number I could
have added a few more like waterproofing
and some others I thought hey if it
makes sense to me
I need features you think are so
far-fetched - not gonna happen if I
would pick one that seems the most
far-fetched it's a synaptic technology
where the screen is actually a
fingerprint sensor the Samsung does like
to push the boundaries of technology so
let's see I'm hoping I'm hoping that
there's not be that much bloatware
Samsung Verizon or carrier otherwise
just reduce the bloatware to get us
close to Android as we can and for the
pure an adulterant Android was some of
the nice additions that Samsung has and
that would be a happy camper what do you
guys want to see leaving the comments
down below
