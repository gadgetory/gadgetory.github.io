compared the CPUs and the PS read Cell
processor came out on top after four
round the score is two to one for the
PlayStation 3 and this time around we'll
be taking an in-depth look comparing the
GPUs this is going to be the single most
technical round in this series of videos
so put on your thinking caps and get
ready for some heavy weight game console
action its LP from TechnoBuffalo
and welcome to the next installment of
the console wars the processor may be
the power that drives both machines but
when it comes down to graphics the GPU
is equally as important the graphics
processing unit is essentially the piece
of hardware that converts all those ones
and zeros into actual gameplay graphics
and the more ones and zeros that can
push the higher of the resolutions the
effects and frame rates it can handle
spec wise you can notice that the GPUs
on the devices come from competing
manufacturers ATI and NVIDIA the
competition between ATI and NVIDIA has
been going on since long before the
current console war but that's another
story
the xenos GPU on the Xbox 360 is of
custom ATI design the core is clocked at
500 megahertz and the chip has 48 shader
pipelines with a unified shader
architecture shader architecture is very
important when it comes to GPUs to
simply explain what shaders are well
shaders are computer programs that
determine the final look of what you see
on the screen shaders take rendered 3d
objects made out of polygons and make
them look more realistic
so shaders turn something looking like
this into this shaders can be divided
into pixel shaders and vertex shaders
pixel shaders alter lighting color and
surface of each pixel and vertex shaders
basically connect those pixels together
in 3d space now shader pipelines are
essentially the highways on which the
data travels and the more lanes on the
highway the less of a chance there is of
traffic bottlenecking so the Xbox 360
GPU has 48 pipelines that can be used
for both pixel shader and vertex shader
operations the xenos GPU on the Xbox 360
was among the first modern GPUs to use
unified shader architecture
the PlayStation 3s GPU the RSX is also
clocked at 500 megahertz but it has
dedicated pipelines for different shader
operations 24 pixel shader pipelines and
8 vertex shader pipelines so basically
the Xbox 360 GPU has a bigger shader
processing highway with quite a lot more
lanes to make an example the ps3 cannot
get more than 24 pixel pipelines at any
given time while the Xbox 360 GPU can
access up to 48 pixel pipelines
depending on what's needed so if there's
a bottleneck on the ps3 system it can
probably be located right around these
parts
there are some benefits to having
dedicated pipelines but the fact that
both graphics card manufacturers have
now transitioned over to unified
architecture tells a pretty clear story
unified architecture is clearly the way
to go
let's possibility of bottlenecking and
overall higher maximum bandwidth so the
Xbox 360s xenos GPU is superior when it
comes down how many shader operations is
capable of handling which may be one of
the reasons why multi-platform 360 games
have better frame rates compared to
their ps3 counterparts but if you guys
watch the previous round where I covered
CPUs you may remember that the Cell
processor could handle vertex
calculations and it can actually
decrease the workload of the GPU which
make this comparison even trickier and
obviously because we don't have any
benchmark applications for game consoles
it's impossible to make scientific
comparisons here the xenos chip is
actually divided into two GPUs the main
die and the daughter die which has ten
megabytes of edie ram built in the
embedded dram has a self processing
memory controller which makes it
possible for the xeno chip to use anti
aliasing and alpha blending without
taking a hit to the framerate Eliason is
essentially jaggies that occur on
diagonal and curved lines
alaya singh is most prominent on lower
resolutions so the lower the resolution
you have the more anti-aliasing you will
need while 720p is considered a high
definition it's in my opinion not a high
enough resolution to run without any
anti-aliasing most of you PC guys can
definitely relate if I look at a game on
my 40 inch LCD screen running at 720p
without proper anti-aliasing it's going
to be quite rough around the edges and
some of you guys may note that a large
amount of games on both consoles are
actually running in sub-8
dear resolutions and upscale to 720p
which makes the need for good anti-icing
even more necessary for example hallo
ODST is running at 640 p and modern
warfare 2 is actually running at a 600 p
resolution in upscale to 720p may become
next generation of consoles will see all
games running at native HD resolutions
but not this time around anyways if you
want to see a good example of the lack
of anti-aliasing take a look at any game
on the Nintendo Wii and you'll know what
I'm talking about
ok back to business so thanks to the
daughter die with embedded dram the Xbox
360 games generally have better
anti-aliasing which I consider a
significant advantage I am myself have a
40 inch screen which I look at from a
fairly short distance and when comparing
the same games on the competing consoles
the graphics on the 360 stand out as
cleaner and sharper because the diagonal
and curved lines are cleaner and less
jagged now if the ps3 were running games
at 1080p as a once promised
anti-aliasing would not be as necessary
but on 90% of games on the market today
the xbox360 counterparts have superior
anti-aliasing which I hold in very high
regard
but the GPU on the ps3 has a very
significant advantage which relates
directly to the Cell processor the RSX
GPU has a high bandwidth interface
between the Cell processor and the GPU
itself so it could hand over some of the
graphics processing operations for
example vertex calculations over to the
Cell processor freeing up the RSX GPU to
exclusively handle other essential
graphics processing tasks Naughty Dog
has done this with uncharted 2 and been
able to crunch out amazing graphics out
of the ps3 with decent anti-aliasing to
match another thing that greatly affects
graphics are textures the higher the
resolution the more high detailed
textures you will need so if you have a
game running at 1080p you're going to
need very high detailed textures to
match but straight off the bat I'll go
out to say that neither of the two
consoles are capable of running games
natively at 1080p with high detailed
textures matched the only games you'll
see running at 1080p with a constant
framerate will be racing games and
fighting games that use very simple
reoccurring textures so in my opinion is
better to run games at 720p and have
high detailed textures than to run games
at 1080p with fuzzy and low-res textures
even though the trailer for the upcoming
1080p
God of War three looks amazing I have to
admit that the textures look a bit soft
and I'd rather see it running at 720p
with high detail textures like uncharted
2 to have a lot of high detail textures
on the screen at once you need to have
quite a lot of fast memory that's
dedicated to the GPU and a fast access
to that memory both consoles have an
equal amount of memory but the xbox360
has a unified architecture and the
PlayStation 3 has two separate sets of
memory half of the ps3s memory is
superfast xcr Ram which gives the ps3
some speed benefits in certain
situations but in most situations it's
going to be harder to take use of two
separate memories for things like
textures but when it comes down to
memory it's pretty clear that both
platforms have a slight bottleneck in
their hands
PC GPUs these days have one to two
gigabytes of dedicated memory and I
would imagine it being quite tough to
squeeze out ultra high textures out of
512 megabytes when you have an operating
system running in the background and
this is where texture streaming comes to
play
as you know blu-ray discs have five
times the capacity of DVDs which give
the ps3 huge benefits there's more space
for high res textures and very little
need for the compression of those
textures this equates to the amazing
hide until world you see in uncharted 2
the ps3s GPU gets off easy as it does
not need to devote power into texture
decompression now the Xbox 360 GPU has
its work cut out for it
it has decompressed textures that are
stored on limited space DVDs but if we
look at games like Gears of War 2 we
notice that the Xbox 360 GPU is
excellent at texture streaming even
though it has a bunch of V compression
to do so the Xbox 360 GPU has a bigger
workload and still manages to pull it
off with style so even though it may be
possible to run higher resolution
textures on the ps3 than the Xbox 360
it's mostly thanks to blu-ray and the
cel processor not the GPU but in any
case all the evidence points in ps3's
GPU being a bit weaker than magazine O's
on the Xbox 360 the essentially free
four times multisample anti-aliasing on
magazine O's definitely tips the scales
pretty fast for the Xbox 360 the cel
processor may compensate for the weaker
GP on the ps3 but is pretty clear that
the Xbox 360 gets a point in this round
to recap the ps3 has a better processor
and faster memory but the Xbox 360 GPU
is superior thanks to its advanced
architecture but as you know graphics
are usually more than just some of the
parts of the different hardware and in
the upcoming round we'll be taking an
in-depth comparison of the best-looking
game
of exclusive and multi-platform on the
Kathina consoles
