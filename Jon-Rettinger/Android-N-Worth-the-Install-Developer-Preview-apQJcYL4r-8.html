from TechnoBuffalo here we've been
covering Android and ever since Google
took the wraps off its very first alpha
release it's one thing to talk about
hypothetical situations talk about new
features that they've added like call
blocking new emoji new quick settings
and a ton more but it's a totally
different thing to talk about actually
using it now I've been using the third
beta of Android and on my 6p for the
better part of five days I want to share
my experiences talking about it a lot on
Twitter be getting a ton of questions so
they answer your questions everything
you guys wanted to know about Android
and this is a question I got more than
anyone else
I'm battery life has been ok it's about
10 to 15 percent worse than what I had
on marshmallow but don't take it as a
sign of Android and not be good for
battery life make that more of a sign is
just a third beta and they're bound to
be memory leak issues and that's all
despite things like doze on-the-go and
projects felt being built into Android
and what time it comes to release I
expect value like to be much better than
marshmallow but least for right now if
you're considering putting it on your 6p
are the Nexus device be aware battery
life will not be as strong as it was
with an official build of Android this
seems to be one of the biggest problems
with the third build of Android and I've
definitely had those problems I've had
issues with the connecting to my car
I've had a repair it reconnected no
issues at all looking to Android wear if
that's something that's important to you
and definitely there have been some a2dp
issues at all what song is not coming
over or metadata not coming over with
those songs so Bluetooth seems to be a
little bit wonky you can work around it
but it's far from perfect at least right
now I've actually been really impressed
with stability it seems to be very good
I've had some third-party app crashes
which sort of is known to happen a
snapchat's but a little bit wonky for me
I can't get my key though a panic smart
lock I don't even install on device
rather than that it's been like 95
percent really solid and running very
fast and with not that much app crashing
at all so thinking about trying it it's
not the worst idea you tell us for sure
I think it's a farce what Google's
trying to say about picked a name
they've already said they're gonna pick
the name anyway for you to find print on
that it's gonna be tutela I'm just you
heard it already here first what the
window has been nice I'm not using it oh
and often it's been one instance where
it's been really nice to have doesn't
work every app so bear that in mind
right now hopefully as more versions of
the beta
I'll have more compatibility but it's
nice and it works as advertised
see most updates will not make it to the
16 the 5 X R an article about it last
week
so sort of a complicated answer but
boils down to partitions Google's gonna
need a small partition on your device to
install it on the background wave
another live partition which is what
you're actually using and the 16 of 5x
don't do it out of the box
I'd expect next should Android devices
though of course to enable seamless
updates this appear to be any snappier
at all the marshmallow but it does
appear to be at least as snappy as
marshmallow which is surprising for Veda
it's been really solid really responsive
and overall working pretty well so just
my experience as an Android insofar as
more betas come out and you guys have
more questions I'll do a Pyxis video
anything you guys want to know even a
comments down below hit me up at twitter
hit me up at snapchat any of the social
ways you can get ahold of me and I will
try to answer anything you want to know
about Android and boils down to this
though you've been waiting to install
Android n on your 6p or 5x your pixel C
now something a good time to do it it's
been really stable it's my only phone
I've been using things didn't seem to be
working like 90% of the way the battery
life has not been as good as I would
have hoped that's to be expected for a
beta and it's far better than most bands
I've tested in the past at all so as far
as betas are concerned
thumbs up for Android n get installing
keep comments down below with the next
time
John render can TechnoBuffalo like its
kind of videos the subscribe button
girls appreciate it I'll see you guys
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
