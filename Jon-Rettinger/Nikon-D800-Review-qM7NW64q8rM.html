market and in my hand is one of the
reasons why hi I'm Mike Perlman
photography editor of TechnoBuffalo comm
today I'm going to review the Nikon d800
is the Nikon d800 one of the new high
water mark setters find out in my full
review since 2008 the canon eos 5d mark
ii has ruled the roost in the world of
versatile full-frame DSLR s professional
photographers and videographers flocked
to the mark ii for its superb still
image quality and HD video quality
approximately six months later Nikon
released the d700 and while it was a
critically acclaimed DSLR for still
shooting it lacked a video mode so it's
safe to say that Nikon has been living
in Canon shadow for the past four years
but the tides have indeed changed as
2012 brings us the nikon d800 the d800
brings some crucial upgrades to the
table first off we have full HD video
recording and nikon has somehow managed
to triple the resolution of the d700
sensor and the d800 offers 36 megapixels
so let's get crackin and talk about the
d800 s design architectural II there are
a few things to be excited about with
the new d800 most notably the dual card
slots yes the d800 can host an SD card
and a CF card and when one card is maxed
out it'll automatically spill over to
the other if you're in the middle of a
video clip the video will stop and start
a brand new clip on the other card also
we have this nifty new live switch here
we could switch between video and photo
mode to give us a more accurate preview
of what we're really going to record the
d800 has a slightly larger 3.2 inch LCD
screen with a 921 k display that's the
same resolution as the d700 so don't
expect much of a difference I was a big
fan of the 100% coverage optical
viewfinder particularly because I could
use virtual horizon meters and grid
displays now as far as an interface this
is a prime example of what an interface
should be on a digital camera
particularly the 8 way directional pad
is just so easy to press everything is
just one button press and a command jog
away selecting and executing manual
controls and adjustments was Flash
Gordon fast the menus are intuitively
laid out it was so easy for me to get
acclimated so as far as an interface on
an advanced DSLR one of the best I've
ever seen
now four terminals the d800 has mic and
headphone jacks and that's going to come
in handy for video mode also we have a
USB 3.0 so we have the high speed and we
have an HDMI mini out the mini outs
going to come in handy for streaming to
an external monitor while you're
recording video and we also have your
standard 10 pin connector and flash sync
terminal now one thing to note about the
new d800 is that it relies on the new en
il-15 battery pack which means you can't
use the d700 batteries if you're
upgrading from that camera also the
battery life has a lower rating than the
d700 the d800 can shoot 900 shots and
the d700 was cleared for 1,000 but of
course a Nikon is making a battery grip
for this I looked it up it's about $450
now as far as the d800 S body weight
goes it's about 3.3 ounces less than the
d700 but don't let that fool you it's
still a cinder block especially with
this giant 24 to 70 millimeter NIC or
that Nikon sent me I much would have
rather had the 14 to 24 that I tested
with the d700 but it's not a perfect
world
now let's discuss features the d800 has
the same Nikon advanced multicam 3500 FX
sensor module with TTL phase detection
as found on the d700 the camera even has
the same amount of maximum AF points at
51
but now the d800 has face priority in
photo and video mode and it has a 3d
tracking AF mode which adds new focus
points while tracking subjects in terms
of AF and servo AF this thing was a
speed racer it was blazing fast now one
of the big features about the Nikon d800
is something you'll find on the
company's other DSLR is even down the
price range is that it has full-time AF
another thing about DSLRs in full time
AF and live view is that it's not as
smooth as a dedicated video camera so
even though the Nikon d800 was one of
the best full time
F performers I've ever seen I still
prefer a video camera because it's
silent you don't get those grunts and
groans from the camera now exposure on
the d800 has been improved a bit with a
new TTL metering system with a ninety
1000 pixel RGB sensor although the
maximum ISO range on the d800 has
remained the same from the d700 at
twenty-five thousand six hundred we now
have a new low ISO at ISO 5000 feet is
the same as the D 700 with a 30-second /
bulb all the way up to a 1/8 thousandth
of a second one thing I notice about the
auto ISO on the d800 is that the camera
defaults to lower ISO settings then I
would have elected four so what I
recommend is manually setting the ISO
especially indoors now of course the
d800 has other specialty features such
as an HDR mode but I thought it wasn't
really that necessary especially because
there was great bracketing exposure
bracketing that I could have just
bracketed and thrown all the images in
Photoshop and done my own HDR images but
you could also do things like white
balance active d-lighting and flash
exposure compensation bracketing which
is pretty handy now one thing to note
about the d800 is continuous mode it has
a max continuous mode of 4 frames per
second which is one less than the d700 s
five frames per second on the other end
of the scale this camera has time lapse
and time interval shooting and it's
capable of multiple exposures at up to
10 layers so that's pretty impressive
as far as white balance control is very
straightforward you have your manual and
your presets there was also custom
Kelvin control and you could do it down
to the degree which I thought was great
of course the d800 would not be added
under without vignette control advanced
noise controls at high ISO levels and an
auto distortion control but I pretty
much kept all of those in neutral to
give this thing a balanced evaluation
now let's talk about the flash before we
get to image quality the flash the
built-in flash on the d800 I actually
was really impressed with it I know a
lot of pros out there are going to put
their $500 speedlights on this thing
that's totally fine I recommend doing
that but if you really need a quick fill
flash the d800 pop-up did a pretty darn
good job and the only thing about a
built-in flash with the 24 to 70
millimeter lens that Nikon gave me is
it casted a pretty hefty shadow so I had
to back up and zoom in if I was going to
do any flash shooting and now it's time
for the most important part of the
review image quality and in order to
demonstrate that right now I'm using the
d800 to film this segment and the rest
of the review so from here on out we're
rolling with the d800 now first let's
talk about this beast sensor Nikon
stuffed a 36 megapixel full-frame
fx-format CMO sensor inside which is
triple that of the d700 resolution
images could be captured in RAW JPEG or
TIFF and the average raw size was 50
megabytes and the average JPEG size was
22 megabytes now if you have an 8
gigabyte card and you shoot at full
resolution full quality you're going to
get about 100 shots fortunately my
friends over at SanDisk sent me an
Extreme Pro 64 gigabyte SDXC card in all
my years of testing I've never had any
problems with the SanDisk
I always rely on SanDisk now I tested
the d800 in a variety of locations and I
was amazed by the detail and clarity
with the triple pixel count colors and
dynamic range were fantastic but the ISO
performance was the best I could shoot
at ISO 6400 with great results even the
higher ISO values like 12,800 were
impressive and thanks to the high
resolution sensor I was able to shoot at
higher ISO s and scale the images down
for reduced noise effects now when you
stack raw versus JPEG the RAW files
definitely are higher quality I found
colors to be more vibrant detailed to be
sharper and images to possess a higher
level of clarity I shot in RAW
throughout the entire testing phase and
I was super impressed the d800 as far as
still images one of the best in the biz
but perhaps one of the most highly
anticipated features on the d800 was its
1080p HD video I shot exclusively in 24
frames per second and 30 frames per
second and I was extremely impressed by
what I found
but overall the d800 HD video quality
could be considered for film and
commercial work thanks to its superb
image quality I also love the fact that
I could shoot with full manual
adjustment including shutter speed
aperture and ISO range low-light
performance is very impressive although
when I tested it in extreme dark
environments I did
I noise so that's something to consider
and also keep in mind that when you
compare the video quality from the d800
to its stills
there's really no comparison with the
video quality you find that the colors
are not as vibrant and I stumble across
a few more a patterns it's also a bit of
shutter lag when it comes to motion but
this was to be expected as currently
there's no DSLR that matches it's still
quality with its video quality now let's
talk about the d800 audio situation I
really like the built-in stereo
microphone I thought it performed pretty
well however you're going to want to go
for an external microphone but one thing
I noticed about the 3.5 millimeter audio
jack was that when I plugged my
microphone in the floor noise increased
so kind of have this hissing background
sound I think that's something that's
characteristic of DSLRs and external
audio if you're really serious about
audio if you want pro audio get a Beach
Tech XLR grip adaptor and Bob's your
uncle so now it's time for the buffalo
call with a nikon d800 it's awesome for
the full review go to TechnoBuffalo comm
until next time I'm Mike Pearlman keep
snapping folks
