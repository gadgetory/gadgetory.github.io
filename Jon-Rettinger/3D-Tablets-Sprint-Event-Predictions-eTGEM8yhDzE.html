technobuffalo here today is Monday
februari seventh day we have a sprint
keynote event this evening in new york
city of course the TechnoBuffalo staff
will be at the event covering it live I
thought it could be fun to recap some of
the rumors what we can't expect then
I'll do a video post show and see how
right or wrong I was about what sprint
is promising so they are assuring us of
an industry-first david blame you'll be
performing on stage the magician
trickster guy the advertisements the
invitation for the events to see what
sprint has up its sleeve so rumors
recently have surfaced of two phones in
particular first the HTC arrived it is a
windows phone 7 device which certainly
you've seen in the past but there have
not been any cdma windows seven phone
devices perhaps or industry-first is
just going to be windows phone 7 with
wimax which is sprint's 4g technology
which they use they partner with clear
also rumors of a phone call to kyocera
echo an android device not that much
known about it right now i think two
things we can be certain of one we're
going to hear android used a lot and
number two nobody really has any idea
the promising industry first you know
perhaps we'll see some sort of 3d
technology there have been rumors of 3d
phone displays and 3d tablets coming out
for a while perhaps prince is going to
get their head in the tablet game beyond
the playbook announcement that came out
just around CES simply really
interesting to see what they do sprint
was surprisingly absent from CES really
wasn't showing very much enjoying things
very new it was especially evident
considering what 18 she was showing with
all the 4g devices when verizon was
doing with their 4g network and what
t-mobile was doing with their 4g network
all three of the four major carriers the
exception of sprint were really vocal at
CES so hopefully it's going to be spritz
time to shine for those of you out there
that are sprint
fans are looking to switch and they are
going to watch this event very carefully
I would expect 3d and tablets to feature
very heavily into this sprint event all
right guys we will see be sure to stay
tuned to technobuffalo for full coverage
of the event we're actually going to be
live blogging from inside of the keynote
which is going to be kind of neat so hit
the link down below to go over to the
live blog page and to at least get ready
to watch the event and we'll be doing
live obviously updates hence the live
blog depart be sure to check it out one
of a ton of video coverage as well
showing whatever it is sprint announces
I'll look to you what you guys have to
say leave your comments down below i'm
