technobuffalo here since i unbox the
adamo XPS a few days ago the biggest
question that I've had is how does
typing work on a laptop such a unique
design so I'm going to show you how
typing works when you're sitting at a
desk when you're sitting in a chair that
on your lap and you're sitting it's a
couch relaxing how tight me is going to
work on a computer with a very different
take on the keyboard so let's go ahead
and get started okay so here we are at
your standard desk configuration sitting
in a chair of regular height without a
significant economic aspect to it just a
regular chair at a standard desk we're
going to open up the laptop you'll
immediately see that raised area across
the bottom while sitting at a desk
typing is actually very easy and it
feels a little bit less stress on the
wrists I've had a battle a bit of carpal
tunnel in the past I'm actually found
that breather ergonomic keyboards that
are split or I'm tapping on the laptop I
generally use a stand that actually
raises it similar to how this is typing
for here is actually very comfortable
the keys you can see our metal capped so
you're sitting at a desk with overhead
light actually almost reflects off the
key so it's a little bit hard to see
what the numbers or letters are but as
far as typing experience from a desk
goes it's actually a very pleasant
experience it is really quite nice now
because of this unique design you don't
get that much room at the screen goes
back it's about as far as going to go in
the center of gravity seems a bit off
its supposed to send her laptop work
centered here it's a little bit weird I
was worried that I was going to knock
this thing over so if I tip this and
you're hitting in this Rosie walking or
as you're typing whatever it might be
you can see it is going to tip but it's
actually not going to tip over it's
going to come right back down so right
about there is where it's centered and
it's going to go over you can knock it
relatively far before it would fall down
on the monitor despite its weird
appearance now it's actually relatively
stable when it's on a desk surface it's
got these little feet on the bottom
right there you can see a little bit of
rubber I sort of keep it set and not
moving which
really counterintuitive I would expected
that a laptop like this would have had a
lot of movement to it but typing on a
desk is actually very pleasant let's
take a look at how this works if you're
sitting at a chair similar where I'm
sitting right now and you want to use it
on your lap okay so here we are sitting
in to the same regular chair with the
laptop on my lap it's actually quite
easy to type I would have been worried
that again it was going to fall over but
even with I'm bouncing my knees the
computer is not falling forward it
definitely is a little bit of a shake
too and it's not a stable as a standard
laptop but it's not going to fall
forward with just standard leg emotion
even as you type it still stays pretty
stable and there's any flex on the
bottom either which is pretty impressive
for a laptop of this thin so we're
sitting at a caer typing on your lap is
actually going to work quite well if you
cross your legs for example when you're
typing that's where you run into a bit
of issue because there's enough room for
the thing to stay stable so if you're a
lady who typed your legs cross or a duty
tuxedo legs crossed you're gonna have a
bit of trouble you can still type with
it like this but it can wobble just a
little bit let's go ahead and check out
how this works reclining on a couch or a
chair so I oftentimes like use my laptop
sitting right here on my couch just
relaxing watching a movie or while I'm
watching the game like to catch up on
some emails let's see how the adamo XPS
works well sort of reclining back so
again you gets her the same experience
you had while sitting on the chair it is
surprisingly stable and actually a bit
comfortable because of the raised edges
you get a bit more ergonomic typing now
there is a bit of wiggle sort of up and
down its supposed to standard laptop but
it's nothing bad I think I could
definitely get used typing with this on
my lap so I've had the past few days
this is actually position I've use it
the most in and I found it to be
relatively comfortable so a lot of
people much like myself have a recliner
they're like to use a laptop this way
let's see how this works as well and it
sort of becomes a bit different when
you're almost at a horizontal position
the laptop I found the edges of it
almost fall off the sides of my legs
they can get have a little bit of wobble
when I'm sitting up not a bunch of an
issue but I'm reclined all the way back
and have a bit of a wiggle but nothing
that would prevent me from typing on it
again you can see that area at the
bottom of the downward facing speakers
sits pretty nicely on your lap I was
actually quite surprised when you're
laying back like this if you tap it you
can see really how far you have to hit
for to fall forward on the screen comes
right back almost all the way down
that's the point where it starts to fall
forward so if you're concerned about
using the adamo XPS you're worried about
the keyboard how it would work in
certain situations like I definitely was
the concern to really fortunately don't
have much merit the laptop works pretty
well on your lap despite really only
having a small area at the bottom to
rest on your legs but it does work
nicely and again surprisingly so it's
probably one of the more comfortable
typing experiences with sitting at a
desk certainly you're going to want to
use this in different situations to see
how it's going to suit you I'm sure my
stability standpoint it definitely works
pretty decently so guys i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo this is
sort of a second of many adamo XPS
videos we have coming up so stay tuned
to the channel and technobuffalo for all
of your tech needs i'm jon rettinger and
i'll see you in the next video i'm going
to go watch the olympics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
