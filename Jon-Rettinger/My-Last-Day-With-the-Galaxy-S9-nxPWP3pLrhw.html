short but usually about a year which is
ridiculous when you consider the price
of these flagship phones and as silly as
that might seem even say it the Galaxy S
9 and s 9 plus are about to be put out
to pasture to make way for the Galaxy S
10 so as we make way for the new let's
take a final like last look revisited
after the Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus so for
this one sorry about in advance I'm
gonna adopt you at least temporarily
into my family my youngest sac turns 3
on February 3rd and instead of wanting
like a big party you just want to go to
Disneyland so I took everybody with me
including my four and a half month
pregnant wife and my five-year-old son
Nate all of us grabbed the s9 plus and
we went to Disney for the day so let's
head out to the happiest place on earth
so I don't know if you have kids but
Maya are super into trains so that's
where our day at Disneyland started you
guys are you guys all excited so while
we were sitting on the train I was
looking at the beautiful 6.2 inch qHD
screen that's 15 percent brighter than
the outgoing s8 and it's mostly
noticeable outdoors alright so I'm just
gonna say this is like a matter of fact
at this point I'm not gonna belabor it
samsung screens are the best in industry
and it's not even close it just looks
good no matter where you are or what you
are looking at the design of the galaxy
s 9 plus is held up pretty well it's
essentially the same design language as
the s8 but it still works and the phone
still feels the part of a flagship it
feels premium it looks premium and it's
generally held up well so generally with
most of the flagship phones that we keep
for a long time we protect them in this
case we're rocking the D brand skin on
the back to keep the back scratch free
sometimes my phone is in the same pocket
as my keys so the D brand skin helps you
know keep those nasty scratches off of
it if you like the look of it or you
want to pick up a skin for your own
we'll link to them down below if we were
in a world where like the pixel 3 didn't
exist I feel pretty confident saying the
dual aperture rocking cameras on the 9
plus are in the convo for at least best
in the business
but you know pixel 3 does exist
it seems pretty weird to say this but
the camera module itself actually has
ran
built-in they're jolting pictures look
you know awesome especially in like
ideal lighting they look way less
processing on previous Samsung phones -
which is nice to be able to finally say
it did a pretty good job also on
low-light especially with noise
reduction but the same thing here in a
world without night sight I'd say what
an awesome job Samsung you deserve a pat
on the back again you know night side
exists so this is like a second best
camera for low-light situations so the
phone can also take super slow-mo and
960 frames per second I don't really use
it that much but about this was a good
time to test it out so my oldest nate
when it's like a pretty decent gross but
recently he was finally tall enough to
go on pretty much every rollercoaster at
Disney so we decided to try a Big
Thunder Mountain for his first ever
roller coaster roller coaster 95
I honestly gave it like a 50% chance so
you'd actually get on but to my surprise
he jumped right on the ride to my
complete surprise the little dude
absolutely loved it and also to my
surprise the right gave us a pretty
clear look at the upcoming Star Wars
land at galaxy edge in fact he loved to
ride so much we went on again but this
time he asked to sit up in the very
front and honestly was probably my
proudest moment as a father so since my
wife and Zach obviously couldn't go on
Big Thunder Mountain because pregnant
woman and a toddler we stopped for like
a Disney staple we had a get a churro
break I'm gonna be honest I definitely
did not need to eat the second half of
both my kids trios but here we were with
me scarfing him down it was also
completely unnecessary to Disney
experience and probably even this video
but I forced it in there anyway and also
the churro of the galaxy s nine let's
talk about big speak so maybe it's the
best invention since the churro but
Google assistance done everything I ever
needed and so I never really used Bixby
outside of accidentally hitting the
button and quickly canceling so I was
obviously outside waiting in Lyons
inside and lines and with sunglasses on
and off and Samsung intelligence scan
which combines iris and face unlock
worked pretty well and pretty much every
single scenario never once fillings
unlock would you take it either way is
either a sign that it's amazing or
incredibly unsecure I'm choosing to go
with secure it also did unlock way
faster than - review so they show up the
Samsung police improving the software
there all right so now we're about three
hours into the day and surprisingly not
a single meltdown for either the kids so
we decided to press our look and see how
good they were driving so we headed on
over to Autopia and this is a good spot
to get some advice never get behind the
wheel with a three-year-old
I mean like obviously yeah but despite
being on Rails he slammed me from side
to side and my old neck kind of hurt
after the fact
doctor we wrote out Sofia's I take a bit
of a breaking I showed my kids a are
emoji which marks the only time since
the initial review I actually used AR
emoji they and I'm guessing like most
people were enthralled for the first two
minutes and very quickly lost interest
when when goofy website so my kids love
Nemo but I still expected my toddler to
completely lose his big in a confined
space fit together like a champ and I'm
gonna choose to credit great parenting
here and not the threats of of us having
to leave the feet blossom
oh and also here are some more low-light
shots and some bad luck and b-roll
inside the summary
so it was at this point I told Nate
there was a Star Wars ride which having
just turned five he was finally allowed
to see the movies and little dude was
pumped so went on over to star tours but
not before I'm meeting some
stormtroopers who took a shot at us but
you know predictably they missed
ever since my kids met a real-life
stormtrooper they've had just Star Wars
completely on their mind so Zach was too
short and my wife was too pregnant to go
on it so Nate and I went off together to
the moons of Endor well they small world
again
and you go in outer space yeah so was
starting to get dark so we decided it
was probably time to start heading home
I've been playing with the nine plus
pretty much all day and the thirty five
hundred million power battery was still
holding strong at about like fifty five
ish percent so that about summed up my
year-long testing with battery life it
was great to get through a full day
after that charge it I feel like that's
the best you can expect from a phone get
through one day you're sleeping at night
just plug your phone in while you're
while you're sleeping so as of this
filming I didn't have one UI on the
phone which was kind of a bummer and the
bait has been closed but I tell me
watches the phones will probably have
one UI already on them I love
disappointed the phone I was using was
running Android eight instead of Android
Pi oh it's and some experience 9.0 so I
can talk about how things will change
but in 1ui hits but I'm assuming they'll
get better-looking and and probably a
little smoother all right so you guys
are free to go back to your own family
now hope you guys enjoyed coming along
with mine for a day at Disneyland of the
Galaxy S nine plus it was an awesome
phone then it's an awesome phone now and
even though there's a new one coming or
might already be out but tiny watch this
with a higher number still consider what
I think is one of the best flagships of
2018 especially with those sweet
discounts and at the very least it's a
good phone to take with you on a
disneyland experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
