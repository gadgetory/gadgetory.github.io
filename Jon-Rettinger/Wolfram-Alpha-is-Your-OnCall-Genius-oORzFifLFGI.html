TechnoBuffalo a lot of people use google
bing or yahoo as their search engine of
choice and if you're a good searcher you
can probably find what you want within
moments without having to go back and
change your search query many times can
usually find what you want quite quickly
there's another search engine out there
that doesn't have that much market share
but it's a really powerful tool in
finding information it's called Wolfram
Alpha you've probably heard about it
somewhere along the line and we're going
to talk a little bit about how you can
use this to get some information that
may be useful too so let's start with a
basic example let's say we want to know
the weather in New York City something
of course that you can do with Google
but let's see the output so it's going
to think for a minute and it's going to
tell us the current temperature that's
easy enough but it's also going to give
us weather history and forecast so we're
going to see the last few days of
temperature the last few days of cloud
cover conditions from the last few days
historical temperature data really very
specific stuff but let's get even more
specific let's say we want the weather
in New York City on a very specific day
I'll say April second in the year
nineteen eighty-one going all the way
back this is great for research projects
ok so it's thinking and here's the
weather on that period we even get a
daily trend of temperature in addition
we can see the daily breakdown of cloud
cover back many many years ago in this
year very useful we type another city we
compare the weather in New York City and
say Philadelphia on this day in 1981 and
so it's thinking
and now we get side-by-side comparisons
and graphs that compare these two
regions showing the cloud cover and the
conditions and the precipitation very
interesting let's do another search
let's say we want to look at what 409 99
British pounds is equal to well from
alfre knows that i am from the US so it
immediately converts it into u.s.
dollars it shows an exchange rate for
the last year although we can change
this to the last 10 years to see how the
UK UK pound and the US dollar has traded
together we can also see what this
equals in euros and in other forms of
currency let's do something else let's
say we're having breakfast and we want
to know the nutritional facts of some
whole milk a banana and cereal so it's
thinking okay and it gives us the
nutritional facts of all three of these
things that we typed in very interesting
but we want to see what it's like to put
all of this together see the total
calories of all of these things so we
click total nutritional facts it thinks
for a minute and it tells us with all of
those things with one cup of milk one
banana and 30 grams of cereal which is
the average serving size for cereal
we're at 359 calories and nine point
four grams of fat pretty cool and pretty
useful you can do this with really any
kind of food that is common and it
breaks it down towards the bottom here
okay let's try something else let's get
the GDP information about the GDP of say
of France ok here's the result and we
get a graph showing us back to the 70s
and we can change the kind of scale we
have from a logarithmic to a linear
scale and we get a lot more information
about inflation rate and unemployment
rate and things like that very useful
stuff let's do something else let's say
the age of Bill Clinton Bill Clinton is
63 years old two months and 13 days old
let's do something else let's let's say
we want to know how many days
it's been since the date let's say March
third let's say you're born in nineteen
eighty-two and you want to know how many
days it's been who knows why you want to
know this maybe you're making a family
tree and you can see that it's been 27
years seven months and 29 days and from
here you can actually copy it speaking
of doing a family tree research project
let's say you want to sort of visualize
what it would look like in a family tree
if somebody's referring to your
great-aunt so you type great aunt and it
shows you a little family tree so beyond
what I've shown you here the search
engine can do a lot more especially in
the fields of chemistry biology
mathematics physics finance if you're
curious to what it can do and what it's
really capable of go to wolframalpha.com
and you'll see a button here for a video
intro and also a one-page summary that
will really drill down and show you the
true capabilities of this really
incredible search engine that's quite
useful in a lot of situations that's it
