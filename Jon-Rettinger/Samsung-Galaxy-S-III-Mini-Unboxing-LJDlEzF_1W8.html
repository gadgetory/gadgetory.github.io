TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 mini the regular
Galaxy s3 was too big and too powerful
for you
I got a smaller less horse power pack
and cousin right here it's go ahead open
it up see how it performs alright so
here is the Box to the galaxy s3 mini
looks very similar to the unlocked box
that we saw for the galaxy s3 tells you
all the specs on it but of course we're
gonna run all that business down for you
so we can ignore them for now
this guy was sent to us courtesy of our
friends at nigra electronics link will
be down below if you want to check them
out a great place to go to get all of
your unlocked cell phones and tablets so
I'll go ahead and use our buffalo knife
we will gingerly cut the plastic I will
take this looks like I have not seen one
he's in person so I really have no idea
what to expect it's not a phone that
really see that often here in the US I
know some carriers in Europe in other
parts of the world have picked it up so
there is the galaxy s3 mini and it looks
like a main galaxy s4 which I suppose is
appropriate I'll go ahead and lift up
the tab phone is sitting in a try push
it off to the side for just a quick
moment dual-core CPU so it also we're
going to have in the Box I'm not even
going to try to pronounce that properly
we've got some earbuds for different
sized ears
we've got the earbuds that go with it
are they adapters rather go with it with
inline mic we've got the micro USB
charger and that is yeah so yeah the
u.s. charger how do we cool and then
we've got syncing cable and the battery
which is of size 1500 milliamp hours so
let's go ahead and push all that off the
side for just a moment let's take a look
at the phone itself so I'll go ahead and
gingerly peel off all the plastic bits
and pieces I can tell you what you can
expect so it is a Super AMOLED screen at
the resolution of it's not a busting
resolution or anything 800 by 480 the
phone feels really small it really just
feels like a mini galaxy s3 running
Android
for point one it's got a dual-core 1
gigahertz CPU in it Giga RAM either get
an 8 or 16 configurations but it's got
external storage on the back we've got a
5 megapixel camera with autofocus and of
course that LED flash vga little job you
lives there on the front this is an
HSPA+ phone the 14 4 so you should get
pretty fast speeds if you are in HSPA
Network and the bands are 900 1900 and
2100 case you're wondering Wi-Fi 802 11
B GNN Bluetooth 4.0 it's got and I've
seen it so the height got four point
eight inches 2.5 inches by 0.39 inches
so it's not giant and of course that is
a four inch diagonal screen I'm go ahead
and pop in the battery and take a quick
tour of the phone alright so we got the
galaxy s3 mini all powered up and it
feels super mini on the hand used to
same Samsung phones with much larger
screens but it is pretty much TouchWiz
and all of its TouchWiz II glory let's
see we're gonna get here in the app
stuff all the Samsung add-on did expect
chat on Chrome is your default browser
go and continue to scroll through
another thing overly exciting there take
a look at the widgets and it's going to
be the standard Android widgets with
some of the fun
Samsung add-ons there you can see what
there are no S Pen action here you don't
have any sort of multi window stuff you
get with some of the top to your Samsung
phones
it's the bare-bones TouchWiz but it does
work pretty well let's go ahead and take
a look at the settings and we'll see
what else we're going to have here we'll
go back to apps and let's try and find
settings you can see all the stuff the
phone's gone and take my word for it
scroll down to the bottom we'll go about
device and here is all the goodness so
it is Android 4.1.1 and there's a model
number the gt1 8 190 l let's do a quick
tour of the phones we got a physical
home button right there we got
capacitive back buttons and menu buttons
if you want to multitask Samsung phones
you just hold down the main home button
if we continue the tour on the left hand
side you've got volume rocker up and
down nothing else on the right hand side
power and lock button noise cancelling
mic and the micro USB charging port on
there and on the top 3.5 milimeter
headset jack if you want to access the
SD card slot or the micro SD card slot
that's going to live under the 1,500
milliamp hour battery so don't be fooled
by this phone not having top-tier specs
it's still like dual-core phone which is
very capable so looking for something
that's just gonna work well for a couple
years you don't need crazy power then
you play some games or watching movies
it's gonna be a pretty good phone for
you let me go ahead and do a quick size
comparison with some other phones it's
funny to look at a samsung phone that's
4 inches and think it feels small on you
bring a device like the iPhone 5 that
has the same screen size certainly it's
a much taller phone but if I go ahead
and turn this on you can see Lucy right
there and the screen sizes are exactly
the same bringing in its big brother and
cousin here is the irregular in galaxy
s3 can see the size comparison there
then if we bring in just the giant Big
Daddy here is the galaxy note 2 and you
can see the size difference between all
of those guys as well so this guy is a
very small pretty useful phone so who is
this phone going to be for I really been
wanted do this for a long time I'm gonna
draw on the table because that that's
kind of fun if you don't need power but
just want a phone that's going to work
and work pretty well for you the galaxy
s3 mini is going to do it it feels
really good in the hand it's light it's
gonna fit in your pocket and it's going
to work for the next few years if you're
getting it unlocked you're not going to
be tethered
forgetting an unlock not can be tethered
to a two-year contract so if you want to
keep this phone for a year so it's going
to be a pretty good option I want to
thank our friends at Negri electronics

phone link down below if you want to
check them out and if you want to draw
on tables and stuff just because I kind
of liked it this is something called
idea paint uh anyway guys thank you for
