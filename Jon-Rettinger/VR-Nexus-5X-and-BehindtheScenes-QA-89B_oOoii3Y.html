we're on pretty here from TechnoBuffalo
in a day or two ago you guys were
awesome enough to engage with us and
send us a bunch of questions on Twitter
and snapchat follow us on snapchat if
you don't yet and we really appreciate
it John got some questions for him I got
some questions for me he did his version
about the Buffalo link above so check
that out and this is going to be my
version of ask the Buffalo first
question comes from Vignesh Raja at Ron
Parata what do you do in your free time
to be honest I don't really do that much
in my free time either I'm working on
TechnoBuffalo stuff for the happiness
story of Sam I'm always making videos so
I stare at Adobe Premiere for far too
long I try to work out I've been trying
to be healthier and so I do go to the
gym every now and then go running that
kind of stuff boom um terms of video
games I do play UFC I do play NBA 2k
games let me know if you guys play I'd
love to know from Ryan Bulli at ROM
Purita what's your favorite type of
music what are some favorite bands or
artists hashtag asked to be I don't
really have a favorite musician or
artist or group I just like too much
music I'm actually into all genres of
music pretty much except for country
haven't been able to get into that right
now I'm really listening to a lot of
John belly on ooh John villian go check
him out plug there he's awesome he
produces he sings he raps there's all
kinds of stuff sounds like the lead
single lead singer from Owl City very
cool guy go check him out
I like the new Kanye album which I hate
to admit in public but it's really good
I'm still deciding on the new Drake
album I'm just a big music head so if
you guys want to ever be interrupted
while filming a video I love music so I
forget everyone talked about music hit
me up but those are kind of some
examples
Hiten vara asks what's going to be the
next big thing intact it's hard to say
what's going to be the next big thing in
tech but something I've been super
pumped about for the last two weeks
which is a very short amount of time has
been VR I downloaded the app vrsc which
I talked about in my five apps that you
can check out so linked out above check
it out and I really loved it because it
was the first time I experienced
storytelling or documentaries in a VR
perspective and it pulled me in in a way
that I didn't think VR could do I
thought VR was more of a gimmick up
until now and then after that experience
and after using the vibe in the gaming
context
sort of won me over so I don't know it's
gonna be
or AR but either one I think VR is
pretty cool I just haven't used an AR
headset yet to really compare with but
that's gonna be the next big thing if
you ask me to put my money on a horse
that sounded so weird like if I'm
putting my money on
that's something Conor McGregor would do
Ryan O'Donnell asks is the Nexus 5x
worth the price simple answer is yes
it's a great phone comes in at a great
price feels great looks great performs
great it is great no complaints here go
grab it Robert J steed what's up Robert
we've tweeted a couple times do you plan
on making more behind-the-scenes videos
love seeing your little insight into
your world yes we definitely are we're
planning on doing specifically a behind
the scenes video on how we produce a
techno Buffalo video so I don't know if
that's a behind the scenes of it behind
the scenes but it feels very meta Daniel
Snyder do you think it's a little too
late to join the YouTube tech community
as in is it worth starting a new channel
Oh Daniel Daniel Daniel this is really a
yes and no answer it just depends on
what you're playing on doing in the
quality of your content and the
uniqueness of your content I think
making great content is no longer good
enough because the tech YouTube
community is pretty saturated if you can
come with something really fresh in a
unique way of doing things in a fresh
way
there's always room free there's always
room in every market as long as you're
coming with something really creative
and new that people don't have that
being said you might also be interested
in looking at other social medias that
are new and up-and-coming so maybe
making a pure snapchat page for tag or
an Instagram page where there might not
be as much competition as there is on
YouTube from duck poison pretty violent
and vicious name this one is for Ron
what's next for the happiness stories so
for those of you who don't know I run a
separate video series on my own personal
time it's called the happiest stories
you make little mini documentaries
covering people who have like cancer
cystic fibrosis there are awesome little
inspirational videos once a week so
that's what those questions are Frank -
my plan is really just to keep making
awesome content the goal is really just
to make positive stuff that people can
take into the world and use as
inspiration to go attack their week
better and go hopefully be better people
and that's it just keep making cool
content keep trying to inspire people
and hopefully more people watch from at
live creative co named your top monthly
subscriptions that you think are worth
it out
music WCC Netflix etc honestly you kind
of named off all the subscription I
really use Netflix is great it's a
default you can never miss house of
cards Adobe CC is Adobe Creative Cloud
for those of you don't know so a great
way to get software at a relatively low
price compared to what full software
packages used to cost which was between
a thousand to two thousand dollars for
music I don't actually use Apple music I
used to I switched to Spotify because I
like the playlist better that's really
it those are my main subscriptions so
let me know in the comments down below
if you have any subscriptions that I
should know about because I couldn't
think of any other ones those are really
my sort of core there's my main ones
give us a thumbs up if you like this
video let me know what you think in the
comments below as mentioned and
subscribe and I'll see you guys the next
one thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
