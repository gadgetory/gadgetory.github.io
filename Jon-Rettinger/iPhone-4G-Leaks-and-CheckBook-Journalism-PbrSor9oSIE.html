from technobuffalo here in case you've
been living under a tech rock the past
few days you've no doubt seen the leaks
that gizmodo posted about their hands on
time with the iphone 4g i'm going to
give you a bit of background on the
story and talk about swear the ethical
quandary and whatnot i agree or disagree
what gizmodo didn't talk a little bit
about checkbook journalism so here's the
brief story about three and a half ish
weeks ago an apple junior engineer who
had a iphone 4g prototype actually
disguised as an iphone 3gs went out to a
bar to celebrate his birthday just a few
miles from apples Cupertino headquarters
presumably you may have celebrated a
little bit too much got up and left and
left his prototype iphone 4g on the
barstool this is all according to
gizmodo so somebody found it changed
hands a few times by time the guy got at
home you realize this actually wasn't an
iphone 3gs that's heard of a weird
casing on it pulled up the casing and
revealed some very very different and
unique hardware he had a chance to play
around the phone for for a few hours
went to bed woke up the next morning and
the phone had been remotely wiped by
Apple which itself was probably a bit of
a red flag this was indeed a legitimate
iphone 4g prototype so evidently he
called Apple as they listen I've got a
prototype what you want to do with it
Apple the junior sales rep saying to the
phone or the customer service rep sort
of blew it all figured it was a hoax has
what I and the guy was left with a
legitimate iphone 4g prototype so what
he did next sort of where this video
starts he tried to sell the device to
different tech blogs it was offered to
engadget gizmodo I'm presumably a few
others and now this is all sort of
happenstance and we don't know if
everything that's being said is true but
the senior editor of engadget said he
passed on the device didn't feel was
right to actually buy a post and buy
news and gives motor decided they wanted
to jump on and actually paid five
thousand dollars
portable device this is where things
start to get a little bit gray and a
little bit hazing sir depending on where
you stand so what gizmodo did was they
paid five thousand dollars for the
device they did their due diligence they
took the device apart verify that it was
actually an apple product there was
apple internals and they went live with
the story now here's where my question
is if they knew this was indeed an apple
prototype then it was apples property
and they bought apples properties so
that you consider them buying stolen
stolen goods or whether Apple really
didn't make an effort to get it back at
a time it's going to be up to you so
where do you stand on checkbook journals
and you think his moto was right to buy
the device well I have to be honest with
you I'm a pretty clean-cut guy i buyed
by a pretty set code of ethics however
if someone offered me an iphone 4g
prototype to post on TechnoBuffalo I'd
be very hard-pressed to say no and I'm
just being honest with you and you know
trying gone to their selfie entrance
question if I had the opportunity to buy
the iphone 4g prototype i probably would
have bought it now i would have probably
closely done what gizmodo did would have
posted on it as soon as Apple got in
touch with me I would have given them
their property back so essentially I was
would have been letting Apple know that
I had their device in a very public
forum I know it's a bit shade in a bit
grey and I can see both sides of the
bait but push comes to shove I probably
would have done it and that's a tough
thing to admit you know whether or not
you would do something like that or not
to something like that and I think the
majority of people out there would
definitely want to get their hands on
device however what gizmodo did next I
do not agree with they found out the
name of the junior engineer who lost the
prototype and published it and this is
where I tend to disagree and there are
two sides of the fence here's some are
claiming I'm not going to mention the
guys name that his moto published his
name to get public support for the guy
so that Apple couldn't fire him and if
they did their be public outcry the
other side of that fence is gizmodo was
just trying to milk it a little bit and
wanted people to know who this guy was
we'd be held
vote for what he did I would not have
posted the name that kinkos handled a
little bit tacky side however if their
intentions were good if they wanted to
drum up support for the junior engineer
then good for them although i think i
would have had a very hard time play
that information out there gizmodo
essentially costs this young man his
career and some of his motor did by the
phone somebody else what else the
information would have gotten out there
somehow there's no doubt about that some
his motor sort of preempted their
competition by agreeing to purchase of
advice so I wanted to give a bit of a
history on and see what you guys thought
would you have bought the device if you
ran a tech blog or a technology-focused
youtube channel do you agree or disagree
it's tough to to make a decision on that
so I'm kind of curious what you guys
have to say to leave a text or video
response anyway I'm John retin Yorkin
technobuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video Oh bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
