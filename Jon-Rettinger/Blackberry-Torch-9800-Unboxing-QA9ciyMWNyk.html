TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing that
I'm very excited about this is the
blackberry torch 9800 it is a form
factor most consumers have been waiting
for combining a touchscreen and a full
physical QWERTY keyboard
I missed this while I was gone on
vacation so I'm real excited to go ahead
and take a look at it let's get started
alright so this review unit came right
from the folks at rim Research In Motion
the makers of blackberry well of course
you see obligatory big ol knife to cut
the box and I've not seen one of these
yet so I'm actually really excited to
take a look it is right now a carry
exclusive on AT&amp;amp;T and is going to run
you 199 dollars go ahead and open up the
box there's a little bit more tape to
cut through and we will get started now
we're gonna go ahead and open up the box
and here we've got some sort of PR stuff
about the review unit and here is the
blackberry torch 9800 push that off to
the sides go and take a look at the box
looks like a new blackberry box new 18t
box it's all in black rethink possible
blackberry torch some pictures of the
device some specs and of course I'll go
over all the specs we do the unboxing
tech messaging social networking web
browser this is running the new
BlackBerry OS 6.0 with a full
multi-touch capable WebKit browser
shouldn't get a similar browsing
experience what you get on an iPhone and
Android device or a Palm webOS device
touchscreens a 3.2 inch touchscreen
we'll talk about that a little bit later
it's got Wi-Fi 802 m V G and N and a 5
megapixel camera it's the highest one
the Blackbirds put in they're really
getting to the higher range consumer
cameras let's go ahead and open this up
I've got a SIM card included for testing
that was nice the folks at rim and here
we have the blackberry torch itself and
on first blush even without the battery
and so heavier than I expected it's got
a solid feel to it they'll push that off
to the side and see what else we're
going to get in the box
blackberry torch QuickStart guide so
it's sort of a cross between the bold
and the outgoing guests blackberry storm
Oh chance is still around the storm - a
little minidisc safety information
you've got a pair of headphones
stereo headphones with microphone
attached in the 3.5 millimeter jack got
your little wall charger it's a a small
blackberry charge looks similar to what
Apple's done the past it's nice that RIM
isn't shipping those four big wall
chargers anymore it's got a USB port and
I assume there's a USB cord there as
well and it is micro USB so that's sort
of standard a little bit of a cleaning
cloth and the battery and the battery I
believe is of size 12 70 milliamp hour
battery amp hour it's going to get you
about five and a half hours of talk time
so enough about all the specs let's take
a look at the device or off of the
accessories let's look at the device and
talk a bit more about the specs and what
you're going to get with the blackberry
torch so it is running a 624 milliamp or
significant 24 megahertz processor so
it's relatively fast it should be pretty
quick what I've seen and what I've heard
it's very capable of multitasking or
handling the things that you look to do
on a multimedia device it's got four
gigabytes of internal storage that's
expandable you get a micro SD card slot
in the back which should come with a 4
gigabyte card batteries can be good for
about five and a half hours of 3G
talktime 3.2 inch capacitive touchscreen
with a half VGA resolution of 365 4e 5
megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus and LED flash you can shoot
video at 640 by I believe Court II and
if you want to MMS picture this is going
to send them off at 176 544 pixels and
of course as I mentioned 802 11 B G and
n now I can exhale let's go ahead and
pull off the plastic it's for a
satisfying whooshing tag noise pull out
the plastic there the gorram fossick to
pull off let's take a look at what
you're going to get here on the phone a
lot of plastic
all right so these are physical buttons
here on the bottom those are not
capacitive buttons like we've seen on a
lot of Android phones you got serve a
typical array of blackberry buttons
here's your set button the BlackBerry
manual button got an optical trackpad
here which is you can select it so I
guess would be five way back button and
a power and end button you have a full
physical QWERTY keyboard here and see
how this feels it doesn't have as much
throw as some of the bold keyboard it's
because it's a slider so it wasn't that
much room so push the keys in or out
still retain a relatively thin form
factor although on first blush a
keyboard does feel very good at the
typical BlackBerry keyboard look that
used to with the bold got sort of the
angled keys that are sort of all
together next to each other feels very
nice there is also a full on-screen
keyboard as well prefer that you can use
that in landscape or portrait let's go
ahead and turn this over and take a look
we're going down the back that's a bit
of a rubber ribbed edges you're going to
have four typical BlackBerry buttons on
the top here as well you've got your
screen lock button and call mute nothing
on the left-hand side other than the
microUSB port on the right volume up and
down sort of inside of almost
encapsulated there's your headset jack
and one physical hard button which is
probably going to launch the camera I'll
be doing a full overview this device and
showing you how blackberry operating
system 6 works comparing it to some
other devices if you want to know how
this looks not to some other probably a
competitive phones let's go ahead and
bring it a few here is the iPhone 4 for
example I'll zoom out a little bit and
get a better sense of the size so 3.5
inch touchscreen versus a 3.2 a bit of a
difference there and of course the torch
is going to be a little bit wider
because that slide-out QWERTY keyboard
let's maybe the form factor everybody's
been looking for so you get sort of the
best of both or all the physical and a
virtual keyboard it does not have the
sure Press technology of you seen on the
older blackberry storms this does not
press and it's sort of a true
touchscreen here's the original storm
Exede I'm talking about screen actually
pushes in
this does not do that bring in a few
other phones here here is the joint
incredible this is a pretty decent size
there and one of the larger screens
phone let's bring in the Droid x2
difference there with the 4.3 versus the
three points to quite a big difference
in size so stay tuned to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo comm for all kinds of
blackberry torch coverage I'm real
excited I sort of getting this and see
how it works go ahead and give it a
quick power on so you can see in skin
stay tuned for all the coverage alright
so you got the SIM card and battery in
things going through an initial boot up
I will cut next to the load screen
through thinking that I can show you and
again I'll be going certain more in
depth into the operating system and how
BlackBerry OS 6 compares with the other
competitors it looks like we're about
3/4 of the way done here all right got
the AT&amp;amp;T splash screen letting you know
that it is indeed a world's phone it's
quad band so it'll work everywhere that
you go
so whether you're in Europe whatever
continent and it's going to do some
curious security software updates and
you get a kind of a cool load screen
here lo what you do so go through and
got service um probably some accept
information go ahead hit that keyboard
on first blush does feel very responsive
simple gestures up and down opening
menus go ahead and continue you can sort
of see what the intro video is going to
look like show you a little bit about
the phone it's got a new menu system
where you can sort of show and hide
whatever icon you like you can swipe
back and forth on again I'll show you
guys how all that stuff works let me
know there is indeed a webkit-based
browser blackberries the pass from not
equipped with the most capable of
browsers this one is supposed to be a
huge step in the right direction and
certain links should be a very welcomed
addition to all the rim fans out there I
know there are quite a few you who are
very black/gray dependent as this may
actually be the phone that you've been
waiting for so here is a short intro
video I am John Rhett injure
no Buffalo and I will see you in the
next one bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
