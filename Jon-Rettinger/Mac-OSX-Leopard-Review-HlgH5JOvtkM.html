overdue review of the new operating
system for Apple computers Leopard first
thing before I get started is this isn't
gonna be a video demonstration of the
features there have been copious other
videos that have done that and probably
better than I could ever do so up here
I'm going to put some links
that'll give you some video
demonstration of the features I'm gonna
talk about this video we're just gonna
be my impressions of the operating
system as a whole having used it since
launch day so first thing I'll talk
about and I'm the maniac everybody wants
to know is stability in all the time
that I've had Leopard now it's been
coming up on a month
it hasn't crashed shopping once the
computer has been rock solid with rock
salt with Tiger 2 but things just feel a
little zippier the boot up time is a
little bit slower probably about 3 or 4
seconds slower but the operating system
operating system itself has just been
been really quick once it's loaded up so
if you're worried about stability with
new operating system don't worry it
isn't Vista not a knock on Microsoft
it's just apples all west's aren't
playing just some issues that that
Microsoft's are so some of the first
some of the cool features and the big
features don't talk a little bit about
the smaller ones the first big one and
the one that I use all the time actually
have needed to use two time machine
so what Time Machine is essentially its
automated backup so we need to have an
order to make Time Machine work you need
to have an external hard drive that's
bigger than your internal drive on your
computer and one thing to note when you
activate time machine and leopard it'll
delete all the content off of your
external drive so just be aware of that
firsthand and what it does is it gives
you a three-dimensional view of your
desktop so let's say you are working in
Microsoft Word and you had all your Word
document saved in a Word documents
folder on your desktop and I'll say you
actually deleted a file well you can
actually open up that folder click time
machine you'll get a three-dimensional
view of all the folders going back and
you can go back to wherever that
document was before you lost it click it
hit restore and it's back that's it
and everything is totally automated you
don't have to do anything as soon as you
plug in your external drive the
operating system ask you if you want to
activate Time Machine you hit yes and
that's it that's all you got to do my
500 gigabyte my book that I would using
has been awesome
I recommend it if you looking for
external hard drive otherwise I've heard
all have been pretty good so that's just
that no time machine has been a really
really really good future feature I had
a paper I was working on that forever
reason I ended up I was tired it was
light and ended up deleting a paragraph
I didn't want to delete and I saved it
and closed it I realized it the next
morning and as it would use time machine
to bring back an old version of a
document open up that paragraph paste it
right back in so I can already attest to
how good Time Machine is and I'm sure as
things go on I'm only gonna be happy
with it find more uses for it so time
machine highly recommended I think that
alone is worth the cost of the operating
system the next cool thing is something
called spaces and what spaces is
essentially um because virtualized
desktops
so let's say you are downloading music
from itunes browsing the web and you're
editing of your editing a video and it's
processing we can do now is have a
separate workspace for each you activate
spaces I think you can hit ctrl and the
arrow keys and a trend space is on and
it actually filters through your desktop
gives you an icon on your screen of how
many desktops you have and you can just
drag and drop different windows into
different virtual spaces I think that's
the one that thing that this review you
know could probably probably use and
check out the video for review of spaces
I hope you guys out
hope you guys out a lot so spaces is a
great feature I haven't really used it
that much because I have the dual
screens but if I didn't have dual
screens I could see spaces being a
really really really great feature there
so if you're traveling one of the next
cool things other than spaces to know is
a new i chat i chat as a messaging
client that comes built in and that has
some really cool features actually I've
got a list here like in
hope you guys with a little bit so so
some of the cool stuff with I chat you
get new photobooth effects so you can
set up background in the back make it
look like you're underwater on a roller
coaster all kinds of really cool stuff
one of the nice features is this thing
called screen sharing and you really
what you can do is you can collaborate
with a friend right over iChat you can
work on anything you want whether it's a
presentation in keynote or PowerPoint
and you invite the other person to a
connection actually brings up their
desktop on your screen and you can share
it similar to like PC anywhere or remote
remote desktop but just really easy to
do and they can do it with Mac to Mac
you know which makes it really easy
color back so that's one of the really
cool features with with iChat is that
the screen sharing thing it's got a lot
of other - you can record now yourself
and iChat you can use multiple logins
you can make yourself look invisible you
get animated buddy icons there's a I
chat theater you can show nearly any
file on your system through an iChat
video conference so if you're giving a
presentation for work or something or
school you kind of have everybody logged
in via I Chad you can show um your
keynote or PowerPoint presentation any
way that can be a real handy feature -
so those are some of the biggest
features I think with leopard new in
addition there's a three-dimensional
dock and kind of some cursory stuff but
overall there are 300 plus new features
and those are the highlights of them you
know there's a Google map addresses in
your address book there's new stuff with
AppleScript Automator is updated boot
camp is now out of beta and officially
part of Leopard so if you want to run
boot camp now you have to have leopard
and check out my video on boot camp vs.
parallels and tell you what boot camp is
this actually allows you to run Windows
XP or Vista on your
your Mac natively and again you need a
full install disk Vista or XP doesn't
come with bootcamp dashboard is now
updated to use this thing called web
clips you can clip out any portion of a
web page and just drag it off the
dashboard to make it a widget and
whenever that page gets updated it'll
show up on dashboard it's actually
really cool if you look at if you look
at my page and you look at Echo fishes
pages we look at the gadget or ESPN you
can clip those now right to dashboard
open up dashboard and see if any of us
have anything new that you want to see
so that's kind of neat and I guess one
of the last feature that I use a lot is
the same called stacks and what stacks
is it's you can really organize all your
files into early nice needs deck and
one-click and the stack kind opens up
and it really opens up a kind of a
straight file you can just open anything
anything you want
so I've I go to some pictures a lot so I
set up by pictures folder as a stack and
it's really handy you can do it as a
list review all your icons at once so
you can store them you can download
stacks it's really easy there's also a
new front row the front row is very
similar to the front row on appletv it
looks just the same now so I mean that's
nice I really like the way that looks
there's a lot of graphics and media
stuff updated too there's new core
animations and updated OpenGL there's
new stuff in iCal and I'll post some
links again over there to list some of
the new features there's some stuff for
you know and analyzing templates and
mail has new features it's got our email
it's got new stationery new RSS readers
photo booth has the new effects in there
too it's kind of a updating interface
that's nice to be you to go to booth and
the last thing I almost forgot to
mention is this thing called quick view
actually what I use one things I use
most in Leopard if you're ever going
through a huge list of files and you
want to see which one it is you can
click on it and your spacebar opens up
quick view it actually opens up the
document that opening up the program so
if you have an Adobe program it'll open
it
that opening up you know Photoshop
whatever it is you see the document
looks like but weird documents or open
up keynote presentation you can see what
it is really neat highly recommend er a
picture you click the picture hit space
and opens up the picture so I think
that's very worthwhile anyway guys sorry
I couldn't show videos and
demonstrations here YouTube is gonna cut
me off in just a minute keep it under 10
so I thought you guys know so the new
features in addition coverflow you can
sort documents to get coverflow like you
can in itunes so i was just a quick
summation of leopard overall I'm very
happy with it certainly worth the
upgrade anyway guys enjoy have a nice
afternoon or evening or ever you're at
any guys I'll talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
