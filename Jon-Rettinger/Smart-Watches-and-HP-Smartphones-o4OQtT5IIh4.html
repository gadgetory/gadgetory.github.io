to you by 23andme what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
welcome back to the episode of ask the
buffalo except i'm not doing ask the
buffalo I am handing the ass the buffalo
reins to our newest buffalo miss ashley
Esqueda sew ins to be super dramatic i'm
just gonna slam down the microphone you
know what I'm out of here I've answered
enough questions I don't know where the
next iPhones coming hi guys thanks John
hey guys its outs the Buffalo and it's
all mine this week we're gonna talk
about HP's for a back into smart phones
smart accessories the future of cars and
how we divvy up writing at TechnoBuffalo
this is asked the Buffalo so let's get
answering our first question is from
TechnoBuffalo commenter banned from
japan who asks hey john not john do you
think HP will have a chance in the OS
wars if they truly are coming back in
the game well that is an interesting
question because i have a lot of latent
rage at HP for killing my beloved webos
I loved the palm pre I stood in line
when it came out at a Best Buy It was
fourth in line I think that HP is gonna
have a very difficult time with a couple
of different things number one mindshare
not a lot of people are saying gosh I
wish HP would make a phone they're
pretty happy with their HTC one's their
galaxy s4s and their apple iphone 5s and
their Nokia Lumia so I don't know that
there's a lot of demand so i'm not sure
if they have a chance not because they
couldn't make a okay piece of hardware
even though i think most om's would do a
little bit better i don't think they're
gonna be innovating to the point where
it's gonna bring people in droves and at
that point really if you can't bring
people in droves what are you really
doing if somebody like Microsoft is
having a difficult time bringing people
to Windows Phone 8 HP is gonna have a
tough time bringing people to the
hardware side on smartphones from them
so I just don't know next up twitter
user iOS daily matt wants to know are
smart watches in smart
glasses even necessary have we gotten
that lazy we haven't gotten so lazy that
we're eating cupcakes in a cup like in
Wally and being shuttled around via
hovering lazy boys but we definitely are
kind of lazy but I do think that there
is some inherent value to smart
accessories like glasses a google glass
and smart watches like pebble and even a
future i watch if that does happen one
of the things that I have found is when
I personally have my phone in my back
pocket I feel that a lot of times I'm
always checking the time for no reason
and I don't know i think it's sort of
like a weird compulsion that we have
kind of developed after the smartphone
craze maybe even before then maybe you
checked your candy bar nokia back in the
late 90s i think that smart accessories
are just a natural evolution of what
we're using and i think that in the
future we're gonna have even crazier
technology so potentially smart glasses
may turn into smart contacts we've seen
these contact lenses that enable you to
have sort of a telescopic I which is a
little creepy but kind of amazing in the
sense that I am certain we will be
killed by robots at some point so maybe
things like this will give us a fighting
chance and things like smart glasses and
watches to me are the first step towards
even cooler human modifications that
we're gonna be able to make in the
future so I don't know that it's about
laziness I think some people buy them
because they are in fact lazy but
generally speaking I think it's just
sort of footsteps going forward how
technology works kind of awesome i love
it twitter user oscar v 8 31 wanted our
opinion on this question what is your
opinion with the future of cars best of
all which energy source she is
considering global warming well i think
climate change is something that a lot
of people are very concerned about
obviously we have so many different
vehicle options available to us with
battery powered cars hydrogen power
cards gas-powered cars I definitely
think that at some point we're gonna
have to get away from fossil fuel just
because it's really hard to make over
time and we're gonna kind of run out at
some point especially with people like
China really coming up in terms of
industrialized society and building
things and factories so I'm going to say
I really like as a concept the idea of
either a self-driving car that
hydrogen-powered I think that we can
find some breakthrough in hydrogen
technology i'm sure some of you would
disagree with me on that but i do think
that it is a good way to run a car just
because zero emissions and we've all
seen those videos where they run a
hydrogen car and then they like have
clean water come out of the tailpipe
generally speaking i'm not sure if we've
seen the change in car technology that
is going to move society as a whole
first world society as a whole away from
fossil fuels and gas-powered cars we've
seen it's really amazing battery
technology starting to kind of come up
it's gonna take a little longer but
overall I think we are on the right
track but better battery technology
number one better use of hydrogen
technology number two I think those are
the really big important things to focus
on and lastly technobuffalo commenter
the courageous carlos asks hey there my
question is how to writers for
TechnoBuffalo divided the news to write
articles about does everyone know which
article they're supposed to write how do
you avoid writers from writing articles
on the same news well we can all see
what everyone else is kind of working on
but generally speaking thunderdome real
quick before we wrap this up wanted to
take a second to thank our sponsors
23andme I love science and more
specifically DNA our individual
biological fingerprint so back in 2007
23andme released their personal genome
service it cost a thousand bucks which
is pretty pricey for a lot of us out
there and they only offered 14 reports
on your DNA but as all of the best
technology does over time it has gotten
way more affordable how much more
affordable you ask how's 99 bucks sound
that's right 99 bucks gets you a full
personal genome analysis and it's not
just 14 reports anymore it's over 200
reports yeah that's right you might find
out why you're sensitive to cilantro or
you could discover famous ancestors some
of the reports cover medical topics like
health risks and carrier status for
hereditary conditions all that all of
that for 99 bucks and more that's
cheaper than taking a family afford to a
3d movie on a Saturday night that's a
cool thing about 23andme you get to
explore your very own DNA
from the comfort of your living room all
you have to do is head over to the site
order your DNA kit online male 23 me or
saliva sample and wait for your report
take advantage of that ninety nine
dollar price today or just learn more
about the service by heading over to ww
23andme calm / TechnoBuffalo that's it
for this week's ask the Buffalo thanks
so much for watching will you give this
short the show back uh no no um your
fault preceding wheelie chair okay yeah
