TechnoBuffalo here a few months ago I
showed you it was on my Android device
and now I'm back to show you what I've
got on iOS I'm not an app hoarder but I
generally keep the amps that I use the
most so I'm going to show you what I
think you might not know and walk you
through what I've got and sort of go
over very quickly this stuff I think you
guys are all familiar with so I've got
my home screen set up relatively simply
I got me walking with Nate man in the
back just photos calendar settings
camera YouTube if you guys are youtubers
really want to try the YouTube studio
and YouTube capture studio will actually
give you almost real-time analytics on
your video so when it says 301 publicly
it'll tell you what that real video
count is capture it lets you obviously
capture video and upload directly and
YouTube kids you've got kids kids I
already know what that one is
passbook I love the Google app I use
that almost instead of Syria for all my
searches and I love the Google now cards
app store you guys know that social
media I've got social media accounts you
guys are probably familiar with a one
you might not know is one called me weep
Somu is kind of a really cool new social
media app it's got all the functionality
and more like something like facebook
provides I'm sort of unlike Facebook and
Twitter we worry about privacy and they
kind of have loose settings and can sell
your information maybe gives you full
control over all your content enables
you they can reclaim all of your privacy
something that's really important you
own your content you control all of your
interactions you design your level of
privacy I like that I can share certain
post different people if I don't
everybody to see what I'm posting just
want my wife to see enter my family I
can select that here so that's not me I
really enjoy you can share all kinds of
cool stuff you can just do text you can
you picture video audio movies and sort
of share everything direct from the app
they've got a cool feature that I
haven't seen before you can actually
post with your voice we'll just kind of
need so say there if you want record it
post it and you are good to go
after you've been following me before
for a while one of the cool things about
the company is actually Tim berners-lee
the founders of world wide web is on
their board of directors so if we want a
social media app that you don't to worry
about stuff getting hacked or stolen
movies a good way to go rest of stuff
here I think you guys are probably
familiar with TV tracking the guys run a
website these are apt you should
consider analytics which is just thus
far for iOS gives you pretty close to
real-time traffic that's a Charpy go
tell many people are on your site all at
once and
analytics using more in-depth and a
little okay hey did yesterday before and
certain date ranges there's a ton of
analytics apps these are the three that
I use most so if you're on our website
you might want to take a look at all of
those three messaging just sort of
messaging apps to you the whole time
what's that bbm messenger and why are
sites new sites that I visit opted we've
just short cuts that's an exciting there
I put all my Apple apps time just in a
folder that I don't really use it often
maybe I'll use clock but for the most
part that's really it others where a lot
of apps kind of live I'll run through
these very quickly and show you ones you
guys might not know PlayMemories I have
a Sony camera lets me transfer my
pictures from the camera over to the
phone via an ad hoc Wi-Fi really nice
Marvel unlimited except you'd like to
read some comics here gif keyboard or
Jif keyboard that's the way you can send
sort of gifs in your keyboard TaskRabbit
really cool way to sort of get people to
help you out if you need help at home go
pick stuff up for you
a TaskRabbit is a really cool way to do
that red fin for property atomic web
it's another web browser I ever really
use that in a while
action movie for creating shorts little
action Clips you can have aliens
attacking all kinds of other stuff nest
I have a nest thermostat at home and
also have Dropcam at home so I can use
that to monitor both of those 1password
the best way to store passwords I cannot
recommend one pastor enough if you
forget passwords that one is worth the
price I don't know what it costs now I
downloaded it years ago but that one is
really worth it uber conference we use
that a TechnoBuffalo for conference
calls not too confused but actually uber
which is the car service box kind of
like Costco but you can order stuff only
use it once phone swa4 a great way to
get your contacts over from iOS to
Android sort of uploading through clouds
and downloads them back down rest us up
like you guys are probably familiar with
SONET roll for alarm
Kibo I've got a smart lock at my house
coin is an app that you control your
coin smart card it's a credit card you
can store different credit cards on I
also have straddles cards well you see
that app here in just a minute I know
some others through apps I've got kind
of just stashed away in my other folder
games have attached time to play that
many games only have six on here but I
still love tap defense when my first iOS
games ever played and I still love that
one
here's all my passbook app so good at
you guys sort of put enough
I tried to be organized then it kind of
went away storage values for cloud
storage here's what I've got sugar sink
Drive Dropbox and onedrive Amazon stuff
I'd get from Amazon all the time I've
got in there
eyes are kind of apples media stuff so
you got music iTunes Store videos and
podcasts Maps Google Maps and Apple maps
these are mine 8 apps Elmo calls he
calls and Mickey Mouse catalog cookie
calls really helps them eat dinner Elmo
calls well Elmo call and then if he
doesn't eat I'm gonna go hang up so
parents bribery kids Apple watch
activity monitor I have an Amazon echo
at home which I love so I've got the app

public yet you can see that little bee
logo right there that is a upcoming beta
TechnoBuffalo app Google photos you know
what that is ADT Pulse to help control
my alarm at home google hangouts and go
translate which to me is frigging
incredible you talk to it and I'll just
translate things for you into other
languages of via audio incredible happen
boosts pianer lets me scan bluetooth to
see what the dresses are and straddles
cards another smart card I'll review is
on both of those smart cards as well so
you can see what they are but other than
being set up very very simply here phone
mail 231 is not that bad I usually it's
in a thousand so I've been really
working really hard to get back in box
zero I usually use Chrome for all of my
web browsing messages but you have
Safari there there's the case ain't use
it for anything else and that's it
that's all I got are there any big apps

absolutely hundred percent have on here
that I don't and you're like John you
