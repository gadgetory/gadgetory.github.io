technobuffalo checking out the new
special edition harman kardon version of
the HTC One m8 announced by sprint today
you can see it's got a black finish on
the back it's already getting some
fingerprints but really the difference
here is that there's Harman Kardon
technology inside the phone which
includes clarify which they say restores
the quality of compressed audio so your
mp3's and stuff are supposed to sound
better the phone also supports some of
the lossless formats out there that you
can get if you're a real audio file and
then live stage here works with the
Harman Kardon headphones that come with
the phone you can toggle these aren't
off for a more realistic live music
sound so both of these are supposed to
really really improve the audio you get
and it also includes a pair of
headphones at retail for about one
hundred thirty bucks normally but this
will retail will it comes with the phone
that costs 229 with a two-year contract
so it's just thirty dollars more than
the HTC One m8 that sprint already
offers but it obviously comes with
better headphones and a better audio
experience I asked sprint what that
means for customers who already
purchased the phone and they said that
they have a you know 14 day return
policy is normal but otherwise you're
kind of out of luck if you have gone
past that and prefer this obviously you
see the LTE connection here to sprint
spark device also supports the HD voice
that sprint talked about today that's
rolling out nationwide and I'm by the
middle of this year going through you
can see they put a focus on music
there's new Spotify agreement with
Sprint customers that they talked about
but otherwise it's very much the same
HTC One m8 that we saw before we've got
obviously the ultrapixel camera on the
back dual LED flash power buttons in the
same spot but I do like to like the
black finish it's kind of nice we
previously had only seen the silver the
gunmetal gray and the gold
so obviously Harman Kardon got the black
model here any case that's just a quick
look at the Harman Kardon it's a limited
edition HTC One m8 launching on spring
for 229 the two-year contract this is
