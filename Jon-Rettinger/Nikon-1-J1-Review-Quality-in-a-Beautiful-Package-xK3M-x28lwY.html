the one the Nikon one is this camera all
that ashton kutcher says it is and his
commercials find out after this intro
the Nikon one series cameras represents
the company's brand-new mirrorless fleet
and it's represented by the j1 which is
more entry-level
and the v1 which is for advanced
shooters now olympus Panasonic Sony and
Samsung have been at this for a few
years now so I was a little concerned
for the little j1 but have no fear this
camera did exceptionally well what we're
dealing with here is a brand new sensor
type pioneered by Nikon it's the 1-inch
CX type sensor and this is slightly
smaller than the Micro Four Thirds
cameras like the olympus EPM one and the
panasonic gf3
naturally with any new sensor or size or
format we have new lenses that join the
party but have no fear if you have a
drawer full of Nikon f-mount Series
lenses DX lenses there is a special ft-1
mount for the Nikon one cameras that
will allow you to throw that 600
millimeter telephoto lens on and that is
pretty badass so did the lens and the
sensor work well together well for image
quality on the Nikon j1 I was very
impressed I came in a bit concerned for
this camera knowing that I've already
seen the Olympus I've already seen
Panasonic what panasonic has to offer
and that's really tough competition that
j1 really kicked some booty even though
this camera has a slightly smaller
sensor than the EP m1 I feel that both
cameras were matched in many situations
and the ISO performance the high ISO
performance on the j1 was spectacular
the j1 also has a great movie mode it
has 1080 60 I HD video 1080 30 P video
it also has 7 2016 at 400 frames per
second and 1200 frames per second but
the resolution is so small it's like a
little stick of gum video quality was
very good in bright light though I could
have used a little more sensitivity in
low-light the camera did perform really
well so overall image quality with the
Nikon 1j one tantamount if not a slight
edge over its
Micro Four Thirds competitors now you've
probably seen Ashton Kutcher acting all
suave and debonair over this thing on TV
well it is pretty sexy when you look at
it it's very sleek and minimalist and it
has this cute little flash that pops up
and looks like the Dino go monster from
Star Wars external controls are fairly
limited on the Nikon j1 there's no hot
shoe unlike on the EP m1 and that's a
pretty big disadvantage especially if
you want to add a more powerful flash or
if you want to add a microphone an
external microphone we just have this
circular dial that also doubles as a
4-way directional pad there's a tab in
back that's for setting shutter speed
and some other controls in addition to
zooming and playback we have an auto
focus and auto exposure lock button in
the back as well so for the most part
this camera is very simplistic on the
outside rather than external controls
like the Nikon 1 v1 the j1 concentrates
on its color palette it has a nice spicy
pink that will have girls doing back
flips in addition the camera does not
have a huge tool belt on the inside
either for manual controls we have
quality controls rather than quantity
for instance the J ones 73 point phase
detection autofocus is pretty awesome
it works exceedingly fast one of the
quickest systems I've ever used in
addition this cameras pretty darn quick
it can capture up to 10 frames per
second at full resolution and it is
blazing four manual controls we have a
shutter speed that goes down to thirty
seconds with a bulb mode there's also
ISO of up to 6400 and the lenses I shot
with had pretty accurate vibration
reduction but if you're looking for fun
art modes in a gaggle of scene modes
you're not going to find it on the j1
you'll find it on cameras like the
olympus EP m1 and Panasonic's Micro Four
Thirds cameras but not on the j1 this
camera really does not have a lot of
that it's got active d-lighting it's got
picture control with vivid and neutral
and monochrome lows things but don't
expect any bells and whistles on the
inside the j1 does however have
excellent controls in video mode I could
set the shutter speed the ISO the
aperture it's just really one of the
best
video modes in the mirrorless circuit so
what's the bottom line with the Nikon 1j
one Ashton Kutcher's white stormtrooper
I'll tell you something it's sleek it's
sexy its minimalist and it specializes
in quality manual controls and quality
image performance so who is the Nikon 1j
one for it is for beginners looking to
expand their knowledge on photography
looking to break into the
interchangeable lens system circuit and
it's also for the ladies because of the
colors and the design I was mobbed by
girls everywhere and went with this
camera they didn't care about me all
they cared about was this camera and
Ashton Kutcher so what's the buffalo
call on the Nikon 1j one it's a good one
check the full review at TechnoBuffalo
comm for my image samples video samples
and more in depth analysis but the
bottom line is it's a gosh darn good
camera this has been Mike Pearlman for
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
