from TechnoBuffalo here not got an
unboxing for you of the Nokia search a
new Kourtney smartphone from 18t
Wireless this puppy's gonna run you
$79.99 on a two-year contract after a
$50 mail-in rebate this is running the
Symbian s60 wireless operating system
which is the most popular mobile OS in
the world and I've never used it so I'm
sure looking forward to giving it a
whirl the fact that it hasn't penetrated
the US market as much as it has Europe
and the rest of the world is quite
interesting so I am excited to get
cracking so let's go ahead and open this
up and you know what we got to open it
with the big old back so go ahead and
dig in the cactus tab myself alright go
we will slice our way in this was just
released a little while ago so it's a
very new phone actually a much bigger
AT&amp;amp;T box and we're used to seeing it's
much longer and flatter so there is
there's a picture of the Serge letting
you know on the front that it's got mail
it's got a camera it's got a GPS and of
course it's got a web browser and the
one cool thing about the web browser on
this is actually it's flash enabled
meaning you can go to youtube.com and
you'll see a web page it looks just like
it would on your home computer and you
can actually play the YouTube video
right from your browser in addition to a
ton of other cool Flash content that a
lot of websites have so let's go ahead
and see what else we got in the box
package contains box look looks a little
beat up but it's a new device so it's
probably the first one to open this
here's some specs its quad band edge and
of course HSDPA meaning it's 3g it's
four point four nine by 2.2 four by 0.39
inches weighs point four three eight
ounces it's got a 2.4 inch display up to
16 million colors at 240 by 320 it is
very nice it's got a pretty beefy
battery up to 4 hours talktime but
standby time up to 16
days it's got bluetooth and full HTML
browser a flash support like I mentioned
instant messaging PDF and there as the
smartphone features that you would
expect so let's go ahead and take a look
at the device we'll go through all those
features and when we do the review when
I did the review using the Royal we so
here it is welcome to 18 T on top of the
box
pretty simple AT&amp;amp;T fair that we're used
to seeing here is the device and as
usual just put that off to the side for
a minute it's like the battery is tucked
into the side go ahead and pull it out
see how big this battery is the nokia BP
4 L I know that they label out of their
batteries three point seven volt 1500
milliamp hour battery which is really
nice it's kind of thin so it's nice to
see a that bigger battery in that small
package let's see what else we got in
the box we've got the charger it's what
kind of charging port using a
proprietary Nokia port and we've got
your getting started guide that nobody
ever reads getting started CD and some
random AT&amp;amp;T information nothing
that's exciting over there so let's go
ahead take a look at the phone and it's
got a nice Giotto it's definitely a
plasticy material we'll go over all this
in the review let's take a look at what
we have on the front we've got a
four-way navigational pad looks like
there are two buttons that will probably
light up when it's powered on right
there and there are a few others right
on the side as well but it looks like
they need to be powered so they're
probably backlit we've got three hard
buttons right there
and you've got your full slide-out
QWERTY keyboard on first blush it does
appear to be a very usable keyboard with
some nice throw in the keys it's got a
great big space bar which I like we'll
go through all that in the review
alright take a look at the top of the
device you've got your two point five
millimeter headset jack looks like you
can also be used for the charging port I
believe that'll probably fill right in
there
we have looks like there's a USB port it
feels like it's probably microUSB let's
take a look well interestingly enough
there weren't any micro USB accessories
so that was quite interesting yep Micro
USB nothing on the bottom on the side of
device you've got your volume rocker and
it looks like a camera button to power
this camera right here so let's go ahead
and power this thing on and take a walk
through some of you guys like to see the
inside of the phone so here we go
there's your SIM card slot and battery
just slides right on it going to put
this back in this back goes on very
similar to the g1 I mean you got to push
a button on the bottom and kind of slide
your thumb all the way around to take
off the back let's go ahead and to power
this on and see what it looks like so
the power buff backs on snapped on there
so there we go it is loading up let me
take off the screen protector got that
whooshing noise continue using phone in
offline mode no so you get your
ridiculously loud three Geographic and
here we are and using the Symbian
operating system which I have to admit
have no idea how to use so take this as
a first blush of the OS like the
batteries got a really nice charge in it
and those buttons that we were looking
at earlier that we're backlit were
indeed backlit so you've got a stand and
an N key we've got two soft buttons I
think we have a web browser button here
we've got a menu button a button that
probably launches the email messaging
client which it does let's sort of
interesting phone it's got this lip on
the side that it uses when it slides out
to make it sort of a rectangle but it's
not so flush which is kind of
interesting that's like the device does
have a built-in accelerometer that was a
pleasant surprise as well interesting
let's check the speed when you slide
this out peers to be relatively fast
certainly faster than most windows
mobile phones I'll say so I'm very
excited to use this and give the mobile
OS estrade this is running the Symbian
OS I believe version 3.2 of s60 and
again the one thing I want to clarify
this is a two megapixel camera so hope
