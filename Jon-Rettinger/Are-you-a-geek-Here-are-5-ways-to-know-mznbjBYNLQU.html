TechnoBuffalo here we live in a very
tech centric world and the word geek
gets thrown around like crazy now so I
thought that I would give you guys the
top five ways that you know you're a
geek these are some that I came up with
some I asked you guys on Twitter some
Lucy helped me figure out too let's go
ahead and jump right in these are in no
particular order but tell me so I
consider myself a geek through and
through so picking the top five was kind
of tough so I took the Twitter with some
ideas and I had some ideas you guys had
some things I just saw a ton of people
say the same thing of let me go ahead
and jump in and talk about the top five
ways that you know you are a geek no
particular order coming in at number
five this is one that I do all the time
you know what phone people are using
just by glancing at it's kind of a game
I play on a mountain about are waiting
at the airport I'll see people using a
phone from the side I'll try and name
that phone I do it everywhere I go I
don't even mean to do it just out to
battle see somebody you know on a phone
at a coffee shop and I'll just try and
guess what phone that is and generally
I'm like 95% accurate down to the model
even if it's like you know iphone 5 vs
iPhone 5s I can tell you the same thing
with almost every device so if you do
that chances are you're a geek number 4
you know more about the products and
people who work at the stores this one
happens to me all the time I walk into a
carrier story team T or Verizon asked
question about a phone they're like oh I
don't know but do you want to upgrade to
our next plan I was like you you have to
know about the products that you're
selling I get it when I go to Best Buy
or Apple stores chances are you know
more about the products the people
trying to sell them to you number three
this is the one that I saw on Twitter
almost every answer everybody gave you
are IT support for your friends and
family like oh your tablet's not working
call John all your that's not working
call John phones crashing call John just
put your name in there chances are you
are IT support for everybody because you
love tech and people think you know how
to fix everything I'm so convinced to
this day my parents aren't sure why do
friloux so anytime something happens
with like their internet my mom's like
but this is what you do for a living
fix my internet number two
this one I'm guilty of I tried to be a
better person but it happens you judge
people just a little bit based on what
phone they're using I see somebody out
and about using like an iPhone 3G or 3GS
just like bro for an upgrade like really
is that things still run you'll see a
galaxy s2 and they'll be just like man
likes TouchWiz that sucks back then I do
it I try not to I try to keep it to
myself
and I try and stop myself and having
those thoughts but but I do
and it happens and makes me feel bad but
I still give it a sign that I'm a geek
and number one this was becoming more
prevalent for me now you know the source
material of all the comic book movies so
like Ant Man you see you just like
excuse me Darren cross was not the
yellowjacket and we're Richards hearts
defect I was a big comic nerd probably
encoding surprise to you I read most the
comics that are be turned into movies
the ones I didn't read that are out now
I just go back and reread I love Marvel
unlimited I can go through and read all
that stuff and it makes you a little bit
upset we're not sure the source material
and I get it doesn't know we translate
over but still you know it hurts you
just a little bit inside how many do you
get are you you fire five four five four
four five three four five I want to hear
what your number was any other ways you
think you might be a geek let's go
insert the conversation guys thank you
for watching till next time John Wright
enger' this is lousier Ettinger we'll
see you guys the next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
