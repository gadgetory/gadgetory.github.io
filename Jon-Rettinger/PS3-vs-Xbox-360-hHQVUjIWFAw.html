PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 this is
my second go-around with the Xbox I had
a 360 for probably a good year and a
half and sold it picked up a PlayStation
3 instead if I thought I would used for
whenever I decided to play a game but
primarily as a blu-ray player so time
had passed
and Xbox released their new Xbox
experience and with that came Netflix
streaming and a more streamlined user
experience so I rethought in Xbox 360 I
want to give you guys my comparisons and
thoughts on the two and if I had to pick
one console which one I would pick so
first the Xbox 360 has a fantastic
catalog of games
I'm absolutely fantastic it's got some
great exclusives a halo and the rest
gameplay is fantastic I think graphics
look graphically it's quite stunning on
an HD television but for me the real
killer app is a Netflix streaming
I've always enjoyed watching Netflix
movies and as soon as I went online it
was just another added bonus so the fact
that I can do that now on my TV really
is icing on the cake for me you can also
download movies from the Xbox
Marketplace and download games legacy
games new games all kinds of stuff the
Xbox really shines as far as gimme is
concerned when you're playing online
Xbox Live is fantastic although it is a
subscription service so you do have to
pay for it that's certainly a negative
but if you do decide that you want to
play online it's a fantastic way to go
it is a cheaper console depending on
which model you get I know if you start
adding up the Wi-Fi adapter extra
control or a bigger hard drive you ended
up at just about the same place as a
PlayStation 3 but you get a lot of
options with the Xbox whether you want
no hard drive what size hard drive
whether you want a black one or white
one you pay for all those choices but
you really do get different options
something to keep in mind PlayStation 3
also has a fantastic catalog games it
certainly has a ton of exclusive titles
for it and it's
how long he's growing rapidly the
xbox360 had about a year head start on
the PlayStation when it was released so
there are a few less games for the
PlayStation graphically the games look
fantastic I think even maybe a smidge
better than on the Xbox although my
playstation hooked up with HDMI the Xbox
hooked up with component on line play
not necessarily the strongest suit of
the console it's a little bit weak a
little bit laggy on occasion and it's
not terribly intuitive so if you had to
compare the two just based on online
gaming experience you have to give the
edge to the Xbox Playstation 3 also has
the PlayStation Network where you can
download games legacy games as well new
games and you can also download and rent
movies and TV shows it really has that
going for it as well with the biggest
draw for me but the PlayStation was was
a built-in blu-ray player if you own an
HD TV blu-ray looks absolutely fantastic
and at the time blu-ray players were
four or five hundred bucks I can get a
PlayStation 3 4 less &amp;amp; Galyen to play
games and have it be firmware
upgradeable which is always very nice
some of the blu-ray players you buy it
and the firmware that's on there is the
way it stays but the PlayStation you
know that film somebody's gonna be
upgrading it in order to stay
competitive so that was very nice as far
as functioning as a blu-ray player I
think the functionality is absolutely
fantastic
I got an external remote to go with it
so it looks an act just like any other
blu-ray player absolutely outstanding so
guys for me personally if I had to pick
one console actually gonna side now with
the Xbox 360 for a few reasons
I'm not watching as many blu-ray movies
as I thought I would and that's probably
because now I have Netflix streaming I
have an Apple TV I have a lot of new
ways to get content onto my television
as opposed to just putting in physical
media I don't play that mini game when I
do I do like to play with friends an
Xbox Live really just can't be beat you
do give up a little bit graphically and
I think you give up storage space on the
DVD versus of blu-ray roms that the
PlayStation uses but for me personally I
think Xbox is a better way to go catalog
of games and more my friends have an
xbox so it's not easier to gain with
more people that you know so I'm sure
people are going to criticize and
complain
say that I'm wrong and you guys are
entitled to your opinions and I'm
curious to hear what you have to say for
me personally the controller is more
intuitive and feels a little more
natural in my hands I have a little bit
bigger hands so the playstation
controller always feels a little cramped
for me but that being said there are a
lot of people that the PlayStation is
better for if you're a pretty hardcore
gamer and you're dedicated to some
PlayStation exclusives if you want to be
able to play blu-ray content and if
we're going to sacrifice a little bit of
online play the PlayStation is a
fantastic choice
so I recommend the PlayStation if you
want to use it as a blu-ray player if
you have no interest in blu-ray at all
and just want to play games Xbox is the
way to go if you do want to be able to
play movies on it definitely go with the
PlayStation 3 you won't be disappointed
just for me as far as gaming in my
experience the Xbox is just a better
choice so guys I'm very curious to hear
what you have to say I know some of
these videos can incite rage full
comments so please try and keep it civil
hope you enjoy if you want some
