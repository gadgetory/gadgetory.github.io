sprint and Motorola are throwing a party
in early June but why how many phones is
nokia having the hopper for their big
windows phone come back this fall and
our Google and Apple about to engage in
the war of all wars the war to turn this
into this and how do I manage to bend my
debit card anyway it's techno buffalos
rumor roundup hey what's going on
everybody I'm Noah crabbits
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo calm
welcome to rumor roundup for the week
ending Friday may 27th 2011 happy
Memorial Day weekend everybody whether
you've got monday off or not here's to
the beginning of summer and whatever you
do don't run your debit card through the
dryer when you're doing your clothes
after your big holiday party this
weekend it won't work afterwards trust
me on that one so sprint and motorola
send out invites to a party they're
throwing in new york city in early june
june nine they're getting together the
CEOs from both companies will be on hand
to unveil their latest collaborations
they use the word any little quotes
there because they use the word
collaborations plural in the invite
indicating that will be showing off more
than one device now safe money is on a
sprint version of the motorola xoom
android tablet this is a 10.1 inch
screen tablet computer running Google's
Android Honeycomb the tablet-optimized
version of Android that came out on
verizon earlier this year we're looking
probably at a sprint version of the zoom
that supports sprint's 4g wimax network
being unveiled at the event but some
inside sources have confirmed to us that
the headliner at the show is going to be
a smartphone that turns into a laptop
kind of like the motorola atrix 4g that
came out earlier this year on AT&amp;amp;T
that's the one you've probably seen the
TV commercials where the guys going
through airport security and all the
security guards gather around because
they're not sure is this a phone is a
computer what does it do what's this
crazy thing well the craziness is coming
to sprint apparently as a device called
the photon 4G this will be a dual-core
an NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual processor dual
core power
smartphone with a 4.3 inch high res
display a kickstand on the back for your
multi multi media needs all kinds of
goodies wimax support and then an atrix
tile optional laptop dock so check for
that in early June will be there
TechnoBuffalo reporting on whatever it
is sprint motorola have up their sleeves
earlier this week microsoft unveiled the
forthcoming update to Windows Phone 7
code named mango a lot of 500 features
all kinds of new integration with Bing
voice search and visual search all kinds
of goodies under the hood they had a big
press event New York City they did not
announce any hardware but Nokia who we
all know now is in a partnership with
Microsoft kind of a last ditch effort
really for both companies to stay in the
hunt in the in the mobile game nokia
announced it they'll be they'll be
unveiling not one but again multiples
that plural thing devices I got stop
doing this device is later this year
again unknown what device is what form
factors how many but more than one
apparently kicking around the nokia labs
can't wait to see those because nokia
makes great hardware i happen to be a
fan of the design language of Windows
Phone 7 but you know both companies
really need a shot in the arm if they
want to compete with the likes of Apple
and Google who are you know really just
pushing the mobile race ahead and ahead
speaking of Apple and Google what are
they up to with this whole getting rid
of my credit card thing earlier this
week two giants of the tech industry
Apple and Google were both involved in
announcements regarding this whole thing
coming to be known as mobile wallets now
this is a google nexus s smartphone this
is one of the very few smart phones you
can buy in America that has what's
called an NFC chip inside of it NFC
stands for Near Field Communication and
as the name might imply to you it's a
wireless system that lets devices
communicate to each other when they're
very very close together near field so
literally when you wave them in from
each other or tap them against each
other magic happens the magic that
Google wants to happen is going to take
your phone and link it up to your wallet
using something called wait for it
Google Wallet Google
an event just yesterday Thursday in New
York City where companies like spring
and MasterCard and Citibank and a lot of
heavyweights of the tech and financial
industry is join them to talk about
Google Wallet and google offers
basically the idea which is already very
popular in Japan goes like this your
phone has this NFC chip in it your phone
also has software that links it to your
banking accounts your bank account your
credit card account your debit card all
that kind of stuff when you go to buy
something if the retailer has a
compatible system like MasterCard
PayPass system which is going to be on
board actually they're already trialing
this in San Francisco to New York
apparently is going to spread throughout
the country starting later this year
probably in time for the old holiday
shopping system shopping season there in
the in the winter but basically if
there's a compatible device at the storm
you've got a compatible phone when you
want to buy something you literally just
wave your phone in front of the cash
register and the payment is made you can
already do this now with some mastercard
paypass credit cards and others similar
systems for their competitors but the
idea is everything will be linked to
your phone and that's it a couple
possible benefits for this you don't
have to reach into your wallet to get
your credit card if you're like me and
you run your debit card through the
dryer and it's warped well you know I'm
not going to run my phone for the dryer
actually there are statistics saying
that people notice when their phones
missing almost immediately within you
know matter of minutes but it can be
hours if not days before you realize
your credit cards gone so not only is
there a convenience factor but also an
added layer of security or so proponents
say for consumers and retailers alike
now apple's announcement was not
actually an apple announcement but it
was an announcement from a startup
company in San Francisco called square
squares been out for a while selling
these systems that plug into Apple
devices in the headphone jack and allow
retailers to use their iOS device as a
credit card terminal so you literally
plug this thing into your you know your
iOS device and it's got a slot to swipe
credit cards through and then their
software that lets you accept credit
card payments from consumers their
announcement this week they kind of
rolled out a more expanded system that
includes customized iPad with software
to basically turn an iPad
to a cash register complete with Google
Analytics style data that retailers and
perhaps small businesses especially
should really be interested in because
it can help them predict trends and see
when people are buying what and you know
set up smarter promotions coupons that
kind of stuff and then also there's a
consumer app an iOS app that again will
turn your device into a wallet now the
iphone doesn't currently have NFC so
there's one for the Apple rumor mill
will the next iPhone the eye for a store
the iphone 5 whatever it's going to be
called will it have an NFC chip i'm
thinking probably yes but in any rate
the app right now the way it is it again
links to you know as many of your credit
and debit cards that you want it to and
then it's got a software that's a
virtual wallet complete with what they
call tabs and cards and so you have a
tab set up for each merchant that you
visit and let's say you you frequent the
TechnoBuffalo cafe i heard they make a
good latte you go there you open up your
app you pull up the TechnoBuffalo card
and there's a menu and you you choose on
your phone while you're waiting in line
what you want to buy so you get a coffee
you get a buffalo burger you know
whatever it is may throw a cookie in
there and by the time you get up to the
register the transaction is complete so
you've paid wirelessly the people on the
other end see on their terminal what you
ordered so they can get your order ready
and there you go all you have to do is
say hey how are you good morning get
your food you don't have to exchange
money easy as pie or again so the
proponents say we should see this stuff
rolling out in a wide scale like I said
later this year and we'll leave you with
one more rumor since we mentioned the
iphone and i mean really what's a rumor
show without an apple mention more
information this week or maybe
misinformation about the so called apple
iphone 5 or like i said is it the iphone
4s I don't know gonna have an edge to
edge screen so even less of the bezel
I'm showing you this on a on a nexus s
but you get the idea less of a bezel the
screen taken up more and more of the
actual front of the device which you
know gives you more screen real estate
and also makes it look cooler and then
also just just yesterday some comment
from the UK that Apple PR in the UK is
apparently purportedly in
fighting UK journalists to fly out to
San Francisco for the WWDC conference
apple's big developers conference that
happens in early June now this is a
little fishy or a little interesting
because everybody's been talking about
how we're not going to have a new iPhone
this year in the June July timeframe but
instead it's going to get pushed back to
a September launch but if the Apple
iPhone PR team is inviting journalists
to fly from the UK to San Francisco for
WWDC that would make you think there's
got to be something big worth making the
trip for like the next iPhone but you
know that's why they call them rumors
our job is to track them and report them
your job is just to get excited or think
they're silly or do what you want to do
with them there you go it's the rumor
roundup for this week my name is Noah
Kravitz the website is TechnoBuffalo com
whether you like video whether you want
to read articles whether you want to
look at pictures we've got you covered
everything for your digital lifestyle
until next week I will see you later bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
