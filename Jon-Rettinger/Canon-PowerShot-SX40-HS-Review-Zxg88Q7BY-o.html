so much that the other brothers just
can't deny then bust a move and get
funky with my Canon Powershot SX 4ths
review Mike Pearlman here for
TechnoBuffalo reviewing the Canon
Powershot SX 4ths a camera that is big
it's bad and it's obscene and by obscene
I mean a 35 X optical zoom lens with 24
millimeter wide angle capability
this thing is a stalkers dream the Canon
Powershot SX 4ths shares many of the
same features with last year's SX 30 is
but take note of that name change is to
HS yes a new sensor is at play here
it's a 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor which
allows this camera to have a max 3200
ISO which is a boost from last year 1600
that's pretty big also the Powershot SX
4 ths receives canons new digit 5 image
processing meaning this camera is faster
it can take up to 8 frames per second at
full resolution in burst mode this
camera also has better noise management
and HD video has been boosted to 1080p
at 24 frames per second I noticed a
fairly significant upgrade in image
quality I was able to shoot at higher
ISO s and attain the same results that I
was able to with last year's SX 30 is
and it's CCD there was a noticeable
improvement in low-light and high ISO
quality 1080p videos were actually very
impressive overall image quality
definite improvement from last year's SX
34 a 1 over 2.3 and sensor this cameras
about as good as you can get now let's
talk about image stabilization one of
the most important things for a camera
like this you have a fixed lens 35 X
optical zoom I will tell you that at
full telephoto I was able to snap crisp
sharp images with this camera thanks to
the optical image stabilization this
camera also has new intelligent is which
selects from 6 different types of image
stabilization depending on the scene and
offers powered is for keeping the camera
steady during recording videos I will
say that it is a little harder to keep
the camera steady while recording videos
but for still images the image
stabilization is fantastic you'll notice
that the design of the SX for ths is
relatively unchanged from last year we
have the same flip-up flash giant chunky
mode dial we've got a hot shoe on top an
electronic viewfinder and we've got a
circular controlled dial in the back
also Canon retained the flip out very
angle LCD it's a 2.7 inch with the
230,000 pixel display I have to say when
you use the manual focus with the focus
assist that magnifies the frame it's
like trying to discern pixels out of a
georges seurat painting so Canon
definitely needs to improve the LCD
resolution on next year's superzoom I
enjoyed seeing my old friends again the
ISO manual focus exposure compensation
and self timer shortcut buttons located
on the control dial and one thing to
note about this camera is that its
battery is twice the size as most power
shot cameras so it lasted twice as long
so stamina on this camera very good
despite the fact that the sx40 HS has a
lot of manual controls it's devoid of
the super manual controls that you find
on cameras like the s100 or g 12 for
instance it doesn't have a histogram it
also doesn't have a neutral density
filter and the white balance settings
are pretty basic
aside from custom you could just do
presets the sx40 HS also lacks HDR mode
but we do get a digital light meter in
manual mode which is very helpful the
shutter speed on this camera can dip
down to 15 seconds though Canon put a
cap this year on the ISO anything after
one second it defaults to ISO 81 you
want a little more exposure say 400 or
600 and you're maxed out at 15 seconds
with shutter speed autofocus was great
on this camera it had flexi zone which
allowed me to move the focus box around
the frame I could also shoot with
exposure bracketing we also had multiple
aspect ratios to shoot in and of course
creative filters like super vivid and
toy camera overall the most prominent
new feature on the sx40 HS is its
improved image quality
and the best thing about this camera is
that it's price tag has remained the
same at four hundred thirty dollars this
camera offers better image quality 1080p
HD video new intelligent image
stabilization faster eight frames per
second shooting and expanded ISO up to
3200 and the same killer-diller 35 X
optical zoom lens with great image
stabilization for the full review with
image samples and videos go to
TechnoBuffalo comm until next time I
will see you guys later
