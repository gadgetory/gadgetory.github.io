note 7 the past week samsung just issued
a complete recall of the phone due to 35
cases of just floating batteries if you
missed our if you the note 7 I liked it
so much i bought one for myself this is
my daily driver and it looks like
they're gonna pry it out of my hands so
if you bought a galaxy note 7 the
carriers are still in the process of
letting you know what they're going to
do but as of right now if you should
updates for each and today is September
second so if you have an AT&amp;amp;T phone like
I do AT&amp;amp;T has stopped filling device and
then the process of determining what
they're going to do next if you're with
risin they've also stops line advice in
through September 30th they're going to
completely waive the restocking fee if
you bought one and you want to just
return it so to get opportunity maybe if
you got a few scratches maybe a little
crack on it and you want to return or
exchange it when the new devices are
available you can do that keeping tune
with the other two carriers tmobile has
completely stopped selling device but
beyond that they don't know yet they're
still finalizing what they're going to
do sprint again stop selling device and
offering customers who bought one a
similar device until the issue is
resolved so Galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge
for example this is close to
unprecedented for company and in one
ways I give Sam some credit for issuing
a recall now before there are millions
of more devices out there on the other
hand damn that sucks like big time hit
to the credibility of Samsung and to
note 7 you can argue it one of two ways
a good for samsung I'm taking care of
their customers on the other hand oof
are their products going to explode I
don't think my phone is going to explode
I'm not worried that give me my pocket
inch come out even if I did mention
review the phone got really really hot
and warm and those some explosions have
happened during charging so maybe could
be affected I don't know if I'm gonna
swap my phone out for a new one mostly I
just don't really want to set one up
again despite Samsung having really cool
features for moving contour for one
device the next but we will see what are
you guys going to do note 7 is usually
what what I want to know either comments
down below if you haven't bottomed that
seven it's gonna totally deter you
became one up are you going to wait for
the next
pixel google phones coming out
relatively soon or maybe go something
from LG or another manufacturer I really
want to know I'm gonna still keep using
this phone and hope it doesn't explode
in my pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
