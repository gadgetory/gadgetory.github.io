were having a nice positive day I'm
trying to be positive heading into the
new year
speaking of a positive things this is
the iPhone 10 R and my review of the
iPhone 10 R was not positive it was
actually the first iPhone that I
couldn't recommend I had a degraded
software and user experience despite
trying to phones and restoring from back
up setting up from scratch didn't work
the way I had expected it to with my
iPhones typically have you know iPhones
you might not like them but you can
usually recommend them because you know
what you're gonna get so I wanted to go
to the expert and get a different
opinion on someone who loved the iPhone
10 R and also be able to say was I wrong
about the iPhone 10 R have things
changed since the initial review so
ladies and gentlemen the one and only
mr. John Morrison I'm gonna ask you to
straight up am I or was I wrong about
the 10r and our friendship is on the
line with your answer I don't think you
didn't have problems can I say that I
feel like people mix up the use case to
where like I I genuinely feel like you
had those bugs like you're not the kind
of guy that's gonna make that up yeah my
experience was different and like if I
was gonna recommend an iPhone for people
to buy it's gonna be the 10r
just because it's like it has most of
the things that everybody wants
obviously it's cheaper but in certain
ways I think with portrait mode and the
single lens and the lower aperture like
it's better in certain ways so I don't I
don't think you were wrong I think you
had I think you had problems and in all
fairness I have actually bought two more
iPhone 10 RS for gifts so like I'm aware
that was probably an anomaly experience
so taking the 10 are taking my issues
kind of like out of it has your
experience changed with with software
updates are you still are you missing
the zoom do you care about the LCD I
don't feel like I do I find again most
people they don't care about resolution
they don't care about that second lens
and honestly having the the lower
aperture with the the main focal lens it
allows you to do things like if you add
something like a moment case and you get
the telephoto lens it's like the super
iPhone
smacks on steroids where it's actually
better because you still retain the
lower aperture and I feel like in a lot
of ways I don't miss that and it's weird
but like the OLED screen is better for
sure like there's no like anybody who
says it's not better just lying but if
you go to it and you get used to it it's
not something where I felt like I was
missing anything going to the ten-hour
do you think so a lot of questions about
the 10-hour way with discounts coming
and it's the first one that Apple and I
think they really tried to give a
full-featured phone you're not
sacrificing processor
you're really not sacrificing much in
the way of camera you're sacrificing it
in screen is really it reverses to
flagship and that's a very new approach
for what you consider not really a
budget but the more affordable for Apple
do you think that was a mistake and a
mistaken approach from Apple I just
think it was slightly too expensive and
I said it from the get-go if it was like
$6.99 just like that mental thing of a
phone being in the seventh and obviously
they're doing like the discounts right
now but just for me like them it's like
the same thing you go like to a store
and some things you know a hundred
ninety-nine bucks and it feels like it's
under 200 even though it's not and
something about just like that 749 price
tag just it made it feel closer to the
tennis and tennis mechs and it should
have whereas if it was like $6.99 and
obviously everyone's gonna say it should
be even yeah cheaper than that but just
like the mental thing of it's in that
like 600 versus like that 800 900 or and
you think would have helped a little bit
and I think the whole the markets in a
weird place right now weird place it's
not you know it phones have kind of come
to a point where the whole market
suffering and everyone wants to like
jump on Apple I'm like oh yeah my
phone's dead 10 hour sales suck
but it's like no one talks about Samsung
slashing the prices of the s9 in half or
that you know the note 9 was an $1,100
phone and now you can pick it up for
$7.99 on Amazon or whatever so it's just
it's more of the market as a whole as
opposed to if Apple did something wrong
with the 10r yeah so it's it's
interesting that you mention that so I
think apples held right or wrong to
different standards least the Blessed
perception to two different standards so
the 10r weather was a hit-or-miss
they tried something new and I think any
company who's trying something new
should be commended whether it ends up
falling flat or being successful you
know for every note edge you know you
end up with a Galaxy S 9 like things
paved the way for the next generation
and so I want to give Apple credit for
the 10r and I do want to say that
software updates and this is still a
foam that I had the issue with have
fixed ninety percent of my issues when I
try to call up Siri now Siri calls on
the screens not rotating on its own
without me touching it I haven't had the
reboots that I had so now I can say I
can recommend the iPhone 10 our
experience has changed I think it's only
fair to change the opinion with it right
like you make a statement once things
change
I mean I was wrong about a pixel and the
night sight I made fun of them for their
keynote you know like I mean to be fair
that picture looked like let's be honest
like I get it I was wrong and it's it's
amazing like what they're doing with
that but the picture looked a little
like come on like it was the pretense
was that we were gonna talk I have flown
10 hour but I have other questions and
he does not know other questions so I'm
gonna low you into a sense of confidence
all right what phones in your pocket
right now
tennis max Tennyson - not 10r no what
was the previous non-iphone that was in
your pocket oh it's been a while I mean
so I talked about this with Dave 2d the
other day I feel like the cliche tech
thing right now is to carry two phones
which I agree because as much as I I
still feel ugh I always want to have a
pixel with me just because of the camera
so like with Dave I think it was like
the Galaxy s8 was like the true like I
hate the term the daily driver but I
hate it like banned that word that term
please that was probably the last time
like I you know put a sim in there and
like didn't carry an iPhone but it's
like come on like what well obviously
we're spoiled in the tech world but it's
like you have the access to to the
ecosystem it's like I'm messages cool
like people don't realize how can being
on a day-to-day work scenario like
airdrop and like airdrop it to my
computer just
that's we do it you point a people
off-screen all the time in the office
alright so for me at least initially the
10r was probably one of my most
disappointing initial experiences what
was your most disappointing tech
experience of the year can I say like
the lack of air power or like new home
about air Potts does that count or I
think maybe I wanted more out of the
pixel 3 because I think it's a great
phone I was I was I was believing the
hype of like the pixel 3 ultra and the
node knotch and it's and like I said I
once I got it in that you don't notice
the notch but it's like I think the
frustration was Google is that like if
there was one company to deter own Apple
like you have all the money in the world
that's like fu money Google has why
aren't you why aren't you taking it to
Apple and putting the money that they
put into the research and the
development and granted the cameras
great the software is amazing but why
can't you get on the hardware level I'll
go with that so that was actually the
next question was what is Google done to
impress you in 2018 just late I'm
kidding uh I guess like nitesite right
like I think that's an advancement in
terms of like to act like and I want to
give credit for you not saying the red
hydrogen one from us disappointing tech
of 2018 see the problem is I didn't even
touch that either yeah I just I think I
looked at it once and I I knew it was
gonna be a disaster and yeah I just I
didn't have any expectations right yeah
I think that's the difference is like it
was probably the most trash piece of
tech of the year without a doubt like
but I don't think red did it for that I
think red did it because they eventually
want to get their tech into yeah Apple
or Samsung like they're just making a
prototype to say hey you know it's
marketing at that point because the
phone is just garbage what's what's next
for John Morrison this is like my 60
minutes big interview question I'm going
a little more formal what's next next
tell the audience I think I just want to
not get out of the tech game but just
keep doing what I'm doing and having fun
I think you can probably attest I
and I can attest Tech has got stale a
little bit everything's good I mean
everything is a varying degree of good
like yet try I just want to make stuff
that makes me excited and things I want
to show people and like things I would
run to like someone that I'm close to in
like this is awesome I'm going to show
you it in that same way so okay so
what's one thing that gets you the most
excited making awesome video or I don't
know I sometimes I go back and forth
between music or video but like the art
of it I guess learning you know the
science behind it cuz I feel like coming
from someone who never went to film
school we're never like learning why
something works so I think I'm I'm a
bigger nerd than I let on in terms of
like the actual science behind cameras
and and I guess that's been my kind of
mindset lately too is like I don't care
about you know on the Android side like
it's not that I don't like Android it's
not that I don't like PC I just don't
care about making I want to build a
computer I don't want to tweak my phone
I just want to make stuff whether it's a
video or whatever it is it's not that I
don't like it I just don't care about
overclocking my computer that's fair
alright so my last question if you were
Tim Cook or you're an Apple executive
what's one change you would have made to
the tenor I would have gonna hold it for
reference sure I would have like flipped
the world upside down and just eating a
little bit on the costs and I would sell
this thing for $5.99 and just take over
take over because at that price it's
like what are you doing
and add some fast charge in the box that
charging the box would be nice
still no fast charging no because people
people say it's not a big deal but if
you've experienced like USB to see
lightning it'll change your life
so you diverged from the iPhone 10 are
well suited so I wanted to come talk to
Jon have a conversation to people who
love technology and doing kind of
similar things for a long time and and
Jon's blazing a path I don't think
anybody else's has really blazed and
it's been cool to watch and see and then
say that yeah probably I was wrong about
the 10 art
wasn't wrong about my experiences with
it but in all fairness they has improved
since software so I can recommend the
phone again and kind of give it updates
on that front best iPhone of 2018
I'm not saying man anyway thank you guys
for watching John thank you for for
hosting us hope you guys enjoy it and
I'll see you next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
