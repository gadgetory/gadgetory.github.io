TechnoBuffalo with an unboxing of the
drobo mini which is a high speed
thunderbolt and USB 3.1 closure we can
toss up to 4 2.5 inch drives either the
traditional moving parts mechanical hard
drives or the much faster solid-state
drives for the utmost and extreme
performance now on top of those 4 2.5
inch drives there's also an msata slot
towards the bottom so in theory you
could pack in the storage maybe get like
4 750 gig 7200 RPM hard drives tosin and
msata SSD that's going to boost the
overall performance while giving you the
cheaper storage options of a hard disk
drive so as we continue on with the
unboxing we have the drobo mini text up
top the unit itself and I want to be
surprised if it is actually much bigger
than this right here because it is
designed for portability so if you're
looking for a professional portable
solution this should hopefully fit the
bill we're going to flip it on its
backside not going to need a knife just
got a little bit of tape to get through
it kind of gives you a rundown of the
compatibility that's both mac and
windows compatible also a rundown of the
box contents but i'm going to show you
guys that so i'm not going to be
redundant and go through that twice so
we're going to open it up right here
flip it around give you guys the sneak
peek inside and it gives us a welcome to
the world of don't don't don't i can
only imagine that is drobo so as we set
that aside we got a little plastic
material right here going to lift that
up and we see hopefully the drobo nicely
wrapped up a little bitty blanket you
sleep it in there so i'm going to take
that off set that off to the side i get
a quick look at the drobo itself will go
through the boring stuff after because
this is what we are here to see so right
there smack in the middle we have the
drobo logo flipping it around here is
the front enclosure this is where the
hard drives actually go in and I believe
this is magnets so go to toss at it and
you guys can get a quick look in there
on the back giving you guys a tour we
have the fans which is going to expel
the heat outward we have the dual
thunderbolt ports USB 3.0 and we have
the actual power input and the power
button and then above that there's a
little mini logo designated a name and
giving you guys one more quick look at
the front of the unit we're going to
open that up show you what it looks like
you're actually throwing a hard drive in
there and if you guys are interested in
seeing a full review with benchmarks
after i use it out for about a week or
so let me know with a comment down below
and i'll come back with a full review of
this guy lastly on the bottom here is
that msata sot i was talking about so
once you open this up you can toss in a
really small msata SSD that is going to
boost the entire performance on the
overall unit so i'll definitely try to
make sure i get ahold of one of those
before i bring you guys the full review
so now that we've taken a look at the
unit will go and set it aside and take a
quick look at the accessories because
they actually do include a thunderbolt
cable which is nice because that will
save you 50 bucks they're going a little
against the grain because it is black
not white like the Apple cable then we
do have a USB 3.0 the power brick what
you guys can take a look at right here
nothing fancy and lastly we have the
manual d literature and looks like a
drobo sticker so that wraps it up again
if you guys do want to see a full review
with benchmark speed test comparisons
let me know with a comment down below
now we'll be back in about a week or so
with the full review of this guy aside
from that this is john for bulls sign it
out make sure to check out TechnoBuffalo
calm for the latest and greatest i will
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
