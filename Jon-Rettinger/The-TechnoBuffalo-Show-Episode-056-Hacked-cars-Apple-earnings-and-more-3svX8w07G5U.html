Buffalo show I'm live your to host for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by deputy managing
editor todd hazleton everybody are you
doing this week Todd I'm good it's good
week you're ready for next week yeah
next week's a crazy week yes for those
that don't know we've got the one plus
announcement on Monday the motorola on
tuesday and then nokia is doing
something on wednesday yeah sounds like
that'll be v are related which is
interesting yeah that's not where i saw
nokia going but seems like everyone's
really see our headset yeah and i saw
that they had been i guess for many
years now somebody on twitter said this
had been researching sort of VR stuff so
while i came as a surprise to me i guess
some people have been following nokia
more closely aren't that surprised well
I i'm here to announce that next week
I'll be announcing the Sean tronic VR
headset I mean hey since everybody else
is doing it why not yeah why not so a
couple things go over this week first
off glad we drive older cars yeah
seriously we both drive on old trucks
and following news that yesterday that a
Jeep Cherokee was hacked on the room I
don't know what it is so bear with me um
the jeep cherokee was hacked by these
hackers in this wired article covers
exactly how it went and i want to read
this for everybody listening here we go
though I hadn't touched the dashboard
the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started
blasting cold air at the maximum setting
chilling the sweat on my back through
the NC climate control system next the
radio switched the local hip hip hop
station and began blaring skee-lo at
full volume I spun the control knob left
and hit the power button to no avail
then the windshield wipers turned on and
wiper fluid blurred the glass that's in
addition to the hackers being able to
slow down the car kill the transmission
all kinds of stuff and the craziest and
scariest thing is that he couldn't
control anything so like while the the
air was turned on he couldn't turn it
off and you know while the transmission
was killed he had no control of the car
that's
irvine me the one thing they did address
and that car belongs to those two
hackers do they have to at any point get
physical access to the vehicle to
initiate the heck yeah good point didn't
sound like it because I said sitting in
a laptop across the country but that's
good point maybe they had to first get
something in there and I don't know if I
caught that answer either yeah I I don't
know I I just noticed my core android
figures laying on his back he apparently
is taking a nap uh but it gets scary I
mean like if I can just go in like he's
sitting he's sitting on the highway when
everything like they tell him they say
get to get on the highway and whatever
you do don't panic and he sees like you
know everything's killed out steering
brakes transmission and he sees a semi
truck coming up from behind him that's
that to me is like like what do you do
and I never really thought about it with
these connected cars I always thought
was connected in the sense that you know
sure there's this LTE connection but
it's oftentimes provided by 18 to your
verizon and yeah there's bluetooth but
that's direct it's within 30 feet
usually an absurd to your phone like I
didn't see this as like a huge problem I
always thought connected cars were sort
of more convenient and not something
that hackers could get to and it's
particularly scary when you think about
cars that I've tested you know coming up
like Volvo has them and stuff like that
where they can pretty much drive
themselves so you know while his
transmissions out and stuff like that it
sounds like from this article you mostly
had control of the steering so you could
at least get off the highway but these
other smart cars they I mean the
steering is controlled by the car so
wouldn't the hackers have access to that
too yeah they would and to be clear for
everyone these were white hat hackers
they have learned Jeep to this security
flaw Jeep is issuing a firmware update
and they will not be releasing how they
did it until next month at a hacker
convention so that they have followed
proper procedure and Jeep was the first
people they alerted yeah and I think
they did this I mean they asked the wire
guide
you know come driving the car so you can
show you it oh and the one thing that I
thought was crazy too and this is
terrifying they brought up an image like
a video feed of themselves I guess on
the in-car system while they were
hacking it's so like he sees these
hackers I guess they were dressed up in
jumpsuits like that's terrifying man
like a joker come on and your steering
goes out oh if this did not require
physical access to the vehicle which we
do not know this is terrifying yeah I
mean because you know somebody's going
to release a kit that anyone can follow
and do it and you could end up you know
politicians could be taken out somebody
that you owe money to somebody it feels
you stole their girlfriend or boyfriend
hey I'm trying to play a prank hey
revenge porn is going to seem quaint
compared to if this gets out in the wild
yeah and that's horrifying I mean I'm
sure car companies are not software
companies i'm sure there was no way
going as anyone thought about the
possibility of this being hacked it's a
car i'll never be hacked you know I I
hope every car company is now looking at
their vehicles may I hope so too you
know they even showed they could lock
the doors now of course he could have
manually unlocked but you know suppose
that there is some sort all sorted
whenever I go out to her by and I end up
wrinting whatever vehicles available so
I end up in a lot of different vehicles
Mustang last time yeah Mustang last time
you know thank you to the nice clerk
that gave that to me so you know there's
a lot of different locking systems out
there some of them it's not obvious how
you can unlock them if you were to lose
control of that button you know and
that's pretty terrifying yeah I mean
imagining you got locked in the car and
they decided to drive you into a lake
yeah that's who I mean and the scary
thing is like even just the windshield
wipers like blasting the windshield
wiper fluid up on your windshield like I
mean you can't see anything if you're
going 70 miles an hour on the highway
that's going to cause an accident or
they could just want to take your brakes
they could also make it so your
windshield wipers don't turn on in a bad
rainstorm yeah all kinds of yeah I
there's all sorts of ways and talk about
a black male possibility oh I'll let you
drive your car again when with you in it
yeah you know when you give me your PIN
number yeah yeah I uh scares me like
crazy and such in Baja last should we be
scared that there are cars that could be
hacked yes I think you should be scared
guys like you you know hopefully like I
said I i I'm hopeful that every car
company with the connected system is
currently looking at their systems you
know and and trying to fix any security
holes and so on but for right now i'll
gladly keep driving my 99 tahoe which is
as dumb as a car comes yeah you know
just a long deck yeah i have a tape back
I and a CD player I mean wrong edge mine
does even in there although I typically
use the I use a tape deck adapter to
play you know i pod oh great if I taught
my ipod came back to life yeah that's
pretty awesome ok I plugged it into sync
it one last time with hello juice was
left and all the Senate started charging
so I still think it's on its death the
stuff medbay yeah yeah dad every week
there has to be one point where I can't
talk but but it's a light over now it's
alive for now I'm like that Android
figure behind you looks dead yeah I know
I I didn't realize he'd fellow so moving
on to our second topic apple earnings
and while while we're talking about
apple i'm going to resurrect for android
guy here
so apple earnings okay I'm getting
really really tired of all these you go
x and i'm eating air quotes you know oh
they only sold yo ex million of this
device is obvious that it yo its died
you know folks any company i can sell
millions of any product it's really hard
to say that's a dying product yeah
unless they're not making any money off
of it which isn't true for any of those
products alright that's sort of how
Apple makes its money because it makes a
lot of money off of each product sold
margins so you look at the US and we
have somewhere around over 300 million
people in the country so let's say you
sell three million of a product that
means you've reached one percent of the
country in a quarter yeah and that
that's that's bad news yeah and we're
talking about the Apple watch here where
sales estimates depending on who you
talk to you what an unless you're
looking at or like between two to four
million units but based on the would we
say about a billion a little over a
billion dollars it looks like that
segment made so then you'd have to
figure out the average selling price
between three hundred and fifty dollars
and seventeen thousand dollars depending
on the watch model sold so you have to
figure it's probably around five hundred
dollars because a lot of them are sport
models so using that math I think people
are coming in close to about three
million units sold which seems pretty
good and one of the points I brought up
in an article on the site yesterday
where I said the Apple watch is six
success even though i hate the apps on
that I think you know there's a lot of
terrible things about it still the sales
figure seemed to me to show a success
because you have to remember that Apple
is going to make money off of app sales
and stuff like that especially with with
watch os/2 I mean that's a
billion-dollar tens of billion dollar
market for Apple the itunes app store in
general so I think there's you know
additional revenue from that coming in
this fall and then you know this is just
an early first for one-off product you
know or it's not one off with the very
first product
gonna see more I think at an apple watch
too and it's still out sold during the
same time period the very first iphone
and the very first iPad Tim Cook said so
I think I mean it sounds like it's doing
just fine we'll see and I think unlike
the iPad at least where we've sort of
come in this point now and there were
like ten point nine million ipads sold
and people are still saying the iPads
tuned because look sales are down that
makes sense and there's not a reason to
upgrade so i think that the Apple watch
though they'll probably make it easier
the more reasons to upgrade as they add
an additional sensors and capabilities
for the apps you can do on it and stuff
like that and meanwhile the ipad sales
at 10.9 slightly missed i think analysts
were looking for like 11.1 million sales
iphones also missed that I think there
are 47 analysts were looking for I think
50 was a number of 50 million and you
think 47 million or whatever it was
phones and a quarter is credible and a
non release quarter yeah but they're
looking for growth in places like China
where I think we can see that that was
pretty clear because Tim Cook so that
was doing well but also they said they
had the most switchers from Android ever
and I think when you look at you know
United States thats who are battling
sure there's going to be switching back
and forth but in China I think it's been
primarily an android market thanks to
all the low-cost players there so I
think that's where we're seeing probably
a lot of the switchers well again yeah
these analysts sit around and before the
numbers come out they it's almost like
playing fantasy football you know they
sit around and they go well I think this
is Emma and they sold oh you didn't
reach the arbitrary number i said so you
did bad well i mean in general when you
see like it's a consensus among wall
street so you have like a super bullish
guys and the super bearish guys they're
saying like Apple didn't sell any
iphones so it's kind of like a
middle-range number and i think the real
bulls are the ones that are just looking
for china for huge expansion in other
places now I
we're 3 million units goes quick I mean
it's a huge market what when I used to
very very lightly dabble in the stock
market which just to be clear and for
full disclosure I currently own no
shares of any companies despite what you
all may think about me and apple or me
and Google i do not own shares of either
company but you know for instance i had
walmart stock way back when and i always
loved you when the quarterly reports
would come out and they go well they
showed growth but it's slowing there's
only so many places you can put a
walmart folks there there's only so many
people in the country you know at some
point growth will stop yeah and so they
have to find other ways to offset that
exactly exactly but it just uh it's
enough to drive you nuts at times but
well we've got some questions coming in
on our various subjects here from such a
Mahal the Jeep that was hacked and
remotely controlled was it connected to
the internet or was a hectare neither
way it was connected to the internet
through the entertainment system which
apparently that gave them access to all
the engine controls and dash controls
which more unlikely like my folks have I
forget what year it is best bourbon with
OnStar in it and you know OnStar is able
to call them and go hey your left tire
left front tire pressure is out of whack
yeah so there's sensors all over your
car and if you do have any sort of
connection then yes it's transmitting
this data which means it has access to
those systems yeah i'm going through it
again now mmm they went through the
UConnect cellular connection i guess and
then change the cars firmware rewriting
the chips firmware to plant their code
so that's how they did which is pretty
well from a brazen Franco but why does a
car access to the internet even mobile
time you know that that's a great
question and it's because people have
you know what I love is where you keep
fighting again
distracted driving and the more I get in
these cars the more I feel like I'm
getting in the cockpit of a spaceship
yeah my Mustang had more buttons on the
steering wheel than I have ever seen in
my life thingamabobs yeah sit and yes
I'm driving I'm like yeah maybe if I
drove this for a month two months I
would learn your words the volume
control but in this little bit of time I
kept going wait whether it's low I bear
watch the road exactly you know and so I
just I find it interesting that we keep
putting more stuff into cars yeah you
know I'm sorry I don't think cars need a
entertainment hub yeah and to answer a
bresson's question there the why do they
have internet plans I think a lot of
them do say you know you can offer a hot
spots your passengers connect or you
have Spotify or Pandora in the dashboard
or you want traffic or to search for
points of interest like a nearby gas
station stuff like that also if you can
do with your phone but it's just built
into the cars entertainment system and
then the carriers you know get you on
there their plans or you pay for it when
you get the car now uh because I that's
all I need my life is yet another your
another cellular playing yeah me because
I don't have enough from Sean the man 34
do you see a lot of Apple watches in the
wild interesting note I see Apple
watches on a lot of older individual
65-plus Sean have you been idea knees
people maybe they aren't that old and I
think you're being a little rough on him
I see nah like three or four in the wild
already yeah yeah I've seen a few in the
wild especially like when I was in
airports i saw one or two at comic-con
you know walking around so yeah that
they're out there I just it's not like I
say him every day yeah but I don't know
it that's an interesting no I do find I
find that interesting that you're seeing
it on over people that's that's
something I wonder
about because like my father is a
complete technophobe I i'm just now I'm
he is his first smartphone has arrived I
did not let him take it on this road
trip because I need to set it up and I
needed time to actually sit down teach
him what he going we got him a
refurbished iphone 5s okay and we we got
him a big heavy duty case because my
father drops things like crazy but this
will be his first foray into smartphones
so everyone wish me luck trying to teach
him that but uh most people in his age
range which he's 60 he'll be 69 this
year most people in his age range are
yuh technology I don't understand uh so
I'm gonna be curious i would love to see
a breakdown of the different graphics of
who's buying apple watches yeah me too i
would cast a skew younger let's just
yeah uh-huh that would be my guess too
but Bo we hit we have at least some
anecdotal evidence of going to older
folks so that's interesting from brazen
Franco what have you returned this week
Todd nothing and i still have my kindle
paperwhite which i'm loving which would
probably have been the gadget that i
returned yeah i'm already when i
finished one book i'm on the second one
I'm yeah I like a lot you're you're
letting us down Todd I know I gotta
start returning stop letting my wife
down well how about for next week you
just go buy something just just you
return it yeah just to return it well
that was sort of that was my kind of
plan with that thing was like oh like
maybe I won't like it I'll return it but
I love it so uh format to nucci hope i
pronounced that quickly do either of you
had to either of you who have used the
galaxy s6 over a longer period of time
have you started to have any of the
issues that apparently plug the phone IE
RAM management touch with slowing down
etc I have actually not even I take that
back i think i held in the sex for like
two minutes
uh have you heard of any no I haven't
well I don't use touch squeeze after the
review period i put on my apex launcher
but a lot of other people like other
launchers so and that and that's just
fine i know another in other galaxies
devices they seem to slow down over time
but one of the things that I know has
sort of been a complaint was just in
general android 5.0 ex had RAM
management issues and stuff like that so
I know AT&amp;amp;T I think all of the carriers
actually have updated to android 5.1
lollipop so that should address a lot of
it but I haven't really noticed that my
only did my biggest complaint with that
phone remains the battery life and to
such a degree that I don't really like
using it as a daily driver because you
got to keep it charged I actually I had
a question for you Todd I saved this up
for the podcast so we're hearing these
rumors about samsung and sony both
having events in august as opposed to a
tifa like they normally do yeah do you
you remember back when CES had a lot of
phone announcements that everyone moved
away from that to their own events to
mimic apple well for whatever reason
people started moving into Aoife you
think we're seeing another mass exodus
from a trade show two individual events
I'm sorry yeah it's starting to look
like that because we saw like you said
there was a moment carry or she used to
have their announcements to see us and
everything and then that everybody broke
away from that and then we started to
see if it got super busy like last year
was his busiest ever everybody had
something there so it was nuts and now
it sounds like yes like you said Samsung
might have something maybe Sony earlier
Motorola's next week it's good news for
us it gives us a little breathing time
we don't have one event where we're
going crazy but I think it's bad news
for Eva where all of a sudden you know
the trade show itself where maybe
there's not as much importance to put on
it and I'll be interested to see how
that what happens in February to with
Mamoru Mars because these are big shows
but people aren't going to go if there
aren't big enough at least the press
like the reason the press go to these
shows is because we're there
the big announcements but if there
aren't any announcements and what do you
do and I remember a couple years ago I
used to go and I think fans who have
been reading I guess for a long time
garmin nuvi phone was a device i think
that was announced but otherwise i would
go for like the first galaxy tab I think
that was like the only product announced
so we saw like this huge you know run up
into last year and maybe it's their
people were backing away which I think
it's probably smart of Samsung to have
this phone get it on the market get
people hyped about it and then the
iphones can come out versus that people
can start buying it versus last year a
couple years ago where they sort of come
out at the same time and then people are
like oh like which one do i pick you
know the thing is though if Samsung
moves the note 5 and the the note edge
plus shiny version whatever the whole
name is if they move those out to August
Naab which would be an obvious move to
try to beat the iphone right do you
really think someone that's interested
in the iphones gonna go oh I can't wait
another month for the iphone but this
one's here now no I don't think so but I
think maybe they just want as much press
coverage and all that kind of stuff
leading up into it you know all their
marketing all kinds of whatever's it
reminds me of like I keep thinking
remember I don't know I think you'll
remember this when I was on my honeymoon
people were like are you ready to go
back whatever it I was like yeah cuz the
iphone and the note i guess at the time
the note 3 had both hit the market now I
was super excited to go play with them
you know at the same time and now we'll
have a little spacing but I think it
gadget enthusiasts like all of us here
are the ones that would be like oh well
maybe I'll go with that or the other I
mean people that are hard core android
or hardcore iOS right no of course if
you're if you're a hardcore enthusiast
then you're going to go with whatever
it's not based on timing that's for sure
right but I just I find it interesting
that you know we're now hanging these
rumors of Sony phones also inagua
yeah well Sony's got a difficult battle
ahead i think that I mean they Xperia z4
for example was hardly a flagship z4 vie
for verizon finally that's the quad HD
display that I think is a comparable
flagship but they really need to get out
there in front of everybody somehow so I
would just say this sooner the better
maybe that's why they're doing it well
what got me about the Xperia rumor was
you know the Sony's been saying oh we're
going to try to focus our mobile
division to try and make a profitable
and all that and we get a rumor in one
day of for new Xperia phones yeah oh
yeah we've heard that before from
Samsung and the likes like oh we're
going to narrow down and instead of
releasing a hundred phones they release
99 yeah i just i don't understand what's
going on but yeah i'm going to be really
interesting what happens with Mobile
World Congress if the if the phone
companies are starting to move away from
the trade shows we might see Mobile
World Congress take the next step yeah
from d Norbert what do you think about
IOT internet of things as we are more
and more connected data mining is kind
of scary and hacking too um the other
thing that concerns me is somebody who
tests a lot of Internet of Things I am
currently fighting a battle of trying to
keep my self under my data cap I
actually am trying to go I'm the only
one home for like a week I'm trying to
use like no internet for a week at my
house so that I have a built-up surplus
when they do return yeah as for data I
don't as worked up about data mining as
a lot of people out the main reason
being I'm at the age where I know my
data has been collected if you ever
google my name enjoy the pages and pages
and pages of data on me yeah my father
for some reason is just flabbergasted
and whatever he tells you know he talks
to somebody like an old printer whatever
he you know if you google Sean there's
like two
fifty thousand results on him I don't
know why this fascinates him but it does
there's so much data out there on me
that I just I don't care there's nothing
exciting about me yeah why I think the
thing that is like you know google or
apple an apple oasis like we're not
collecting that data I don't but you
know when they start to save like well
we know what kind we know how you like
your house like the temperature we know
what time you go to bed cuz your lights
go off and stuff like that like isn't
that kind of scary and I think so
especially for hacking or or so do you
hacks in and then they know you know
when you're not home I per member when
foursquare was sort of at the center of
a thing where people were checking into
restaurants and stuff and so these these
thieves would know when they're not only
oh he's gone so let's go rob them I mean
then I think that could become sort of
the problem here but again if it's can I
get a connected house let's assume you
have a connected security systems here
like do something they turn it off um
but I'm excited about the the connection
the Internet of Things and you know
doing controlling my washer and dryer
one day and stuff like that the thing
that I that I don't like with data
mining stuff is is the health
information and you know I I guess I my
Apple watch is feeding it back to my
appt all the time but you know at one
point where where is it where do we have
this line where it's like oh you can't
get health insurance because you don't
walk enough then we know that thank you
don't exercise enough you clearly have
not taking care of yourself so this is
how much your health insurance gonna
cause that kind of stuff for ease me you
know because if you just kept that
private then nobody would ever know that
I can see in general though data mining
just it doesn't yeah okay like I as
we've talked on the show I'm a big
believer in loyalty programs and I wrote
an article about that not too long ago
on my personal blog it somebody was like
but all the data you're giving away i
don't care so what if you know i stayed
in marriott for eight nights good for
you now give me my free upgrade give me
my upgrades yeah yeah okay so i've given
up some data but i'm going
go to England again this year for
vacation and not pay for one night of a
hotel and I'm there for eight nights
yeah which is awesome but I mean I think
there's also generational divides here
between like our parents were my parents
are probably slightly younger than your
parents but we have you know our parents
who at least minor would never give that
kind of stuff away then awesome or like
yeah well it's kind of easy i get the
free upgrade or i'm just going to log in
with my facebook account i don't care if
they get my profile picture to you know
say my kids I don't have kids but the
next generation where they're just going
to be like will dekha jo I'm just going
to log in to everything I don't even
what's privacy that's kind of the scary
thing to me between the CEO say 60-year
break yet people that really cared about
privacy to people that never knew what
it was almost in that form now I I don't
know I I just don't worry about it I
just good the way I look at if somebody
really wants my data they're gonna get
it whether or not I've been date of mind
I it's just what every that's the cost
of it did they pay you get convenience
in return for your information mmhmm
yeah exactly some people don't think
it's worth it some people do some people
don't care some people do a movie on to
lighter fare from shauna man 34 do you
guys listen to any other podcasts I
listened to a ton I don't listen to any
I listen to what's long we loved cereal
cereal those it that that's really the
only other podcast you listen to yeah
that was like the first one that I
actually like listen to you and kept
going with no man i listen to smodcast
how did this get made tell em steve-dave
what say you occasionally check in with
Aisha Taylor's WTF with marc maron this
american life oh I took it back i
listened to this american life here
there there's something yeah views of
the news yeah I listen to a ton i listen
to a lot of them when I'm driving I
listen to well I will say this like an
hour and a half podcast may take me all
day to listen to because I have a you
know a dedicated button on my play and
stop button on my keyboard so like when
I'm between editing posts I'll hit play
for two minutes yeah well while I'm
moving stuff around okay now i'm editing
i posit yeah right right it was just an
entire day but I guess sometimes I'll
listen to BBC World Service but that to
me was I used to listen to it on the
train and it was a radio show so to me
if it's technically a podcast now I
still consider it like internet radio
now I I'm a big lover of podcast I i
used to i haven't had it for ages i used
to have my own personal podcast which
train to host a podcast by yourself for
30 minutes was never thought but in
general i just i'm a big fan of the
entire idea podcasting so I listened to
as many as I can nice uh from such an
Mahal what apps you mostly use on your
android iOS device um what you a you
know I've been open my own screens over
gmail and feedly yeah Twitter for sure
gmail constantly Oh weather com app
group me because I talk with my friends
and the google photos app those are
probably my baby spotify concert
hangouts i use hangouts a lot skype i
use some that's about it for massive
ones that like when i'm traveling then i
use like flight track american airlines
app tripit yeah stuff like that google
maps i use google maps constantly went
to Google Maps I ever tried ways
yes I use ways when we're driving to the
beach cuz the traffic is crazy I tried
it I was not a huge fan oh really I like
a lot I don't know why I just I didn't
then thrill do it for some reason i
think i prefer just having a set path
yeah and said and it does kind of bother
you like you know obstacle head like car
on the shoulders like I really get it
yeah I don't know oh let's see here
we've got a bunch of question so let's
try to get through I saw this came in
earlier from brazen Franco when we were
discussing his these hackers hackers
could release a kid to attack your
Carney so the NSA already has the kit oh
then I say has everything but not overly
concerned about that uh let's see oh
from Sean the man 34 Todd being you live
in NYC kinda uh have you concerned
having no car and just using uber when I
did live in New York City I moved I'm
literally just across the river but I
moved out a year and a half ago I did
not have a car now I have a car I still
use uber all the time I do when I'm in
the city and i also use taxis in the
city it really just depends and i'll use
uber here though it's cheaper than a
taxi is i'm in jersey city to get you
know if I want to go to the mall or
somewhere close by and i drive if i'm
going to the beach or something like
that you no longer trip so I need they
are you still go to a mall do you go
there for your morning power walks haha
well let's see i went to the mall I go
there like when I need something like oh
you know I'm going on a trip I need to
get some new dress shoes or something
like that cuz trust she's not easy on
amazon yeah i know i agree i'm trying to
find a new wallet and actually when Joey
convinced me to buy a Wii U which I
eventually sold because I was one of
didn't play i loved it i didn't play it
enough i went to the mall and got it
there sort of like instant satisfaction
if I know it's there then I'll go get it
yeah living in a small town though i
just i order everything oh yeah how far
away is the mall for
you the closest mall 90 miles uh I think
gars is three minute in three minutes in
hoover so it's like a four dollar ride
ya know I'm 90 miles from the closest
mall ah speaking of online shopping have
you heard about this and folks is not
paid uh have you heard about this new
site called jet com no I haven't done by
the same guy who I think he started like
diapers calm and which was eventually
bought by amazon well now he's back with
a new startup which it's kind of like a
wholesale club but online huh and the
more you purchased the more you say but
he guarantees that everything is priced
the same as amazon if not lower Wow and
it's fifty dollars a year to belong but
he's already got a ton of coupons out
there for like a free 12 months with
your first purchase free shipping over
thirty-five dollars if you give up the
right to free returns you'll get a
bigger discount at checkout wow it's KY
interesting i minus stuff is it all like
groceries and stuff like it's all like
household for now it's mostly like
household goods although i haven't dug
that deep it like that the explanation
video had like televisions as well and
intercept so i don't know it's kind of
intriguing it's an interesting concept
yeah this conversation brought to you by
gedcom know this as of right now
TechnoBuffalo shows still not taking
advertising uh from saw Raja do you guys
root or jailbreak I do not I don't it's
mostly out of laziness thing i did when
i when i played with phones like a lot
more or i was tweaking stuff and now I
just we're going through phones but i
guess i should say i played with them
less cuz i had more time to to but now
we're going through phone so frequently
i don't own the phones you know a lot of
them so they have to be sent back so i'm
not going to route or anything some of
the guys in our in our office both rude
and jailbreak the phones they own yeah
for me the iphone like the most i'll do
these days because i rely on like i have
two primary phones
or sim cards one's going through review
units one stays in the iphone and for me
it's sort of like a work phone even
though it's not but it sort of is so
like I needed to be at least like not
messed with at least buggy as possible
even though I have the beta the public
beta of iOS 9 on it and I know that
routing and jailbreaking isn't always
buggy or anything like that but just for
me I just don't want to mess with it you
know something could go wrong when I'm
doing something yeah in the kitchen ya
know I I just for me it's a lot of
laziness and also i just i don't have a
whole lot of motivation to yeah i don't
have you know like it's like I know that
I could do all these things with
jailbreaking you know with the city or
whatever it's called and I did used to
jailbreak like I said on my iphones and
used to route and stuff but now I'm just
like ah yes I want to do it I really
care I don't know I'll just put on a
custom launcher that I'm happy from such
a Mahal what is your galaxy note 5 wish
list keep an eye on technobuffalo later
today yeah uh from Sean the man 34 has t
be considered doing more how to's guides
and help post instead of just news yes
that is a frequent discussion the
problem is the amount of news that's
done how to's and that sort of stuff
they take way longer to write so it's a
matter of we can get out three news
posts or we can do a really quick how-to
yeah and the thing is they could be hit
or miss for us I mean some people aren't
sometimes you'll do something like oh I
was interesting so like i think i did
how to install iOS 9 probably did the
beta recently and sometimes it's people
just you know you can see there's not a
lot of interest in it so you're like oh
well i guess they didn't care about that
how to so then you gotta try to figure
out which how to using people care about
we had one that the people loved it was
like how to cut your sim card and that
one did well and the other one stone so
it's always sort of a time balance thing
to like is it worth the investment
to do something I forgot to bring i
haven't mentioned this to anyone so my
parents were finally switching from
sprint to t-mobile and they joined my
camp since i already had one so when I
went to get their sim cards and it's
been a long time since I went to get a
sim card you know they're now coming
with all three sizes no I didn't yeah it
hurt it's a pop out and then you just
keep the excess part around so in case
you switch the phone that uses a bigger
one but you've got all three sizes of
sim card in one sim card and so sweet so
you can always even go larger you can go
larger by what you do is you go ahead
and you place it back in the frame
mm-hmm because i accidentally popped the
Nano out right when I needed a micro I
was like oh boy I hope this works and
all I did was when I put the when I got
the sim tray out i put the micro size in
and then I dropped the Nano in the the
punch-out hole and slid it into the
phone at work fine Wow yeah because i
bought the adapters before and these
days i mean the only phones that really
use micro as opposed to nano usually
it's a slide in and you can usually
slide in the nano just right and get it
to work right well that's at least you
get to keep a guide essentially yeah
that's pretty cool yeah I thought I was
really a great idea I don't know why
someone didn't do it sooner hmm yeah I
rarely I don't get sim cards anymore I
just have my two personal ones right
exactly uh we'll be wrapping up here in
a second from brazen Franco worldwide or
states only for jet com I actually don't
know you'd have to just go there and
check I would my guess would be states
only but I really I don't know I i
discovered it yesterday afternoon i
actually Rory Troy you messaged me about
I guess it's only been open like this
week interesting so it's really new is
really new uh from Sean the man 34 Todd
what are your thoughts on be me one week
later oh I haven't used it we were using
it back and forth actually trying to
figure out how to get it going Sean and
I
I haven't used it since but maybe I
should load it up I don't know it was a
pretty cool i don't know if people use
if it's new social network and you kind
of instead of taking a picture and sort
of blocking you know your view the ideas
you just sort of hold it to your chest
it it does the short video clip beeps
when it's done and then posts it I think
I didn't like about this though is that
I couldn't see my own clips until
somebody else saw meadow knows their
reactions weird yeah uh from this will
be the last question of the day from
such from Baja have any of you guys
signed up for google project phi and
have you got an invite i think all of us
have signed up for project by i don't
think any of us have gotten invites you
think I think the office did because
they have a SAP out there but we don't
have it you and I no no we're we're
we're left out in the cold yeah it's so
cool that's all right it's better for us
you don't need another plan exactly uh
tell me about it man uh going to into
the t-mobile store to set my folks two
lines I was just like I don't want to be
any er there's gonna be the sim card to
let me leave yeah but oh well that is
