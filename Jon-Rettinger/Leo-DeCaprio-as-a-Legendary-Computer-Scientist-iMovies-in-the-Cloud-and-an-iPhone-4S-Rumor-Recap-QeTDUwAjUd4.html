to you by netflix is leo dicaprio going
geek for an Oscar speaking of movies we
all know a whole bunch of apples Jeff
just came out but what's around the
corner our movies in the cloud next for
iTunes and you know what it's called
rumor roundup so let's round up those
crazy iphone launch rumors and see which
one's panned out it's techno Buffalo's
rumor roundup
hey what is going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for techno
Buffalo and welcome to this edition of
the rumor roundup for the week ending
Friday October 14 2011 this episode of
techno Buffalo's rumor roundup on
revision3 is brought to you by our
friends at Netflix happy iphone 4s
launch day everybody you know whether
you're a an apple fan or not it's the
big news so definitely head over to
technobuffalo check out the other rev
three channels catch up on all the
latest pre-order selling out people
waiting in lines iPhone madness enough
said first off Hollywood computer
science match made in heaven Oscar bait
could be word is that Leo DiCaprio has
the inside track to play Alan Turing in
the upcoming biopic the imitation game
now for those you need a little bit of a
history lesson Alan Turing really is one
of the fathers of modern computer
science he was especially big especially
known for his work during World War Two
where he helped crack German codes help
crack the Enigma machine and there's
actually a test called the Turing test
which obviously is named after him and
machines that can run them the test
Turing machine you may be familiar with
that term but the Turing test basically
asks if a computer can produce answers
to questions that are indistinguishable
from human answers so he's had a big
role in shaping the modern world modern
theories of artificial intelligence so
there's a movie being made about turning
a biopic the imitation machine and Leo
DiCaprio you may know him from such big
time hits as growing pains there's a
movie about a UH boat to a head DiCaprio
said to have the inside track on playing
Turing and given Turing's life not just
his immense influence on computer
science and how big technology is these
days but also the rest of the story he
was persecuted for being gay he was
given estrogen shots and he wound up
committing suicide all kinds of you know
really just a great story but a story of
human tragedy you know greatness and
persecution
a really interesting story obviously the
kind of thing that may have Oscar
contention written all over it and Leo
may be up for the role have to stay
tuned on that speaking of Hollywood
reports came out this week that Apple
may finally be closing negotiations with
Hollywood studios to bring streaming
movie content to iOS devices Apple has
reportedly been talking to studios for
years now but at the same time the
studios have been interested in a
technology called ultraviolet
ultraviolet is linked to blu-ray discs
and basically would allow owners of a
blu-ray disc to stream a copy of the
content to another device so basically
you buy a blu-ray you can play it in
your blu-ray player and then you can
also stream a digital copy to your cell
phone or your tablet that kind of thing
the catch is that ultraviolet does not
work with Apple technologies just like
Apple never adopted blu-ray apple
reportedly not at all interested in
ultraviolet instead they want to get the
studio's on board with itunes and itunes
in the cloud specifically which just
launched on wednesday visa V iOS 5 and
of course today on the new iPhones
iphone 4s that shipped with iOS 5 there
were rumors that this functionality
would be lined up in time for the iOS 5
iphone 4s lodge that didn't happen but
now reports coming from multiple sources
that Apple and the studios are close to
a deal and if they can get the deal done
in time iTunes movies in the cloud may
launch before the end of this year if
not then early next year stay tuned for
that speaking of movies good time to
remind you this episode of techno
Buffalo brought to you by our friends at

and finally since it's a week that was
heavy on news a little light on tech
rumors let's go back and round up all of
the rumors that led up to the iphone 4s
launch iphone 4s available today
globally available today in the US on
verizon AT&amp;amp;T and for the first time ever
sprint along with the rest of the iphone
lineup so all these crazy rumors that
happen a lot of them basically the ones
that had to do with the external design
did not come true the iphone 4s more or
less looks like the iphone 4 there's no
aluminum unibody construction there's no
teardrop design there's no edge-to-edge
display the display did not get larger
it's the same three and a half inch
Retina Display found on the iphone 4
what did happen we're a lot of those
rumors about the internal technology did
come true obviously launching with iOS 5
Siri technology which Apple purchased a
while back a big part of the iphone 4s
and iphone 4s only in the form of the
assistant the artificial intelligence
see another thread they're turning
artificial intelligence weaving this
together it's terrific a big part of the
new iphone 4s experience you can talk to
the device using natural language and
you know your wishes its command that
sort of thing so that happened upgraded
processor of course the a5 dual-core
processor seat first seen in the ipad 2
is powering the new iphone 4s upgraded
camera 8 megapixels much much faster
shutter speed which is huge and 1080p
video capture also itunes in the cloud
functionality the photo stream automatic
syncing the wireless backup to the cloud
as well as wireless syncing to your
computer your pc or your mac backup of
your contacts and all your personal
information so a lot of the internal
stuff happened a lot of the external
stuff didn't happen and also they only
launched one new device they did not
launch a lower-cost iPhone either wasn't
like an iphone 4 4 s and an iphone 5
there wasn't you know an iphone mini
something like that what they did do
which is what they've been doing is they
knock the previous models down in terms
of pricing so the iphone 4 is now
cheaper the iphone 3gs still available
on AT&amp;amp;T only is now a
free on contract device and you know
it's fun to get caught up obviously we
wouldn't have a show called rumor
roundup if it wasn't fun to get caught
up in all the rumors and I certainly do
too but when you look back on it Apple
does sort of have a pattern of doing
things they launched the 3g 3gs came the
next year with internal upgrades you
know speed camera that kind of stuff OS
upgrades same design iphone 4 came out
new design for s now with internal
upgrades again with the exterior
basically the same it does set a pattern
an apple likes to break pattern look to
follow patterns then break them so who
knows that's why we're in business but I
does set a pattern for perhaps possibly
sets up a date for the are totally
revamped iphone 5 probably with LTE to
come out next June June July of 2012
when all of the original iphone for
buyers will be rolling off of there to
your contracts anyway all right if you
bought a new iphone 4s enjoy it if
you've already got an android phone or a
blackberry or Windows Phone 7 or send me
info nor a Mego phone or a feature film
that costs like you know 10 bucks a
month and just makes calls gosh darn it
enjoy that too whatever it is enjoy your
week till next time we're back every
