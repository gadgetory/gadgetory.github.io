to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo this
to show you could ask me jon rettinger
any question you've got from the wide
wide world of technology well this week
it's all tablets all the time we're
gonna talk ipad mini ipad 4th generation
Microsoft Surface some rumor tablets and
everything in between this desk to
Buffalo it's going get start so our
first question comes from user i choose
C do who asks John did Apple released a
fourth generation to counter the surface
and Nexus 10 tablets or are they trying
to change the release cycle from march
to april to september-october timeframe
so a lot of people were left scratching
their heads wondering what Apple was
thinking releasing a new tablet six
months after the new iPad was released I
guess now it's got to change its name to
the old iPad I don't think we're gonna
see two iPads a year from here on out I
think apple is resetting the release
cycle which i think is going to be about
a 12 to 13 month cycle makes more sense
to release a flagship product right
before the holiday season when it's
fresh when it's new and people really
want to go out there and buy them not
only for themselves but for family
friends co-workers really got to like to
coworker to buy them and ipad 4 but i
think this is when we were going to see
the new releases every year around the
October time frame for the ipad so March
no more I think this is when we're gonna
start seeing him year after year
certainly Apple knew about the surface
for months ago i'm sure they knew about
the nexus 10 as well i don't think that
this was a competitive move to combat
those the new ipad or the I bet their
generation are selling like hotcakes
anyway the ipad still represents 90 ish
percent of internet browsing mark the
chair and this was more of an effort to
reset their these calendar so hopefully
that helps enter question so there's
been a lot of talk about this guy the
Microsoft Surface how good is it should
i buy it is it worth the money and all
kinds of questions and that's what our
next user max wants to talk about hey
John help me be decide between the
windows surface or iPad 4 which one is
better so we've only had a few days to
check out the Microsoft service so i
cant yeah
answer your question but what I can't
say is that we will be doing a full head
to head slammed down throw down this
fight tablet battle to the death between
the microsoft surface with Windows RT
and the fourth-generation iPad soon as
we get our hands on one which hopefully
will be sometime in the next week so as
far as which one you should get that one
really has yet to be seen i will say the
first impressions of the surface it's
been pretty positive the bill caught is
absolutely outstanding build quality is
on par with anything that we've seen
from Apple it looks and feels different
my favorite feature so far has got to be
the touch cover this thing is really
neat it takes a while to get used to
typing on it but i really liked having
the option it's thin takes up really no
extra room in the bag and is really
useful so stay tuned to the coming weeks
TechnoBuffalo calm will give you a full
answer your question max steve asks hey
john i have an ipad 3 should i upgrade
to an ipad for and what case should i
get for either one so if you've got an
ipad 3 and you're looking longingly and
lovingly at the ipad 4 and it's
lightning connector and it's a6x chip
look away it is not worth the upgrade at
all now certainly we haven't had a
chance to review the ipad 4th generation
yet but just based on what we know i'd
say hold off save your cash for the next
generation ipad yes you're going to get
a little better graphics performance
yeah you're going to get a little better
performance overall but did you have bad
performance with their generation ipad 2
games not perform up to your standards I
chances are up until monday before Apple
announced the 4 generation iPad you
loved your third on the fourth one
really doesn't offer that much so sure
there's a lightning connector in there
after 30 pin is a relic and cherish it
so as far as what cover you should pick
well there are a ton of options out
there my ipad is being protected by a
red smart cover but you have to pick
which one's best for you hopefully that
helped enter question want to take

user mgl 1323 asks hi John as a college
student should i go for the surface RT
ipad or wait until the surface pro comes
out so i need to know a few things about
you first before i could best advise you
the first one thing i need to know is
you have another laptop or desktop in
your apartment or dorm room if the
answer is yes then the ipad or the
surface RT is going to be a great way to
go they're going to be awesome for
browsing the web checking videos or even
writing up short papers or notes not
going to be used for a primary computing
machine if you don't have another
computer you want to tablet that can do
both your best bet is going to be to
wait to the surface pro comes n
essentially you're getting all the power
of the latest Intel Core Series chip in
a tablet form factor you can plug in any
type of keyboard accessory you want you
could use a touch cover or whatever else
you like and you get the best of all
worlds I don't have to buy something in
addition so hopefully that helps answer
your question you got to pick what's
best for your situation thank you guys
