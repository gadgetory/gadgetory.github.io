up in my office not answering phone
calls not replying to emails I've been
like a hermit counting Mac apps so I
could sit here in this chair and
comfortably tell you that there are 1
million three hundred thousand seven
hundred and sixteen Mac apps available
and I challenge you to prove me wrong
and it can be tough to find the best
apps for your Mac computer so we're
continuing the series we started with
iOS and Android and I've got what I
think is the best and most useful Mac
apps available before I jump in though I
want to give a huge shout out and thank
you to setup for sponsoring this video
and making content on the channel
possible so a big thing all right so
let's start with Daisy disk this one's
not cheap it's $9.99 but I think it's
worth every penny it's the best app just
to clean files on your Mac over time
file up start to add up you've got
residual files you've got trails that
don't go anywhere you want to clean up
your computer it's gonna scan all your
connected discs and actually show you a
picture of what taking up space you can
decide whether or not it's worth
removing or not and skylights also
delete files right inside the app which
for me is a big deal we got a Mac with a
smaller harddrive this is gonna be a
really important one because your
computer's starting
so this next one is our producer Ralph's
actually one of his favorite apps it's
called unclutter it's also $9.99 it's
really cool for a couple reasons first
if you don't like a messy desktop any
files that you want to copy you can
store this little pull down that's going
to come down anything you've copied it's
gonna be a record of so if you
constantly apply to emails the same
thing like we don't give away free
phones because you asked you can store
all those things there it's a really
helpful utility you find yourself
opening up like a notepad or a text at a
document a lot this is helpful so you'd
actually type notes right inside of the
other ones let me help you an
organization storage and also make your
desktop look a little neater unclutter
is a really good way to go I think one
of the best features of Windows 10 is
the Snap feature essentially you drag a
window to the side and sort of snap in
the middle so you can have two windows
open side by side and I wish that would
come to Mac I was fingers crossing it
would come to Mojave but it didn't but
fortunately there's an app called better
snap tool it's appropriately named a
little bit cheaper here at $2.99 it's
gonna do what Windows 10 does but give
you a bit more control than that it's
generally just gonna give you better
window management you could snap one
those two corners sides you can do
fullscreen obviously you can also
customize personal snap areas if you
find yourself doing a lot of tasks on
one screen or constantly sizing windows
it's a really good app to check out
so while Daisy disk is gonna do a really
good job of freeing up space on our
computer I think we've been paired with
it is an app called app cleaner and this
one's totally free it's gonna help you
just delete all those apps maybe you're
not using anymore so first it does where
you'd expect it completely deletes Mac
apps it also deletes the weird files
like you kind of get associated with
those apps and make sure it's actually
uninstalled and it does all this stuff
and really simple UI that way anybody
could figure out even if you're new to
Mac OS alright so the next app is
definitely not necessary but when I find
myself using probably more than I should
as I have one of my conversations in
just emoji form it's called rocket and
there's a free version and a paid
version is gonna cost you five bucks you
guys ever used slack we sit here at the
office all the time my favorite feature
is to search for emojis or add an emoji
I just hit a colon and then like smile
or rocket ship and those are
show up I have to go hunt for it into
some sort of submenu this does that but
in any window you are typing in it's
really nice and if you decide to go for
the paid version then you can add in
your own custom gifs that you've made
and search for them the same way alright
so the next step is kind of a confusing
name but it's really useful it's called
bartender and it's got nothing to do
with getting you sloshed if you look at
your Mac and your OS menu bar can't do
much with it you can hide some of the
apps but you can't really reorder them
this lets you customize the mac OS menu
bar like completely free order all icons
you can search menu items it does a lot
of those little things for you that
gives you more customization that's how
your computer looks that the OS itself
doesn't give you there's a lot of other
stuff too
I liked I can make my own hotkeys for
stuff that I do all the time you can
centers almost in your menu bar you can
hide things and find them later just
gives you a lot more control for what's
there and what's showing so those are
the awesome things that bartender does
the downside is it's 15 bucks so it's
not cheap I think it's worth it
but if maybe you don't want to pay 15
bucks for one app you prefer to spend
like maybe 10 bucks for a ton of apps
then set app is gonna be one of the
first things you want to check out set
up is a new way to kind of discover over
120 best-in-class Mac apps really high
quality developers all in a single
subscription it actually it's a lot of
the ones that we mentioned this video
are available in set app it's a bit of a
different model but one I think you
should check out especially if you've
got a Mac and you're sick of paying for
new apps and then paying for in-app
purchases so all the apps are gonna be
updated there you're gonna subscribe to
set up gonna get a folder it's gonna
show up in finder you open it up you're
gonna see all the icons for the apps
that you want to use you get a preview
to see what they do double click and let
you install on your desktops they're not
taking up space while they're there and
these are apps that you would owe nearly
pay a lot of money for apps you want to
try and maybe wouldn't pay money for it
you find out that you love so it's ten
bucks a month so about a hundred and
twenty dollars a year you get a seven
day free trial to try and see if you
have something that you want so there's
like no risk you can download it scale
the aspic all I would pay for that and
then you're good to go over 800,000
people have already tried it and
probably loved set up and now you can do
it too suppose that's this it's a great
way to get the latest high quality Mac
apps right on your computer the only
thing you should check out setup I use
it I think you should too again link to
them down below so listen after 17 days
of counting apps I don't want to say it
but if you guys want to see a Windows
version I'll lock myself in there for
probably three to four more weeks that
will count all the windows apps that are
available if you guys have some favorite
Mac apps we didn't check out leave the
comments down below we kind of share
them with the audience it's a ton of
awesome things out there both free and
paid be a lot of fun curating this list
so let us know what you want to see the
next one
till then I'm John Ranger you
