technobuffalo huey new apple could say
at a news more than a few days and today
they finally announced a refresh to
their macbook pro line of laptops he
said long been rumored i even fall
asleep predicted them evidently a well
over a month ago delay was evidently due
to a shortage of the core chips that
evidently rival manufacturer acer was
monopolizing let's go ahead and hop
right into the updates in throws you
that may not know the macbook pro line
ranges from a 13-inch model to a 15 inch
models up to 17 let's start with the
little guys the 13s though what used to
be called macbooks they got updates they
didn't get updates to the new core line
of chips so the i3 i5 or i7 they say
with core two duos but did get a spec
bump the lower end was bumped from 2.26
to 2.53 and the higher end went from
2.42 2.66 and they all got four gigs
around which is quite nice price point
is 11 99 and 1499 and they now claim a
whopping 10 hours of battery of course
that's a sealed in non removable battery
but 10 hours if accurate is quite
impressive let's get sort of to the meat
and potatoes of apple's announcement
that is the 15 inch length that's really
where most of the action happens you now
have core i5 and core i7 chips kirby's
kind of wondering what are these core
chips essentially the architecture on
the silicon the trip without getting too
geeky allows for faster processing even
though the clock speeds they seem lower
so the now r i5 and i7 it's pretty much
across the entire line offering intel's
hyper-threading essentially that allows
for four virtual cores on a dual-core
processor so more cores batch processing
oh even though they do have slower clock
speeds apples plenty they can come in
almost fifty percent higher than the
outgoing core2duo trips so just to show
you it's not always clock speed that
relates to actual computer speed a lot
of other factors in there so these are
much much much faster on despite the
lower clock speed so the higher end is
going to have a new graphics card
well the nvidia geforce GT 330m with
autographic switching essentially what
that is it's akin to the Nvidia Optimus
technology what that'll do is if you're
just doing sort of like browsing you
don't need your big powerful video card
it's not going to use it just gonna use
an integrated card that's in there as
well whatever you need to use for
graphical power it's automatically going
to switch over to that graphics card
certain you'll get better grab
performance but you'll have decreased
battery life and when you're done doing
graphics intensive stuff like gaming
whatever you might be doing it'll
automatically switch back to integrated
so you didn't have to do anything
previously you had to flip a switch or
there was a software solution now you're
nothing to worry about it automatically
can do it for you and you're gonna get
improved better like because of it
because you're not always going to be
using the big beefy card and apples
claiming their new MacBook Pro lines the
1570s you're going to get between 8-9
hours battery life which is also pretty
impressive so the core i5 is you can get
in all the models start at 2.4 gigahertz
go to 2.53 and the core i7 chip goes to
2.6 64 gigs ram is now standard across
the entire models you can also now get
huge 512 gigabyte solid-state REM you
know all that solid saying goodness is
not going to come cheap it's going to
set you back another 1,300 bucks prices
start at 1799 the 15 inch which is
actually a hundred dollar price premium
over the outgoing models and they go all
the way up to 2299 on 17 and again they
are boasting 8 to 9 hours of battery
life on the 15-inch model to get a bit
more customization you can change the
screen options by default you're going
to get a 1440 x 900 glossy screen you
can upgrade to a 1680 x 1050 glossy
screen four hundred dollars more which
is super high-res you can also add an
anti-glare essentially turns into a
matte screen for fifty dollars more
17-inch to sort of stuck with their
monitor configuration which is 1920 x
1200 and those you sort of considering
the higher res frame if Nick higher is
always better sometimes it is but also
can make the fonts and
appear much smaller a little sharper
something that you want to check out in
the store before you go and buy just
some friendly advice if you look at some
really high res laptop like the sony
vaio p for example really really high
res almost impossible to read i'm not
saying that's going to be the case of
the macbook pros but i just don't want
you to go out there and spend the extra
money and realize that you can't read
your computer so what's missing for all
these updates well nothing about the
macbook air which hasn't received it
update in a very very long time and
maybe apples forgotten about it maybe
you'll see an update at the worldwide
developers conference or maybe it's been
end of life we don't really know the
math book line i remained unchanged but
these are some pretty significant
updates the macbook pro nothing
revolutionary this is more of an
evolutionary upgrade to faster
processors something that we certainly
expected don't underestimate though this
upgrade this core i5 and core i7 chips
really honest you know in action are
tremendous and amazingly powerful so
you've been holding off for a macbook
pro now it was definitely time to write
up and get 1 i'm going to get this
question all the time I've gotten older
macbook pros or to do a chip should i
upgrade well if you're doing things that
require faster processor speed you may
want to consider it this isn't just a
core two duo 2.4 bump to 2.6 bump this
is an entire review of how the computer
processes things and it is a significant
bump although i don't think unless
you're doing heavy processing you're
going to need it the core 2 duo chips
are still plenty fast although these one
new ones can potentially be fifty
percent faster which of course is quite
a bit so what you guys think are you
excited about the new macbook pro bus
was it worth the wait I disappointed
were you hoping to see an update for the
macbook air like I was or do not care at
all you just want Apple to shut their
mouths through sick of their news I know
there are some of you guys out there as
well I'll leave text or video comments
down below I'm really curious hear what
you guys have to say and I am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo I'll see in
the next video for life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
