to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State what's up everyone III
2013 is finally over we saw so many game
so I thought it'd be fun to pick my top
5 these are a no ranking order they're
just in alphabetical order cuz I
couldn't even do that picking five out
of all the games that we saw and played
was extremely difficult so at the end
I've got some honorable mentions as well
if your top 5 doesn't match up with my
leave it in the comments I love to hear
what games you miss obviously there are
a ton and this is completely personal
preference so let's go and get started
alright let's start with Destiny's gonna
be available for the xbox one
playstation 4 xbox 360 and ps3 of all
the products on display at e3 this year
one of the most ambitious is probably
bungie's destiny the first game from the
studio sends a departure from the Halo
franchise boasts a consistently
connected world where friends and
strangers play together in order to
build themselves in three legends so the
demo the world saw played live during
Sony's press conference on Monday night
was roughly the same as the one the
press convention-goers caught behind
closed doors it's gorgeous in motion
promises a massive environment filled
with loot epic battles vehicles and open
world events so awesome there the game
floored us during Sony's press
conference and we hope it floored us
again upon entry release and also it's
nice that Sony folks get some action
from Bungie as well having really had
their grips on Halo and of course that
goes to Microsoft number two you might
not expect this actually one of our
surprise games in our own brandon
russell loved it as well as did joey
davidson its plants vs zombies garden
warfare gonna be coming to the xbox 360
xbox one and pc what a fricking surprise
this one was like joey said in his eyes
on preview earlier this week he was
convinced at all the marketing drum up
from leaks from EA for this title or
nothing but jokes and jabs their own
franchises come on garden warfare plants
vs zombies garden warfare turned out as
a totally legit thing and beyond that
it's freaking awesome pits players
plants against waves of zombies you'll
select your speech season use its unique
abilities to engage in tactical squad
based comp
as we were told again gann during a
preview of the game this one is about
nothing but just pure fun it's silly
it's ridiculous that's exactly what
popcap was going for it's just an
awesome game you can see the plants hop
around you go visit the zombies and
Azzam buses in their mansion if you like
third-person shooters and you like
playing for two zombies which I like
both this game is gonna be one you're
definitely gonna want to pick up
probably actually one of the ones i'm
personally most excited about so next
let's go to the wii u a super mario 3d
world so in our top five this one might
be the most surprising to you folks
perhaps right next to garden warfare
maybe but though for our money there's
not much finer than a product in a 3d
mario game in super mario 3d world is
the wii u sequel to one of the plumbers
most outstanding out things in years
that was my my Mario Mario games might
not be your cup of tea but for Wii U
owners dining to play some quality games
seeing an entry like this is huge a
proper 3d Mario title and HD is
something a lot of Nintendo fans have
been dying to see at Super Mario 3d
World answers that call based entirely
on the franchise's pedigree we're sure
this one will pack plenty of surprises
and probably super odd mechanics next
this one is titanfall xbox one xbox 360
and PC so speaking on a personal level
titanfall wasn't exactly on my radar as
a must-play tyla before e3 this effort
from respawn entertainment the studio
that formed out of those who left
Infinity Ward a few years back like call
of duty with next at first blush but
it's already one I was ready to dismiss
pretty quickly titanfall is a
multiplayer title that pits wanting the
pylons and mechs against another the
game type we know is about a traditional
3-point capture and hold the premise so
far is super basic then we had a chance
to watch a full live match played out in
front of us and the game is freaking
stunning it's fast intense aggressive
and oppose a genuinely unique set of
mechanics and angst interactions between
pilots mechs and their opponents so
while strictly multiplayer titles like
this kinda don't usually work in many
ways especially in our gaming wheelhouse
what we saw titanfall almost demands are
freaking attention because of that I'm
super excited about it next title the
witcher 3 wild hunt coming xbox one
playstation 4 and pc so this one's
directly from joey davidson zone
words as someone who attends four or
five of these trade shows a year I'm
used to seeing demos for games that are
a year more away from release these
demos are normally little more than five
or ten minutes of gameplay rife with
cuts and jumps to be expected that dev
teams won't be ready to show off a ton
of action for game that's certainly far
from ready the witcher 3 wild hunt
though however rocked a full hour-long
entirely uncut gameplay section CD
Projekt RED developers behind the title
are kind of insane for taking a shot but
it worked behind closed doors
presentation is one of the most popular
in the entire show and for really good
reason wow that'll be open world its
environment is 35 times larger than the
one in the witcher 2 it boasts choice
and consequence insanely creative
monsters and next-gen graphics response
to it from media during the show was
fantastic and it's pretty well deserved
so get pumped for this one folks gonna
be good so we ran through top five but
there a ton of honorable mention titles
here as well Metal Gear Solid V the
phantom pain Mario Kart 8 saints row 4
battlefield 4 letters of zelda link
between worlds and maybe one of my
personal favorites ducktales remastered
ducktales woo there's a stranger out to
find you what did you just grab on to
some so i want to take a minute break
from all the crazy gaming stuff to thank
our friends at state farm for sponsoring
our e3 coverage insurance is one of
those things you don't think much about
when you don't need it but the second
something in your life doesn't go
according to plan insurance will be all
you think about they're obviously a ton
of choices for all your insurance needs
but when something does happen the most
valuable thing you can have is just
someone to talk to someone who can
reassure you that everything will be
okay and walk you through the process of
getting you whole again it could be a
tough time but stay far makes it easier
they give you an agent who's there to
help you any time a day seven days a
week if you need them three a.m. on a
sunday they are always there helping to
get you to a better State get help tips
and guidance live a better affordable
and more productive life so when you
guys say do you agree disagree with my
top five I want to hear you wait your
top five are leave your comments down
