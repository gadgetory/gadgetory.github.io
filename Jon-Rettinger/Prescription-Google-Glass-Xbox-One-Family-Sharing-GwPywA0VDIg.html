to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back to the episode of
rumor roundup there are so many tech
rumors going on every day can be hard to
keep up that's what I am here for
sitting here and this here chair to
share with you all the tech rumors from
the week you might have missed up this
week the iphone 5s might be getting an
even bigger screen in the iphone 5 the
xbox one family sharing plan the best
part of their crazy drm might be making
a comeback and Google's patenting Google
glass and removable heads-up display for
prescription lenses this rumor roundup
i'm jon rettinger let's start rounding
up so earlier in the week reported that
initial iphone 5s supplies could be
limited due to slow fingerprint scanner
production a long rumor feature that may
or may not make an appearance in the
brand new handset although earlier in
the week again Bloomberg came back
saying the rumor of the delay of the
iPhone 5s is allegedly due to a decision
to increase the handset screen size from
4 inches to four points three inches
making it more competitive to what we
see now based on sheer volume of leaked
iphone 5s photos we've already seen
Apple would likely have to trash
millions of already produced units if I
wanted to implement a bigger display so
what Apple's gonna do is still yet to be
seen I would wager though that we are
not gonna see a 4.3 inch screen on the
iphone 5s I'd say it might be a killer
feature to make its way for the iphone 6
fingerprint scanner same Retina Display
faster processor faster memory may be
some serious feature that sort of added
that can only be used the bigger memory
or probably what we see in the iphone 5s
so the xbox one family sharing might be
brought back to the console if the
public demands it claims chief product
officer Marc Whitten the family sharing
feature was a pretty popular idea which
would allow up to ten family members to
share in a pool of video games and the
savvy jumped on the opportunity asked if
anyone could be in your family cuz you
know like Ralph Hawkinson brother does
that make me family so Microsoft replied
at the very surprising yeah but
on Microsoft like any 10 people could
join in on your xbox one family and
share your video games which might make
your real family feel super bad wouldn't
set an interview with IGN responding to
a fan petition to bring back quicker
sauce previous drm policies let me just
clear that up for you people are now
trying to get back the drm there was a
huge outrage to get rid of it the
internet got all hot and bothered and
now people are saying bringing back some
the drm stuff because actually the ideas
weren't half bad so granted none of this
is set in stone and all Microsoft has
yet to officially confirm the return to
family sharing but I do give Microsoft
credit this is a more passive more
honest dance than depth sorry this is
how we're gonna do it it shows a company
that's evolving I think people are gonna
get upset you also have to commend a
company when they try and take proactive
steps to make themselves better and to
void terms of pitfalls they had in the
past you not to look back you know that
far to go to the launch the ps3 when
Sony famously said if you can't afford
the ps3 price get a second job Sony
learned they launched a ps4 very
differently in the serve came in the
heroes of this new generation Microsoft
certainly eat a lot of crow just like
big piles a crow a whole murder of crows
they ate and they're trying to sort of
fix those steps so you know what I given
credit so a patent awards at Google last
week suggests the company is working on
a prescription version of google glass
that would feature a specialized set of
glasses with an attachable heads-up
display looks like the computer display
will perch on top of especially designed
glasses using a set of magnets the
patent also details how that product
design will include batteries and
circuitry to control glass it will also
feature a communication device likely
similar to the microphone and vibrating
speaker that the current google glass
developer kit supports prescription
google glass could be manufactured using
a number of materials including aluminum
or aluminum stainless steel titanium
nickel and gold according to the patent
i will come in a variety of colors and
designs we still obviously don't know
when the police a google glass will
arrive though the company has hinted at
a mass released by end of 2013 which so
what the my calendar is not that far
away so he's been waiting to get your
glass if you want to be a glass whole
you might be on the ease in what
prescription lenses up so let me stop
