TechnoBuffalo comm and this unboxing was
doomed as an unboxing from the start I
mean you know when you get a phone
shipped to you in a box it just says
number 13 on it
I actually like the number 13 but a lot
of people look at it as an omen
anyway I shot the video and then the
files would not import to my computer
for editing the files were corrupted
apparently so in the meantime I played
around with the phone some and now it's
not an unboxing it's a first hands-on
it's any rate it's the Samsung Galaxy
Preval for boost mobile and issues with
the unboxing video notwithstanding I'm
still kind of psyched about this phone
because it's service is dirt cheap or at
least as cheap as smartphone plans get
right now it's on Boost Mobile it's a
froyo Android device Android 2.2 2.2 -
to be specific and the phone itself is
170 999 it will be when it comes out
later this month late April availability
through Boost Mobile online and then
sometime in May in the stores but we got
one early hence the lucky number 13 box
so 179 99 no contract if pay tax but
that's it and then 50 bucks a month for
unlimited voice and data and then it's
also on the kind of neat sounding but
unfortunately named shrinkage plan on
Boost Mobile which basically the deal is
if you pay your bill on time six months
doesn't have these systems in a row just
if you make six on-time payments they
knock five bucks off of your monthly
plan and they'll do that up to three
times so if you make 18 payments on time
and a year and a half which is a long
time but in a year a half you can be
down to paying 35 bucks a month for
unlimited voice and data fifty bucks a
month is already you know like $30 less
than what t-mobile is doing
you know basically I think it's around
I'll double-check this but I think it's
around $30 less than the cheapest
unlimited plan or close to unlimited
t-mobile for 80 bucks is 1,500 minutes a
month not full unlimited but you know 50
bucks a month way cheaper than what
you're going to pay on the big four
carriers from nationwide unlimited voice
and data but then you get down to 35
which again takes a year and a half to
get to that so that's a ways out but
over the course of a two-year contract
you could save you know 50 bucks $30 a
month versus $1 a month so $30 savings a
month would be $360 a year seven hundred
twenty dollars over a two-year contract
but then also that could decrease as you
go on so worth looking into anyway and
it's a full-on Android phone with the
market it's got Android 2.2 with access
to the Android Market so um you know you
can definitely use it as a real Android
phone not kind of a metro pcs has an LTE
phone out but it's not a full-on
smartphone that kind of thing
anyway the phone itself you know it's
definitely not high-end but for some
people it'll be just fine 3.2 inch
display it is 320 by 480 resolution this
is running an 800 megahertz Qualcomm
processor I've been playing around with
a little with the phone this afternoon
and you know it's snappy enough it works
fine we'll take a quick tour on the
phone you've got your it's multi-touch
it's got you know Android voice search
and everything true hoop blog all right
true who not sure hoop
true hoop log cool call old log theater
no cancel let's do it the old-fashioned
way I was haunted anyway I used true
hoop log and not technical flows site
for these Android homes because for some
reason I can't get out of mobile mode
sometimes in TechnoBuffalo and I wanted
to show you your the phone loading up a
regular web page it's on Wi-Fi right now
Sprint's 3G service is what powers this
thing
and it was working fine for me before
you've got multi touch capabilities
pinch and zoom it's it's responsive
enough you know it works well it's a
smaller screen but everything seems to
work fine it's got an accelerometer so
you can go portrait and landscape the
phone itself on the bottom you've got
four capacitive touch buttons on the
left spine you've got a rocker switch a
lanyard pork shoutout to Aaron Baker
lanyard port micro SD card slot comes
with a two gigabyte card pre-installed
on the right side you've got a camera
button Hardware button for the camera on
the top three and a millimeter headphone
jack power on/off lock switch on the
bottom micro USB I believe in the retail
packaging you'll get you know the USB
cable as well as the AC adapter but I
don't know that's what came with lucky
number 13 and then on the back it's a
two megapixel camera no flash I believe
it's fixed focus it shoots video clips
but pretty low resolution so you know
for me that would be the biggest
drawback I think is the camera not being
so good because I use my camera a lot
these days on my phone but you know you
can listen to music on it you can rock
the Android the whole thing you can put
up to I believe a 32 gigabyte card in
there if you want and you know what's
Android is some search some I'm sure
somebody's going to figure out how to
route this thing you also get it's got
GPS built in and you get tell nav from
what the press release said you get
TeleNav unlimited for free it's got some
stuff there's telling F it's got some
stuff built in you've got Frank think
free office
you've got the scavenger hat of course
Google navigation you got layer
augmented reality browser so you know
you can do some things with it and if
you're in the market for low-cost and
especially if you don't want to be tied
down into a contract it's definitely an
interesting an interesting option here
was looking before go back here
go back here - I was looking for John
for the Lakers video before so let's do
John unboxing the robot vacuum here so
the YouTube app you can rotate and it
goes into full-screen mode you can hit
the high quality button again this is
connected to Wi-Fi so it's faster when I
was trying to do it before I'm on that
Oh crash well that's it let me get this
playing here popping robot come on now I
want to hear John complain about how he
doesn't like to do housework just to
show you the YouTube app works well you
can watch YouTube videos no problem
you're not gonna have flashing this
thing personally I don't care it's
actually are you I don't think you're
gonna have flesh I don't I've never
really had a phone that did flash well
anyway but let's see maybe you do maybe
I'm wrong the phone does have swiped
pre-installed which is neat I'm not used
to using swipe but I was messing around
with it before and I liked it better
than I did when it first came out and
obviously it's become quite popular but
again you know an interesting option if
Sprint service works well where you are
yeah so and there you go but I'm sure
there's a way to shoehorn flash onto
here if you really want to anyway if it
works well where you are you don't mind
the lower quality camera the 2 megapixel
with the the low res video option it
doesn't even tell you when you you know
when you go in there you've got video
quality high or low MMS and that's it so
and then when you switch the camera mode
yeah there isn't even an option it's you
knew geotag but it's a 2 megapixel
camera so if you can live with that you
know you really want a smartphone the
$50 unlimited thing definitely is is
compelling to me anyway then again
there's a reason that I pay out the nose
to carry around you know top-of-the-line
smartphone instead of this so it's one
thing for me to say it is another thing
to put my money where my mouth is I
can't even spit the words out and would
I actually switch to the galaxy prevail
on boost I don't know but I'm excited to
find out I'm going to check it out
report back to you it'll be much more on
the galaxy prevail and of course all
those fancy high-end phones over on
TechnoBuffalo dot-com so until then
thanks to the folks at Samsung for
loaning us to prevail to check out again
the galaxy prevail launches in late
April on boost it's an Android 2.2
smartphone 179 dollars plus tax no
contract $50 a month unlimited shrinkage
so you can shrink that bill down to 35
bucks a month but it'll take you at
least 18 months to do that that's a long
way away a lot can change and that much
time well next time I'm Noah thanks for
watching
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
