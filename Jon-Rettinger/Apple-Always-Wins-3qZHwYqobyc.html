they've entered a ton of different
categories from personal computers to
phones to video cameras and even video
game consoles and whether you like Apple
or you're on the other side of that
argument one thing that you cannot argue
is Apple has had success a pretty common
argument to make against Apple and one
that I've made for years is that they're
very rarely first they sit out
generations they wait for new
technologies look at wireless charging
for example and they wait until they
feel the technology is ready to go but
doesn't even matter that they sit them
out I don't think you'll have one device
I think you'll have a full screen device
that you can carry around and you'll do
dramatically more reading lights off of
that yeah I mean I believe in the tablet
form factor the iPad was not the first
tablet Microsoft had been doing tablets
for years even Apple themselves had the
Newton there was a third-party
manufacturers I was taking a MacBook Pro
and turning that into a touchscreen
called the mod book but when Apple
entered the market it became very clear
that this is the way a tablet should be
done so 2010 when the iPad was announced
and it was pitched is like the Internet
in your hands and if you think about
what that mobile internet was back then
this was a pretty big deal sort of have
a larger display like the tablet market
back then was dominated by a thing that
was like resistive touchscreen so you
had to use a stylus and actually like
push into the screen almost to get it to
react so something that was capacitive
and this large was awesome I mean I went
and I waited in line I pretty much
camped out for the iPad and I maybe I
bought into the hype because camping out
for product that you've never used
before or new product category is
admittedly crazy but even from the first
day like I was hooked on the iPad and
it's kind of funny the way I used the
iPad on day one with the original iPad
is kind of how I still use a now I I
watch movies in bed with my wife I reply
to emails in the morning before I get up
use some social media on it but
it's it's always been a consumption
machine for me over the years and that
just gotten better as the tablets have
gotten better as the displays have
gotten better then I can just do more on
it but it still is the ultimate
consumption machine and certainly you
could do almost everything they can do
on an iPad now on your phone but having
a larger screen to do that on has really
just improved the overall experience and
still stay true to that original vision
of the internet in your hands
I love the current gen iPad pro for me
it's as close to perfect as a tablet
could be but even that close is still
not perfect we did a whole video when I
talked about what the iPad pro needed to
get better what iOS 13 needed to improve
the experience and we're heading in that
direction but the iPad changed
tablet landscape and it changed how
people use a tablet it really was the
Internet in your hand I don't think I've
ever seen an industry get more
reactionary then that first gen iPad so
iPad got announced Motorola was like we
gotta do something and then the zoom
came out with a version of Android that
was like just for the tablets running
honeycomb the tablet was so half-baked
and rushed if you wanted cellular to
work it was launched with Verizon you
had actually send the tablet back to
Motorola and they would add the module
in and send it back to you and I
remember i pre-ordered one I went to
Best Buy first thing in the morning to
get it to see what the competition could
do he looked at it and like this is it
it was really clear from day one how far
ahead
Apple was and then companies caught up
you know Samsung sort of entered the
market they had their tablet lying we
saw a bajillion Android tablets we even
saw palm or HP at the time entered the
market there was a lot of options but
one tablet the way Apple did things
succeeded for a reason it worked out of
the box and it worked well in fact
that's worked so well it's pretty much
decimated any tablet competition there's
still some of their Samsung's got pretty
awesome tablet options as far as market
share goes so Apple not only gobbled up
the market they killed the competition
in the process I think the iPad has just
followed the Apple mantra like they
waited they saw an opportunity in the
market
they just release a product that worked
really well didn't do anything
necessarily new but it did everything
very very well
so before we keep rolling with the video
hope you guys have been enjoying the
content share subscribe and hit that
notification bow so you get the heads up
when the videos are coming your way we
got a bunch of awesome stuff lined up
including some giveaways I don't think
you guys are going to want to miss and
again I want to get a big thank you to
this video sponsor log me ins go to room
so meetings are not the most awesome
part of everybody's day but they're an
important part of business it's a
reality that I'm sure you guys deal with
on a regular basis we do it here too and
it can be kind of a complicated mess of
setting up speakers cameras and mics try
to get us all look like we are in the
same place but fortunately go to room
has a solution this is an all
encapsulated solution that's crazy to
set up for four users easy it set up for
admins and it works really well you've
got an awesome 10 inch touchscreen lets
you control everything
you got a Polycom studio that's the
camera it's the mic and it's a speakers
and they sound really good and it's
fully integrated with GoToMeeting
actually comes with the license or
GoToMeeting so you know it's going to
work well if you have conference calls
with 250 people I have 25 cameras up and
you will look and sound absolutely
awesome it seems like something that
would probably be complicated but the
setup is literally minutes you plug
couple things in you've got an Intel
nook in the box the software is already
pre-configured you turn it on and you
are set and ready to go
easy to set up and it just generally
feels like you're all working and
talking in the same room which is the
best compliment that you can give you
know a camera setup try to find out more
check out go to room comm kick some
business so we're making a video about
the best Apple products I wanted to ask
people in the world what their favorite
Apple product was so I went to Twitter
we got a hundred and 40 responses and I
think a lot of people tended to agree
with me so the most popular answer that
we got and I will use Markland sangan's
answer iPhone it's one of their best
selling products ever to change the
world for better or worse depending how
you look at it other responses Patrick
cam Palani set air pods simplicity and
ease to use is fan
and nobody has come close that's true so
another product that didn't make our
list but if we had a runner up it
probably would have a nancial sag was
saying Apple watch series for I think
this is like peak Apple watch very
little difference between one and three
four I think they hit it out of the park
our friend leb said when I was a kid it
was my Apple two Gs I was in love with
that thing now I believe it's my iPhone
and I talked about business school my
former professor Raymond peru's was said
the Macintosh because the GUI plus Mouse
defined the era of bringing a modern
computing to the masses and that's what
the 1984 ad was all about revolutionary
in a big way as of yet unmatched by a
tech company Internet was bigger but
it's a different category so Ryan Negri
said iPhone and air pods both game
ecosystem changing products really
excited for the future of voice
technology
so you look back in the pantheon of
Apple products like the one that stands
out that Apple clearly did right it's
it's the iPhone smartphones existed
before 2007 I had him I loved them they
were most often called blackberries and
they were great and then the iPhone came
around didn't it changed smartphones you
only have to look at what Android looked
like before the iPhone and Android
looked like after the iPhone to see the
impact that Apple smartphone had on the
marketplace and since the iPhone first
launched almost every phone that's come
out whether you want to hear it or not
has been some iteration of what Apple's
doing if you look at the flagship market
look at the design language that Apple
started look recently at the notch you
see Android phones adding notches for no
reason other than to look like an iPhone
so as amazing as I remember the first
iPhone to be and as breakthrough a
product as it was it was a hot mess when
that phone first came out so 3G was the
big fan going on the phone was rocking
edge you couldn't record video on it so
obviously you couldn't send SMS the
headphone jack was recessed so far that
you essentially had to use only Apple's
headphones that were in the box there
was a lot of things to romanticize liked
about the iPhone certainly I just did it
in this video but it was still a very
flawed clearly first gen device I can
still hate Apple and I appreciate what
they've done for the smartphone space
Apple didn't wear these the iPhone in
2007 would probably still be using some
version of a blackberry you guessed it
the Apple iPhone so I member right I set
up the phone it was singular at the time
make my first phone call it's the phone
it's got to work and held it up to call
my girlfriend who's now my wife hello
hello hello the speaker was busted on my
first iPhone I was crushed so you hear
all these news stories there are lines
they were gonna be sold out and my like
geek heart heard a little bit so I set
my alarm I woke up extra early I went to
the Apple Store first thing in the
morning
and they swapped it out and I got one
that worked and I was happy I was able
to use it and then I went to a wedding
that weekend and I was the only one that
had an iPhone and there was a crowd of
people cuz nobody had really seen
anything like this before no one had
seen again the pinch-to-zoom
typing on a screen was still essentially
a new experience and everybody had
questions and how it worked but
everybody wanted to hold one everybody
wanted to feel one and see what it
looked like and you could tell at that
moment that this was different this
wasn't the next-generation blackberry
pearl it wasn't the new curve this was
something very unique to the market and
once you use the original iPhone you
knew very clearly that phones were never
gonna be the same so it wasn't
surprising to see the industry reacts to
that first iPhone and see a bunch of
clones hit the market but what's
surprising is industry is still reacting
to the current generation of iPhones
whatever year it might be and that is
changing a little bit right now we've
got thinner bezels phones that folds
cameras that are popping up but the
design language of modern smartphone
still stems from Apple you might not
like how Apple got to this point but air
pods are the correct way to do wireless
audio so the air pods like pretty much
every Apple product are not perfect no
noise cancelling is crazy still only
being available in one color no volume
controls the list goes on and on yet
despite their imperfections you see air
pods everywhere you see clones have
flooded the market and that's for a
reason they just work and they work
really well and they work unlike any
other offering a competitor has on the
market look obviously wireless
headphones have been around for a while
again Apple did not do that technology
first but what Apple did was streamline
the experience it seemed obvious that
those wires were gonna go
what didn't seem obvious that Apple's
design languages was gonna be just
cutting the cords essentially
on the earpods but it works the pairing
process is simple the UI is elegant
Apple took something that seemed
inevitable and made it easy to the
consumer you don't have to change the
way you do your things for the products
products just work for you I was so like
upset at Apple for removing the
headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and it
seemed like they were removed it so they
could sell you air pods that I resisted
buying air pods for a while just as my
own teeny tiny form of micro protests
it's in ridiculous they would take
something away and then sell you a
solution but when I bought air pause and
perhaps I got Apple brainwashed the
ease-of-use and how they could work for
me just make things a lot simpler I
never liked the idea of holding a cell
phone them to my head all the time and
by nature of my business I'm on the
phone all the times the fact that I
could just have those and keep the phone
in my pocket was super simple and like
most Apple things the UI is pretty slick
the first gen air pods just work and
what's surprising to me is how many
they've sold
despite like not really even being all
that great anything in fact they are
just convenient made these things fly
off the shelves
once Apple announced air pods we saw a
very familiar path start to appear
competition was coming out with some
form of wireless earbuds some looked
very similar and we're obviously clones
some were trying to improve the concept
but again as Apple went so went the rest
of the market following Apple making
videos on Apple is fun but also
infuriating you see competition coming
out with crazy new things foldable
displays wireless charging at the time
LTE 3G the list goes on and on and you
wait for Apple you wait to see if they
care you wait to see if Apple is ever
gonna do it and when they do eventually
enter they're never first but usually
their interpretation of that new
technology that new product usually
works very well from the start and is
almost always better than the
competition who might
been at it for years so we can debate
all we want whether or not Apple made
the right moves entering these markets
but you have to do is look at the
competition that's left and the market
share to know that they did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
