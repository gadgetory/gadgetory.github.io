technobuffalo here with my biggest
giveaway video yet let's get started you
guys follow my channel you'll know I
love to do giveaways I think it's an
awesome chance to show my appreciation
to the audience and to give back to the
community that really supports me so I
teamed up yet again with the folks at
blippy to give away i'm guessing you
know by the title a brand spankin new
mac mini that's right a brand new mac
mini guy another question you are asking
probably right the second is John will
this be open to people outside of the US
and the answer which I am so proud to
say is yes it will be open as long as
you were on this planet which is Earth
you can win a brand new mac mini so how
are you going to have to win and how is
it going to work if you're outside of
the US all right so let's start with the
outside of us stuff first people speak
different languages the may be problems
with power adapters so if you are
outside the US and you win this giveaway
I am going to give you the cash
equivalents of a brand new mac mini
which is seven hundred dollars u.s. so
if you're outside of the United States
any witness all you're going to need is
some sort of PayPal account or an
address where you can send the check and
i will send you the cash equivalents of
a mac mini that's a cash equivalent us
of 700 bucks which i think is pretty
cool and you can use it to buy yourself
a mac mini you can use it to buy
whatever you like save it it will be
yours if you are in the US and you win
well that's pretty obvious the Mac Mini
is going to go to you so outside the US
cash inside the US mac mini awesome
hopefully that will make everybody happy
it's sort of difficult to do a hardware
giveaway outside of the country you have
to worry about tariffs you have to worry
about different plug outlets language
people might speak I thought this would
just make it easier and get everybody a
chance to win so what are you going to
have to do
well it's going to be very similar to
the last giveaway that i did with blippy
when i gave away a brand new ipad you've
got to do just a very few simple things
first chances are you already are you
got to be subscribed to me on youtube
number two you need to follow me on
blippy and there'll be links to all this
business down below as some explanations
as well I wish the profile is blippy
calm / technobuffalo so give me a follow
and soon as you give me a follow you are
going to get one entry as soon as you
review something on blippi blippi is a
site where you can review anything from
movies to mobile applications two games
to obviously electronics if you review
anything on your blippy account see you
are going to get two entries now you can
only review you can review as much as
you want but for each review you're only
going to get two entries total so you
can make 10 reviews on blippy which is
pretty cool site you should but you're
only going to be able to get two extra
entries so let me recap everything here
to make sure it is nice and clear oh
that doesn't look like nice and clear
you need to just follow me on youtube
super easy chances are you already won
give me a follow-on blippy which is a
blip a calm / technobuffalo and you're
going to get one entry if you write a
review on your blippy account you're
going to get two entries so the most
entries you can get is going to be to
most people may just get one if they
just want to follow but if you want to
use the Site you want to review
something and put something up there
you're going to get an extra entry
hopefully that makes sense so most you
can get yet again is two entries to this
contest so next question you're asking
John what is this going to end well this
contest is going to end at eleven
fifty-nine p.m. pacific time on sunday
january second and i will announce the
winner on monday january third on a live
show i'll give more details about that
as we get closer so it doesn't matter
what time zone you are in the world it's
going to end at eleven fifty-nine p.m.
pacific time hopefully guys this is very
clear all the explanations are going to
be down and the what-have-you so you can
check them out I'm really excited to be
able to give away this really cool
product and be able to open it up to
everybody in the world to be able to
offer just a bit of cash so I hope you
guys enjoy and I hope that this giveaway
is fun let's go ahead and get started
