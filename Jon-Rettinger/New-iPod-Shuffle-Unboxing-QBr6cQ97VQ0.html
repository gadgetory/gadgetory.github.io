TechnoBuffalo here we're going to take a
look at the just released new iPod
shuffle this is the one with voice over
and buttons so let's shuffle up and deal
alright so that's just arrived from
Apple and probably unnecessary large box
we'll go ahead and dig in with the big
ol knife hopefully won't slice any
fingers here ok the path paper or just
dig through it one of the two there we
go alright so here is the iPod shuffle
go ahead and push this off to the side
for just a minute it comes in a very
teeny tiny little shuffle like box let's
go ahead and see we can get this plastic
off it this sleeve won't come on it when
you buy it in the store there's just how
they ship it doesn't peel that off there
it is iPod shuffle very very very thin
let's go ahead and open this up this
should be a piece of tape somewhere
around here there it is
so go ahead and rip that off shuffle is
a great Little Gym iPod it holds two
gigs and music so a pretty decent amount
you can obviously see what you're
controlling but you can't tell it to
control different playlists hence the
voice over part so you can say play
playlist gym and they'll play your gym
playlist go ahead and pull this out and
see what else we're going to get in the
box we've got to do a lot of zooming in
since is a very tiny player so designed
by Apple in California go ahead and pull
this out start here you've got some
headphones I assume have a microphone
built in somewhere for the voice-over
stuff or perhaps it does not we also
have the USB to 3.5 millimeter
connection jack which how you're going
to sync your iPod shuffle a little bit
surprised you don't have any sort of
microphone on these are just sort of
Apple standard headphones and here we've
got the shuffle itself I bought it in
blue go ahead and peel off that plastic
on the bottom should just unclip so
let's take a look at the shuffle it's
got through
iPod button array you've got your volume
up and down play pause and then track
forward and back you've got a lock
button on the top and a button on the
top of it button right next to a smooth
activates the voice control i've 3.5
millimeter headset jack and nothing and
you got a clip on the back now this
looks very similar to two generations
ago ipod shuffle as well let's go ahead
and see what the difference in these two
are you can see there's definitely
significant size difference here looks
like yeah lopped off almost half an inch
you get exactly the same looking product
so you can see what those two look like
stacked next to each other very very
very small the live pod thing weighs I
mean feels like it weighs almost nothing
let's go ahead and take one last look at
and for a size comparison to get a sense
of how big this is here is a standard US
quarter you can see that the quarter
comes very close to matching the size of
the shuffle they go ahead and put that
right on top see it takes up pretty
large portion of it so this is a very
very very small device see how it's
gonna look in your hand if I clip it to
your jacket or clip it to your backpack
and get your tunes on as you're going to
be plenty of free weight on your
shoulders because this thing takes up
absolutely nothing you're wondering
dimensions it is one point one four
inches long point three four inches
thick and point one to four wide and
you're going to get up to 15 hours of
audio playback on it's two gigabyte
flash drive which is pretty impressive
it actually has an eight percent charge
on two hours and fully charged in about
three hours this thing is going to
charge up very very quickly of course
I'll use it I'll show you how it works
yeah the voiceover works maybe you don't
even need a microphone
maybe it's built in here somehow we'll
give it a shot and see how it all comes
together
stay tuned of course for all the content
and all of the coverage on the upcoming
ipod line and we're starting with the
new shuffle I'm John Breton jure from
TechnoBuffalo
stay in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
