to you by Linda what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of a Retton
Jers riffs I'm realist John wrencher
this is the show where I just talk about
anything and we're looking super
electronic sometimes their rants
sometimes their rays sometimes are
nonsensical sometimes I'm sitting like
eight stories up my high horse but it's
always something that's going on in my
mind so this whole week and part of last
week I've been reviewing the HTC One m8
and prior I have been using an iPhone 5s
so I want to sort of share my experience
what it's like for someone like you who
might be considering picking up you know
either the HTC One m8 or the Galaxy s5
or another Android device maybe has been
an iOS stalwart some of the harder
things that I've encountered and what we
can do to possibly mitigate them so
let's go ahead and get started so I've
had the awesome privilege the past week
of checking out this guy the HTC One m8
and prior to that as I proposed I have
been reviewing at least for the past
probably four months I've been using an
iPhone 5s and switching full time to the
HTC One m8 I run into some difficulties
this isn't an iOS which is an Android
type video or what side you're on but a
lot of people switch back if we're from
the west's so for those of you folks
that maybe are using iOS now thinking
about going to Android here's some
difficulties that I ran into and maybe
we can crowdsource some solutions for
them the first one is iMessage so a lot
of people are still trying to send
messages to my phone number via iMessage
they weren't using the email address
associated with it as well so text
messages we're bouncing back which means
I didn't get a lot of tech messages
which was also kind of nice for the
first few days until people realize that
I was no longer using iMessage and then
it's a little knowing to not be able to
use iMessage now obviously there a ton
of alternatives I've talked about bbm
there's whatsapp and such I would be
prepared when you switch to get some
lost tech messages along the way people
automatically associate your phone
number with iMessage and maybe not the
email so bear that in mind and along
those lines as well if you have an iPad
another Apple device at home there's
text messages that people think they're
sending might actually just get sent to
those devices so you might not even get
them until you take a look at your iPad
so that's kind of a bit of an annoyance
so the next issue has to do with photos
and iCloud I as I mentioned seem to
mention all my videos I got a little kid
at home I take a lot of pictures and I
loved when I snapped a picture with my
iPhone
automatically sync to iCloud and I could
view it on my iPad and I could do a
shared guide and my wife could see it I
don't have this you have that same
ability on an Android device now there
are things like Dropbox which I've been
using starts taking my photos up to the
cloud um I wish there was a way to sort
of get from there over to iCloud or my
pictures live on my Mac at home so not
really an elegant way to do that I can
plug the phone in and I can pull the
pictures from there and treat it as a
camera but adds an extra step and an
extra step and extra step it's not as
elegant as it would have been so be
prepared for that if you don't use
photos a lot then you're not really
gonna have to worry
Android's got a built-in application
that does sync things for you if you
want to stay in android you're not gonna
have that problem at all just the
initial move something to bear in mind

TechnoBuffalo and this one's this one
was surprising I've switched between iOS
and Android quite a bit but I only
noticed it when I did it this last time
contacts some of my contacts are stored
in Google oddly enough
and I always backup my contacts
everytime when I try and switch phones
oh when I went from the HTC One from the
iPhone I use HTC's built-in transfer
tool so able to transfer all my contacts
right from the iPhone over here it
didn't transfer over all the images that
associated with it that was kind of
annoying all the photo IDs and such so
directed sync back so I took my iPhone
sunk it with Google contacts and I tried
to pull from Google contacts down to the
Android device and still not all the
pictures were there now if you use
Facebook or other social media
applications you can pull down those
pictures and
associated with the contacts but this
wasn't didn't work as well as it had in
the past something that sort of strange
did I noticed but overall it's a pretty
easy transition to go from iOS Android
to go back from Android to iOS but those
are the three things I noticed were a
little bit more difficult I know people
ask me what's the biggest problem about
switching iOS or what should I look
forward to when I switch or what should
I be aware of so I know going into it
that's probably be the three thing is
obviously there are ton of ways around
it and it's not a which one's better
which one's worse actually I think both
of them are pretty equal when I use iOS
Android public equally throughout the
year but spare mind if you looking to
make a switch I get that question all
the time and asked about flow and it's
sort of too long an answer to do I'm
just one question so I thought Rangers
risk the perfect spot to do it thank you
