now and all the jokes you could tell but
it was a little robotic didn't have that
much personality enter Google assistant

singer and you sounds less like a robot
let me show you all the fun stuff you
can do with Google assistant aside from
having her make reservations for you

tablecloth

closer closer closer okay stop close
your eyes and open your mind the crystal
ball shall reveal the truth now ask a
yes-or-no question
are you better than Siri the all-knowing
crystal ball says on oh wait it was
upside down
it says no oh goodness if I trust this
thing the other day it said that BHS is
making a comeback
oh snap there ask the crystal ball
alright we get it Google assistant I'm
feeling lucky oh yeah this is so much
better than telling you about the
weather let me get into character
welcome to are you feeling lucky no need
to be afraid it's just a game show a
game show

the show how many contestants do we have
just one one contestant let's do this

idea then a bunch of Googlers in
California started doing a lot of
experiments and that's where I came from
I was very literal so Google assistants
got jokes she got game shows she got
random fun facts she has just an insane
amount a dad joke for you she is she's
