TechnoBuffalo here at the none boxing
and first look of the sony vaio fit 14
there's a lot of competition in the
entry-level laptop world especially with
windows 8 and this is Sony's entrance go
ahead open it up and take a first look
so here is the box for the Sonia viola
fit to us from our friends at Sony looks
like this one's been opened
prices range did a pretty affordable
about $550 and go all the way up to a
couple thousand you could pick different
screen sizes
they sent us the 14 inch with 4 gigs of
RAM Intel Core i3 at 1.7 gigahertz and a
1920 by 1080 screen and a 500 gigabyte
Spinney harddrive there all kinds of
options you can update the Rabb you can
go SSD you can pick a ton of different
things here this is the entry-level
essential configuration here so you can
see how it would look like go ahead and
try and cut this ridiculous amount of
tape alright so finally my battle at the
tape is over and let's see what we've
got inside I like presents itself as you
slide the box we've got power brick do
you have a digitizing pen which is kind
of cool feels really nice like it's made
of either magnesium magnesium or
aluminum or aluminium push out to side
there are two buttons there as well this
is of course a touch screen take
advantage of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1
depending on which you're using a Sony I
think designed some of the best laptops
out there there Vaio duo is a pretty
cool looking laptop this one is well
very very well designed
you've got aluminum on the top go ahead
and open it up there's a bit of a rubber
stopper right there so your finger fits
very nicely under it and there boom she
is the keyboard on Sony laptops are
really solid it's got a gigantic
multi-touch trackpad here so I've got
the guy out of the box let's take a look
at all of the IO that we've got that is
where your power is going to go so
you've got a vent you've got HDMI USB
3.0 it's got kind of a segmented design
entirely like it makes it feel much
thinner that it actually is a bit of a
tapered edge we continue our tour around
got a speaker right there you've got of
course your audio out full-size SD card
slot another USB 3.0 if you pull that
down as we're Gigabit Ethernet it's
going to live and then your power button
but like most Windows 8 laptops right
now this one also has a fuse
rises up in sleeve look at that so you
can screen can come down and view like a
normal laptop you got a lock or release
if you go ahead and sort of pull this
right here you can turn this guy into
kiosk if you'd like you can tilt it back
and make it a display or you can close
it and make it a tablet though certainly
in tablet mode it's a little bit on the
thick side but you can still use it as a
tablet and get all of your sort of
Windows 8 action on if you decide to a
pretty decent design here of course
you've got also a Windows button on the
bottom to take you back home or to Start
menu depending on where you are at this
guy is available now from Sony it's
their big laptop for the holiday season
if you want to see more on this we can
cover we can show you what it can do
spec wise we can show you the operating
system a lot kind of stuff leave it in
the comments down below if you are
interested until next time I'm John
wrench from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you
in the next video bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
