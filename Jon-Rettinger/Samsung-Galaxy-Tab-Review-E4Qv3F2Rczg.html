TechnoBuffalo here I want to give you a
full review of the Android tablet that's
really starting the Android tablet crazy
this is of course the Samsung Galaxy Tab
let's go ahead and get started so I've
had a little bit of time to plate the
Galaxy Tab it overall I have to say it's
been a very pleasant experience I was a
little bit worried how an Android
operating system that's clearly meant
for a mobile phone was gonna translate
to the tablet world I really the same
Samsung has done a nice job making
Android 2.2 tablet II if you will and a
lot of ways this is very standard soft
Froyo but know different ways Samsung
certainly made some nice tweaks one of
the biggest ways you can see these
tweaks is in for example the application
menu so you sort of don't get that
circular scrolling that you get with
Android 2.2 they've served encapsulated
the icons and they've added a lot of
sort of their own value adds here so for
example you now have a you book reader
certainly you have an e-book reader
available for Android like the Kindle or
other sort of applications that are
third-party but sort of a native ebook
reader is really quite nice and the
pixel density on the Galaxy Tab really
makes text pop it's got a 7-inch dream
at the resolution of 600 by 1024 and it
almost looks like when you look at it
goes to a very low power mode and
there's very little glare on the eye and
eye strain what your reading books and I
do a lot of reading this was quite
important to me something to keep in
mind let's go ahead and continue let's
talk a bit about the browser Android
does a great job with the browser and
the one gigahertz hummingbird processor
that's found in here there's a fantastic
job handling flash content I've showed
this in previous videos but I do want to
show just really quickly again what
Flash content looks like here on the
Galaxy Tab will not play whoo-hoo
unfortunately I tried my fingers crossed
the whole time but you have the nice
option
you want to use flash 10.1 sure have
that plane it's actually the best
implementation of flash board that I've
seen on device I really worked quite
well you can see the turn right here
showing my unboxing so I was actually
surprised at how smooth it was the
7-inch screen I found to be a little bit
smaller than I would have liked maybe
I've gotten used to the bit larger nine
point seven inch screen on the iPad but
it definitely is sort of a mark before
it makes it definitely more portable
gives you much more screen real estate
than you get with the device like the
iPhone so pinellas with using for your
internet browsing I think that the
seven-inch screen really is gonna be a
nice sweet spot for a lot of people big
enough that you can read articles text
web browsing you can watch a video on it
but it's not too large it's gonna be an
impediment or a peanut rather when you
put it in your bag or a backpack
I really have sort of a nice sturdy feel
to it one of the other things I really
like about the Galaxy Tab is in the
addition of cameras having the choice
with not the take pictures there are
fairly unremarkable camera that's got a
1.3 megapixel camera on the back and a 3
megapixel sensor without a focus and
flash on the back there pictures aren't
outstanding they're sort of difficult
camera phone as pictures but if you have
the option is whether or not take
pictures whether or not you want to take
video with the Galaxy Tab which other
tablets which I won't mention any names
you don't have the option to do you also
be really got a lot of flexibility here
with the Galaxy Tab in the u.s. gonna be
available on every major carrier as you
have the choice about whether or not you
want that network connectivity and you
have the choice whether that you want to
pick which networks going to give you
the best connectivity for where you are
so if you're near great verizon signal
you can pick up a verizon galaxy tablet
from your brady Dean t-- signal you can
pick up a 18 C galaxy tablets or to do
those pay-as-you-go
options one of the other nice things in
sort of another way where the galaxy cab
gives you flexibility is right here on
the side with that micro SD card slot
the basic version comes in to 16 gigs
but you can throw in cards here up to 32
gigs and really get as much or as a
little storage as you want or as me lots
of experts out
as hot swap cars and really have a
couple seasons at your favorite TV show
I'm not XD card and a couple movies on
another so for a long flight you can
have to worry about the storage you have
inside of your device you can really
have an extra customization Samsung has
done some other tweaks here I found
quite nice one of the best places sort
of see that would be in the calendar so
we can sort of see where they've
augmented the calendar app you can view
it by day week list and I'll put a link
down below if you want to see my full OS
tour of the Galaxy Tab like that's sort
of a lot of very nice tweaks here to
make a mobile operating system very
tablet friendly video works really well
it's very bright you can sort of see it
clearly filming video playing on a
mobile device isn't really gonna do it
that much justice but say that the
resolution does look nice here's sort of
pop and the video playback it was
relatively smooth because it's Android
they sure have the openness to sort of
put on whatever video files you would
like or use third-party video players
that's really sort of the overall
general feel for the Galaxy Tab i've
enjoyed using it I think it could
definitely be my tablet of choice if
you're an Android fan you're really
gonna like the evolution of Android and
how it plays in the tablet device if
you're an Apple fan and you're sort of
staunchly against Android you're not
gonna like this and that's sort of hard
to talk about an Android device without
mentioning Apple it's hard to talk about
Apple about mentioning Android it's true
as you read the cons you see that's
always the hottest topic so know what
you're getting into if you like and rate
if you've got a mobile device you're
familiar with it it's going to be a very
reminiscent of what you've seen on your
phone a little bit larger and optimized
don't worry about it not working on a
tablet really Samsung has done a
fantastic job by making it work on a one
to five scale i give the Galaxy Tab a
very very very solid four and a half
hour performance it at times can be a
bit sluggish you have to do a decent
amount of program and resource
management here this particular device
I'm feeling to do that I think you're
going to get a really good experience
the lack of better cameras I kept it
from getting a solid 5 but this is
definitely one of the best if not the
best happen
the market so I wanna come out here in
the US or in Europe and you're in the
market for a mobile tablet device you'll
wake yourself to look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
