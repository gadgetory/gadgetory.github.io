technobuffalo here the holidays are good
for more than family hot chocolate gift
giving gift receiving they're also an
awesome awesome time for gadget rumors
and we've got a doozy of a rumor roundup
for you today I say we but it's really
just me cuz I'm the only one sitting
here with my serious glasses on let's
talk about ipad 2 and when this guy is
going to become obsolete last gen
technology I've got a full rundown of
all the rumors and sort of what's to be
expected for the next generation iPad so
let's get started alright so let's start
with the obvious dove course is going to
be in the next gen ipad cameras count
them two of them we've seen rumors and
reports from a variety of sources
including just recently routers Reuters
not sure the best way to pounds that
this seems to be some discrepancy I has
jumped on board saying there will indeed
be two cameras a front and a rear one
aberrant I said that Omni vision is
going to be the provider for both
cameras the back 15 mega pixels on the
front VGA and I'll of course be able to
take advantage of facetime which seems a
natural addition to the iPad it's a
mobile computer people taking with them
really wherever they go and being able
to talk to folks certainly would be a
nice addition and it would make facetime
a ubiquitous technology across Apple's
mobile products released the iOS enabled
mobile products so the first one in the
duck category two cameras will be there
let's talk about what you're going to
look at with these cameras and the
screen Apple really pioneered some of
the high resolution displays they still
have the highest resolution display on
the iphone 4 with you retina display and
the ipod touch there has been a lot of
rumors about a Retina display which is
really just fancy Apple jargon for
hi-res screen making it
way to the iPad so the current
resolution the ipad screen it's a 9.7
inch screen is 1024 x 768 now certainly
we will see a higher resolution whether
or not you want to call it HD or not and
really get to be seen but we will see a
higher pixel density and I'll just look
a little bit better and crisper so look
for a higher resolution screen that I'm
sure apples marketing department will
call some crazy and people will go nuts
for but high resolution screen will be
there all right so let's talk about form
factor is it going to look like this I
also remember when rumors thought the
ipad was going to be called the isolate
assuming the isolate would have been a
much better name in the ipad which still
kind of makes me giggle to say so it
seems like the best way for case
manufacturers to get exposure is to make
a case for a product that doesn't yet
exist and that is the case for the ipad
to get a case for the ipad 2 because we
are starting to see case leaks coming
out left and right showing a ton of new
features so first and this is a feature
that was rumored to have been included
in the first generation ipad but was
removed the last minute to dock
connectors so one on the bottom and one
on the side so if you want to use a
keyboard attachment or whatever you'd
like to use you can actually have it in
both orientations landscape and portrait
certainly that would be a welcome
addition to the ipad apple sells a dock
connector at the next general keyboard
you can only use it in portrait becomes
quite annoying certainly would might
want to use it like in the landscape
mode also certainly you can use
bluetooth keyboards as well if you don't
want to pony up for apple's potentially
over priced accessories one of the sort
of novelty is that we're staying in
these caves releases and if these case
releases are to be believed is an extra
slot or hole next to the bottom dock
connector which is presumably going to
be for an SD card which kind of is
interesting in Apple currently sells a
camera connection kit where you can pop
in an SD card from your camera put it
into the accessory 30 pin connector on
the bottom of the iPad
you can import your pictures having that
integrated would be kind of interesting
also might be the potentiality to have
another type of charging port perhaps
micro SD of dr micro USB port rather
there's been a lot of buzz especially in
the European Union about standardizing
power adapters and Apple certainly been
one of the companies that has been most
reticent to do that but looks like
there's going to be governmental
pressure to sort of unified a power
adapter so perhaps you'll see a 30-pin
and a micro USB connector although my
smart money I think is going to be on
there being some sort of expansion
microSD card slot or a regular size SD
card slot now whether or not that's
going to be used for expandable storage
so that you can pick up a 16 gig ipad
and up to 32gb with the card that seems
if it doesn't necessarily go in line
with Apple's model that we see in the
past but Apple has done things that have
been different than certain you have to
start somewhere to make a change so you
very well may see expandable storage or
to be really nice and certainly would
give customers a bit of flexibility with
their devices and would probably limit
the ability to charge extravagant
amounts for flash storage to up yourself
to 32 and 64 built-in let it just go
pick up presumably a high capacity SD
card slot pop that sucker in and you're
good to go so what about what's going to
power these things the first time we saw
Apple system-on-a-chip a4 was in the
iPad will presumably see an update to
that I for chip a clock speed right now
is at one gigahertz a natural sort of
thought progression would be that will
see 1.5 gigahertz proximately 1.2 or
more one of the things about Apple
products they control it's called a
vertical integration they control the
hardware and they control the software
on the devices so while they might not
have an edge in the power department
when it comes to process or especially
next generation in fact they optimize
the software to utilize the most that
those processors can do I generally
makes her a faster experience so think
iPad now but think a little bit faster
probably see a bit more RAM thrown in
there for good measure so when are we
going to see this rumor
ipad 2 which undoubtedly is coming well
the first iPad was released in April and
it's looking like ipad 2 will follow up
suit with an April release a production
is presumably setting that a lot
presumably supposed to start because we
got to presume in quite a bit I supposed
to start in February so sort of / dub
produce ton stockpile um and get ready
to ship them out and have a wide release
in April so we'll probably see some sort
of press conference about three or four
weeks before April so sometime near apps
end of februari early March timeframe is
when we can expect an announcement for
the ipad 2 so what does this mean for
the holiday is perhaps the ipad is going
to be gifted quite a bit don't worry
about getting antiquated technology
certainly it's the nature of the tech
beast but you can always give a nice big
fat I owe you if you want to give
somebody and new iPad you can wait to
give it to them in April so what do you
think about the ipad 2 rumors are you
excited not excited personally i think
the biggest one and the most needed
feature on the ipad 2 is gonna be
edition of cameras which should have
been there from the get-go and really
was a glaring feature a mission high
resolution screen will be nice faster
processor will be nice expansion card
slot would be kind of cool but to be
able to have a camera on there there's
been a lot of times I mouth my iPad and
I want to capture something or I want to
send a video on to someone I just can't
do and I really think it hinders the
experience of having a very capable
device so guys that's it I'm drawn
rettinger technobuffalo with my iPad to
recap rumors and what have you leave the
comments down below if you agree
disagree or what feature you think I
might have missed out that you've heard
might be in there I'll see you or talk
to you rather in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
