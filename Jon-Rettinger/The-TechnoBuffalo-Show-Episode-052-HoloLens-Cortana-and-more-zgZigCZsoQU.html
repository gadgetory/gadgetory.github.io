TechnoBuffalo show I'm lime your two
hosts for today's Sean ani editor in
chief of the site i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazelden everybody
are you doing today Todd good good debt
it's been a busy week yeah this is
really busy with e3 i sent out the
newsletter actually went out this
morning but i was talking about it
yesterday when i was when i was writing
it and just going through all the gaming
posts we've had half of III is
incredible it's like its own several
apple days in a row just the about muse
well i think the problem this year was
we had more press conferences than we've
ever had before with Bethesda had its
first one ever square joined in you know
is it was crazy for a couple days there
but now now we're just down to Joey and
Eric are out there they're going to all
their hands-on sessions you know which
of course is the the fun but busy part
of the thing actually John is on his way
to e3 as we speak oh nice and Joey has
no time in his schedule to even run by
him and say hello I know um oh I was
there jeez it was probably like five
years ago now and just waiting in the
lines and stuff like that to see things
it's just it's crazy it's unlike any
other show well luckily Joey has been
part of the gaming industry long enough
that he has actual appointments where'd
they take him into little rooms for the
hands-on sessions so he isn't waiting
for the kiosks luckily right yeah that's
awesome if he was we would be in deep
trouble but uh but Joey will be on the
show next week folks to go over all of
his thoughts and feelings about III so
definitely be sure to tune in through
that nice today since we are the
non-gaming guys yeah we're great we're
going to touch a little bit on what's
been going on at e3 although the first
day I want mincha is hey here have a new
Kindle paperwhite yes right this morning
amazon announced a new kindle paperwhite
out of out of nowhere display 300 pixels
per inch
Shh suji's twice as sharp as last year's
model and it has a new font free what
they're calling it hey I forget the name
of it as well yes I was funny though was
when you put the the post into the
system I had been the Amazon just a
little bit before that you know check
out the affiliate system for the day and
all that it was enough at that point
yeah it literally just hit and I was
like oh weird I'll write this like you
know because back in the day I Rob
viously when the first kindle came out
and then the year after they would hold
these press conferences you know like
yeah everybody got excited about it now
it's sort of just like you know here's
some we're doing this we're going to
continue doing this and here's a new
model yeah well I have last year's
paperwhite which I love yeah well I see
no reason to upgrade this year it's not
like a phone or whatever it's like if
it's working for you it's working for
you right exactly yeah but I'm glad
amazon keep set that line going you know
and there's no reason they shouldn't the
number one selling e-reader right yeah
but it's definitely doing better than
the fire phone well we we do have a
couple of topics we want to touch on
today and Todd I I believe you did watch
the hololens presentation at my watch
part of it i want i was watching the
minecraft stuff which was crazy yeah
that was pretty much the only thing they
showed right right and that was enough
to break your brain yeah for those of
you that didn't see it what they did was
they they demonstrate that you could
play Minecraft on a wall and they were
using a camera that would show you
hololens projections although people in
the room could not see them right right
so they started off playing on the wall
and then the guy said let's move it to
the table and using a voice command it
moved to the table and I'll get to you
in a say why I don't think it was
pre-recorded demo there was a glitter
but but it wasn't from the hololens so
anyway the the Minecraft area projected
on the table in three dimension and then
he could moved around he could lift it
up he could you zoom into
the reason I don't think it was
pre-recorded was because the woman
playing along with him on the surface
when she went to get in the mine cart
she got stuck and you tell he was
waiting on her like uh come on yeah can
she wasn't jumping in the mine cart if
she was taking forever to get in it so
that's why I actually think it was a
live demo which actually makes me happy
because that means that was being
rendered in real time right like it's
it's there right yeah and here here's
the whole thing I've been around the
gaming industry since the colecovision
days and so I've seen all sorts of
peripherals come along and the hollands
is not strictly a gaming peripheral
let's be clear about that right more
like a computer exactly but I've been
around long enough that I've seen all
these peripherals come and go and they
always promise you the moon and then
they deliver you tallahassee right you
know I mean let's all take a look at the
power glove the one of the most famous
examples from Nintendo's 8-bit system
days it was horrific alee bad it was
just horrible I I bought one buying into
the hype remember I was much younger
that and then of course there was like
the Sega CD system which attach to the
Genesis it was horrible I mean there's
been a number of peripherals over the
years that have sucked right if the
hololens can deliver even fifty sixty
percent of what we've seen even that
will be a game changer and I'm not
making a pun ya know it's true i mean
because they're you know the gaming is
just a small component of what hollow
ones can do because it's also full
computing experience and i think that's
what makes it so incredible and you know
when you look at oculis and you look at
some of the other ones they're awesome i
can't wait for the final versions of
those but i think in a lot of ways it's
those are your consuming and interacting
with the environment but i wouldn't say
your computing all the time whereas
hololens
you know you're you're actually can
actually do stuff not work Mahalo ins
well i was on a skype call with ron
duwell who's our writer from japan he's
not at e3 so he and I were working
remotely and he and I return fare okay
so this is great for Minecraft that it's
a prime example but what other potential
gaming scenarios could you put this into
becoming you're not going to play like a
first-person shooter with it right but
basically anything with a top-down
mapping system would work perfectly with
it and we thought about like the sims
SimCity oh yeah even if you go back into
some of Nintendo's old games and like a
zelda a link to the past right starcraft
2 could even potentially work I there's
a lot of Denny thing with a map based
system civilization doesn't starcraft
would be amazing you know the exact like
troops and send them and what have I
your living room for zerg rush coming at
you all these was so terrifying I know I
actually that kind of creeps me out to
think about yeah at least bugs running
on your floor but now I will say this
the hololens you could tell that was a
slightly redesigned head said he was
wearing different than what we've seen
before hmm not significantly but at
least somewhat it's definitely getting
out of the realm though of where it out
walking on the street right right right
right right I don't think that's we're
gonna go with that yeah I mean and like
I've said before and famously have said
before that I would love assistance with
reality augmented reality is definitely
something I'm very intrigued by but it's
I can't see myself wearing the hollands
walking down the street to do right yeah
it is more of like similar to the way
you wear oculus but I mean I mean we're
talking about virtual reality and then
we're talking about augmented reality
and so you know but I think they're both
sort of you're sitting or maybe walking
around a small room with microsoft's
hololens but it's not like Google glass
I don't you know now here's a really
interesting comment from brazen Franco I
don't know about you guys but I don't
think hololens will be a thing compared
to oculus well I actually I take the
complete opposite view of it than you do
breeze on I'll tell you why I think the
fact that with the oculus you're
completely shut off from the outside
world in the sense of your sight I think
that's going to be a detriment to
virtual reality in general because it's
going to get very you know people are
going to trip over things people are you
know are you making fun of me I think
that virtual reality in journal via
oculus project Morpheus any of those I
think a lot of the problem is that does
shut you off so much from the outside
world and i think that people will be
intrigued by it they'll use it but it
will quickly go on a drawer with
hololens i see a lot of potential beyond
gaming i see a lot of other uses for it
you know like they've demonstrated to us
a television anywhere you go maps all
sorts of things so i think that hololens
has a lot more potential uses than sayin
oculus rift yeah I think so too that's
why I was sort of saying it's like a um
it's not entirely a consumption sort of
mechanism where oculus is just like I
mean you are consumed right and then
you're not only consuming it is consumed
you which is kind of interesting I'm
excited for them both but for totally
different reasons I think oculus is just
incredible the way you're really
entering a whole other world almost
whereas hololens I think it's different
you know because you're still in this
wall right right exactly so I don't know
now of course the big question about
hololens went or two big questions when
is it coming Christ and the price yeah I
don't the price that keeps sticking in
my head and this is complete guess
everyone complete yes this 499 oh wow I
was going like 1,500 bucks I have no
idea either that's a composite well I
mean if they go 1,500 bucks there girl
the Google guys category I know that's
the trouble they have to be affordable
yeah that's the whole thing I mean when
they get to the consumer model I think
it cannot go over 499 I just don't think
it can um now and actually we have a
question from such a Mahal somewhat
related to this what do you think of the
final version also known as consumer of
the oculus rift and how much do you
think it will cost 300 400 500 or a
thousand or some other price also of the
i key also at the oculus event there was
no mention of facebook at all at the
event that's true I Facebook owns them
so now you've talked with the guys from
oculus many times Todd I know they've
never given you a definitive price but
they were even given you a hint no they
haven't given me a hint um HTC didn't
either with the vibe which I consider a
similar products in the sense that
they're both virtual reality but they
did say when I was with HTC and oculus
of this to you got you need this
computer and I think that's going to be
I hope that's the bulk of the cost right
like when you have the gear VR it's only
200 bucks because there's just like some
plastic and it in your phones powering
it and when you come to oculus sure
there's the sensors on the outside
there's all that kind of stuff the
displays in the on the inside but your
computer's doing the bulk of the work
there so it's it's I think it's going to
be split like you're probably going to
spend a lot of money but also because
you need that computer and then the
oculus headset yeah I don't know what
the it's going to end up costing I I
think that's a lot of is that people got
realized that these things are not going
to be cheap yes it's great to dream
about them and you know think about what
they could potentially do but they're
not going to be you're not going to find
them on the shelves at Walmart yeah
they're not for exactly they're not a
budget it's not a budget system by any
means I mean this is cutting-edge
technology this didn't exist a year ago
you know or two years ago um previous
models of it did but you know so you got
to be prepared to pay those kind of
crisis right right well the second topic
we want
touch on this week was Cortana and you
were talking to me yesterday Todd about
the fact that Cortana is coming to the
Xbox well yeah I just thought it was
neat Microsoft has already said you know
iOS and Android then yesterday microsoft
said it will hit android next month
which I'm excited for because I think
Cortana is a really great voice engine
it's just I don't wanna say
unfortunately but it's unfortunately
stuck on Windows Phone for the most part
and and then soon coming to Windows 10
which is exciting and then and now to
the xbox one and I thought wow this is
this is really cool because you know we
have our smartwatches now and our phones
and the phone reminds us to do stuff
through the SmartWatch but then you know
when it's connected to your TV in your
living room and then says like hey don't
forget you got to go do this or
something I thought that was pretty cool
but well here's the thing though without
the kinect attached to the X boxers no
built-in microphone right job so this
actually could give people a reason to
ring connector connects I'll believe
that when I see it right now the fact
that Microsoft is selling the xbox
without the kinect was sort of like
what's the point yeah so I mean I'll
still be interested to see how it
interfaces but it's not gonna be for
everyone unfortunately because of the
whole connect debacle well can you d
quarter I don't know because I didn't
see it yesterday I was sort of just
reading about it through the android
announcement because they sort of
combined Android next box born in the
announcements reading sir can you just
use a headphone though I mean like like
we're doing right now it's a quick yes
you yeah you you can plug in a headphone
yeah right okay so I mean in some
instances but i think it's it's not so
much that I I thought that was cool you
know like hey Cortana what's the weather
or something like that on xbox which it
is but it's more that you know I can do
these things on my phone and then those
come over to the Xbox sort of seamlessly
and it's the story Microsoft's telling
about Windows 10 everywhere even though
there are different versions and skews
technically it's still this idea that
it's it's everywhere and in some cases
parts of it are on you know soon other
phones iOS and Android but yeah I was
just actually yesterday installing
the latest i don't know if i have the
home here the latest build of windows 10
4 yeah i do on a 1520 I want to play
with it windows 10 mobile maybe I wasn't
so far I actually it just installed when
I left yesterday but Microsoft promise
they did like a lot of UI changes live
stability they change Cortana they have
a new one handed mode so there should be
a lot of changes in this one in fact
it's such a big update they uh if you
were in the in the beta tester program
it's called windows insider early which
I was and you already installed that
version of Windows 10 you now have to
revert back to Windows 8.1 and then
install this sorts it's kind of a jump
through hoops took me a while but here
we go just turned up yeah okay I'm
excited to play with it so here yeah
it'll definitely be interesting to see
and we do have a question about Cortana
here where did it go do they really got
come up with a better way to look at
these questions I think I see it from
Sasha of the hall how is Cortana
compared to Google name yes I did just
found it what do you think about
Microsoft is bringing court on to other
platforms when they could just be the
best on Windows Phone to help and
compete with Google mansory that
actually wasn't the question I was
looking for bed works as well um so I
think that bringing curtain to other
platforms is smart because it might and
well if it works this well on my iPhone
it might must work even better on a
Windows film right and they sort of
mentality and plus it's it's about
Windows 10 you like you you have it on
your new laptop Cortana's there so why
not have it on your phone to and bring
that experience through everything but
I'm not sure how well it's gonna work
i'm excited you know is it how does it
tap into the emails properly and all
that on other platforms or is it just
that it's pulling it from you know your
desktop computer i'm not sure but i do
have some complaints about it the other
question was how does a comparative to
Siri and Google now yeah
Siri I have the iOS 9 beta obviously
it's not meant for your everyday phone
but I do that it it's she's not very
good on that either and I know she's
supposed to have improved and Google now
always impresses me I saw an article
yesterday not very good internationally
which I wasn't actually aware of because
I haven't used it that much
internationally but the reason I like
Google now so much is for when you when
you try to grab that traffic information
or points of interest it's all related
from google maps which is obviously I
think we could agree probably the best
mapping South software out there dad
Cortana is still pulling it in from I
guess its here maps still I think or
Bing or something and it's not good so
the points of interest have always been
sort of a weak point for me and that and
it's still not great so I actually did
try that and I've joked about this in
the past but like you know remind me to
get eggs at A&amp;amp;P and it put like some a
and P airport in like some other state
and I was like what am I ever gonna go
there like what helli that's not a point
of interest near me that I would be
interested in like that doesn't even
make it exit an airport so I wish it was
sort of smarter with that kind of stuff
oh really why would anyone get eggs in
Anarchy right let's see scrambled eggs
oh man I'm about to board if I only had
a dozen eggs that's for me yeah it's
just kind of like what I got say I was
in Tahiti on my honeymoon and the
airports there there were chickens
running around inside so maybe you could
get eggs yeah not something I've ever
yeah I don't have the same regulations
to the United States what else what I'm
trying to think but in you know Cortana
is pretty good it's good at all the
sports and stuff like that and actually
it has a card base in your face it's
very similar to Google now a lot of
instances to write well we're going to
move on into questions which we've got a
lot coming in and we thank you for that
now folks I will worry I see a lot of e3
questions and while I've been involved
in most of III todd has not been
involved in very much at all right
so meet us our gaming expert so we'll
take some of the e3 questions but what
we've been able to answer is in depth as
say Joey will be able to next week right
of course this this was the big news out
of Microsoft and this question comes
from such a ball is the upcoming
backwards compatibility on the xbox one
a welcome to additional feature or is it
just men I think it is an extremely
welcomed again it's something that
should have been there since launch it's
something that should have been there
since launch on both systems mm-hmm I
you know in this day and age the the
idea that you can release a system that
is not at least one generation backwards
compatible to me is just wrong right you
know I why can't it what was stopping it
yeah exactly there were you know exactly
i mean it's and it does have to do with
emulation and all that sort of stuff
that's fine but you have the
technological ability and before the
PlayStation 2 there wasn't backwards
compatibility that that was something
that's sony introduced to the world and
it was a very welcomed addition to the
world I mean before that we had always
had like yo your Nintendo cartridge
doesn't fit in your Super Nintendo right
right here like like you know I can't or
the stupidity of the fact that the
Japanese cartridges were built slightly
differently than the American cartridges
so you couldn't slap a super famicom
cartridge in your Super Nintendo without
an adapter yes weird yeah it was it was
stupid but whatever so yeah the
backwards compatibility hasn't been with
us that long but with microsoft
announced in this is just per sec could
have been there from the get-go right so
while i think it's exciting that they've
done this it also annoys me a little bit
because it could have been there since
launch day yeah it's frustrating yeah
and that is what they're doing right
it's like an emulator inside Lee it's
like software ambition this yeah yeah
what is that coming exactly I they
didn't give an exact date it's just it's
supposed to be sometimes
couple months yeah I believe in the
lifetime of Windows 10 right like
hololens you're good yeah exactly but
you know you look at now Sony they're
gonna have to do it right because
otherwise Microsoft is going to hold
this over their head for until the next
generation without question but will
Sony do it we'll just have to find out
uh from such an bahal as well hey sean
has your pebble time so far AB honestly
I love it but it's not that much more
than the original pebble had the battery
life is definitely worse that's mine and
again last night after not really using
yeah the seven days is bump because it's
about five which is not bad but it's not
the seven I was promised right yeah and
and one day safer to steal like 10 and
eight right like what what's changed
makes it 10 I have no idea yeah none
Daisy's nice uh from Britain Franco and
this is actually something I've wanted
to address for the past couple days can
we all agree that Nintendo one and EA
wasn't the most boring meaning what
company one III of folks here's the
thing and I don't agree with the concept
of any one company winning III at the
end of the day I think that the winners
of the gamers right we have seen some
amazing titles over the past couple days
we've heard some great additions to the
system's the gamers one to declare that
any one company one III is just never
made a lot of sense to me right you know
that being said yeah an antenna had a
great show I think that Nintendo kind of
set the world on fire in the world of
toy based games by announcing that
skylanders and amiibo are teaming up
mm-hmm that boggled my mind ah kudos to
them but no I don't think that
tenda what I will say that this EA
definitely was not the most boring this
year that award would go to Bethesda and
we publicly said that on Sunday night
and you know live for it but I think
Bethesda it was and you have to give him
some leeway because it was their first
ever big conference presentation like
that but it was pretty Snoozeville from
the nav 9900 off topic why don't you try
a live stream on periscope ones there's
a couple reasons that we decided to do
it through hangouts number one is it
also transmits to our youtube channel at
the same time as well as Todd and I when
we record we actually record our audio
separately he then emails me over his
audio file and I combine the two and
that's how you get the audio podcast but
with this if anything should go wrong
with those two audio files this is not
as high quality but it gives me an
emergency backup that I can strip the
audio out of the video if it should ever
need to be done we had to do that once
on tech on the range right and that kind
of convinced us that yeah we need to
have a backup audio because in the world
of technology something will go wrong at
some point right always it always from
such a Mahal when do you think hololens
will be available for consumers to
purchase and what do you think it will
cost okay well we worry covered the cost
thing but as Todd made a joke about a
few moments ago it was it's announced
for within the lifespan of Windows 10
yeah they say sit like you know like
with Windows 10 or something which seems
like could be years it could be launch
day or it could be two years down the
road yeah I don't think it'll don't know
july 29th it's now they're thirds
there's absolutely no way it's that day
yeah none but no we really we have no
clue as to what the release date is not
a bit unfortunately
oh let's see moving on from an F 9900
which III event do you like Microsoft or
Sony I like them both I I thought
Microsoft was a lot stronger than it has
been the past couple years yeah I think
Sony needs more exclusives definitely
although they definitely it was very
telling to me that a lot of companies
came out and said and you'll get this
first on Sony and you'll you'll get to
do that first on Sony and that tells you
that they know which platform is winning
I'm sorry folks the numbers don't lie
Sony is winning this generation at the
moment by a considerable number yeah so
it's nothing I guess what is it black
ops right is going to be the the new
black ops as a PhD ever well it's not
going to be exclusive to ps4 bed it's
going to get a lot of stuff first first
first right right yeah it's going to get
maps first dlc first beta first yeah all
that sort of stuff so yeah I think it's
pretty clear that uh Sony is getting a
little bit further in the gaming
industry at the moment from jason d 123
will windows app on android make a phone
all join together Tata Syrian s voice
interesting to see a phone for the three
platforms what do you think I think that
would be awesome it will never happen
I'll never happen never I should
actually androids is google now has
voice is just for samsung but um what is
it sound hound hound is pretty cool i
was using that recently which is sort of
just a standalone voice assistant or
smart assistant on android still invaded
but it's sort of like you know it's it's
not made by any of them ya know it uh
yeah i would be cool by all never
happened uh from bridget Franco am I the
only one disappointed on about Sony for
announcing just one vita game during
their conference funny story so Ron as I
said lives in Japan and he and I were on
skype the entire time and in Japan is
quite common you you have very long
train commute sir Ron does a lot of
gaming on the train and throughout the
entire Sony presentation I just kept
hearing him mumble come on Vita that's
something from veena come on Vita all
throughout the conference I'm like Ron
they'll get to Vita and then they like
through one game for bdays like you told
me they'd get to Vita I'm just like I
don't control this rod yeah that's
pretty sad yeah it does veena is a great
little system I don't know why it hasn't
caught on like the 3ds I mean the 3ds is
huge yeah yeah I don't understand why
the Vita doesn't get a lot more love
from Sony but yeah PS or remote play
stuff is awesome but I know it doesn't
count as its own games but like that's
the only reason I use it oh speaking of
Sony you told me yesterday that you had
something you wanted to share about the
upcoming xperia phone for verizon oh
that oh i was just saying this is the
flagship that that sony should have
launched in the first place they have
the xperia z4 and then yesterday morning
they announced the experience e4v for
verizon which is it's basically the same
phone but with a quad HD display instead
of a 1080p screen so you get Snapdragon
810 you get the 20.7 megapixel camera
and all that stuff but it's just like oh
so you're able to do it but you don't do
it until like Verizon comes and pushes
you to do it which I thought was kind of
weird I mean just sell it sell the
Xperia z4 with a quad HD display why
does it have last year's tech I mean
which is sort of like what HTC to put
the one m9 to it has 1080p screen which
is I mean we've talked about it before
1080p looks fine whatever but like wired
why it's flat it's not flagship tech
exactly and so if you've gone and
slapped it into a carrier exclusive
phone all you're saying to all of us is
that well yeah we could have done it on
the other one but you weren't deserving
right and like we bout to verizon's
commands because we don't have any
relationships with US carriers I mean
last time sony launched the
3v last year excuse me it was like a
plastic version of light it was like a
z2 plus it wasn't even as good as his
III and then this year and what the
other way so last year it was like
inferior and this year its superior you
just you don't go and make a carrier
exclusive better than your flagship that
makes no sense no I know it just it's
really sorry yeah I I don't get it but I
I'm excited to see it even yeah I mean
someone else's number its water proof
they say and all that kind of stuff
which is crazy sorry I was going through
the documents and and everybody says
like waterproof and all that and they
really mean and they shouldnt like you
know you see the TV commercials and
stuff people are jumping in pools with
their phones what they really mean is
fresh water proof so like in the sink
you know in a lake but UK like it they
always say in a small print like don't
go in a chlorine swimming pool don't go
in salt water all kinds of stuff and I
feel like consumers don't really know
that there's probably an article they're
more likely because that I actually did
not know that about the salt water yeah
I guess because it conducts electricity
a little ah good to know because you
know I terror it's more corrosive I
don't know I just tend to dive into
oceans with my phones but uh I go
fishing in them and I have brought out
in waterproof phones out and that that's
exactly that's something you should know
yeah but it's definitely not something
they make clear now interesting from
such a Mahal I currently have an xbox
360 and I've been thinking about getting
an xbox one for a while now and the
announcement that microsoft made
convinced me even more to want to get
one when would be the right time to buy
one this year from now until holiday
2015 honestly at this stage of the year
you don't by any major electronic really
until black friday starts rolling around
yeah the big sales the lot to counter
that argument I'd say the sooner the
better cm more time to enjoy that's true
now and on the gaming consoles in
particular you may not see a huge price
drop
them but you a lot of times you'll see
them come with one two even three game
packets right on these puzzles yeah so
you get a lot more bang for your buck if
you wait till the holiday season on the
gaming consoles so if you can hold out
that long I would wait till the holiday
season without question from brazen
Franco speaking of carrier exclusives
widely you why the US carriers
exclusives are a common thing to do
because the carrier's throw a bunch of
money at the phone companies and say
make us a fun yeah and like we want you
know we want this to be our flagship and
to attract people into our stores
because the idea at least with them
trying to think I think it was like the
HTC cha-cha-cha which was the AT&amp;amp;T
facebook phone with the facebook button
it might've been the salsa whatever it
was the United States they put it in the
in you know they're like this is our
flagship but they put the store window
because I hope people you know walking
by on the streets like I've never seen
that verizon's and carry that phone you
go and of course that phone failed but
that's the idea especially with the
exclusive colors and stuff like that too
I that's like you know best buy i'll
have like the blue HTC One m8 mm you
know and you have to go to best buy to
get it I i will tell the story very
carefully because i don't want to
identify any of the parties that were
involved by i once there was once a
phone that came out that i thought was
incredibly stupid that even existed was
it the fire phone no we probably trust
so i'm at a CES party and i run into
someone i know fairly well from the
manufacturer of that phone and i am what
were you guys thinking what was I put
that funny goes that wasn't our idea
yeah the carrier asked us for that I was
like getting me he's like oh no they
came to us and asked for that phone yeah
that's the other thing that happens I
was like wow that's not good maybe you
shouldn't do that again but they also
control the names a lot of times 2 which
is which can be sort of confusing yeah
yeah exactly so a lot of times when you
see phones out there
you have to think twice yo E you may go
oh that's such an odd phone to exist
why'd they do may have been the carrier
that asked for it mm-hmm especially if
it's exclusive to a carrier right at a
very very early case of the z4 p I mean
that's pretty cool Verizon customers at
least they have an option that's nice
yeah from an Ave 9900 why doesn't
technical get III event try for next
year we we are at the point where we are
discussing doing events but it's a
logistics thing especially since we're
so spread out as you all know yes John's
on irvine california and Brandon Roy
Ralph Ron and marker with him but then
you have Todd and Jacob in New York I'm
in Missouri Joey's in Delaware Ron's in
California Erickson Michigan or
Minnesota and so we're very spread out
but it is something that we've started
discussing doing down the road when I
have no idea right but keep an eye out I
I'm sure we will announce something at
some point in the in the future just not
sure if it's distant or near from brazen
Franco no 1s it yet so I'll do it this
week what have you returned this week
Todd nothing I haven't tried to think I
think it's been one of those weeks where
I haven't really left my apartment which
means it's a busy week so I've been
returned anything haven't really left
the seat of sitting him yeah for those
that don't know I live on a large piece
of property which is out in the woods
but I have been known to go as long as
two weeks without stepping foot off my
property I believe it now now I do I
walk between the buildings so I do go
outside I just don't walk off of my
property yeah I have in weeks we're the
only place I go is to the starbucks at
the bottom of my building which is bad
well are you going to hell are you going
to ask them to open an extension
on your floor if they should well that's
why I'm excited here's more relevant
news yesterday starbucks announced
they're spreading the the ordering
system mobile ordering to some odd
thousand you look at 3,400 3400
occasions I think which is cool because
you can just order your drinks from your
phone and it'll stay like estimate time
to pick up like you know six seven
minutes and then you just walk into
starbucks and go right to the pick up
cap the only problem for me that's
convenient because I'd order right now
and go downstairs and pick it up the
problem for me is I use a refillable cup
so they can't wrap my coffee way and all
I ever get is black yo pike place or
whatever yes those real quickly yeah I
guess I once had a guy at a Vegas
starbucks I walked up in order that the
cashier KY looking he goes that's all I
was like yeah egg next guy in line
looked at me goes as the simplest
starbucks order i think i've ever heard
of my life and like I just want black
coffee but yeah oh I get some similar I
just get I get the ice black coffee
socially but I put them open it I just
I'm sorry I just like buy coffee from
such and haul are any of you guys going
to get an oculus rift project Morpheus
headset or valves VR headset when it
comes out not until I get to try one and
see if I even have any interest in it
mine's gonna be about the killer games
or something like I want I've said this
for a while there I want this big like
mm oh I can explore any like a world of
warcraft or something and it seems like
that's gonna take a little while yeah
now i'll probably wait for bid now
project Morpheus has support for no
man's sky the space exploration game
yeah I might be sold real fast yeah
because that looks so awesome uh yes
Jason we like you we had a question like
it's not that question a jason d 123 one
so if we like him yes we we like you
Jason um let's see here from Bray's
Franco how many of the trailers gameplay
presented during e3 do you think our or
do you think our trusty real
representation of the final product I
already flagged every you be soft game
okay for those that don't know over the
past couple of years there has been a
real problem with the company's juicing
up their trailers that they show at e3
the most famous example the past couple
years of course is aliens colonial
Marines which was nothing as good as
what we were shown and there actually
was a class-action lawsuit filed over
that and the class one it was pretty
horrific Lee obvious that they had
messed with it so a lot of trailers are
in question there's been a lot of
questions over the past couple years now
I will say this Joey just recently this
morning turned in his hands on with
Assassin's Creed syndicate which as we
all see which as we all know Assassin's
Creed unity was a complete and utter
train wreck Joey really it was and joey
is a very very critical gamer and he
actually reached out to me last night
shortly after he had played syndicate
and he goes I think they listened to
every criticism from last year he says
it's highly more stable and by no means
is this qualifies or review folks so
please don't take it that right but he
said it was far more stable it was the
most stable Assassin's Creed demo he is
played at an e3 in years and pastures
he's seen characters glitch out pops
framerate drops everything else he saw
none of that this year so I that's not
to say that there hasn't been some
tweaking to the trailers this year but I
think a lot of the companies have
learned their lesson especially with the
threat of lawsuits hanging over their
head that one has now been lost so I'm
still I'm not going to say that
everything was 100% truthful but I don't
think it's anywhere as bad as it used to
be all right we've got
for one more question here so let me
just jump on them did you do oh this is
a great point I saw a lot of this on
Twitter from brazen Franco feeling bad
for all those who sold their entire 360
collection to move on to the next gen
yeah that's a former that is a huge
better I saw several tweets like that
after the announcement the other night I
luckily I I went through one stage where
I sold off almost every gaming system i
had but this was a long time ago but
since the PlayStation 2 days when the
ps3 and the xbox 360 came out i decided
to always keep one generation back as
well because there's still decent games
and i just didn't see the point i wasn't
going to get that much form so why not
keep him ran and played the games that i
liked that being said I still have a
dreamcast I still have a super nintendo
yeah for those those folks that sold off
all their 360 games I feel for you that
sucks big time well that is going to
bring today to a close do check out the
site a little bit later we are going to
be have some coverage of whatever it is

thankfully in 15 minutes yes a and I
