TechnoBuffalo here with the phone that i
know a lot of you have been waiting for
this is the HTC Sensation for t-mobile
this guy packs a tremendous punch and
really brings these super phone specs so
with a name like the sensation let's go
ahead and see if it really is alright
take a look at the box here is the
picture of the device this is running
HTC's new sense 3.0 kind of neat there's
a seal which i think is probably broken
we've got some specs on the back 4G and
Wi-Fi capable 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor this is one of the new
Qualcomm dual-core chips we've seen
Tegra 2 which is a bit clocked at 1
gigahertz dual-core 1.2 so this should
be an absolute screamer 4.3 inch screen
baby slow camera the rest of that good
stuff of course we're going to talk
about let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing looks like has indeed been open
to assume there's some sort of SIM card
in here go ahead and pull that off
nothing on top and here is the sensation
looking very Android esque pull it off
much thinner than I expected you might
have seen this guy leaked months back it
was called the pyramid looks like I just
powered it on I was called the pyramid
when it was internally at HTC and it
looks just like the leaked shots push it
off to the side for just one quick
minute
I'll see what also gonna get in the box
it anything new here t-mobile has been
pretty good at including me annuals
which I will throw on my desk they're
gonna live inside of that box Start
Guide and the rest you can see the boot
up screen there HTC's new tiny little
wall charger we've got a pair of stereo
headphones and your sync cable all the
required stuff great and exciting let's
go ahead take a look at the phone which
is most important there's something that
I actually am really excited to take a
look at Noah saw this I saw a few of it
at the I believe is a GDG tea gathering
a few weeks ago
it's the first time I've actually had
any sort of chance to take a look at the
device all right so now that we've
unboxed the phone let's go ahead and run
through the specs because this guy
really tacks some heck of a punch card
honestly you can't see something this is
going to be highlighted by its brilliant
4.3 inch qHD Super LCD capacitive
touchscreen and what does that qHD means
moves are going to get a resolution of
540 by 960 with 16 million colors and
all of us is weighing five point two
ounces and they will say it does feel
very very light in the hands i'm curious
what that qHD screen is gonna look like
when put up against AMOLED super amoled
amoled plus and all the other high-end
touch screens available right now as I
mentioned earlier it's being powered by
a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm built
Snapdragon processor so for those of you
out there like the benchmark this thing
should be an absolute screamer and best
what we currently have
from the Tegra 2 built chip from Nvidia
so let's go HTC Sense knew 3.0 when I go
and show you real quick it's highlighted
by this new sort of lock screen
evidently you can put little widgets
there and you can unlock and do stuff
when you get there so here we are at the
home screen then go ahead and continue
to walk you through what else you can
expect it's got a 1520 million power
battery curious how good battery life is
gonna be 4 gigabytes of internal memory
and a pre-installed eight gig card where
she can up that 232 Wi-Fi 802 11 B G and
N on the hump this guy you've got a
camera obviously with a dual LED flash
the camera is of the 8 megapixel variety
and that can record video at 1080p which
is kind of neat that's not the only
camera living on this guy all right
there's a teeny tiny little sensor which
is of the 1.3 megapixel varieties you
can go ahead and get you a front-facing
video action on high-achieving it's
actually a VGA camera I'm not one point
degree when these drones come in the
mail they come with some press release
you can see
all that goodness so as a VGA camera not
1.3 scratch that I've got a lot of other
goodness in here it is
gingerbread powered so this is Android
2.3 no Froyo no Eclair no donut as the
order no cupcakes with cupcake donut
Eclair Froyo and gingerbread which
proves that I know at least the early
part of my alphabet which is quite nice
that we are going to have a full
gingerbread support here really
everything that you could have wanted in
a modern smartphone
this guy's packing including support for
HSPA+ on the left hand side you've got
your volume rocker up and down sort
original HTC faire micro USB charging
we've got some microphones on the bottom
for noise cancellation on the right hand
side really got nothing on the top you
got your power and lock button located
on the upper right I really like that
location I'm used to it there's the VGA
camera got your branding across the top
three point five millimeter headset jack
on the back was that 8 megapixel camera
the dual LED flash there's a little bit
of a bump right there so when you put
the phone down you will have a little
bit of a rock you can keep in mind there
is an integrated kickstand here I assume
the battery gonna slide out somewhere
from the bottom there I'll take a look
and let you guys know where the battery
is going to come from where the SIM
cards gonna live looks like everything
was already pre-installed ah there it is
so this comes off so you can get as live
on camera
this whole back actually pops right off
look like it was three separate pieces
but it was not you've got some soft
touch here a bit of plastic and then
some other soft touch got a really nice
feel on the back there's where all the
actions going to happen and it's just
one piece go ahead and snap that back on
or at least attempt to I am not the best
at getting back the phone's off but I'm
not as bad as Noah can be sometimes so
there we go we got everything all back
and working let's go ahead and run
through the setup process real fast and
I'll give you guys a full tour of sense
so you guys can see what to expect it
will presumably be coming to all HTC
devices lessons ation is the first to
get it so leave all your questions
comments down below things you want to
see on the sensation
real quick size comparison so here we've
got the 4.3 inch sensation that would
just involves here is the dredge part
also a 3.5 inch the charge is definitely
not one of the thinner phones out there
you can see sort of that size difference
we go ahead and stack them if you want
to see what a 4.5 inch screen again look
like next the sensation here is the
again the Samsung built-in fuse and the
4.3 inch screen just looks downright
tiny I next to it go ahead and stack
these guys you can see what those look
like
and lastly let me go ahead just power it
on the Samsung let me bring in an iPhone
4 take you guys are curious how this is
going to look an upside down iPhone 4 so
go ahead and do a little stack job and
if we make our very tasty smartphones
see how much you can see all these size
comparisons are these guys but this
video is just about the sensation so
anything you guys want to see you leave
it down below be sure to stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo for all the sensational
coverage and I promise you there will be
very bad jokes in the video I am John
Breton from TechnoBuffalo
and this has been an unboxing of the
t-mobile HTC Sensation see you guys in
the next video
