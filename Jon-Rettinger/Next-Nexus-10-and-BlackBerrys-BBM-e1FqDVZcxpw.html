to you by audible hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley discover any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology and sometimes beyond every
tuesday we put up a call for questions
on TechnoBuffalo calm you can leave your
question in the post comments otherwise
you can send them to me on Twitter
anytime of the day or night at
TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley asked Emma to
make sure you use the hashtag ask the be
so I can see it and usually on every
show I answer between three and five
questions so let's get answering this is
ask the buff twitter user grieve Tom
asked hi I'm looking for a small
flagship tablet and I'm thinking either
the nexus 7 or the LG G pad any
recommendations ok Tom so this is a
really tough question and I don't want
to cop out by saying well these are both
just fantastic devices and either when
you go with is going to be great now
that's true whichever one you go with
would be pretty good but let's hash it
out here let's figure out which one we
think you should choose so you have the
nexus 7 on one hand the second gen Nexus
7 is gorgeous it's thin it's lightweight
it's seven inches you can throw it in a
bag it's really easy to carry around
obviously new updated screen you're
gonna get the most recent version of
Android as soon as it comes out pretty
much you're gonna get KitKat almost
right away with a nexus 7 and obviously
running stock Android so you get to do
all the things you've always wanted to
do with the Nexus 7 I can't fault it
there's some really great features on
the Nexus 7 however I got to use the LG
G pad over in Germany when I was there
for Eva really nice I mean they've got
some great software features they have
the tray we're able to sort of swipe
over and keep three apps sort of hidden
off screen where you can bring them back
on quickly and they're easy to use and
they have some really neat software
tweaks and features on the G pad so the
thing is is you're getting all these
great software features on the LG G pad
but because of that you're probably not
going to be getting the most recent
version of android so 4.4 kitkat when it
comes out in the next few weeks I should
say the coming weeks we don't know when
it is you get a G pad
might be looking to the nexus going I
wish I had gotten KitKat 4.4 and now I'm
gonna be waiting while G pad so with
that being said neck-and-neck race I
think just the availability of the
newest version of Android especially
because it's imminent I'm gonna go with
the Nexus 7 Josh asks hey Ashley with
Apple now hosting its ipad event on
tuesday when will we see an update to
the nexus 10 from google what do you
expect the nexus 10 second generation
will bring to the tablet market well
josh the second-generation Nexus 10 is
definitely on Google slate I mean I
think we all know it hopefully it will
be coming with maybe even on the same
day as the announcement for KitKat 4.4
so I think it will ship with kitkat 4.4
it's a really nice device the first gen
I was a little bit of a skeptic at first
I really loved the Nexus 7 has opposed
to the nexus 10 4 1st gen but I think
that this might be a really nice
turnaround for Google in terms of making
the design a little bit more streamlined
a little less bubbly on the corners we
may see more storage either internally
or even with an expandable storage slot
which obviously is really important to a
lot of you guys out there one of the
things that people did not like about
the original Nexus 10 was no cellular no
LTE hopefully at this point we'll see
LTE on board for the next to 10 second
gen and then obviously it's going to
have better specs but at the end of the
day I definitely think that 10-inch
tablets in general on Android are all
really kind of offering the same thing I
think whatever you know magical thing
that the 2nd gen Nexus 10 offers is
going to be bundled in with KitKat and
the one thing I would really love to see
as if Google bundled the nexus 7 in the
nexus 10 for the holidays with a free
chromecast I think that's a great way to
get people involved in the Google
ecosystem in an inexpensive and fun way
twitter user iOS James asks what are
your thoughts on BBM's blatant
disrespect of keeping followers informed
game over BlackBerry's going through a
lot right now let's all be real here
they're going through a lot they've got
some acquisition issues it's possible a
bigger company might snap them up
because right now they have the ability
sort of shop around for a different
buyer I'm so Fairfax may not even be
buying them officially it could be
someone else could be a bigger company
honestly it could be that not even the
BBM team knows what's going on and I
know that that's a really scary thing
obviously you want the people delivering
your software to know what's happening
in
exactly and when you want a perfect
roadmap that everything is going to come
out on time but at the end of the day
you know stuff happens and there's a
different way to say that that's a four
letter word that is even more
appropriate but it's not appropriate for
this show so I'm going to skip it but
you know what I mean I mean stuff
happens and sometimes you gotta just
take a detour and figure things out I
think that's what bbm is doing I think
that's what the BBM team is doing I'm
sure that if they could just wave a
magic wand and release it to you guys
they absolutely would but unfortunately
right now things are a little bit in a
state of flux over at blackberry so I
don't blame them I don't think it's
disrespectful I just think that uh you
know F happens I gotta interrupt the
show for just one second talk about our
