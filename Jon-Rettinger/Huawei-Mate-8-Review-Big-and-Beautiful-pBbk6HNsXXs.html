pedigree with the Nexus 6p having hit
the US shores and doing very very well
for itself so let's see if they can keep
up with their own benchmarks that they
set with the Huawei mate 8 there's four
major things that I really want to cover
with the mate 8 performance screen
battery and software so I want to start
with all the rest of the things just
kind of get them out of the way so the
camera on the back and on the front
really is just ok it's not amazing
you're not going to be upset with the
photos that you're taking overall things
look fine it's definitely a little over
sharpened and over processed for my
taste but that's something that you're
going to see a lot with Chinese
manufacturers that said though the
camera is perfectly fine it's not the
industry leader but you're not going to
be upset with the performance the build
is fan-freakin'-tastic we know what
Huawei's builds tend to look and feel
like and since this is very similar in
size and quality in terms of price point
as the 6p is we kind of expected a lot
of this but I didn't expect the
chamfered edges I didn't expect it to
feel so nice in the hand I didn't expect
it to feel like a really quality slab of
hardware and I got to tell you it really
really does they knocked it out of the
park with the build quality on this
thing the cure 950 is an octa-core
processor in a big little formation and
that means there's four processors
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz and for smaller
processors clocked at 1.4 gigahertz I
was not able to get this thing to
stutter for me even once launchers games
movies downloads updates in the
background I just can't get it to think
twice about a single thing and what I
think is really telling about this thing
is that in the benchmarks it beats
Samsung's top-of-the-line Exynos right
now if this phone literally sits on top
of the antutu benchmark scores and I
gotta say I'm not a benchmark guy but it
really shows on the mate a part of the
reason that I think the performance is
so fantastic is because that screen on
the front that's the other big thing
that I really want to talk about the
screen on the mate 8 is a 1080 screen ok
the PPI is still very high you're still
not going to see pixels but this is not
the highest resolution screen that
you're going to see on the market and
you know what that's actually kind of ok
here the other place that that lower
resolution screen comes into play is
battery life and that battery life is
exactly what I meant to say you can get
two days of use out of this thing no
problem you get you can get this thing
to last all week if you really want it
to this should be the gold standard
moving forward in terms of battery life
very impressed emui I don't use this
phrase lightly it's an abomination it
removes the app drawer it changes
everything it's just it's all fogged
glass and it's one thing if you want to
knock something off and do a good job
knocking it off which they sort of do
but it's another to shoehorn another
experience onto a platform that's just
not built for it but we're running on
this is still a beta build we're still
getting updates on a regular basis we
did reach out to huawei and say hey we
have a couple of questions is this a bug
or is this the feature a few things we
found were features but they are still
problems and this is one of those parts
where the software really really shows
his rough edges you're constantly nagged
by the software whether or not you
really want to do something you want to
really dismiss that notification because
it might make your experience a little
worse there's other weird things like
the ability for third-party launches to
set themself as the default launcher
doesn't work you have to dive all the
way into the settings which is I'm not
joking about five layers deep to change
your actual default home screen I
actually had to reach out to David
Reddick from Android police to figure
out where the hell that setting even was
this is the number one thing that I'll
tell you about this phone that really
really sucks and it for me it really is
a big sticking point and it almost made
me tell you not to buy it but I'm not
gonna do that the software isn't a deal
breaker in the mate 8 because it gives
you so much more than that and if you
can get used to the software quirks then
you've got an incredibly incredibly
competent capable device in your hand
give me something in the range of 500 is
$600 that makes one or two very small
compromises that I can still get the
performance and the battery life and the
experience that I want to get out of the
fantastic device without having to make
even more compromises at the $400 price
point in the two weeks I've been using
the mate 8 I've had a really really
positive
Ariane's despite the software and really
that's the story at the end of the day
the mate 8 is some great hardware with
some pretty bungled software at the end
of the day the made 8 is a pretty solid
buy just with the caveat little
disclaimer make sure that you can deal
with the software wherever you buy it
from make sure they have a decent return
policy or if you can get your hands on
one at first I got to say guys I was
really impressed by the mate 8 I found
myself bouncing back and forth between
the 6p and the mate 8 and I'm
surprisingly impressed if they can
really kind of get their act together in
terms of software I'm very excited to
see what what else we can expect to see
from them throughout the rest of the
year let me know in the comments what
you think about the mate 8 there's a
like button for you to click on if you
enjoyed this video there's a subscribe
button to click on if you want to get
more videos like it and of course you
can also tweet me at Mark B if you want
to have a quick conversation whether
it's 2 a.m. 2 p.m.
doesn't really matter just let me know
what you think I love talking with you
guys you make my life a lot better thank
you guys so much for watching be kind of
one another and I'll catch you in the
next video I think I hope I hope I'm in
the next video I'm not in the next video
it's going to be an awkward conversation
to have late</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
