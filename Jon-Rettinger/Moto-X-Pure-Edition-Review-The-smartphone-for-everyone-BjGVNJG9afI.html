leave all preconceived notions out of a
review as reviewers we try to be as
objective as possible but just as normal
humans opinions of bias will inevitably
slip in I began my view the Moto X pure
edition really hoping I'd like it it
checked off almost all of my box must
haves stock Android well almost
check supposedly great camera check Q HD
screen check quick charge check
expandable storage check great value
check on the other side of my imagine
each art though we're missing a finger
print sensor wireless charging and
removable battery so after five days of
using the Moto X pure dishes my daily
driver which side wins and most
important question I'm gonna answer this
whole thing is but I buy it I'm Jon
render from TechnoBuffalo this is my
review of the Moto X pure edition as I
do with all my reviews let me give it a
slammer I use this guy for five days as
my daily driver on AT&amp;amp;T Motorola sent us
a code to design the device of our
choosing
Brandon you did the written portion also
use it for five separate days also on
AT&amp;amp;T want to see more detail anything
I'm gonna talk about or see full gallery
samples and beautiful HD hit the link
down below and check out our full
written review I'm gonna break this
review down into three separate
categories what I like what I don't know
other impressions that don't fit into
one of those two sections I'm generally
a pretty happy person so let's start the
likes the software Motorola has the best
take on Android period even better than
Google's own Nexus devices
it's almost stock with some really
useful and unobtrusive additions this is
essentially 5.1.1 with some apps
pre-installed and those apps are great
Motorola's quick notifications on
ambient lockscreen are insanely useful
the Moto app made the phone feel like
mine it recognized my voice and did some
really cool things when asked to take a
selfie or brought up the camera did a
countdown snapped away in new and I was
driving and read messages aloud it goes
way deeper but the moral it's really
helpful if you're like stock Android I
bet you're gonna dig this speakers
aren't something I usually talk about in
reviews but these front firing ones
sounded great loud without being tinny
maintain the fidelity of the music if
you're watching videos forgot to turn
the volume down they get so loud or if
you're the kind of person uses their
phone on speaker when in public you can
now annoy many people who never could
before
next on the likes is moto maker we had a
blast customizing our Ironman themed
phone to make it truly ours from picking
the backs and accent colors a
personalized message when you boot up
this phone felt like mine
other camera here's one that hasn't been
on our likes list for any moto device
for really as far back they can remember
the camera is not the best camera phone
every Motorola claimed in their
announcement but is really competitive
with the best and that's a gigantic
improvement from where they were 21
megapixel sensor takes good pictures in
normal light and even does a good job in
low-light it captures plenty of detail
and you could easily replace a
point-and-shoot is your go-to camera
again if you want to see more detail or
check out the whole gallery and full
glorious resolution hit the link down
below I know this is gonna matter to a
lot of you but my grill SD is here I
also really like the double side design
at the SIM slot and micro SD card slot
doesn't appear to take up any extra room
and makes you wonder well company's
gonna adopt something similar I'm adding
the screens Melissa likes because it's
the best screen Moto's ever done images
the clear text looks incredibly crisp
and videos and games look awesome but
any just a full disclosure i started
testing the device immediately after
using a samsung galaxy s6 edge+
so while the screen does look really
good definitely not as good as Samsung's
but would you pick this phone up
you'll hopefully won't be coming from a
Samsung screen and in that case screens
gonna look good to you starting at
through 99 this is a killer deal but it
was definitely competing in a more
crowded field may ever wore in years
past it's still a great value especially
me throw in moto maker last on my list
of likes is turbo power charging well it
is annoying the brick is freaking huge
and the cable is currently attached it
does charge super fast and because
there's always a flip side let's talk
about the dislike since this certainly
isn't a device without its flaws the
codes on my mind let's just start with
battery 3000 million power batteries
picked ibly not awesome now granted
using turbo charging helped a lot when
I'm out I'll always have that giant
power brick with me wireless charging
would have really helped here you'd get
through a full day if we can have to
change how you use the device for me
that meant turning down my brightness
and not endlessly scrolling through a
newsfeed as often as I do my wife was
happy I wish I had better battery life I
no stop for is in my likes but the moto
camera app is not good
I don't like tapping the screen take a
picture I can't think me would just
focus it it's a personal thing I
understand so I end up switching over to
Google's own camera app so I guess
points to Androids letting the user
choose their default out here's
something new they have never mentioned
in my years reviewing phones vibration
the vibration motor is so loud on this
phone it's almost like its own ringtone
forget trying to be subtle in the movie
if this thing is on vibrate mode
every one five rows away from you it's
gonna know someone's calling the phone
also feels a little bit top-heavy it's
not gonna followed your hands by any
means but just waited a little bit
weirdly thought I mention it the lack of
mirror print sensor especially now that
Android pay is out is a big omission I
got really used to put on my iPhone and
Samsung devices and not having it here
made the device feel really lacking to
me maybe if you're coming from a device
that doesn't have it you will miss it if
you're coming from one that does it is a
glaring omission even for this price
point so this next thing is nitpicky I
know but I can't be alone here I love
the Google now launcher my favorite part
is just swiping right to get to Google
now I have never configured almost
mirror it but no matter what gesture
shortcuts I said about what did I put
there so just like the convenience of
Google now just a screen away the Moto X
comes with Google now launcher
pre-installed so you figure awesome
right John's not gonna complain here
you my friend are wrong not awesome
because limits you to four icons down
plus the dot which makes zero sense for
devices resolution icons just look way
too far spaced out on the note 5 or
galaxy s6 edge+ for example install
Google now launcher you get five down
plus the dock it makes a really big deal
to me fortunately though I've got Nova
to get me almost there now on to the
neutrals things you need to know about
the device that aren't good or bad
they're just things that you need to
know the build quality it does feel
better than previous gens but nothing
memorable doesn't feel great but not
horrible included here because people
just asked me about it a lot next
performance for me it felt as if you use
anything else I mean it does have three
gigs of RAM a Snapdragon 808 Brandon FL
it was a bit sluggish specially when
multitasking it's fast but not blazing
because I know you are all gonna ask
here are the benchmarks 25,000 488 on
quadrants and 47,000 749 on in two two
five seven one so what's the verdict is
there perfect phone nope but it's a damn
good one right they were discussing what
we want to talk about in the review and
meet the analogy that the Moto X is like
the camerea phones it's all flash it
does have any curved screens or other
gimmicks but it's gonna be reliable and
it's gonna do what it's supposed to do
without turning mini heads so the
question I asked the beginning would I
buy this if I had a 400 to buy a phone
then yes I absolutely would I would
customize the color and casing to make
it absolutely uniquely mine motorola has
a hit on their hands and the least
you'll need an invite to buy this guy
this gets an 8.5 on the TechnoBuffalo
skill so you guys think do you agree
disagree my off base let's give your
thoughts on it maybe the civil
discussion down below until next time
I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo so
yeah that's next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
