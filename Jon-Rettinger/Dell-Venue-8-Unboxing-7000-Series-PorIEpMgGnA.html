techno before it's an unboxing of a
really nice tablet for maker you might
not expect this is the Dell Venue 8 the
new Dell Venue a is part of their 7000
series this is the 7840 pricings gonna
depend on where you buy it and what
specs you get and are from around 350 to
around 400 bucks kind of a nondescript
box go ahead and slide it on out and
there is the tablet its opening the box
you've got the tablet itself you've got
an 8.4 inch OLED screen 2560 by 1600
this brings out the big deal to tablet
the big deal is the build quality this
thing looks absolutely incredible in
fact it looks like the love child of an
HTC One m8 and a nexus 9 that's kind of
a reverse design for you see on most
tablets that usually are kind of like
this with the camera in the upper right
hand corner or in the upper left or in
the middle but the speaker at least on
top this one it's the other way like
this with the chin down below and a
relatively bezel list design feels
incredible unibody design that cold
aluminum or aluminium back depending on
how you want to say it or what country
you're from and then the rear facing
camera down below this is been powered
by an Intel Atom processor up to 2.3
gigahertz shipping with Android 4.4.4
kitkat but hopefully get lollipop on
here 2 gigs of RAM 16 gigs of storage
the downside is only eights could
actually be available to you but you
can't expand that with a microSD card up
to 512 gigabytes 802 11 AC bluetooth 4.0
the camera on the back is 8 megapixel
the big one on the front is going to be
2 and battery is just under 6,000
milliamps at 5900 let's go ahead and our
the sucker on and I'll walk you through
everything here alright so as this guy
boots on I usually expect to find the
power and volume buttons on the right
hand side but this guy is all about the
opposites that's a living on the left
so there's your power there's your
volume noise cancelling microphone lives
there as well on the top nothing kind of
interesting Intel logo you don't see
that every day but a very quick boot up
time on it on the bottom is where every
3.5 milimeter headset jack and your
charging ports
USB then on the right hand side is where
your microSD cards gonna go if you are
so inclined we'll go ahead and open this
sucker up I knew greeted with relatively
stock Android although there are some
tweaks here that's go ahead and look
what's on it will jump down into the app
tray and see what dell has so a few Dell
exclusive apps you see a custom camera
some Dell casts and Dell live widgets
and Macs audio and some other things
that come pre-installed but for the most
part it's pretty stock android kitkat in
fact let's see what version Kit Kat it
is here scroll on down we'll go to about
tablet Android 4.4.4 hopefully we will
see lollipop on here very soon the past
few months I've really come to
appreciate Android on the tablet it's an
incredible operating system this is a
really nice package it's relatively
inexpensive the build quality is some of
the best I've seen at Apple and we're
looking forward to using this guy and
they particularly you guys want to see
let us know if you want to see how the
screen works outdoors if you want us to
benchmark it we'll make sure that we do
whatever you guys want to see when we do
further coverage on it until next time I
am John render from TechnoBuffalo if you
liked the video give it a thumbs up so
