brought to you by goto meeting with HD
faces cuz no one likes sad faces what's
up everyone welcome back to another
episode of ask the buffalo i'm your host
jon rettinger this is the show or you
could ask me any question you have from
the wide world of technology up this
week it's a lot of apple news we're
going to talk about iOS 6 the new Retina
Display MacBook Pros what my weapon of
choice would be in a zombie apocalypse
and a few other tech questions in
between this is asked to Buffalo it's
going to get started user Laurens dbx
what do you think about the new macbook
pro with retina display would you buy it
even with its huge price tag please I
really want an answer so first extremely
thin and extremely light coming in at
just about four and a half pounds if
you're coming from an existing laptop if
you're coming from a macbook pro this
thing is going to feel light svelte and
like a supermodel coming from a macbook
air it's going to feel heavy big and too
clumsy to possibly lug around
performance wise though it really does
look to be a beast we just got it in the
TechnoBuffalo offices yesterday so I
have really yet to run it through it
stats from comfortable sort of sharing
experiences with it but initial
performance seems to be very very
impressive whether or not it's worth it
for the money is going to come down to
you it is missing a few things that the
older macbook pro design has namely an
optical drive so if that's important to
you do a lot of physical media you want
to be able to import cds or play dvds us
is probably not going to be the best
choice for you if however you want a
little faster performance solid-state
drive is going to be something that's
important to you hdmi port something
that you're looking for and that
beautiful Retina Display then it might
be worth the money but really like any
purchasing decisions getting come down
to your particular set of facts so
consider those I when deciding whether
or not the new 15-inch MacBook Pro
serves is a pretty large spot in your
bag user sasha endura asks hey John
don't you think iOS 6 copied some things
from Android for example reply with text
message tab syncing was already on
Android also Safari coffee crumb with
the unified bar so that's not thinking
about how answer this question I really
get two options the
nice polite way or the honest blunt away
if you guys have watched my videos for a
while you know I generally heir to the
honest blunt way so here it is who cares
there are really two main competing
operating systems in global world
there's Android and as iOS and certainly
they are going head-to-head competition
is good for the consumer I know how many
times I got to say that features are
going to come and be influenced from
each other you can see apples influence
on Android androids influence on Apple
it doesn't matter the how strongly
people feel about mobile operating
systems and the vitriol and hate
sometimes that they restore for the
other is completely unfounded and
unjustified that's the honest answer yes
Apple absolutely took influence from
Android one hundred percent they did but
the end result is a better experience
the Apple consumer Android absolute akin
fluence from Apple and the result is a
better end-user experience for the
Android user competition is wonderful
for the consumer and the notion that
companies have to do everything unique
and everything has to be innovative it's
never going to happen every product in
the world have influenced by another
product that's just a way the world
works unfortunately so yes absolutely
Apple take influence from it do I care
no not at all i care about us experience
when i use a phone whether that's
android or iOS i think that you guys
should look at it that way to try look
at it from a business perspective as
well and not look at it so sort of
strongly minded when it comes to android
or iOS and we see this on the site all
the time if we mention iOS if we mention
anything after with android commenters
immediately sort of come in very
strongly with a feeling one way or
another which does make for a lively
discussion it doesn't always translate
to real world business decisions and
certainly Google and Apple are real
world business companies so if cannibals
eating people's faces off the next
inevitable step is the zombie apocalypse
and Gabriel wants to know John what
would your weapon of choice be in the
upcoming zombie apocalypse protect your
face protect your legs zombies are
coming fat chance to interview ideas new
media rockstar I had a chance to take a
good old-fashioned baseball bat take out
my aggression on TV that would my weapon
of choice just a baseball bat it's not
going to break you have to worry about
reloading it
classic weapon it's perfect for zombie
smashing so what weapon would you pick
that was that was more just annoy the
zombies I think what weapon would you
pick love to hear what you guys have to
say and speaking of weapons the best way
to fight living on different parts of
the continent of the world is with

comes from Patrick you and Patrick wants
to ask you guys make a develop a
technobuffalo app for Android and iOS
Patrick something that we've been
thinking long and hard about and it is
coming up and saying it's coming for a
while we're relaunching TechnoBuffalo
with the new theme style sometime in the
October time frame once we can see that
that's live and
gonna have to devote more resources to
sustaining it apps are next on the list
so i think we're probably see apps very
early next year at something that you
guys been asking for something that I
really want to give you but I want to
put up to son you know half-assed done
app I want to be really good and be a
great way to get Tecna Buffalo content I
just wanted an app that would just show
the articles on the site you know that
could be easy but there's nothing fun
there's nothing ingenious or unique
about it I really want to make something
that that I'm proud of and I wouldn't be
proud of something like that so
hopefully that helps answer your
question thank you guys for watching ask
the Buffalo be sure to stay tuned every
week for a new episode or you can ask
