TechnoBuffalo
and last month we heard an incredible
announcement from Samsung there was a
brand new s7 and s7 edge today I'm here
in Santa Monica California it's
beautiful weather a little bit windy
still beautiful very sunny and nice for
me to get my tan on and I wanted to take
a look at the SFF see if it would live
up to the hype we're filming on it right
now so you guys can see what the
front-facing camera looks like lots of
awesome features take a look at new
waterproofing I'm very very excited so
let's go ahead and get started
first things first when you pick up this
phone you're going to be looking at the
design and this phone looks fantastic
the s7 edge to me is one of the best
design phone I have ever seen now from
the s6 and s6 edge+ it is minor
improvements your camera hump on the
back is flattened out a little bit your
thumbprint reader on the front is a
little bit flattened out a little bit
the whole package is just smoother
slicker with the highlight moment to me
for the design of this phone is
something that's not talked about very
often the mobile phone world we all
carry phones nowadays and they've become
extensions of who we are the phone you
use the OS you use the case you have on
it the color you buy it in it says
something about you just the way your
clothes say something about you and your
shoes and your jewelry and this phone is
really like a piece of jewelry in gold
it is super flashy it looks awesome it's
a very superficial thing but I didn't
feel lame carrying it around I felt
awesome and I wanted to tell people
about it in terms of build quality it's
as good as anything I've ever used
probably even better it's been mentioned
a couple times that Samsung actually
made this one a little bit thicker than
the previous gen s6 edge and all the
better for it because again it just
feels fantastic the back curve that
they've brought in from the note 5 is a
very welcome addition it's a bunch of
small additions that make this a
fantastic phone to hold into use on a
day to day basis still a fingerprint
magnet and the edge screens make it a
little bit tough to pick up from time to
time but nothing you can't get over for
looking and feeling with a badass so
what are the differences here in specs
between the s6 edge and the new s7 edge
well first off it's the display size now
it's been up to a 5.5 inch display so
it's in between what the s6 edge was the
s6 edge+ was the my opinion it's the
perfect screen size resolution still
1440 by 2560 which 4k is not really
needed here I'm more than happy with
that resolution when first looking at
the camera it might seem like Samsung
actually downgraded it going from 16
megapixels to 12 megapixels but
megapixels are purely resolution and
that matters more when printing not so
much when viewing on regular computer
and phone displays so instead of
focusing on the megapixel account what
they did was go from an F 1.9 aperture
to an F 1.7 so they opened it up a
little bit they went from a 28
Lemaitre lends to a 26 millimeter lens
on the back so it's a little bit wider
field of view now and overall this is
probably one of the best cameras if not
the best cell phone cameras I have ever
used
Samsung has really been killing it as of
late with their cameras that being said
this is probably the first time I feel
comfortable with saying that you can
leave your point-and-shoot at home not
saying this is as good as some high-end
pointing shoots nothing there's a DSLR
replacement but in terms of convenience
in the trade-off of losing a little bit
of photo quality or only having to carry
one device I think the photos that come
out of the s7 are more than good enough
for your average consumers needs as
usual I'm a huge fan of the front-facing
ultra wide lens camera that is fantastic
for all my snapchatting needs something
to note however that when you shoot
video within Samsung's own camera app
that ultra wide-angle front-facing
camera becomes just a standard
front-facing camera when you're shooting
video and so speaking of the camera and
notable features on the s7 edge I did
what any five-year-old does at a
restaurant and I shove my phone into my
glass of water to see if it would hold
up with the ip68 rating and I can
confirm that it does I followed this up
with going to the playground and instead
of testing dust I went for full-on sand
something that Todd noted while
reviewing the phone was that the
fingerprint reader while it's good
enough is not as quick as the iPhone or
Huawei's fingerprint reader on the Nexus
phones and such
moving on to the always-on display I
have no emotions about this it's a new
feature I guess it doesn't really change
my usage of the phone at all I had some
problems getting used to it cuz I kept
thinking my phone was actually unlocked
but honestly that's probably questioning
my intelligence not so much Samsung's
new feature and to wrap up with one of
the big things and literally big because
it made the phone thicker is the battery
at 3,600 milliamp hours battery will
last you a full day most of the time
more than a full day with heavy usage
coupled with adaptive fast charging and
while I was charging you're more than
covered when it comes to battery and
power now one of the big differentiating
factors between the s7 and the s7 edge
is obviously the edge just like before I
think it's more of a gimmick than
anything else I think it's more for
aesthetic appeal unfortunately no real
functionality added so those are my
thoughts in the new Galaxy s7 edge of
course you have support from microSD
card which is cool I'm not a huge
microSD card user I'm much more fan of
using cloud storage and internal storage
that works fine for me I know John has
some stronger opinions on it so check
out the s7 review for that and while I
had almost only positive things to say
about the s7 edge I gotta say if I was a
buyer in the market and had to put my
dollar behind the phone I would probably
use this opportunity to grab an s6 edge+
or an s6 edge at a cheaper price the
improvement on the s7 edge are good
marginal at best nothing too crazy
and speaking of marginal and nothing too
crazy we did see a processor upgrade up
to a Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 88-90
octa processor but it's not like the s6
edge was slow before let me know what
you guys think do you guys think it's
worth the upgrade would you guys spend
the extra money on it what are your
opinions and thoughts I always love to
know I genuinely try to respond to like
