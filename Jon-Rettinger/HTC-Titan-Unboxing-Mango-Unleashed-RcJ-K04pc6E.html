technobuffalo here as our website in the
videos continue to grow we're expanding
to new parts of the world technobuffalo

international we have a writer in Seoul
South Korea and sage we have killian in
the UK and we're expanding our video
audience to the UK as well and hopefully
to the rest of Europe so like you guys
to meet our newest european-based video
producer you might recognize his face
he's dave Cryer from geek annoyed it
does an awesome job was a guy of the
following for quite a while I actually
had the pleasure of meeting him when I
was in London last month so please enjoy
gage first video and give him a hearty
welcome to TechnoBuffalo jon rettinger
now see you guys the next video
hi everyone this is dave from illinois
bringing you the TechnoBuffalo viewers
an unboxing of the HTC Titan mobile
phone so here we have it this is the HTC
Titan a brand new handset just come out
the other day it's running windows phone
7.5 the very latest version of the
operating system also known as mango is
take a look inside the box and this is a
very large screen handset as you can see
here is actually sporting a 4.7 inch
Super LCD screen running at 480 x 800
resolution let's just pop that to one
side and we'll show you what else you
get inside the box now we also get some
information here about Windows 7
software license terms we've got some
warranty contact information a warranty
statement windows phone 7 license terms
safety and regulatory guide and a little
bit more interesting with a full color
printed quick start guide how to get
everything up and running on your
handset further down into the box we've
got some little packets let's crack this
one open so in here we have got what
looks like the USB cable 1 ends going to
computer or charger the other end is a
micro USB connector to go into the
handset itself and in this pack here we
have got the hands-free kit I believe
yes we have this is the HTC hands-free
hit two little earbuds there for your
music pleasure and then a little click
control piece here which has got a small
microphone hold on the back and a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
on this end to go into the handset
and we've got some extra should be some
extra ear buds in here normally here we
go Google pack here with a crocodile
clip I'm not going to open this and some
little foam ear buds to go on those
earphones and then we have got here lay
country-specific adapter let's just have
a quick look in here now I'm in the UK
this will be specific to your country
but I have got a three pin if i can get
this out of the pack 3 pin UK adapter
this goes into the power point and then
the USB socket resides on the top for
charging the handset so get this box out
of the way and have a look at the
handset itself so we're going to peel
this off let me do it this way this is a
big phone it actually feels quite light
in the hand though it's not heavy by any
means so here we've got it we've got the
4.7 inch Super LCD screen this is
flanked here by some touch sensitive
buttons down the bottom here speaker
grill at the top front facing camera on
the top edge we have got that power
on/off button the microphone pick up
here and a three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack on this side direct access to
the camera on this button here volume
rocker up and down on the bottom we've
just got another microphone a little
piece here that we can push to gain
access to the battery and then round on
this side we've got that micro USB port
for charging and synchronizing the
device round on the back we have got the
camera and I believe this is an 8
megapixel camera which I am right in
saying that so we've got eight megapixel
autofocus 28 millimeter lens with f 2.2
aperture it's also got this nice thing
in the software where you can take
panoramic photos very easily with this
camera autofocus dual LED flash speaker
next to it here and then we've got what
looks like some more speakers or pickups
ashes is probably
microphone pickups I would imagine for
when you're recording video when it
comes to recording video you can only
record in 720p that is a limitation of
the windows phone 7.5 software this
front facing camera is a 1.3 megapixel
camera and I didn't see a battery in the
box i'm assuming the battery is already
installed the battery is quoted as a
1,600 milliamp hour battery and it will
reside under this cover here so here we
have the HTC Titan all turned on and
fired up and ready to go when is give
you a quick look at how smooth it is
scrolling very very fluid motion we're
actually connected via Wi-Fi at the
moment so I'm going to dive straight
into Internet Explorer you can see here
I've already loaded up the TechnoBuffalo
website let's give this a refresh and
just see how quick it is that refreshing
that page so we're connected via Wi-Fi
and there we go the page is almost
refreshed and let's dive straight into
maybe this top article here have a look
see what this looks like there we go
that is the article loaded let's turn
this round into landscape mode very very
nice to use the text is super super
crisp very crisp text great for pinch to
zoom as well no noticeable lag or check
a boarding on there let's pop to another
website is put to apples website have a
look see what that looks like so again
amazingly fast at rendering that page so
a very good browsing experience on the
HTC Titan so there we go guys that is my
very quick unboxing and look at the
brand new and very big 4.7 inch screen
