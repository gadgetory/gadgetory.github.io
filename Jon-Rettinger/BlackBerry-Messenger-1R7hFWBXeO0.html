to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of renter's
rifts I am back in states and I got a
story to tell you it's a story about
blackberry and how I use bbm quite a bit
while I was traveling at the Geneva Auto
Show and I really really liked it this
is retinas risk let's get started before
we get to the story let me just say I
used an iPhone 5s while I was in Geneva
and my wife uses a Galaxy Note 3 so we
couldn't talk on the phone using
FaceTime audio which is pretty solid
whatsapp which we did use for messaging
on occasion doesn't have a voice option
we could have set up Skype but I really
wanted to give bbm for voice of a shot
so I was traveling I installed bbm on my
wife's phone she never use it before
she's not the most tech-savvy and I
wanted to you know give it a whirl
forget all the hoopla but going over
whatsapp being sold for a lot of money I
wanted to see what black break it off no
certainly hasn't been that many reasons
to have good news for black bear over
the past few years but I think it's time
to give credit where credit is due
bbm is awesome and bbm for voice is
absolutely incredible the voice quality
this is all the other side of the world
even when I had a very slow Wi-Fi
connection was awesome you could not
tell us on their side of the god of the
world you couldn't hear any echo it
sounded really really good at sounds
like any typical cell phone call on her
ends again not the most tech-savvy she
was very easy for her to use she figured
out how to make phone calls figure out
how to answer it she liked that you
could see if her messages were received
everything just worked really really
well I did make international calls
using Skype to call my family and to use
dial actual numbers on the voice quality
didn't measure up to what I was hearing
on bbm voice so if you're looking about
traveling you might want to give bbm a
shot actually made me want to look at
bbm serve as a whole messaging platform
all over again it worked really quickly
I was using whatsapp usually that works
pretty well I get the little check mark
let it got sent but sometimes it's delay
I
delay at all with bbm that's how we
texted each other it's how we made phone
calls I had no issue with it at all I
Jewish on non BlackBerry devices that
there was a way to do video chat it
would have been kind of nice to see my
baby and see my wife and such but for
just straight voice it was really really
incredible the only knock that I had on
it is the little icon to dial was super
small how to kind of tap it and when you
put it on speaker there was an echo so
you got to hold the phone up to your
head but that is really really it so if
you're traveling abroad and you're
thinking about maybe wanting to send
messages or make phone calls it's a
really great way to go it's now pretty
much platform agnostic with the
exception of Windows Phones you've got
Android iOS or of course blackberry you
can use bbm Voice and just going to work
well so again I haven't had the
opportunity or really the reason to say
many positive things about blackberry
they've been you know hemorrhaging money
into their history the past few years
been a well-documented no point in
rehashing well they do something right I
feel they need to give credit as a bbm
for voice really awesome if you've got
friends that live out of the country if
you've got relatives live out of the
country if you want a for some reason
save your minutes a really solid way to
go I did try using it when I was just on
data to hear the quality I was on a 4G
connection in Geneva on Swisscom I did a
speed test I was getting about 2 to 3
megabits down and about the same up and
I just made a quick couple minute calls
to test how it worked on data and it
sounded absolutely identical as it did
to on Wi-Fi so the issue there as well
as funding in the States you want to use
it on Wi-Fi or over cellular you're
gonna have no problem at all so
blackberry nice job not something I've
had a chance to say very often and I'm
happy to be able to say it again you
