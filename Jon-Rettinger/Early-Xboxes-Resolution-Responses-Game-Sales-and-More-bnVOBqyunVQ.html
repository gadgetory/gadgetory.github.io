to you by audible early Xbox one's
resolution drama game deals are
battlefield 4 review super mario 3d
world gameplay and a gaggle of new games
let's get out of controller hello
everyone and welcome now to controller
the weekly TechnoBuffalo show that
covers all your gaming news reviews
demos and new releases in its easy to
digest capsule farm I'm your host Ashley
sceva and I'm super excited to launch
this show on our channel especially
since its new console November and the
ps4 is coming this week it's always a
big week in gaming though so let's start
out with the news some very lucky Xbox
customers got the gamer surprise of a
lifetime last week when their Xbox one
pre-order showed up in the mail for
those of you playing at home that is
three weeks before the consoles official
launch on the twenty-second of this
month one of the xbox one consoles found
its way to ebay but the auction was
pulled down after getting a tremendous
amount of attention as you'd imagine
another early Xbox one hundred twitter
user moonlight Swami shared his thoughts
and findings about his first days of the
use revealing a required 500 megabyte
update when you boot up the new xbox but
then he was banned from xbox life
however it looks like Major Nelson is
working with moonlight Swami to get
everything cleared up so hopefully he
won't be banned for too long head of
Microsoft Studios Phil Spencer is
fighting back against criticism from
gamers regarding frame rates and
resolutions for Xbox one games call of
duty ghosts plays natively in 720p at 60
frames per second and now rise son of
Rome is confirmed to run in an odd 900p
ratio at 30 frames a second Spencer says
quote games should be defined by more
than their frame rate and resolution
unquote and that also quote if they
really care they can go play Forza at
1080p 60fps unquote Spencer then went to
thanh to talk about why connect was made
a mandatory part of Xbox one bundle
explaining that he didn't want to split
up the user base for developers which in
turn helped Microsoft garner connect
support for many
games and features so I guess it's kind
of a win-win for everybody except for
your wall it's console launch week for
the playstation 4 and there are a couple
of great sales happening target's
started things off with a buy two get
one free deal for select ps4 launch
games and it appears amazon has followed
suit with the exact same deal so here's
how it works if you have no games
pre-ordered you buy two games up the
list and get a third for free obviously
if you've already pre-ordered one game
you just have to buy another one and you
get the third free and if you already
have two games pre-ordered you'll
automatically qualify for the free game
deal bonus to be fair the launch title
selection is a little sparse save for a
couple of titles but if you're eyeing
three games your ps4 this should save
you enough cash to maybe pick up another
controller each week out of controller
picks a review on our site TechnoBuffalo
and gives you a recap this week's review
recap is battlefield 4 so what's our
official stance well the single-player
campaign is pretty terrible but it's
also short enough that it's a worthwhile
gamerscore boost without being
completely annoying to finish
multiplayer is a whole other story
though and really that's where
battlefield shines we specifically did
conquest mode which relies heavily on
teamwork and control point domination
but if you want to read the full review
and see our final score hit the link in
the description let's play as a feature
on our gaming channel where a member of
our writing staff plays a game it talks
about it over the footage this week's
let's play as the highly anticipated
Super Mario 3d World on Wii U Nintendo
said we could only use two-minute clips
if we also had commentary so our own
gaming editor joy Davison spent two
different levels talking about the game
and bopping goombahs this game looks
ridiculously fun so make sure you head
over to our TV place channel to check it
out I gotta interrupt the show for just
one second to talk about our good
