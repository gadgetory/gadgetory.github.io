for sponsoring this video she want to
learn more about their power way of
wireless chargers even potentially get a
discount for yourself
hit the link down below I'm gonna tell
you guys a poorly kept secret about Siri
she sucks and this isn't like a knock on
the iPhone in general I'm a big fan of
the iPhone in fact I'm using the iPhone
I enjoy my iPhone what I don't always
enjoy is Siri to put that in context
Syria is okay on its own so your
compared to the competition
still has ways to go so Siri actually
debuted in 2011 with the iPhone 4s it
was until July the next year that Google
now came about which start answering
questions doing assistent like things
they started split that out into it's
now the Google assistant but even now in
early 2018 Siri is still incredibly far
behind now Suri still has some uses I
think it's incredibly good at dictation
she's good at reminders she's got a
calendar as good at telling jokes and
occasionally singing you a bedtime story
but you look at it apples Apple so to
speak what the two can do side by side
you start to see how far behind Siri is
is message to apples there are a few
small steps Apple could take to really
bring Siri up to parity but we have with
Google assistant let me show what I'm
talking about so the first thing the
Lynx was series the experiences
inconsistent across devices if you're
using Siri on a home pod for example it
does a really good job of being
contextually aware of what you're
talking about if you're talking about an
actor you could ask what movie he was in
and it'll know that experience is not
the same on the iPhone it's different on
an Apple watch you don't get the same
Siri on every device that's confusing
and ultimately ends up being annoying I
blitz focus on the iPhone I mean
contextually aware I mean the phone's
going to know the context of what you're
talking about so let me show you hey
Siri who is Kobe Bryant
Kobe Bryant played shooting guard in the
NBA between 1996 and 2015 he played for
the Los Angeles Lakers how many
championships did he win here at Kobe
Bryant's career stats in the NBA so
protects Lee here Siri didn't know who
you're talking about it but couldn't
find the answer
sometimes she knows sometimes not the
results are just frustratingly
inconsistent another big area of
deficiency is knowing what's on your
screen if I'm on Safari and I go to
Lakers calm and I ask Siri when the next
game is it's gonna pull up a list of
sports and I have to go through grain
early to eventually go to basketball
Lakers and then find out about the game
so if we're on Chrome on an Android
device and I just asked when the next
game is Google is going to contextually
know the screen that I am on and I'll
tell me when the next Laker game is that
is HUGE step into textual awareness and
it makes the AI again more
conversational more useful it knows what
you were doing like a real person a real
assistant who's kind of sitting in the
room with you so contextual awareness is
one thing and I'm sure you guys
experienced this but what about general
questions I can ask Siri when the NFL
Draft is for example and I'll tell me
what it found on the web if I go ahead
and ask Google when the NFL Draft is
it'll give me the exact dates and here's
where things get interesting at least on
the surface do you think that Google was
way far ahead all it's doing is reading
you the results that it found on the web
what series not doing is reading you the
results that it you guessed it found on
the web it would just read what it's
finding it would bring it up to pretty
close to parity with Google but it's not
so it makes it less useful if you are in
the car if you can't read if you can't
look down if you're visually impaired a
lot of reasons that you can't click an
article and wait for to load to get your
answer Google just simply reads it to
you that is one of a ton of examples I
could have picked but this is something
that happens all the time
another example that happened to me I'm
a DirecTV now subscriber they mentioned
that sometime in spring their beta was
going to go public so I wanted to know
what months were spring Siri just be me
a search on the web and Google told me
the exact month those questions those
things that you would ask a person ask
an assistant are far and above better on
what you get on Apple and mostly it's
because it just read you the stinkin
answer
Apple already has there this isn't to
say that Siri is a horrible assistant
like I said it's good at a lot of things
it's just not as good as the competition
and it should be apples got incredible
honor resources and they're touting
Syria this incredible product they're
putting Siri front and center on the
home pod you see Syrian iPhone adds the
experience it be consistent and sir you
should read you what it's finding to
bring it up to pars what you get from
Google and I don't know why now almost
seven years later is not doing those
things
it's regardless of how you feel about
Siri one feature that I am glad finally
made it to I phones is wireless charging
and if you want to wirelessly charge
your Apple phone your Samsung phone any
other phone that can do wireless
charging if they want to check out the
power wave wireless chargers there are
two different options there's the power
wave seven point five pad it's made of a
pretty cool and excellent material it's
gonna make sure your phone's not gonna
get scraped or scratched
there's also if you like to stand up
your phone there's a power wave seven
point five stand it's gonna give you
that same faster wireless charging you
can put your phone into a horizontal or
vertical to work either way if you guys
are in the market for a new wireless
charger hit the links down below you can
sign up and choose the deal that's gonna
suit you best have you guys been annoyed
with Siri too and I challenge you to try
one of these things on your friends
Android phone or your Android phone and
see how it handles things differently
and I think that you are going to agree
the subscribe button little bell next
foot to let you know when new videos are
coming your way I'm John Redinger from
TechnoBuffalo
