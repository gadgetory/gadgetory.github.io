TechnoBuffalo calm and this is the
t-mobile HTC Wildfire s it's the
Wildfire s t-mobile's newest HTC Android
phone and this one is a little bit more
budget-friendly
than the higher-end devices like the
sensation it's available now for $79.99
after $50 mail-in rebate with two-year
service agreement so 80 bucks after
rebate kind of a mid tier I guess you
would say phone but I still got Android
Gingerbread Android 2.3 Gingerbread it's
got a full touch screen it's got HTC
Sense it's got swipe it's got a 5
megapixel camera it's not 4G its 3G HSPA
7.2 maximum download speeds so it's 3G
not 4G but it is a quad-band world phone
if you're gonna be traveling abroad this
one comes in two finishes black and
white and your the whole idea here is a
little bit smaller
it's a 600 megahertz processor but
because of the display is smaller and
fewer pixels you don't really need the
one gigahertz processor to move the
pixels around but it's a nice compact
phone obviously they send us the white
version while this is booting up 3.2
inch display so I will get the full
specs for you and the graphics at the
bottom of the screen down there see down
there at the graphics so how this is
booting up also in the Box you get
pretty basic you get your manuals you
get a USB cable and then you get the
modular power adapter alright and again
the phone does run Android 2.3
Gingerbread but it's not the latest
version of HTC Sense it's sense 2.1 so
we'll get this set up here english tan
on screen cameras get our on-screen
keyboard skip automatically sync data
sure set up Wi-Fi we'll do that later
the location sure 3 I will set up a
council later just so we can see what
the device looks like so on the front
you've got
your screen you got your four capacitive
touch buttons on the bottom there your
earphone speaker grille on the Left
spine rocker switch for volume mini USB
port on the right spine nothing on the
bottom you've got your microphone
openings on the top power lock switch
and three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack man I remember back in
the days when I used to complain all the
time why don't they put headphone jacks
on phones and now they all have them
it's great five megapixel camera on the
back with flash LED flash 3x digital
zoom just as video recorder on the
tearsheet they gave me it doesn't list
the specs of the video recorder so we
will have to find out about that what's
going on here I thought I saw something
oh all right I thought I thought
basketball there so that's sad I hope
he's okay anyway so here's the phone
itself and again it's the older version
of sense but you've got all your HTC
widgets
you've got your Google search widgets
and everything as well friend stream
keep track of your Facebook and Twitter
updates the notifications menu here the
notifications drawer when you pull it
down you've got the quick settings tab
there which is kind of nice you can
easily get to your most used settings
and then we'll go back to the home
screen take a look at the apps see what
extra apps are installed you've got four
one one and more the HTC apps of course
friend stream hub that kind of stuff
HTC likes my account my device t-mobile
mall Slacker Radio pre-installed visual
voicemail Wi-Fi calling as well which is
cool so you know not too much extra
bloatware if you will installed on the
device will will go quickly back to the
internet here and actually you know what
let's go from the let's go from the home
screen it's the other voice search works
TechnoBuffalo
all right so this is going over 3G right
now not connected to Wi-Fi at the moment
mobile version of our site loading up
phone feels nice you know it's a little
bit plasticky but but relatively high
quality plastic feeling got a nice kind
of matte finish not quite soft grip but
a nice matte finish to it and the size
you know I'm a fan of these smaller
phones oh boy
I don't actually ever buy one I keep
saying I'm a fan of these smaller phones
but I never actually buy one but I in
theory you know I just I like that
companies like HTC are still kicking out
these smaller phones because not
everybody wants a giant you know 4-inch
phone and I'd have a full-on smartphone
with a smaller form factor here is
pretty cool I think so quickly we'll
load up post about it's not right for me
to load up a post about a rival phone
and a rival network dragon unboxing
that's not cool
you've got a pre-installed two gigabyte
microSD card of course you've got GPS
Bluetooth it's a 1230 milliamp hour
battery Wi-Fi 802 BG 802 11 B G and N on
the display 3-2 320 by 480 so QVGA
display 320 by 480 206 mm colors again
3.2 inches the phone weighs 3 points 7
ounces and it feels pretty good in the
hand it's pretty responsive the screen
is a little a little grippy there oh
nice trying to slide off but not not too
bad let's go real quick and check out
that camera see if we can find out what
the resolution is on there's no front
facing camera I will see if we can find
out what the resolution is for video
purposes whoops that's good take me in
the gallery it's not Rowan ago
640 by 480 so will not shoot HD
all right so there you go unboxing first
look at the Wildfire s from HTC and
t-mobile against available now $80 on
contract after rebate available in white
and black thanks to the folks at
t-mobile PR for loading us this one and
you know if you're in the market for a
smaller lower-cost phone with full
smartphone capabilities you might want
to check this out I've just got to just
use it but you know I've reminds me of
some of the HTC phones in the past with
the smaller form factor the QVGA display
but ran the full Android experience and
you've got Gingerbread here right out of
the box which is nice
much much more on the Wildfire s all the
new phones all the new Android phones
the Photon 4G came out the other day
Jon's got that one some new stuff coming
out in the near future as well so
whatever it is will keep you up-to-date
