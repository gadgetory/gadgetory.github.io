here one of the cool things about the
Nexus One Android in particular in the
presence of these interactive
backgrounds or live wallpapers as Google
is calling them so you've demonstrated
of what they look like and show you the
stock ones that come on the Nexus One
what you're looking at right here is
called the nexus wallpaper and you can
see these little lines moving around and
as you touch the screen you can see that
there's some interactivity and that's
true when you on a screen with icons it
still does just the same let me show you
the other live wallpapers that come on
the Nexus One to access them you just
hold down on the home screen go to
wallpapers and there's a new item there
called live wallpapers so take a look at
galaxy first I'll show you what all
these look like and not so you can sort
of see a little bit of the speed of the
Snapdragon processor this one doesn't
really respond to your touch but it is
moving in the background you can see it
a little bit of a swirl and as you go
from homescreen to homescreen it changes
just a little bit let's go ahead and
check out the next one next one we've
got is called grass this one's sort of
neat application so this is a problem
that a lot of people with the Nexus One
or having I saw it and gadget
demonstrate the same issue the grass
wallpaper forever reason does not seem
to function so go ahead and foreclose it
let's go ahead and try the next one you
can see that there are still problems
that are being associated with Android
2.1 inside defaulted right back to the
previous wallpaper so we'll go to magic
smoke set that as well paper and some of
these are very fun you can sort of see
the potential that these might have all
this certainly they're a little bit of a
battery drain it's not as big a drain as
you might expect this is just smoke that
moves doesn't respond to your touch but
it sort of looks like a slime background
kind of neat check out the next one next
time we've got is one called many
Allmusic visualizations together slowly
revolving 3d so I believe this one if
you're playing music it'll show
sort of the equalization that's going on
and it's an effect to go along with it
that's really all it is sounds a little
bit on the boring side then check out
the next ones okay this one is called
polar clop it's actually pretty neat it
presents the date and time as clockwise
arts month day hour minute and second
don't show what that looks like so again
not working so there are still some
problems with these quit unexpectedly so
let's go ahead and try the next one I'm
going to force close this but that's
just one it's certainly not without its
bugs and areas and you can see I'm
trying to hit the home button with
little avail there it goes
saved a little bit of time yes we see
that they're working out some of the
errors with this so see that other else
we have we hit the wrong button
wallpapers live wallpapers and there are
a few more that are kind of neat
here's spectrum actually as a frequency
spectrum of any current playing music
track and that's that all it does and as
you go ahead and move it along it'll
move a little bit and if you're playing
music it would bump and grind for you
like it's doing right now and just a few
more to go through got view meter it
simulates an analogue sound meter
doesn't really do that much one of the
ones I didn't want to show you is water
this one another one that reacts to your
touch and it's kind of neat go ahead and
set wallpaper go to screen here I can
show you a little bit you get ripples as
you touch it kind of neat you can move
the leaves around sort of flow it's
mostly just they're just a time killer
if you want to play around some people
find it relaxing just one of the other
neat features that's found on the Nexus
One as you guys can see these are pretty
handy but relatively useless I'm just
gonna drain the battery nice kind of
like it I've kept the Nexus as my
homescreen since I got the phone
yesterday but there are still some
errors as you saw with some of the live
wallpapers so guys hope you enjoyed if
you have any questions
about the next is one of the things you
want to see you leave them in the
comments or a video response from very
curious and for all your Nexus One
coverage and upcoming CES coverage sure
to stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo I'm John
Rhett enger' and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
