to you by gamefly titanfall alpha
gameplay leaks Nintendo's slashed we use
sales forecasts and some big Xbox one
sales numbers also we played the banner
saga and cover this week's new releases
let's get out of controller hello and
welcome out of control or the weekly
TechnoBuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases and an easy to digest capsule
form I'm your host Ashley skele it's
always a big week in gaming so let's hit
the news usually when you're in an
invite-only alpha test you sign a little
thing called a nondisclosure agreement
barring you from sharing things like
gameplay footage or descriptions of said
gameplay apparently a little NDA isn't
going to stop some titanfall alpha
invitees though who posted a slew of
gameplay videos over the weekend EA and
respawn probably aren't too thrilled
with that but they might be happy to
hear several players saying titanfall
felt like a more exciting call of duty
those videos might be taken offline so
make sure you catch them before they're
all gone or you can just wait for
titanfall to launch for xbox 360 xbox
one and pc on march 11 which is really
only a few weeks away poor poor Nintendo
after posting great numbers for their
handheld consoles last month they
followed up by posting some pretty
disappointing sales forecasts for the
wii u originally nintendo estimated they
would sell nine million wii u consoles
this fiscal year and now after
consistently sluggish sales are slashing
that estimate by about seventy percent
ouch they didn't sell as much wii u
hardware software as they'd hoped this
past holiday season and then revamp
their future forecasts accordingly
nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata isn't stepping
down though saying his failure didn't
mean he had to resign I will see if the
historically conservative company makes
any major changes in the future but
right now kind of rough going for the
Wii U NPD group released their December
figures last week and revealed the Xbox
one was the number one selling next-gen
console in the u.s. last month with a
staggering nine hundred and eight
thousand units moved in addition xbox
360 sales topped the charts for its
console generation with six
forty-three thousand units sold
Microsoft has to be super thrilled about
those numbers but it's important to note
that last generation the Xbox enjoyed
more prominence and success in North
America than other territories kind of
the same as what's happening now at last
count the PlayStation 4 was still
topping the xbox one globally with 4.2
million consoles sold versus the Xbox
one's three million and if that wasn't
confusing enough NPD also reports the
Nintendo 3ds was the best-selling bit of
hardware for December and 2013 as a
whole let's play as a feature on our
gaming channel where a member of our
writing staff plays game and talks about
it over the footage this week Joey is
playing the banner saga of Viking
inspired RPG with beautifully rendered
characters great dialogue and some
killer turn-based strategy battles it's
definitely worth checking out if you're
