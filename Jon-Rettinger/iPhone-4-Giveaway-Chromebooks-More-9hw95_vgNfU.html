a lot today very very busy alright so

audrianna was talking about well Ford

Google's got those creepy self-driving
cars they're using some of that
technology you're not gonna have to let
your car drive you but it's going to
make a car smarter so if you're
interested in some kind of neat tech go
ahead and check out this guy and then

emily groupon now officially launched

company to make much much more money the
next article was by Jack McGrath which
mobile OS has the most valuable
advertisements what do you think it is

picture here could it be Android could
be iOS could it be webos could it be
symbian could be something else that you

Buffalo addition this is going to be a
weekly show where you can ask me
anything you want you can ask me
personal questions like I don't know why

questions like what phone should i get

leave questions here on the site so you
can leave it right on this article and
i'll go through and read them you can
send them via twitter with the hashtag

we first talked you can ask me anything
you want back to google i/o emily wrote
an article google announces Chromebooks
these are the Chrome OS netbook notebook
it's a combination of netbook and
notebook me out books that's got a ton
of battery life hundred megabytes of 3G
data for free able to boot up in eight
seconds a lot of goodness if you're a
student we're looking for computing on
abundant or you just don't want to spend
a lot of
me these are going to be a great great
option for you so if you want more
information on the Chromebooks go ahead
and check that out next Angry Birds now
available for the web there is now a
chrome OS version of angry birds so now
you can be even more unproductive at
work whereas before you had to hide your
iPhone under your desk while you're
working or hide your iPad to play Angry
Birds or your Android phone or webos
phone or whatever other device you have
now you can just do it online so what I
used to do when I worked in a real job
it wasn't angry birds but I used to read
I used to read tech sites and ESPN all
the time so I used to take all the texts
that I wanted to read at paste it into
an Excel spreadsheet so if anybody ever
came by it looked like I was just
working on a big ol Excel spreadsheet or
I'd open up outlook and I pasted into
like an Outlook email it look like i was
replying and i would just delete all the
pictures so that's another way that you
can be sneaky um I hope that my old boss
wasn't watching but if he is who cares
ah um and that's another way you can be
productive at work alright so the next
