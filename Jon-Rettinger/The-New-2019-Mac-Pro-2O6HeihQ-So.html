first Apple vents I ever went to I was
sitting right in the front actually I
was ending in the second row I was
behind Al Gore and it has a motion
sensor so when you turn it it even
lights up to show you where the i/o is I
was like starstruck is sitting there and
the event was good and then they came
out Phil Schiller came out was like
can't innovate anymore might like look
at the Mac Pro
my dreams kind of being able to have
this mac that suits my workflow as
changes instead of having to have change
in my workflow for the computer already
had
and this is kind of a departure I think
for Apple apples mantras kind of been
will tell you what you want and then
you'll be happy with it does Mac Pro
think it might be the first time the
apples gonna let people build what thing
rumors an apple go hand in hand the
rumor mill has been going crazy recently
we got 6k displays 16 inch MacBook Pros
wireless charging air pods and different
colors and all that's fine but one rumor
in particular has got me more excited
than I've been in years the new Mac Pro
this behemoth
is how the Mac Pro's life actually
started as a g5 power Mac and it stayed
this design for over a decade until Phil
Schiller took the stage and we got this
and then it came out and yeah you don't
innovative design we'd never seen a
computer that looked like that but it
was clearly like a design first function
second Apple was banking on like
thunderbolt all the things and adoption
happening super fast clearly that wasn't
the case and in the name of innovation
in the name of design they went for two
smaller GPUs instead of one larger one I
kind of backed themselves into a thermal
corner it got hot airflow was bad and
people just wanted to put in a normal
big GPU but they couldn't inside of that
like circular trash can and speaking of
that it probably didn't helped it like
it did clearly look like like a trash
can so that's the case I think an apples
fallen victim to this in the past I
would like the cube
it was form over function hopefully they
learned it's been like I said almost
2000 days what's next modularity is
what's next this isn't just like a rumor
that I picked up off internet I wanted
to share this is actually coming from
Apple executives coming from Phil
Schiller and Hair Force One himself cred
Federici in an interview said modularity
will be a cornerstone of the next Mac
Pro and that's significant they said
next Mac Pro so as I said earlier Apple
needs to innovate Apple needs to find
new revenue but it'd be nice to have a
truly innovative product he's getting
worse Apple seems to be spiraling down
the drain faster than anyone could have
imagined so narrative on Apple is that
they don't revolutionize anymore and I'm
gonna argue that Apple's doing what
Apple is always done revolution followed
by years of evolution look at their
history let's take it back to 1977 with
the Apple to this beige box changed
computing and they made that the same
design for years until we got a new
beige box that changed when we interact
with computers slip rub and every now
and then Apple thinks completely outside
of the box all right guess cube in this
instance
and then apple doesn't they've always
done revolution evolution till we get
something brand new that typifies the
direction of Apple for the future the
iPod this changed the way we consume
media and music then it's they the same
for generations until it didn't
it's like today if you want to build
your own PC I mean it's technically
modular you're putting all the pieces
together but I think a lot of people
don't need for either have the knowledge
or the wherewithal to actually build a
PC there's also you know there's a time
element to building a PC it takes time
maybe you don't have access to like a
Micro Center you don't want to drive to
Best Buy you can't wait for parts to be
shipped to you you can go to an Apple
store take something up and just drop it
right on so the modularity example here
is easy as you know buttoning your
jacket you just take your module and pop
it right on and you are good to go
there's no no screws to have to deal
with
there's no motherboard you got to worry
about you just drop it on and your
vision for what you want your Mac Pro to
be just kind of is limited only by you
know your wallet how you want to spend
and your little base can get taller and
taller and taller so you've got the
perfect set up for you then when you're
done just take them off and go back or
sell them or rent them whatever you want
but computers are gonna it's gonna work
for how you want it to be it also kind
of takes the compatibility question out
which building at PC is this Ram gonna
work with the motherboard it's a
processor gonna work with the
motherboard you're inside Apple's walled
garden for better or worse so you know
whatever you buy with that logo on it
it's gonna work with your modular Mac
Pro so you want random to think about
brand you just buy more RAM you want
more i/o enough to worry about thinking
if the mother worked in the supported
you just buy the i/o module whatever you
want you know it just gonna work out of
the box that's kind of what Apple has
been really good at so apples not the
first company to have this modular PC
idea a few years ago at CES razor had
project Christine it looked like we
might actually get it and then never
heard anything about it
also what's really exciting is a
potential for third-party modules on
this that was not always known for
opening things up but if they do
imagine what there could be things like
gaming modules if you're an audio and
you've got all of your i/o built right
in the options that could happen when
you have the foundation and if a
plus-size to embrace more of an open
environment could be incredible it seems
like Apple is heading to the inevitable
merger of Mac OS and iOS you can see how
advanced the iPad is getting I think the
Mac Pro might be one of the first
computers we see that bridges that gap
obviously as architecture concerns Apple
and start making their own silicon or
maybe they're sort of an Apple made
processor you can put on there where you
can use iOS apps it seemed like
something like this that offers
flexibility for the future can prepare
Apple for that future might be and even
if that is sort of a merger of their two
os's
having the word pro and a product for a
police released recently just means
expensive it doesn't mean necessarily
made for professionals something like
this so could kind of bridge that gap
which you like prosumer and professional
who makes their living on their computer
we've got youtubers that are editing on
75,000 dollar cameras
those are professional users in
professional use cases this Mac Pro can
appeal to everybody if you need the
extra horsepower to you know edit crazy
16 K raw you just drawn a few new
modules if you want to edit a video and
you're doing in pro res where you don't
need that much horsepower then you don't
need that extra modules this is a pro
computer that can scale up or scale down
to the user so where are we now in
Apple's history are we at the
evolutionary phase like the third
generation iPod are we finally gonna see
something new a brand new categories app
let that revolutionary time or get
something like the next iPhone I'm
surely hoping it's the latter but I
guess only time will tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
