back to episode of TB news this is where
we it at TB you get it we're giving you
news up today and fresh back from the
holidays we're hanging rumors of the
iphone 7s not called the iphone 8 coming
in September of 2017 so the folks at
macro guitar are claiming we're going to
have a third iphone model which is not
the first time we've heard that
size-wise will be slotted between the 7s
and the 7s plus it'll be 5 inches so
between the 4.7 and 5.5 with dick seems
interesting though is a camera layout
going to be switched the current
horizontal dual camera layout in the
iphone 7s to a vertical layout not sure
what benefit that's going to be for the
end user if to take better pictures or
just look different or if it's done for
internal components but cameras going to
go from this to to to that also
interesting macbook guitar is climbing
will be a new red color coming out for
the next gen iphone we've got a bit of a
spotty record they also claim there's
going to be a jet white color for the
current gen iphones which obviously ever
materialized maybe next gen will have
two separate colors now because it's
going to be called the 7s and the 7s
plus and whatever that middle one is
going to be doesn't mean we're not going
to have that old LED version that we've
heard in the past the presumed theory
for the next-gen iphone goes like this
the iphone 7s and then whatever the
5-inch one's going to be called will be
more on the lower side smaller screen
size perhaps overpriced and the 5.5 inch
phone would have been the 7s is going to
be more premium device perhaps have the
oled screen the no physical home button
and please finally wireless charging so
my bet is we have an iphone 7s at 4.7
inches and iphone 7 plus at five inches
and the third phone apology and iphone 7
as pro i'm guessing L&amp;amp;T would call it an
iphone 8 and have two different numbers
out of this at the same time i think
it'll be the pro version the phone will
have all those crazy ol it features
we've been hearing about for a while
produced in low-volume numbers probably
stupid expensive so new rumors for
iPhones not even 2017 yet your iphones
probably fresh out of the package but
progress marches on so what you guys
think
red color I'm work said about the jet
white if it ends up coming to fruition
Verret sounds pretty hot are you any
interest in this at all or you lee just
like don't care you're still relaxed
from the holidays and you don't want to
hear no more iphone news let us know
down below up to your thoughts on it
give the video a thumbs up to let us
know of course turn notifications make
sure you get notified when these videos
hit we got some cool things coming up
for people who watch our videos early so
check that out until next time jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and with
your new red iphone perhaps you want to
take your favorite animal planet show

i'll plan to go willing to it down in
the description I'm not allowed to say
