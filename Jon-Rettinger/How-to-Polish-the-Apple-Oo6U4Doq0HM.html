technobuffalo here last week was a
disastrous one for Apple the company's
value fell almost thirteen percent and
the process they plummeted from being
the most valuable company in the world
to the second most valuable company in
the world but second place is never too
bad we're talking about losing almost
twenty percent of your value in the span
of a week things can get disastrous I
wanna tell you what I think Apple can do
to improve their market share and their
mind share and regain some of their lost
luster so real quick business background
what happened Apple is any publicly
traded company the US has to do release
quarterly earnings and they miss
estimates they still put out about 350
ish billion of profits but it wasn't
what people expected and their stock
fell almost 60 points or sixty dollars
depending on how you want to look at it
it was absolutely disastrous for the
company losing twenty percent of their
book value really in just about 48 hours
but it's a smaller part of a larger
story Apple's been losing mind sharing
market share for the better part of the
past 14 months have really seen Samsung
lead that charge and the Android assault
so what does apple have to do to regain
their lost market share well first there
are multiple Android phones on multiple
carriers and multiple price points Apple
is currently offering Reese on the phone
standpoint one phone it's the iphone 5
they've got older models that are
available as well but it's one phone on
one carrier at the same price Apple's
being attacked from all angles but
they're only fighting straight ahead so
if Apple is interested in competing and
regaining that lost market raleys from a
device standpoint they either need to
compete at the left end of the bell
curve or the right into the bell curve
and to be at the low end of the price
point or the complete high into the
price point right now they're sort of on
the higher ish end they need a lower end
entry phone that's unique and that's new
that's not just a rehash of last year's
model now they might not get the
performance they might not get the user
experience that they've had in the past
but that's people are looking for
looking for that lower end price I can
get into the smartphone world and most
importantly once they get an Apple
device students at a lower price they're
gonna start buying apps and that's
really Apple secret sauce you know take
the hardware but by all our applications
they make
killing from the app store that thing is
literally printing money but the big
story here is less of a hardware it's
more of the software standpoint since
2007 Iowa's has not really changed that
much is become extremely stale the icon
still the same you interact with the
same you can now create folders you can
move icons around and of course we have
the app store but things just haven't
you Falls you don't have any way I'm
quickly doing information I don't have
any sort of live tile equivalent or
widget equivalent or anything along
those lines in order to get the
information you have to look inside of
an application if you want to see what
notification is you have to go inside of
an application there's Notification
Center you can pull down if you only get
just a smidgen of information there the
operating systems particular that have
been attacking iOS Oh Android and even
blackberry 10 coming on and Windows
Phone have evolved Google's been ghouls
been really good about pushing out
updates every three or four months which
I know for the consumer disappointing
because your phones are always getting
get it but they do bring new features a
streamlined the experience and Apple has
not been doing that releasing a new
phone every eight to ten months you know
incremental software upgrades has been
really detrimental to the company now
we're seeing Johnny I've take over iOS
I'm really hopeful at the next version
of iOS iOS 7 is going to be completely
thinking of what iOS can do you can
release tablets of different sizes you
can use last year's specs for an ipad
mini but what really can different the
product is a user experience an apple
used to excel at that in 2007 what the
iphone did was absolutely incredible it
was even a possible to imagine you could
open up photos with your fingers and
pinch to zoom and scroll from left to
right with the whole browser in your
pocket but now everything has that an
apple hasn't brought anything new to the
table they ushered in the app world
absolutely but again what have you done
for me lately companies not gonna make
money based on innovation they had in
2007-2009 they're gonna make money based
innovations they have now some
challenging apple please update iOS make
something new and fresh push the
envelope do what you use to be good at
and when you are successful Apple it's
making Android better forces Google to
be better it's going to force rim and
Microsoft to improve and step up their
games so Apple please bring some updated
how software bring some
dated hardware and let's go ahead and
get back to where we once were you guys
agree disagree what do you think Apple
needs to do try and keep the comments
civil any time we mention apple or
android always erupt in a huge flame war
does damp wet love to hear your thoughts
I'm drown rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
say next video
