your films with the notch meets the LGG
7 thin queue no matter how many times
you read that name don't pronounce it
think and if you stick around to the end
I've gotten my worst pun I've ever had
in nine years waiting for you
so despite a silly name that g7 is I'm
just gonna call it and you should too is
a really solid phone boasting some
unique specs which is becoming
increasingly tough to do pretty much
every phone out now is just some version
of them good I know on paper a lot of
people are gonna be upset the 6.1 inch
qHD plus full vision display is LCD and
not OLED I even did my own eye roll when
I heard LCD but once actually had a
chance to use it
it didn't matter simply the screen looks
amazing regardless of the tech colors
look incredibly vibrant and blacks were
black the screen despite his technology
remaining to be and the Samsung displays
on how they often don't look real they
look like a sticker instead of a screen
it's the same here at the g7 which is
about as big a compliment as I can
possibly give a display the screen
though is a pretty useful trick up its
notch sleeve it's got a brightness boost
mode which boosts things up to 1000 nits
of brightness which in the real world
means to be able to clearly see the
screen even in the brightest of direct
sunlight which is a gigantic win for LG
automat note that boost mode is gonna do
a number on the 3,000 lamp our battery
belly's quick charge and wireless
charging are here to juice sucker up
faster so the G line sits below the V in
LG's lineup and I get that but the spec
list seems to be kind of like a grab bag
of 2018 in 2017 tech on the awesome side
you got the Snapdragon a 45 which is a
piece of a processor on the shrug emoji
side four gigabytes of RAM which is
still plenty for smooth operation but is
a bit anemic by mid 2018 standards
especially I've got phones coming out
with 8 gigs I would have liked you've
seen six here help extend the life of
the device 64 gigabytes of storage is
standard but at least it's expandable
also here's a headphone jack and I think
that might be the biggest reason people
buy LG phones it's got a 32 bit hi-fi
quad DAC LG really seems to get audio
files which makes it next thing about to
say see
dick cut victory at first no stereo
speakers instead LG's using the entire
chassis the phone as a resonance chamber
to boost the base the means of phone
kind of gonna vibrate when you're
playing music but the bass does sound
sound AC it just sounded good
this newish resonance technology is
called LG's boombox and imagine we're
gonna see it show up in a ton of future
LG flagships in the hand the phone feels
awesome I didn't really like to feel the
v30 it almost felt Hollow
the g7 though feels really solid with
its glass back it it feels premium it's
narrow body is really reminiscent of the
galaxy s 9 - the curved screen on the
side I think they just nailed the the
tactile in your hand test with this one
there is a dedicated assistant button
which mercifully is tied to Google
assistant and I give LG a ton of credit
for not making their own assistant and
then just cramming it down our throats I
asked them if it was remappable and they
said nope but they could open it up in
the future so there's that non-committal
answer for you speaking of design it's
got a notch it doesn't have any sort of
advanced facial unlocking hardware so
I'm not sure why the notch is there but
hey at least it fits in with what seems
to be 2018 flagship design standards as
making of that notch it can actually be
hidden via software I was kind of
worried at first since the screen isn't
OLED but it hides us a notch pretty well
LG's also utilizing software that you
customize and not charriot different
backgrounds so that's that's a thing you
can do now LG's done a really nice job
with their cameras here the dual sensors
on the back are both 16 megapixels one
of the 107 degree field of view and 171
degrees making a g7 all about that wide
angle the software's also utilized a
wide angle sensor to map the background
for portrait mode which is here in the
g7 and at least on first impressions
worked pretty well much like the V 30s
AI is a big part of the camera
recognizing what you're snapping pics of
and adjusting the sensors to suit it
other small bits to know it's running
Android 8.1 and LG's custom UI on it I'm
not gonna talk too much about LG's uy
but I will say pray for launchers so
overall LG made a really solid foam they
aren't trying to lure you in with fancy
gimmicks like AI base emojis are trying
to force their own assistance down your
throat instead they're giving consumers
a well rounded phone
that's good at almost everything at a
price point below the v30 so I'll a g7
might not be for anyone in particular
it's a device that's built for everyone
thank you for watching
