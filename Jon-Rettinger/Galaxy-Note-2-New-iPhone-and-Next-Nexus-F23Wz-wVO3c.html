to you by Jackthreads so this week on
ask to Buffalo we're going to talk about
the next Nexus device we're going to
talk about the Galaxy Note 2 we're gonna
chime in on the galaxy s3 vs. HTC One X
debate talk a little bit on how i got
into making videos this is asked a
buffalo let's go ahead an get started
user I'm not gonna pronounce that name
says can you give us some information
about the galaxy note 2 well yes i can
give you information about the galaxy
note 2 samsung has confirmed that that
will be the main announcement that they
have at IFA so what's it going to have
well you know it's going to be big the
current generation Galaxy Note has a 5.3
inch screen are you fetching that screen
size even go up even higher 25.5 inches
but before you get all crazy that's
going to be a giant phone it's gonna
take up the same size there was a pretty
decent bezel on the galaxy note that
bezel presumably will be removed and
we'll have a bigger screen in the same
package people are pretty much on one
side of the fence or the other that's a
very polarizing Galaxy Note either you
love it or you can understand how
anybody could use it I loved it I really
like using galaxy note i like the
bigness I like the way it felt I like
the way people looked at me like I was
crazy when I held it up to my head I'm
looking forward to the Galaxy Note 2 but
what's it going to have under the hood
well it's going to have a quad-core
exitos processor with LTE we have yet to
see quad-core make its way with LTE and
play so nice together but finally you
might see them have an official play
dates in the form of a galaxy note 2 we
should see a next-generation ml at
screen super amoled plus awesome which
should be a 1080p HD screen as well and
because I know you're gonna ask it
should ship with jelly bean it's not the
stock version of jelly bean but it will
have a TouchWiz version of gables on
that I call it should I be an airtight
which tables assumably it'll come to us
shores as well AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile both
currently have the original Galaxy Note
in its offerings hopefully we'll see
them off for the successor as well
hopefully that helped answer your
question user Liam asks hey John is now
a good time to upgrade to
bold 9900 I'm going to let the
commenters answer that question you
might want upgrade to a motorola razr
those are pretty awesome flip phone thin
user a at lees 0 304 asked hey john i'm
up for an upgrade i've been looking at
the galaxy s3 and HTC One X what you
prefer should I wait and see what Apple
will bring out in the fall over so
presumably we're going to see Apple
unveiled the next-generation iphone
September 12 which is just about a month
away as of this filming so yes
absolutely wait you've probably been
waiting two years to get a new phone
anyway you might as well hang on for
another couple weeks and see if it's
going to be worthwhile for you it sounds
like you're already an Android user and
if you try and decide between the s3 or
the 1x honestly flip a coin they're both
great phones I'm personally preferential
to the HTC One X I like the UI on it I
think it looks a little cooler I like
the fact that it's got that sort of
selling you to body bills but then the
next day I flip back and I go the galaxy
s3 you can't grow on either of those
phones but if I had to pick one and
recommend one and have in the past
January for folks to the HTC One X user
B shows 99s John what made you want to
start making videos and being on the
news well if any indication of that I
had a master planner I didn't have a
master plan look no farther than my
youtube name it's John of for lakers if
I had any inkling I was gonna be doing
this for a career certainly would have
picked a better name it was actually a
very old email address i had from high
school and I just musics I wanted to
comment on videos nothing really made me
want to do it I always loved technology
always had a passion for technology i'm
looking to get a new laptop back in two
thousand seven there weren't many videos
up there explaining how to use switching
over to mac at the time how to use matt
i figured i would try it I've always had
really strong opinions on stuff I know
big surprise and I want to try and share
them maybe that's what got me started
just to have a venir to sort of share my
thoughts and opinions or what really
wasn't anybody else doing something like
that on YouTube as far as being on the
news it's kind of a natural progression
after you guys don't know generally
technobuffalo hear me and the rest of
staff will do CNBC Fox News or fox
business which is something fun that we
like to do it's a cool opportunity to
sort of get out of the bloggers at tire
put on a suit and talk to a broader
audience about technology in the
business behind technology hopefully
that helped enter your question so I
want to take a minute to thank our
friends ends

now user alex fraser says hey john when
do you expect to see the next Nexus
device do you think Google will continue
to use samsung for production that
device after the tech war between Apple
and Samsung so yes I do think we'll see
another Nexus device probably very soon
I'd expect to see it actually before the
end of the year I'll make another video
talking about what I expect to be packed
into that phone ah but suffice to say I
think we'll have one before the holidays
perhaps we'll see a small incremental
upgrade to jelly bean with a k maybe key
lime pie or candy cane at the K or maybe
we'll just be jelly bean on new hardware
but I definitely do think we're going to
see one as far as Google using samsung
again yes I think absolutely they will
there might not be the only one make
your Nexus device also in the rumors
fear her hearing that Google might
partner with five OEM manufacturers to
make five separate Nexus series devices
perhaps a larger one similar to the
Galaxy Note smaller one different sizes
but i don't think the case that Apple is
going to shun google away from working
with them at all in fact think it might
empower Google to work with Samsung a
little bit more in the future thank you
