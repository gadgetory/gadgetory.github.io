celebrate get cozy sit by the fire have
a drink
be sure to tell the ones you love that
you love them too
that is not the reason that we are here
the folks from Wix reached out see if I
could help teach people how to build a
website in fact when I went to build
TechnoBuffalo com
I knew so little about having to build a
website we burn through 80% of our
startup capital based only on my
ignorance the company almost didn't
launch because I didn't know how to
build a website I have a whole video
detailing TechnoBuffalo story and the
mistakes that I made building a website
willing to it up here and down below if
you want to watch the moral is it's now
almost 2017 it is like a bajillion times
easier to build a website and using the
tools to folks at Wix offer it is dead
simple in fact I went in and even built
my own website in about 25 minutes just
showing a gallery of pictures and a blog
that I made showing some the stuff for
my new car the Model X which we did a
video on to you can take a look at that
but I wasn't just gonna make a video
showing you how to make a website which
I promise that I will I thought it would
be kind of cooler to not only show you
that but also to give you a chance to
win your freaking dream phone whatever
phone you have dreamt that exists at
least that's like out you can win it you
could pick an iPhone a pixel whatever
you want and whatever color you want and
whatever storage size you want and again
we tuned up the folks from Wix who
sponsor this video we're going to give
you a chance to and we'll put all the
details right here on the screen the
dates if you want to enter though make
sure you hit the link down below and go
to the article on Tecton buffalo calm
that's where the widget to enter is
going to be so when your dream phone did
good I don't know you should win
something fun because you are a good
person now if you're continuing watching
you want to know how to build a website
so first thing to do is grab your
computer the mediocre battery life in
this case we'll just grab this one
all right so let's get started showing
you how to build a website and I'm gonna
do that by showing you the website that
I built and this again took me about 15
to 20 minutes this is the first website
that I had built using the tools from
Wix and it was super simple I could
probably cut about 10 minutes out of
that next time
so I created a blog style with galleries
and pictures but you can create a ton of
different sites and I'll show you what
all those options are so real quick meet
the Model X it automatically pulled in
all my social stuff that I inputted when
I set up the site in the upper right
hand corner with the links I compact and
everything I was able to put in my own
background gallery the cool kind of
parallax effect
I said I'll learn more button will take
you to TechnoBuffalo calm people want to
contact me and I should say also this
site is live if you want to watch it and
take a look at yourself I'll link to it
down below so you can see it I did a
little story about my delivery of the
car and this is our video that I talked
about it apply actually in line with a
blog and I wrote a post it also
automatically integrate comments built
into the website you can add things tool
you can do emails you can add analytic
tools you can put in ads it is a
full-featured website it's not like
website Lite or only a partially
functional website it is like a legit
full website does everything for
websites can do you can take bookings if
that's something you want to do you
could sell stuff and again it's like
literally a click of a button so I put
in a gallery here and it's just as
simple as hitting an upload button you
can see it's a beautiful like full
screen gallery title show up at the
bottom it's very like elegant away
things were set up and what's made it
really simple so the site that I built
here is a fraction of what you can
actually do and the stuff you can build
let me jump it to the editor fast chase
and the cool stuff that I could have
done and what the editor looks like soon
you build your site you know the power
of the tools so you can see each page is
here and as you scroll through each page
you get an edit button once you let you
edit the content on it pull up a little
list on the side the title the subtitle
any text you want if you want to switch
your image or go to a gallery you've
uploaded or even do a video which is
kind of cool to see it sort of gradually
will move in the background and also if
you want to put a link in is really
Andy but beyond that if you want to move
the pages around you have that option as
well
three little dots show up on the right
for more actions and if you keep
scrolling down you can see what each one
does go to move and I can actually move
it anywhere I want which is a kind of a
cool option to be able to have so I can
select a page in the list and just go
ahead and drop it down but the easiest
way to edit is to go through this
playlist actually and just go through
step by step so you can preview your
site entire website design change
website colors and go all the way down
until your site is built so a jump into
one of these here let's change website
colors let's see I don't really like the
blue and the white that I've got here so
you can either do it for me or show me
how so let's say something do it for
makes life a lot easier so they're going
to open up the design panel and this is
all happening I'm not touching anything
here this is all doing it on its own and
it's gonna take the pictures that I've
gone and it's gonna match a theme right
to it so let's try another way I'm not
the PGA's kind of guy but you can see
how easy it is to do all right that I
like that looks really slick so let's
keep that and then go through and you
could change the section layout contents
and add new sections but I'm going to
close this I kind of like the way this
looks think it looks really clean so
I've got a blog here as well and a blog
might be something you guys want to have
whether it's about your technology or
your life or the food that you eat which
made it really easy to to manage a blog
and not just sort of the whole website
hit the button says quite simply manage
blog this I got to take you to your CMS
or content management system again they
made it dead simple so I can see all my
posts here I could arrange them I've got
different categories are going to be
viewed here I want to go ahead and add
tags that get added here as well let's
go look at the first post this is my
delivery experience I can see what this
looks like so if you want to share it if
you want to duplicate it delete it and
you want to see what's going to look
like let's edit this we're gonna be able
to go ahead and actually get into the
editor edit your posts you can add tags
the advanced SEO is really helpful too
it's going to sort of show you what its
gonna look like on Google as you can see
okay my delivery is the title of the
post or the blog and the name of the
site is test
one the excerpt that Google is going to
crawl the Meta Description all the stuff
that you would need to make sure people
can find you
Wix put those tools directly in front of
you and sort of makes it really simple
so if you don't know anything about SEO
those tools are here for you I think a
lot of you are probably going to be
looking for that blog functionality so
again super simple to go ahead and edit
your pages let's say I want to change
this background I really like the black
and white theme it suggested for me but
I'm not too sure I like that picture so
I'll go ahead and hit edit again here's
all of my content I could view the
gallery that I went in and uploaded and
also which is going to give me a ton of
choices as well enjoy a hit gallery I
can organize my media it's going to be
there no files I've uploaded but I want
to try a video background there now I
don't have a video uploaded I go and
replace it with a ton of different
choices I want to try something kind of
serene and I've got a picture of the car
previously said I might not be necessary
but I think that maybe a city and urban
view will be kind of cool that's where
the car is going to be driven I'm gonna
go ahead hit apply there I think that
looks pretty good to me let me go ahead
and preview that preview button lives
right in the upper right hand corner now
let's see as I scroll down there's that
video I just did now it looks like I've
been coded for years that video just
seamlessly plays then as you scroll it
disappears you can see how simple it is
to go through and edit the site which
can do things like email addresses if
you already have a domain you can link
it with your domain so you don't see any
of the brought to you by Wix or if you
want to use a Wix URL you can do that as
well
you can add ads again you could add
analytics you could add traffic boosting
options you can add SEO packs you can do
everything you can do a very complex
website with no coding skills required
at all it's really simple really elegant
easy to use the pricing is super
affordable I did the totally unlimited
sites for any was like two hundred and
thirty-nine bucks see here aside from
being limited there's a ton of other
pricing options as well and there should
be a tier for whatever you need and I
think it's absolutely worth it if I had
something like this and I created
TechnoBuffalo
my life would have been a lot simpler a
lot easier so even thinking about doing
a website creating website for anything
now
really good time to do it again all
links be down below if you want to learn
more we want to create your own website
and learn more about Wix and also again

ultimate phone hit the link down below
