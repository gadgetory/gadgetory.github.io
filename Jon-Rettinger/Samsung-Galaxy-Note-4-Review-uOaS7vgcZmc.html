TechnoBuffalo heretofore even for you of
Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 it's got a fresh
design it's got fresh hardware it's got
a brand-new screen was all of that add
up to a phone that you want to carry in
your pocket let's go ahead and find out
as I do with all my reviews I want to
give a disclaimer I use this guy for
eight days on ATT service here in
Southern California I want to see any
more detail on what I'm gonna talk about
hit the link down below to go the
written portion Todd at his own review
unit and there's a lot more detail and
pictures and galleries and all the
things we're going to talk about so let
me give a little bit of a backstory
Before we jump into everything about the
phone I was in Berlin for the very first
Samsung Note announced it and the very
first one came out four years ago I
remember thinking to myself what the
expletive is Samsung thinking putting a
phone that big in the mainstream
previously you know Dell had two larger
phones they were kind of Fringe devices
it turns out those Samsung had more
foresight than anybody gave him credit
for or perhaps they stumbled backwards
into what was a hit category they've had
for generations to try and get this
right and a little bit a spoiler alert I
think they hit this one out of the park
let's go ahead and start with hardware
so if you watch my reviews for the years
you know I've been really hard on
samsung in the past I think they've had
kind of uninspired designs looked like
they just designed one new device every
three years and just make different size
variations of it they made a tablet or a
phone not here and not anymore
so Samsung added beveled edges to the
device that make it look for lack of a
better word just sharp they look really
fantastic they catch the light you pick
it up they're cold in the morning they
give it a premium feel I really
surprised how much a little bit of metal
makes it that make a difference to a
device so picking up this versus an
older Samsung device as Todd described
was like a pairing a shoddy second-hand
suit to a freshly present new one it's
cleaner refined and something I think
you could put trust in you also find
that Samsung didn't skip on components
here as well in fact almost all the
hardware is among the best available on
the market right now which I don't say
that for any device usually it's a good
screen an older processor Samsung real
went all the way to the wall with this
one so there's 805 processor under the
hood complicated by three gigs of RAM
32gb of on-board storage XP extender
with a micro SD card slot and a beastly
16 megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization wide-angle front-facing
camera and just a ton more don't think
this phone is really missing is wireless
charging add that in here and Samsung
would have hit a perfect score on the
hardware front I like the way the
buttons feel as well it's kind of a
weird thing to say there's a satisfying
click on the easily reachable volume
buttons the home but has a really
tactile feel to it Samsung also include
an IR blaster on top of the vice right
near the 3.5 millimeter headset jack
it's also ditched that kind of silly to
used USB 3.0 port on the bottom for a
smaller and way more standard USB 2.0
Jack Samsung did admit that folks might
miss the fancy faster speeds offered by
USB 3.0 but since I made a decision to
return to USB 2.0 following customer
feedback and I applaud them for
listening to consumers I like this
choice Todd liked this choice is way
easier to find USB 2.0 chargers with
quick charge particularly as the new
phones with that support are hitting the
market the rump of this phone is that f4
mentioned camera with oh is optical
image stabilization I just call it
choice samsung also included a heart
rate monitor and the sensor can now
measure your blood oxygen level UV
levels your stress and more they'll get
to all that a little bit later the new S
Pen rest in the lower right hand corner
of the phone and the home button once
again doubles as a fingerprint reader it
is way more accurate on the note 4 than
we saw on the galaxy s5 that was to me
an to Todd although still not as
accurate as touch ideas on the iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 plus the back cover while
being redesigned and thank goodness no
longer has fake stitching on it can be
removed and it feels really good on this
device it's still a bit of flimsy
plastic when you pull it off but I will
trade that in da for having a removable
battery and Samsung really makes that
super easy to pop this thing off you can
access the SIM card and microSD card
slot so yeah it's a little bit flimsy to
pull it off when it's on here it's it's
almost flush to the back of the battery
so you don't feel any sort of give it
feels really premium I know this might
be kind of nitpicking here but I do wish
the Zion also included ip67 rating for
water and dust resistance
and I know Todd knows that we can't sort
of have it all but the folks appreciate
that aspect of the galaxy s5 might kind
of be a bit let down turn the note 4 and
it doesn't have such a rating so if
you've got a lot of kids go to the beach
you know you might want to be careful or
just get a waterproof cage or put in a
plastic bag of course the Kelly talked
Karzai talking about this and display
all right I feel like of a better word
it's insane I've been happy with the
display on the screens like the iPhone 6
plus which look really sharp and
stunning on a 1080p resolution but you
can totally see a difference looking at
the note 4 is quad HD screen it is
gorgeous Emma let allows Samsung's
blacks to look really truer than on any
other smartphone I've seen that's ricki
ridiculous viewing for movies photos and
the colors look like they're just
popping off the screen here so as soon
as I got this thing out of the box I
wanted to look for quad HD footage to
watch on this but Samsung didn't include
any but fortunately the camera can
record 4k footage so you can check out
anything a recording I wouldn't download
a few open-source samples and it looks
really beauty
even 1080p videos also look good text of
course while reading a book or on a
white screen looks really sharp and
crisp of course not going to say it
picks those unless you're Superman I'd
have crazy fancy vision and the screen
also holds up outdoors which is even
more surprising I could see it in direct
sunlight which is not something I say
very often
I know I've sort of been a broken record
with quad HD screen saying I don't see
the difference from a good 1080p screen
and that's been the case until this guy
so you can tell I'm kind of over the
complementary here Samsung really offers
the whole package here gorgeous design a
beautiful screen and the specs to match
it it's too bad though the software
isn't as clean-cut so the note 4 runs
Android 4.4.4 kitkat out of the box
which up until a couple days glasses
filming was the most recent version of
Android it's great modern but still it's
got TouchWiz on it which just isn't it's
been improved as we saw at the galaxy s5
but it still feels overly colorful and
crazy bloated think of it as like get
through your second Thanksgiving meal
all you want to do is lay on the couch
thankfully though you can size script
that issue entirely in a third-party
launcher which is the first thing I
usually do to cover up TouchWiz TouchWiz
to me and Todd still feels kind of
sluggish despite the Snapdragon
by processor and three gigs of ram
they're just still small jitters here
and there that aren't buttery smooth I
think other skins like sent six wanted
to be way more efficient I'm not gonna
harp on touch with too much here though
I know some folks like it many options
available which is one of the beauties
of Android if you don't like it you can
kind of make it go away it is one of the
nice things that Android offers Samsung
outfitted the Galaxy Note 4 with s hell
3.5 we're still trying to figure out how
you swallow this is all the health
features it's great reminding me that
I've been sitting in my desk for way too
long which I probably need to bring mind
enough and I do that without moving just
kind of move them up fingers but I did
use it for tracking the calories that we
were eating still though for us and I
don't know why you can check my blood
oxygen levels but does work very well if
you want to try it if want to check your
heart rate from your phone you can do
that here too we get that Samsung try
and create a health gadget and adding
more functionality is always appreciated
but it's just not going to be a maker
brick to touch on the smart phone think
of it more as a value-added then a
reason to go out and get the phone at
least for me thankfully though the
software that does that though is clean
a nice to look at heart rate monitor is
also accurate enough and reading on my
Moto 360 in galaxy note 4 is the exact
same so it's pretty accurate
if you sensors also from useful for
folks who are worried about sun damage
that sort of ppreciate edition as well
and but other options like stress
monitored I don't know tell me I'm
stress which I know that so we've talked
a lot about TouchWiz and my dislikes
fork but Samsung's S note software's
pretty awesome and the s-pen is better
than ever
it can use the S Pen to select groups of
items like picture is super easily it's
also even more accurate allowing you to
sketch drawings if you can draw inside
of the S note application density they
linked also under canvas changes you
press harder on the screen with the S
note and it seems way way more sensitive
than before other kind of software stuff
multi windows also been improved to not
only can you rent web side-by-side it
can also pop some of them out like
hangouts in the browser and the camera
and more I'll run them in super small
mini windows right on your home screen
it's got two more useful than we thought
there's a ton of more software coops I
could talk about here though some of the
highlights that I ended up using the
most I could probably make like an 80
minute video just on through the
software features
Samsung's got on board here and that is
one of the nice things about touch with
if you like those small features that
Samsung adds you're going to love this
device find yourself served not using
all of them though you might
look at putting a third-party launcher
on so next let's talk about this camera
with that camera hump right there we
said since I'm didn't skip on specs that
statement certainly holds true for the
back camera here it's a 16 megapixel
camera which is absolutely ridiculously
good
Samsung opted for optical image
stabilization support which you're
seeing other flagship Android
smartphones and of course the iPhone 6
plus
OAS allows you to take better shots and
low-light and also helps keep the phone
as your video recording just keep it a
little more smooth it's not perfect for
moving objects those are those are still
able to blur a little bit but you know
people take a cleaner images if you're
just sort of moving a little bit or you
got shaky arms we've got a video sample
right down below if you want to take a
look at that so it looks like we shot it
outside but then you already came out
really really nice as well
on the picture front this shots we took
on a note 4 also came out really nice
I'm surprisingly they look very good
especially in low light one of the
examples of all those that the link down
below go to Todd's article you can see a
whole gallery of all damned pictures
one of things I'm always worried about
with the quad HD phone is battery life
one of the main reasons would like to
test phones for just a few days here is
that often there seems to be
improvements with battery life over time
and that was definitely the case with
thing with moto 360 and it certainly
holds true with the galaxy note 4 first
couple days we used it battery life went
Bob pretty fast it's probably because I
was using it more than I would it's got
a 3220 million power battery and after a
couple days it start using like a normal
phone it got really really good my usage
is pretty heavy I think probably more
heavier than most I'll take it off the
charger around 6:30 to 7:15 depending on
the time of day got two emails being
pulled down all the time it's mostly
cooked to Wi-Fi either home or at the
office Bridge all right it's been way
more time than I should
to Neph hours of phone calls video
viewing games all kinds of a sort of
regular phone you used to do it's time I
plugged in at night around 10:30 11 I
had about sixty percent battery life
here so you can easily get through two
days of course we've got our moveable
backs it can with buy another battery
and pop it in just go along in merry way
we've talked a lot about all the
components the software the heart of the
camera has it all come together so I'm a
middle D bit fickle when it comes to
phone I jumped from OS to OS and from
phone to phone without really batting an
eye
this one though I can see myself using
for a very long time
it's got top-tier specs really good for
a while
a just ridiculously gorgeous screen and
cannibal credible camera on a package
that's smaller than the iPhone six-plus
despite having a bigger screen size this
phone gets a really solid nine and a
definite recommend fortunately though
Mountain View has done this guy I can go
ahead and saw a good nail launcher and a
fresh eye compact I make this guy my own
