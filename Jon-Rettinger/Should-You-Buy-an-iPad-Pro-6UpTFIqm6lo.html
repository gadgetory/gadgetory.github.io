half weeks in the tech world in that
time span we've seen 17,000 phones get
announced we've seen concept devices
that can fold we've had new iPads
there's been a ton of stuff so I thought
it'd be fun to kind of bring back ask
the Buffalo
so before IQ you're a let me thank our
sponsors world of warships so if there's
one thing almost all games have in
common they cost you money but what if
there was a free online strategy game
that wasn't gonna cost you a cent but
was it's also kind of fun let me tell
you about world of warships it's kind of
similar if you guys have ever seen like
World of Tanks and World of Warplanes
you have several types for ships and do
different roles and you can team up and
vs. and battle each other you can also
choose different countries if you want
to be the US or German factions or
Russian you can you pick your
nationality the world of warships is
also always getting updated so it's
consoling you game's mission ships new
stuff is just always showing up so this
sounds like something that you want to
check out again totally free and no
pressure
hit the link down below you can use a
code play warship 2018 to receive a
bunch of free stuff when you start so
again a big thank you to world of
warships are sponsoring this video and
generally making all of this content
happen and I promised that I was gonna
cue your egg nashandra asks was thinking
about buying a MacBook Pro or an iPad
pro for school which do you think would
be best to buy first so I got a ton of
versions of this question the iPad pro
is an awesome iPad but it's still
running iOS so until there's like a pad
os or an iPad OS that makes it more of a
desktop replacement by a PC by your
MacBook by your MacBook Pro or bio
Windows laptop at least for me I don't
want to have to change how I use the
device to suit the device like I have to
with the iPad for iOS wanted to use it
as a full computer Mac OS or Windows 10
you can just sit down and do your work I
get that might not be the most popular
opinion here but when someone asked me
what's a PC I tell them exactly what it
is it's not that bad
santino two one three the pics
3xl cause the same as a1 plus 60 which
phone you recommend to an average person
I think I'm gonna give away that versus
video in a question stay tuned that is
coming I'm actually working on that
script so add ready Freddy asks how do
you find balance in your life really the
honest answer is I don't I put this out
on Twitter last week but I've long
suffered with insomnia and anxiety it's
been hard for me to try to find balance
I think what I've succeeded in doing is
is masking it better than most but if
there's one thing that helps me calm
down at least as much as I can it's just
being with family next one comes from
inadequate Chi galaxy full little
smartphone gimmick for the future the
Note edge seemed like a gimmick but now
it's become a staple
so everybody's looking at the full
double phone that Samsung showed is like
this is a product they're going to
release this is more like a concept of
what things could be and the internet
was linked as internet tends to be like
super mixed on what to think of it I
think it is going to the future is some
sort of foldable technology will be the
future the giant bezels they showed
presumably will not be there hopefully
but a device you can open up that
there's multiple purposes I definitely
think is going to be the future at
undvik tendr√° if you had to choose one
company to make all the tech what
company would it be and why if there was
like hypothetically a question that I
wouldn't want to touch with a ten-foot
pole maybe a 30-foot pole it would be
that question so next my friend Anthony
min Ogoni at Red Socks 2009 asks what is
your dream Android device so I'm gonna
do like a Franken device of like parts
from different phones we're gonna take
let's start with the sexy sexy single
camera from the pixel 3 XL we're gonna
slap the screen from the galaxy note 9
on it we're gonna put the in screen
fingerprint reader from the 1 plus 60
we're gonna take the face ID from the
huawei mate 20 Pro USBC 38 hundred
million power battery to keep things
like really realistic slap 6 gigs of ram
in there android Pi and I'm realizing
that I'm mostly just running off
what is the May 20 Pro so right you'll
have Cohen asked what do you think about
Apple moving USBC on the
had from business standpoint for
customers it's great but do you think
Apple make more money if they ditch the
Lightning port listen I'm gonna tell you
I'm not gonna lie but I guess really
you're not gonna know I was shocked when
Apple really went USBC on the iPad pro
not because consumers love it and
because you can plug in a ton of
accessories and it's almost universal
now but because Apple makes a butt
donkey ton of money from licensing
lightning and if they're gonna give up
that but donkey ton of money for the
iPad but I was wrong
so I'm happy they did it if they did it
on the iPad I can't see how eventually
it won't happen to the iPhone and
they'll give up that donkey ton of money
and licensing lightning I would imagine
it's probably at least one to two
generations away but one cable to rule
them all will be really nice before
Apple just ditches the i/o entirely just
lets you wirelessly charge and sync your
stuff our next one comes from at John M
140 you have one phone to choose for the
next year which phone are you choosing
and why alright so what's a QA or that
business of people off let's do it try
to pick one phone to use for the next
year I am walking into an Apple Store
and I'm picking up an iPhone and 10 s
max don't at me it's best for me but
that's be right for you that's what I'm
picking and at least I'm admitting it on
camera right now so there you go and
maybe something will come out they'll
change my mind but right now and it's
max we had some questions
I made some horrible jokes you gotta
know a little bit more about me
personally I love doing these ass to
Buffalo videos I want to bring it back
if you guys like to see get the video a
thumbs up to let us know I appreciate it
until next time Jon render from
TechnoBuffalo I promise I'm done you and
you're a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
