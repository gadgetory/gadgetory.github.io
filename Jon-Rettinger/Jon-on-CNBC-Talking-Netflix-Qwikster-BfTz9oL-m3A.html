right let us bring in now our guest if
we certainly can that is techno buffalos
jon rettinger John you just heard herbs
a rant on netflix sort of hitting
everything from disclosures to
strategies you got a beef with netflix
you know the guts our reaction is
certainly to agree with her and i think
a lot of folks at least right now and do
however in hindsight I think what Reed
Hastings did is actually going to be a
very prudent for the business the
writing is all over the digital wall
physical media is dying and Netflix's
name is squarely implanted in
association with that physical media if
that dies the subscription-based
continues to fall so does the netflix
brand equity they are severing ties
right now while we have a chance to spin
off as completely separate quick store
business which is also going to include
video games while also continuing to
grow that netflix brand while focusing
solely on digital so bottom line here
netflix as it might remain right forget
Qwikster just streaming is it going to
be a better company I mean is that the
goal of doing something like this to get
stronger is it going to work long term
is going to be a great business decision
for netflix the timing though as her
mentioned is atrocious there in the
middle of huge contract negotiations
with major studios to get content so why
they would choose to do it on at a night
time on a blog is completely
mind-boggling you know because it's it's
a smoke and mirrors type of thing it
doesn't change anything right now it all
it is is it creates the impression
something's gonna happen maybe they will
ultimately split spin off the DVD
business and try to recreate what they
started with when Netflix I suspect
that's where they're going but who knows
you know I would assume so essentially
at Netflix is doing is they're holding
up the their piece of business and
they're cutting off the fat or what they
think is going to be the fat in the next
few years so herb I mean what should you
what's your final take on this because
I'm kind of coming away they can my take
it on saying it's a great company I mean
they're bashing man on oh look they
execute they did what they had to do I
suspect to get rid of the bad stuff
allegedly the bad stuff but you know
what the dvds are still an important
part look not you know they still have
the fixed cost no matter what they do
this still the old legacy Netflix as
part of this entire play what Netflix
and John and we don't have time to get
into jon rettinger thank you very much
for joining us we'll get you back by the
way
confirming what the skeptics said about
