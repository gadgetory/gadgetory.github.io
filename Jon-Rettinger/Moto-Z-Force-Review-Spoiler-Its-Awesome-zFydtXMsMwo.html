teased for years with project ara we've
seen it come out with the LG g5 we've
got a brand new fresh approach and kind
of case modularity with the Moto Z and
the Moto G force I've been testing the Z
force for the better part of five days
as well as all the mods that go with it
is it the flagship phone we've been
waiting for are the mods really worth
the value I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo and of course this review
I'm going to tell you whether or not you
should consider picking up the Motorola
Z force if you want to know more about
the little brother Moto Z you've got a
full written review from Brandon and
Russell hit the link down below and go
check that out I'm gonna focus almost
exclusively on the big guy Z force key
differences being bigger battery better
camera and shatterproof display so let's
jump right in with that shatterproof
Display 5.5 inch qHD that looks really
good at similar splay we've seen from
previous Motorola devices ordinarily
when there's almost a covering on the
screen I never looked as bright and
vibrant to me as a non shatterproof
display motorola and Lenovo has fixed
that here this play here looks almost
indistinguishable from the Moto Z so
safe to say it looks really good this
design language is totally new for
Motorola and the Z and the Z force look
almost identical save for a few
millimeters in the middle I've been
tough on manufacturers in the past for
camera humps and the Droid Z force has a
gigantic camera hump but actually serves
a purpose when the mods are snapped in
place even sixteen pink connectors
towards the bottom of the device the
camera comp actually keeps those mods in
place when you have a case snapped on or
a module popped on the camera hump
almost goes away rest of the phone looks
and feels really premium and you'd
almost expect that nowadays the metal
build feels cool to touch and got that
modern slab thing going for it that I
really like the volume buttons of power
buttons are very small in place for the
top of the device it can take some
getting used to but oddly you don't have
to use the power and lock button to lock
your phone use the fingerprint sensor to
do that you put your finger on it of
course turn the display on you can let's
put your finger on it to turn the
display off but you're gonna want to try
and push that in like a button it is not
gonna push in for it I couldn't really
mention design that walking about IO and
that's just really a single port now a
USBC port and yes it does have turbo
charging you'll get about 15 hours of
battery life in 15 minutes what you
don't have on this phone is the story
that's a 3.5 millimeter headset jack now
moto does give you an adapt
during the box hasn't been an issue for
me but that's a deal breaker for you you
may want to look elsewhere two things
happen the more I use a moto z force
first I want to make Star Wars jokes and
it reminded me a lot of using a nexus 6p
which is huge crazy cuz I absolutely
love the death of ice the full suite of
moto of stuff is here some moto actions
motive voice in moto display but if you
go ahead and throw on the Google now
launcher here this is going to look and
behave almost identical to Nexus device
the OS is based on six dodo a lot of
people are going to be looking at the Z
force over the Moto Z for the better
camera this guys rocking a 21 megapixel
sensor and not surprisingly pictures
look really good when we compare it to
pictures from the Z to the Z forsaking
identical situation we started to see a
bit of a difference the forest looks a
little bit sharper but had the same
noise and low light the forest looks
really sharp but the semis even look
over shark on both bones a color
rendition looked almost identical so
that's the way the camera is going to
see the light on the force and you take
a photo and it can't optically resolve
any more detail it looks to resolve it
using digital sharpening the Z's gonna
soft in the image makes it look a little
bit more natural but a lot of people
prefer that sharper image both cameras
he looked really good as you can see
honestly full res images I'll hit the
link down below to go to the review of
the Z if you get both those look like
the camera comes down to this though
it's good but the reality of smartphone
cameras that most of your snapping is
going to happen on snapchat can happen
on Instagram camera quality there
matters less because you're at the mercy
of the processing of the app we're gonna
have a full video detailing the Moto
mods and how they work link it up above
when it's ready to go the big thing to
know about the mods they are hot
swappable you do not have to turn off
the phone to put these mods on and
whether or not it's true modularity I
don't know but I do know it adds a
really nice functionality to a phone I
already brought and I spec sweet to the
table there's been a lot of people who
are either pleased or maybe a little
disappointed this is a Verizon exclusive
and it certainly is these for the time
being Verizon phones are actually
unlocked at least most of them are so
you can pop an 18 T SIM card for example
actually use it on the network I've
tested a lot of phones in the past few
years and we've been a handful where I
thought I would switch carriers to use
this phone and I think the Moto Z force
is one of those devices it does a lot of
things really well I may be doing
nothing absolutely outstanding some of
its parts are really good
the question I asked the beginning would
I buy this phone the answer should be a
resounding yes yes I absolutely would
and I think you should too
with the one caveat
five millimeter headset jack if you can
live without it not being there you're
gonna get an incredible phone so what'd
you guys think about the Moto Z into Z
force I really wanna have a conversation
with you about it leave in the comments
down below into the video a giant thumbs
up we always appreciate it the next time
