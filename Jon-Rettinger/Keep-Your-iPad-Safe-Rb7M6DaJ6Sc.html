from TechnoBuffalo here a couple days
ago I put on Twitter that the back of my
iPad is getting scratched like crazy a
bit using a Smart Cover since the new
iPad first came out it does a nice job
protecting the front but the back looks
like someone with nails just scratched
all over it so our friends at a case
actually sent a case option to take a
look at and see if it helps protect the
iPad this thing comes with me in
backpacks and suitcases and gets thrown
around probably a bit more than it
should so I'm looking for a pretty
decent amount of protection let's take a
look at what the folks at 8k sense I'll
use it for a while and I'll tell you if
it's gonna be worth your hard-earned
bucks alright so this is gonna set you
back about 25 bucks from Amazon I don't
generally review that many accessories
but since this is one that I really
needed I thought maybe you guys might be
in the same boat as me so here it is
comes in black or whites
some a case stuff on a little bit of a
story about the company they are based
in Taiwan go ahead and open this up
links gonna be down below for their
Amazon store case you wanna pick one of
these guys up go ahead and pull it out
feels a little bit plasticky leather
feel open it up inside we've got some
microfiber cloth to keep it clean you've
got sort of that bending mechanism as
well that we've seen with smart covers
in the past and that's where all the
mounting is gonna happen and this this
is the reason that I was excited to get
this case to protect the back of my iPad
I generally I get a new iPad every
generation for testing and review and I
like to sell the previous generations
and it's only worth a premium for
someone if it's in good condition so
let's go ahead and pop it in see we can
keep it in good condition see how the
install process goes it's pretty much
just a snap and we are all set
alright so we've got it pushed in places
just four simple pushes one in each
corner and we are set and good to go on
the back you've got a cutout for the
camera
got your power and lock button 3.5
millimeter headset jack profile switch
and volume up and down are pretty easy
to access on the back speakers also cut
out and there's room for the
big character some cases actually come
down and cut it and if you're using a
third-party connector doesn't always
work very well or third-party adapter so
pretty nice feel to it let's go ahead
and take a look at what else this case
can do so it'll Bend all kinds of
different ways and they'll use that
little slot in the back to prop it up a
bit more stable than what we've seen
with the smart cover so you get a bit
more stability and you expect more
stability because you have more rigidity
to do it because that whole back panel
so that is an option there as well and
you can also turn it the other way in
case you want to do some typing this is
actually how I use the iPad the most
like this close it up it's got the
microfiber insert so it'll clean the
screen as you close it I kind of try and
rub it around as I close it as well to
keep that screen nice and fingerprint
free a relatively low profile as well
the back little clasp has a pull here to
sort of pull it out to get the back of
that case take it out so it looks me a
pretty nice option very low profile
certainly decent protection and
hopefully will keep the back of my iPad
scratch free so use it for a little
while I'll come back let you guys know
how it's doing and whether or not it's
been worthwhile whether or not you
should pick one up for yourself
so I'm John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo
this is a bit a first look at the new a
case case for the new iPad see you guys
next video bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
