series the pixel is if you want the
counter side of this argument hit the
link up above and go check out the flip
side of the coin the pixel isn't I'm
just back from the Google pixel event
and there's a lot to talk about we're
gonna discuss who this phone is for and
why you should want it all the positives
about the two pixel phones let's jump
right in first one phone two sizes
you're not getting geek respects any
more if you're an Android pira's Jeff
decide between it may be more expensive
6p and less expensive 5x you can settle
on an equally pretty expensive pixel or
pixel x-l mostly the same save for
screen resolution and battery size these
films are for quite obviously the
Android Pyrrhus the folks that have been
following the Nexus line for years and
want the latest updates from Google as
Google pushes that Mouse that having to
worry about running through carriers and
getting updates and muenster than years
after Google pushes them out folks on
the bleeding edge of Android these
phones are for you also for folks who
want a really good camera in an Android
device especially Android device with
stock Android built in previously if you
wanted a great camera and if you're
looking at the LG's and you're looking
at the Samsung devices Nexus devices are
never known for incredible cameras but
Google spent a lot of time having a
chest about how good these twelve point
three megapixel cameras are they're the
same in both phones initial early tests
the pictures did look really good we get
back in our labs of course we'll test it
more but the scores don't lie looks to
be a really solid camera and also no
camera hump on there as well
these ones are also for folks that want
really nice looking screens now the
resolution on the pixel is still 1920 by
1080 it jumps to wqhd 2560 by 1440 on
the XL but just looking at the screens
they look really beautiful that's not
something that translates over the
videos that we did or any other videos
you might watch the screens themselves
looks really nice the black that's
really dark the colors look really
bright and vibrant they rivaled Samsung
screen you get that a lot with AMOLED so
really impressive how the screens looked
these phones are also for folks that
want to be at the forefront of
virtual reality he's had their very
first daydream capable devices so if you
want to be in virtual reality you got to
pick up a daydream headset pixel phones
are really your only options also for
these phones if you need super fast
quick charging you get seven hours of
battery life in 15 minutes is
ridiculously impressive these are also
gonna be really fast phones with no
bloat to get in your way four gigs RM
Snapdragon 820 these things should
absolutely halt from performance
standpoint if you want phones are gonna
be quick these are very good options of
course one of the biggest positives
about the pixel phones one thing they
spent many minutes talking about on
stage the Google assistant which is like
will now jacked up on steroids talking
back at you is only gonna be available
initially in the pixel line of phones
the big question though should you buy
these phones if you have a 6p the answer
is probably not the other 5x maybe you
want to consider it I recommend going to
a Verizon store and checking these
phones out to see if they are right for
you there's a lot of positives about the
pixel phones beautiful screen stock
Android but there's a lot to not like
about the film's as well if you want to
hear that
hit the link up above and give it a
watch thank you guys for checking out
this video give a thumbs up till next
time
