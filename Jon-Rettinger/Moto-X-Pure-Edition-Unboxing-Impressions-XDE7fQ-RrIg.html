from techno before that unboxing I am
really excited about inside of this box
is a custom built just for us and
designed by me moto X pure edition
designed it using moto maker a pretty
big boxer actually for the new Moto X
not much on it just big and all sealed
the Moto X has been one of our favorite
phone's ever since was first announced a
few years ago hopefully is Kurt
iteration is going to continue that
let's go ahead and bring in just the
ridiculously unnecessary I'm for sure
going to cut off an appendage knife and
cut this sucker open when you can be
considered budget phones isn't really
true anymore but lower cost high
performance android phones are becoming
really common the Moto X is the latest
entry into that really crowded market
that's being inhabited by the oneplus
two go ahead and pull off the top I have
not seen one of these get in person you
can see what color we design and there
is our moto x the TechnoBuffalo logo we
got the red leather back it's got a bit
of a texture to it with a pretty cool to
the gold looking accents on the back and
the side we picked something white on
the front on the front I should mention
is a 5.7 inch display its TFT they've
gone qhd here so 2560 x 1440 which means
got a 515 ppi with all aspects later but
let me show you what else is going to
come inside the box and you can see our
the TechnoBuffalo name emblazoned there
on the bottom looks really nice push
that off real fast i'll she's going to
have inside of the box we have
handcrafted letting notes for we in
leather pure edition read me and that
other stuff which we are we're probably
not going to read so removal tool here
for removing Simms a little peer
addition be the cardboard here is
Motorola's quick charging which
supposedly charges a fast and industry
and it should with the power brick that
big and it's attacked it's not a
separate court it looks like let's see
extra so if you're traveling you want to
take advantage of fast charging you're
going to take this with you yeah it is
attached and it does use micro USB no
USB see here it looks like we've got a
interesting we've got a case that comes
with it at a bumper case they'll go on
the phone so hey that chips with it
protect your device which all that took
office I that's not why you're here it's
rip off this plastic and power this guy
hard at satisfying noise ah new phone
smell I still don't let me send your
phone smell so I'm going to go ahead and
power this guy on I'll walk you to the
specs alright so we've got the phone
I'll boot it up and right off the bat
this is the best screen I've ever seen
on a motorola device and you you'd
expect that with their resolution so the
running Android 511 at launch but moto
has been really good about getting
updates so hopefully we will see
marshmallow on here shortly after its
launch so part in this guy is in 1.8
hexa core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 chip
so should be plenty of speed here three
gigs of ram heading on how you want to
configure it either 16 32 or 64 gigs of
storage before you get upset about six
teams of storage there is a micro SD
card slot here up to 128 gig so really
credit to Motorola for including that
while most others are abandoning it
motorola spent a lot of time talking
about that camera motorola cameras have
not been the best and we were kind of
acknowledge that now the nexus 6
certainly doesn't have the best camera
two people generate in moto X's oh we're
not known for their Tamara prowess
motorola claims this is best in class
and it's a new 21 megapixel sensor on
the front we've got a five megapixel
sensor that now has an LED flash next to
it which is a kind of cool addition all
the other stuff you'd expect 802 11 ABG
and NAC plus mimo technology a bluetooth
4.0 at 3,000 william our battery and it
does have NFC which I feel I need to
mention though when the coolest things I
think about the Moto X period issues
that will work with any carrier at least
in the US and pretty much any carrier in
the world we want to go to sprint or
verizon 18 to your t-mobile pop in your
sim you are good to go
with LTE so a lot of credit if you're
not familiar with Motorola devices
essentially what you get is stock and
Driver some really cool apps on top of
it and the app standalone to the OS
itself can be upgraded pretty close to
number google pushes or kodells I wave
my hand in front of it I get access to
notifications if I had in here I don't
you tap it hold you can see what would
be there I can drag up a pie in the mail
or something let's go ahead and unlock
the device and take a look at what we're
going to have inside so again stock
Android here through and through the few
conditions so Moto's own mobile app
helps make it yours you can have a
custom call war instead of saying okay
Google you can be like hey Moto X and
you could do stuff for you a lot of
features for driving as well know when
you're moving and I read your text
messages out loud to you a lot of other
really nice software editions will dive
into when we do the full review when we
walk you around the phone so we don't
have any physical home back or mini or
multitasking button so they're all soft
and build onto the screen you can see
them right there on the left there's
nothing there on the right volume rocker
up and down and above that there's a
textured power unlocked one that looks
really nice and it feels nice on the top
three four five millimeter headset jack
we r sim and microSD card slot going to
live the back you can get a ton of
different colors leather or what options
we opted for for the leather again
that's where 21 megapixel sensor is with
the two tone LED flash a bit of a dimple
which Motorola's become known for for
arresting or finger on it when you're
holding it that's really nice there's
micro USB for quick charging and again
you got to use motorola zone very large
power brick to make that happen it's
turbo power what they are calling it
noise cancelling likes a bound on this
guy a battery is not removable but again
is 3,000 you know we have ours so in
addition to some software settings but
we'll also built in some cool gestures
or things like the little twist motion
will launch the camera for you which is
nice and I believe a memory certainly
crackling do a little karate chop will
turn on the flashlight chop it did turn
it on it keeps you I don't want to go
i'll get at night you want to make sure
you can see where you're going go ahead
and turn that flashlight author so a lot
of cool additions built right in
to the phone I will cover a ton more on
you the full review want to give you
guys a real quick first look hands-on
and unboxing at the brand new Moto X
period I think you guys want us to cover
be sure to let us know in the comments
the next time jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
