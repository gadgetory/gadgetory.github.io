a real quick demonstration of time
machine it's one of the questions I get
pretty frequently here is how does time
machine work the first thing that you
need to know is you need leopard in
order to use it and you also have to
have an external hard drive either
plugged in via USB or firewire or
wireless like time capsule and what time
machine does is every game believe every
hour it automatically backs up the
contents of your hard drive or more
specifically it backs up and that's
changed in that past hour the first time
you plug in a dr SE if you want to turn
on time machine and then it does a
complete backup that's the only time
that it does that reason i'm doing this
video because i actually need a time
machine today and i figured i would give
you guys that mature asian about two
weeks back or a little while ago i
edited a word document for a friend it
was called PA el brochure and i sent the
to him and i just deleted it i figured
he didn't i didn't eat any more if he
already had it turns out he lost the
email with my edit and needed it back so
i was able to get a back for him using
time machine so i'm going to show you
guys how that works first thing you go
to the folder where your document that
you lost was in this case it was in my
documents under documents and then word
documents it wasn't here but not here
anymore so using time machine I'll get
it back so you click time machine falls
down now it opens up your history of
that particular folder so i let me
change the view here make it a little
easier i can scroll out you back in time
using the arrows here let see it as a
little time line right there too i can
scroll back now let's pull up next thing
a change going back until i see the
document there it is p al brochure text
edits now i can just hit restore
and lo and behold that document is right
back where it was now I can send it and
email to them guys time machine really
is a lifesaver you may only need to use
it once or twice in the history of
having your computer but there's one or
two times that you need it really comes
in handy anyway guys want to give you a
real quick demo don't forget to check
out the website at wwu n for lakers com
make sure you hit the www in there
anyway guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
