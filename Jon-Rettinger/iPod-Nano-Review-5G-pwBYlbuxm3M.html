for you of the fifth generation iPod
Nano I find this device since the day
came out and I've been sitting on a
review so I had a chance to really get
to use it really get to know it like it
hopefully provided you with the most
accurate information in previous videos
I've discussed the video recording
capabilities the video effects
capabilities really the highlights of
the iPod Nano but let's get to the
review over before let's just review the
specs pretty quickly it comes in 8
gigabytes or 16 gigabyte flavours really
the same size the ain't gigabytes and
run you 149 the 16 gates gonna run you
179 it's got a 2.2 inch diagonal display
which actually really does look quite
nice and is noticeably larger than the
last generation it does record video on
the back there's a little video camera
it'll recorded H dot 264 VGA resolution
which means it comes in at 640 by 480
so not HD and up to 30 frames per second
and also has 15 real-time effects so
that's all technical stuff what does
that mean well it does not record in HD
but doesn't court video at a very high
quality if I want to see a comparison of
video versus say the flip Mino HD I'll
put a link to that in the sidebar and
maybe somewhere around here you can
click and click and see the comparison
head-to-head the nano really did stack
up quite nicely against an HD camera
certainly it's not HD but the video is
especially the audio quality that came
out of it we're really very impressive
so the Nano is obviously a mp3 player
first so how does it do with its mp3
playing abilities well it's an iPod so
quite obviously it's fantastic it's got
an accelerometer built-in which is quite
nice so when you're standing for music
or looking around you can just turn it
and you can go through and scroll
through everything that you have
landscape wise which is you know quite
nice and s'more of another visual
representation for how to use the device
one other thing that this has is a
buildin speaker which is quite loud
like the iPhone or the iPod Touch but I
listen to music without headphones you
can now do that right on the Nano the
speakers are quite loud and certainly
more than ample for listening to music
it also has a built-in pedometer which
works quite nicely
it's got voice control so you can tell
it to do what you want sort of as you
would almost with an iPod shuffle the
new generation iPod shuffle at least it
does really just work as advertised
it's got the shape to shuffle
functionality and it's quite small and
pocketable
now one of the questions that I get
quite a bit is why would I get an A no I
already have an iPhone or an iPod Touch
I thought about that for quite a bit and
I think Apple really hit the nose on it
the nail on the head with the iPod Nano
and here's why people are going at crazy
nowadays is downloading tons and tons
and tons of applications on their phones
personally
I've got the six pages of applications
on my iPhone and those take up space
also not being able to record video I
find myself recording a lot of things
that were nearly I wouldn't and that
takes up space as well so whether you've
got a 60 gigabyte iPhone or 32 gigabyte
iPhone you know space may be at a
premium you may want something that just
holds your music so you can free up that
space for video TV shows movies
applications whatever else you might
have I think that's where the Nano
really comes in this thing is so small
you can just drop it in your pocket have
no idea that it's there and get
completely lost or if you've got an iPod
Touch and you had to get recording
capabilities around with some friends
and you want to you know record someone
doing a skateboard trick or ever it is
you're doing you get out just bust out
your Nano take a quick video through in
your pocket upload it you get home and
you know see your friend fall on his
face so I think the Nana really does
have a very big niche I think it
services a lot more people by having a
video recording functionality I would
never have considered the Nano really
without the video recording
functionality and I think surprisingly
it works quite nicely one big negative
about the Nano though is the placement
of the camera lens
anyway you hold it while recording your
finger seems to always be right close to
on top of it
no matter what you're doing you have to
be very careful how you're holding its
make sure your finger does not go and
hit the device just something to keep in
mind
certainly not a deal-breaker so who do I
recommend the iPod Nano to that's
another question that I get quite a bit
well if portability is important to you
if you're a gym rat and you always want
something that you can take to the gym
but a screen is something that you need
to have the iPod Nano is a fantastic way
to go if you're a runner you can just
strap the thing like your arm clip it
onto your belt throw it in your pocket
the Nano is absolutely fantastic and the
pedometer feature really only adds to
that if you want something separate to
hold your music if your iPhone it's
filled up or your old iPod Touch is
filled up if you want to speaker to
listen to music it's a great way to go
it also has a voice dictation
functionality so if you're a college
student and you want to record your
professor taking notes this is now a
perfect device to do everything you know
Apple hasn't been one to really release
standalone devices all our devices least
in recent time do quite a lot the iPhone
is a phone when it's internet tablet
it's an iPod and you know that tradition
really keeps true with the iPod Nano
it's not just an mp3 player it's now a
video recorder it's now an audio
recorder it's now an external microphone
external speaker it's pedometer and got
so many things that it really is a
jack-of-all-trades and it does them all
well so I can hundred percent recommend
the iPod Nano I think it's a great buy
at 149 or once I'm done respectively
depending on what sizes you want comes
in a ton of different colors and I think
that if you're in the market for an mp3
player the Nano is a fantastic way to go
and I guys hope you enjoy it for
