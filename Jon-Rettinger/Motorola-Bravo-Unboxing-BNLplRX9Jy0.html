from TechnoBuffalo here at that unboxing
for you of the Motorola Bravo this is a
new Android handset for 80 mg Wireless
let's go ahead and dig in and see if
it's worthy of your applause took me a
while to come up with that so in typical
unboxing fashion the box has a picture
of the device on the front some specs on
the side right there but we're gonna go
ahead and talk more about those in a
minute
talked about what's inside the package
but once again we're gonna see what's in
there and I know everybody's starting to
count down in the comments to show when
the unboxing begins so I'm gonna make
the Box to a relatively quick here here
are some more of the specs on the back
but we're going to run through all of
those once the phone is at it let's go
ahead and dig in all right open it up
you've got your sort of standard
information Quick Start Guide and here
is the phone let's go ahead push it off
this side it looks like there does not
have a battery installed hopefully the
battery is living under here which
indeed it is and it is a Motorola BFF 5x
which I believe is gonna put out just
about 1500 milliamp hours of juice which
is exactly what it is this should be
good for about 6 hours of talktime micro
USB cord the back of the phone take a
look at that in a minute
and the wall charger 2 USB alright so
here is the phone let me go ahead and
run through the specs for you so you
know what we are looking at with this
guy it is going to run you right now at
least $129 from AT&amp;amp;T on a two-year
contract
it has a 3.7 inch capacitive touchscreen
with a resolution of 480 by 854 it is
running Android 2.1 with motoblur on top
of it it's a Motorola Android Hansen it
does have motoblur it's got a TI OMAP
3610 which is clocked at 800 megahertz
512 megabytes of RAM which is a pretty
nice number it has a 3 megapixel camera
on the back
with autofocus it also has flashlight
supports able to view your Flash content
not sure it's gonna be 10.1 compatible
but it will have flashlights not sort of
light your way down on dark hallway but
be able to view Flash content flashlight
I'm a kind of confusing it does have
support for DLNA so you can stream
content to other enable devices over
Wi-Fi and that's a media content it's
got something called Crystal talked
noise suppression which does exactly the
expect it's gonna suppress no is not
what you're saying to the phone but
everybody else around you saying so if
you're in a car on a Bluetooth actually
not gookju's not going to work but if
you're in a car and somebody else is
driving it's gonna block out all of that
engine noise alright so let's go ahead
and take a look at the phone itself it's
sort of a unique design it's got a
rounded sides which you don't really see
it almost has a pebble ish looking form
factor to it I would say the phone
almost looks similar to the Palm Pre
certainly without the slide-out keyboard
but in that round form factor so you've
got your motoblur icons in the bottom
menu button home button and back buttons
clearly labelled texting and driving it
can wait yes indeed it can we will peel
off this top on here and everybody loves
to do that and also i know and i don't
do it it all kinds of hate comments
alright so let's go ahead and pull it
off so you get that whooshing noise and
indeed would you have said it whooshing
noise let's go ahead and see what the
back of this thing is gonna look like if
it's soft touch rubber if it's plastic
and all that business it looks like it
is drum roll going to be soft hunch so
it does have sort of that nice grippy
feel to it we'll pop the battery in and
see what the build quality feels like in
just a moment on the left hand side of
the phone all you're gonna have is your
micro USB charging port on the right
hand side where all the action lives and
by all the action I mean your volume
button on the bottom you just have a
microphone on the top 3.5 milimeter
headset jack and your power and lock
button go ahead and pop in the battery
and while I am yammering will boot this
guy up it does have a 2 gigabyte micro
SD card installed and of course you can
expand that
to whatever size you like this is a big
battery and pop that and usually on
devices that are sort of the mid-range
Android usually get a smaller battery
1500 milliamp hours I would assume this
guy's gonna last you quite a bit
couldn't even figure out how to get the
battery on here at them embarrassing
myself on camera you can see right off
the bat that sort of a unique look to it
with the Chrome or at least parent
Chrome and then the back
alrightso slid that back on looks kind
of kind of unique I'm not sure it's
gonna be a bit of a choir taste so we're
going to pick up the phone it does have
a nice feel to it it has that soft touch
rubber sort of on the sides of else can
you hold it it's got a nice feel to it
it's relatively thin and I can sort of
see a size comparison the hand does not
have a slide-out QWERTY keyboard you're
gonna relying solely on the on-screen
keyboard let's go ahead and do a size
comparison here we'll bring in its
Android 18 T stablemate the Xperia x10
it's sort of see a size difference there
and we'll bring in one of the big
daddies the HTC EVO 4G from Sprint
consider to see how the size difference
looks four point three three point seven
inch screens here and here respectively
let's go ahead and bring in one more
sort of AT&amp;amp;T staple this is the iPhone
go ahead and stack all these guys on top
you can see the thickness test and it
does look like the Bravo is hope it
holds its own and it have a nice amount
of a fitness to it the phone's got some
good feel to it let's go ahead and power
this guy on and see we got our swimmer
and gets her the typical Android
business here I've got very small AT&amp;amp;T
branding down there actually I didn't
even see it
at first the phones got a very nice feel
to it for a mid-range device that has a
lot of sort of premium ish things to it
so you've got the chrome you've got the
soft touch back I would have liked a
higher megapixel camera but I'll sort of
hold off on opinions until I get a
chance to use it three megapixel could
be just alright so there is the motoblur
interface it's going to go ahead and
boot up and probably give me the first
sort of Android setup often
very loud AT&amp;amp;T 3G boot screen I'll go
ahead and use this guy of course as I do
with all my phone reviews for for about
a week or so and I'll do my 20 call test
to determine call quality signal
strength and if this has any sort of
reception or dropped call issues of
course you can see there's some live
wallpaper action going on looks like the
phone is all ready to be set up which is
kind of nice
let's go ahead and unlock it just real
quickly see what we can do here
emergency calls only so this is a
unboxing and I guess first look as well
at the new AT&amp;amp;T Motorola Bravo I hope
you guys enjoy it I'm John Renfro
TechnoBuffalo stay tuned to the channel
for a ton more coverage of this guy I'll
see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
