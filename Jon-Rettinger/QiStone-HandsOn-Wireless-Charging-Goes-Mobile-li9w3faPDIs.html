to you you personally by Dollar Shave
Club what's up everyone
John rent you from TechnoBuffalo here
and I've got kind of a very special
hands-on review these are the Chiefs
tone plus they are external battery
packs with a bit of a twist it's going
to get started we don't cover that much
in the way of external battery pack so
pretty much all the same they've got a
battery in it you plug in your device
you charge it and then you charge the
battery pack and that's really about it
these are a little bit different so just
by the name you should guess that
there's some sort of wireless component
here they're called the chief stone plus
they're available on Amazon for about 80
bucks each so they're not for the faint
of wallet but they do do kind of a
couple cool things so first material on
it it's sort of a it's kind of a rough
touch same material on the back of the
oneplus one I've ever touch one of those
guys 4000 milliamps in each of these so
you guys have followed my videos you
know that I love wireless charging I
complain till I am blue in the face
whenever a new device doesn't have
wireless charging these guys will
actually charge wirelessly charge
devices wires take charge themselves
wirelessly charge two different devices
it's kind of neat so first if you have
let's say one fully charged one and one
not fully charged one you can just stack
on top of each other without any wire it
doesn't plugged in you hear that little
beep there's a blue LED light and they
will just start charging I'll charge the
one on top and beyond that you can also
put a phone on top and it'll start
charging the phone you can also plug in
a device to the USB port and you can
charging another device while you're
there as well so you can just sort of
stack these things up when you got one
on the bottom that's charge low filter
its way up it'll always prioritize the
device charging to over the chief stone
so okay that's kind of neat
take a quick break to thank our friends
at Dollar Shave Club look at his face
not only is it super pale it also hates
to shave it's a pain to do it to go and
buy razors you got to talk to the guy
get the key to the plastic razor
fortress if they think you're gonna
steal razor blades shell out a ton of
money you don't have or don't want to
spend just to make your face look super
soft and smooth that it's silly and not
necessary but fortunately though there's
a cup
it's doing away with all that silly
nonsense business guessed it it's called
Dollar Shave Club and they made it super
simple for just a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club ships amazing razors
and other bathroom things right to your
door and their blades are just as good
as the big shave companies and you can
pick up the package for your front door
in your underpants they've got other
stuff too like doctor covers easy shave
butter to make a shave even more a
buttery smooth shave time shave money
join now at dollarshaveclub.com slash
TechnoBuffalo also you've got some kind
of different adapters so here is
underneath the sort of strange-looking
thing it's actually for the iPhone 5 or
the 5s so go ahead and take it then plug
it into your Lightning port and you can
leave it like that if you want to but
it's super ugly but just proof put it on
the cheese stone and then you can charge
so we have one of the ridiculously
expensive iPhone 5s cases in the office
so you can actually take the device put
it inside of it and you can still charge
wirelessly with the case on the phone
which is kind of neat to be able to have
the options dude you gotta put the right
spot and you can go ahead and start
charging so that's kind of a neat thing
as well you've got other adapters - we
got one for the s5 you can also get a
regular charging pad all that kind of
goodness one of the things that was
really unique about this that I liked
was that you can charge one charge
another without wires you can finally
just bring this with you on a trip
charge one put it on top and be ready to
go I like you can just charge all kinds
different things and put it on top it
was just kind of a neat thing and I
hadn't seen done before I just have them
a sucker for wireless charging and it
worked really well again four thousand
milliamp hours in each they cost about
80 bucks just per one stone they've got
all kinds of other accessories you can
buy with it now especially if you're
thinking about get an external battery
pack give it a shot if arla charging is
important to you it's kind of a nice
addition if it's not important to you
than certainly there are less expensive
options available out there I just kind
of liked the wireless option I liked the
way they felt they're kind of soft and
small and they could easily fit in the
bag okay guys what do you think would
you use this not use it as it seemed
silly to use seems super useful I'm a
sucker for wireless charging is like I
mentioned so things like this always
kind of get my geek smile on alright
