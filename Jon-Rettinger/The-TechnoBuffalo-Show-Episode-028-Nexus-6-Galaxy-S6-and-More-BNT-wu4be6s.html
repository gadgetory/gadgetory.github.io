of the techno Buffalo show I'm one of
your to host for today Sean ani I'm the
editor-in-chief of the site and I'm
joined by executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody are you doing today
Todd I'm good great you're looking very
sporty and yepi and yeah I know I
finally went and got some winter clothes
the other day when I was told you i was
at pepboys getting an oil change so I
had to walk around the mall which I
never do I was like any sweaters and
stuff it's been cold here but that's
actually pepboys a whole plot there they
have a profit sharing program with all
the stores probably the key p and the
ball as long as humanly possible exactly
yeah it's all a big conspiracy it really
did tho i mean i think i was there for
like two and a half hours like come on
so we'll change and they and i had an
appointment you know on our own story
well i think well only there was an app
that could just change your oil for you
yeah see but unfortunately we're not
starting yeah maybe in the contest
you're going to be judging yeah that's
right we can talk about that a little
yes yes um tell everyone i know buffalo
teaming up with the MTA in new york city
which is the public transit authority
here and then with AT&amp;amp;T and i think New
York Polytechnic again this year and we
did the same thing last year and
basically over several months app
developers who want to get access to all
this data and this year they're opening
up historic bus times historic train
times and they're even working with
transit wireless and some beacons and so
developers can use all these tools and
create new apps for commuters whether
it's like you know getting around the
subway station easier and with beacons
hopefully you know you can see exactly
like where you are in a subway I hope
somebody comes up with that and then so
last year was in May we judged a
hackathon where they had 24 hours to
create this app and then
I've one that I can't believe they made
it in 24 hours and basically just
allowed you to find the performers in
the subways and their music and like in
New York City these the subway
performers are all professional
musicians so they're really good so you
might want to find that and then the
winner was City mapper which is now like
a hugely popular iOS and Android
applications it you know surpassed New
York City it's everywhere at Earth in a
lot of major cities so this year they
have better tools and we'll be doing the
same thing judging and it should be
really exciting actually I was just
going to say now if somebody could come
up with a beacon based app that helps
you avoid the panhandlers yeah right
like panhandler here man it's kind of
like ways for paid handlers yeah but
it's amazing like so imagine I don't
think the well the subway data should
help because it's gathered so frequently
that you should have an idea of like
live subway trains but with the busses
especially even last year you can see
like on a map like the bus coming down
which is really really neat I just you
know this year they have access to even
more data so i can't wait to see what
they come up comes out of it all right I
think that's really cool and when's the
final judging um I think last year it
ended in September so I suspect around
the same time although i don't know if
it's a full year we'll see i have to
check the calendar very cool yeah i hope
you have fun with it i hope some people
come up with some great apps rita to
judge yeah but moving on into the world
of the news for the week I cannot
believe how much we're hearing about the
galaxy s6 I know it seems like every day
there's something else and it you know
if my first cup reaction was wow it's
pretty early for that but if you think
about it it's really not right it's
November and then I'm just thinking like
in terms of big trade shows coming up we
have CES which is going to you know
these years it's mostly TVs and stuff
and I think the z1s came out last year
from Sony for t-mobile yes own
acknowledges the phone there yeah and
then we have mobile world congress which
is typically but this year it's in march
early mar
and the rumors are saying that Samsung's
going to release the galaxy s6 a month
ahead of time in march this year which
means that i mean to me that tells me
that they're going to release it and
announcing the same month possibly march
or there's just a mix-up along the lines
and and you know instead of februari
because Mobile World Congress isn't in
February it's in march this year and
that's simply when Samsung is going to
announce it and then release it in April
as it always does but in any case lots
of rumors saying it might have two
curved sides that was from an analyst
but to me it it it does make a little
sense considering the Galaxy Note edge
is out there it takes advantage of the
edge Sipan really well and Samsung's
building up a developer base for this so
I think if they're going to push it why
not push it with another flagship and so
maybe maybe it's just a special edition
of the galaxy s6 maybe it's a guess six
edge I don't know where the actual s6
will have that and then I think two
versions of the processor they're saying
64-bit XE nose makes sense given
lollipop support 64-bit processors or
Snapdragon 810 and and then storage
option somebody said like 128 gate up to
which I think we discuss on earlier show
which be wild you can put 256 gigs of
storage of phone well yeah so it sounds
like it's gonna be exciting but my
bigger question is what in the world
happened to 2014 yeah yeah it's almost
over how are we already discussing see
us and Mobile World Congress I mean then
we just get back from CES it seems like
it and now it's gone right back into it
but I think I booked my flight already
yeah I still need to do that super
exciting times for protected but this
year never really slowed down right like
we would say like oh maybe this month
it'll be a little slower than last and
just like month after month left your
mother gets slamme hey this was easily
the craziest year i've ever seen for
announcements in for new I've always
planned my vacation for later November
because that's a quiet period I'm almost
nervous that something's going to come
up
right you know what's even more sorry I
cut you off oh no good for me what's
even more incredible is that you know it
once it was say phones and tvs I'm just
you know being really simple here but
now it's and then it was phones and
tablets and TVs and stuff and now it's
like phones and tablets and TVs and
wearables and feel like there's just
more and more and more and you know once
upon a time it was printers to do but
we're not really I don't think anyone
cares about those anymore but you know
yeah dad and all the video game news
that comes out right is no longer just
III or gamescom it's just all throughout
the year there's gaming news coming out
and it's just it's mind-boggling to me
just how much stuff is coming out these
days it's nuts but yeah an elaborate
you're right i mean with march isn't
that far away so if this truly is the
plan for the s6 it makes sense that
we're starting to hear about it i did
i'll be really interested to see because
this really it's saying seems like it's
shaping up to be the first of the new
design language the first of the new
strategy of not releasing a phone every
three weeks yeah right yeah yeah because
that's what samsung had said you know
following the last earnings its phone
sales aren't where they want them to be
anymore you're gonna start with projects
euro i guess is the rumor that's
supposed to be the galaxy s6 and i think
we'll see them continue to move forward
with these Galaxy alpha galaxy note 4
style devices with the nice metal edges
feel real premium just hopefully a new
strategy in that direction which is why
yesterday we saw just concept images
that were posted by 3g UK um and at
first it was like uh you know like
that's easy just you know take it take a
galaxy alpha and make it bigger but i
think there's also you know some truth
to those images because if samsung if
say the galaxy alpha was sort of like
experiments are like to get things up
and running then you know it's really
plausible i think that will see the
galaxy s6 take shape in that kind of
form yeah oh definitely it'll be
interesting to see where this goes
speaking of sixes mmm the Nexus 6 yeah
you wrote a great editorial yesterday
about where is this thing yeah like
what's going on well and then after you
left yesterday we got the news that
t-mobile was going to have to delay its
launch because it didn't get it shipment
mm-hmm I saw that yeah what is going on
with this phone where is it yes oh I
thought this was a good question one of
our colleagues texted me while I was
hanging out at pepboys in the mall and
said you know basically Google can't
keep this thing in stock right motorola
can't keep it in stock google can't you
can't find anywhere it's not carrier
stores yet they're only taking
pre-orders or pushing it back like
what's going on if this was Apple people
would be up in arms and saying like this
is ridiculous what's going on with that
whole like you know they gotta get their
stuff together and I said my Quick
Reaction answer was well Google doesn't
control manufacturing in Apple does and
apples more of a hardware company and
Google's not Google's focused on search
and software and stuff like that it
doesn't build its own hardware so it
relies on its manufacturing partners and
the answer was like well that you know
still Google should have the power to
say hey motorola you know make these
handsets and make them available we
wanted for everybody so I thought that's
a good point too um and I really don't
have an answer but then I thought well
maybe it could be a transitional period
for motorola you know the deal with
Lenovo just closed so lenovo is probably
trying to figure out like how they're
handling manufacturing what they're
doing with their the response back was
but this has happened every year with
nexus devices and that's true it has
it's written really hard to find like
save last year Nexus 5 every year it's
been difficult and and I thought well
maybe it's just been difficult because
they were low priced and for people like
ourselves enthusiasts is jumping out
buying them all and saying he'll great
price I'm gonna buy this but then
finally I think it's also that Google
doesn't want to step on the toes of
other OEMs right so they don't I don't
think google always positions this as a
platform for other mini fact
cheers to base their designs awful
fright like here's what you can do with
it if you want to but I don't really
think that's the case anymore and I
think more and more as people are say
and even Google is targeting this as a
consumer device right like it's being
sold in Best Buy's being slowed by
carriers it's being sold with the nexus
player in these outlets Android wear
it's really just showing this whole
ecosystem of devices and so I think that
to be careful and this is just you know
putting on tin foil hat Google doesn't
want to step on Samsungs toes or anybody
else's toes and have consumers think
well like well this is the device you
should buy ignore those folks because
there's still huge hugely valuable
partners especially samsung on that end
and in LG and you know everybody else it
sells products with Google Play services
so I think that's the point to that
Google is trying to be probably pretty
cautious and not say like hey here's the
high-end flagship you should buy versus
a note for and in the end it's probably
smart because I don't think Google's
making more off of a nexus 6 than it is
off of a new floor I don't know the
truth in that but you know it's
Motorola's device well then here's the
question I mean and I tend to agree with
you they don't want to anger the OEMs
why even keep doing the Nexus line then
yeah well I think that's sort of that's
sort of the point at least when I had
meetings with google recently in New
York City we walked in and saw um let's
see i want to say we sat down and saw
the nexus player and it's like here's
google in the living room and all of
your apps and your movies that you've
purchased right and then we walked over
and we saw Android wear devices here's
google on your wrist and everything you
can do connected to your phone then we
walked over to all the next six here's
google on your phone then we saw Nexus 9
here's google on your tablet and i think
it's just about showing like google has
an ecosystem it's gonna tap partners and
show you how it imagines this should
work and in this case it's lollipop
years lollipop and android wear and
everything across the board and we have
manufacturers that can do this too and i
think that's the point but i think in
some ways it's just the nexus line sort
of their consumer facing google
in you know in best pie they have a
section this is like you know here's
this and often you'll find other Android
tablets right there too but I think it's
really just like sort of the I don't
want to see benchmark but the you know
the clean slate this is what we're
offering and then our partners can offer
more in some cases or similar or
whatever but that's my take on anyway I
don't know it's interesting you know I I
just wonder if maybe the frustration
level that everyone's feeling that you
know from the people that do want to buy
nexus 6 and they're having trouble
buying it yeah like yeah like you said
yesterday in your article you know if
this happened with Apple everyone would
be livid you know and apple stock would
collapse now I mean admittedly this is a
very very small portion this is nothing
compared to the problem Google's having
this morning with the double-click
servers for a half exactly yeah that's a
slightly bigger problem so I don't know
it's just it's been interesting to watch
and the fact that t-mobile didn't get
its full shipment it makes you wonder
what's going to happen with sprint and
18 tea and everybody else so I don't
know it's been interesting it sounds
like already has ears cuz they're
already promising stock like later this
week right i think friday oh yeah
they're promising but yeah we'll see
they will see how much is there oh yeah
yeah in every store it's kinda like when
you read those black friday ads real
close to it says seven per store anyway
right yeah terrible yeah some of those
awesome deals I've seen it you know then
you would read the fine print six per
store hey right yeah at least Walmart's
promising you know a one hour guarantee
but yeah which is good and then but I
saw like they're one hour guarantee and
I think we have it up on the side of
coming soon but they're one hour
guarantee is like I guess you can buy it
but then it's like promised before
Christmas or something though you they
give you a raincheck and so when it
comes in again you can still get the
Black Friday price
perfect okay that's awesome yeah and
speaking of Sasha Mahal has a question
is it worth going black friday shopping
oh but it depends on what you need I
mean there's some great deals what
Walmart selling what like a 55 inch TV
for 200 something bucks the thing to
remember about those though a lot of
times special model right there a
special model that's only for black
friday usually like the model number
will end in BF and they've done
something to it it's not quite what
you're expecting on televisions i
honestly would not do by friday but for
things like say a gaming system if you
know if you've got ps4 but you want xbox
one and vice versa I mean there's gonna
be some massive deals going on on game
consoles yeah the parties were great
like comes with two free games or crazy
now that being said I used to do black
friday I used to you know go to walmart
at three in the morning and wait in line
and everything else and now I leave the
country yeah that's great III land in
manchester on black friday morning and I
just ignore them I like two years ago I
had my mother order a grand theft auto
four for me on Amazon that was my my
last involvement a Black Friday can be
great depend on what you're looking for
just use your best sense i mean if
you're going after a known product to
product that can't be messed with you
know be an ipad error game console video
game whatever this way the money savings
versus your time and your stress now so
I don't know it's a tough question it
just depends it's definitely a younger
person's game I feel ya I've never done
it and I don't know oh I guess I become
yeah i got my parents a laptop one year
at walmart because if they needed a
laptop up in 89 it was a ridiculous
laptop I was like fine I'll go
three in the morning and wait in line
and the store was not going to have 15
of them and I got like the fifth one I
think right but yeah it just it's a
matter of how much is your time worth
alright so that's always a big question
for me on anything but alright so going
through some of the other questions here
interesting one from sahaja what Fitness
wearables do you guys wear I currently
don't wear one I wear a pebble right now
but I am considering picking up an up 24
before I go on vacation on this Heather
yeah a varian he's absolutely in love
with it and I'm and I keep going back
and forth do I really need this in my
life they're cool um and I feel like
they still do a bit more especially
thank you for trying to manage like what
you're eating you can add all that and
software right now I don't you watch our
would you still at a review and but it
tells me like a general idea of how much
I've moved throughout the day my
favorite to date was the jawbone up I've
oh I still have my eye on the up24
myself actually difference between this
was the added Bluetooth functionality
the other one you had to plug into your
phone to upload the data all the time um
I don't know but we'll see coming up it
looks like there's a lot Fitbit just
announced several surgical the thing is
it doesn't tie in with apple health kit
which Apple obviously doesn't like as it
pulled Fitbit from its stores and not
that it matters I mean you can use it
with other platforms to you and the app
still works and all that but if you
wanted you know everything in apple
health kit you won't get it with the
Fitbit products and then what misfit has
a really know what's their their
cheapest one it's like 50 bucks and
those work pretty yeah and they have
really great battery life but again no
Bluetooth functionality which for me I
can't it's manual it's not all the time
yeah I I just said I haven't dived into
there but I'm starting to look at it I
really don't want to know what how it
rates my sleep
I know I don't sleep well but I don't
know something to think about but
currently neither of us weird them on a
regular basis but maybe down the road uh
let's see here what awesome we got from
Benjamin MacDonald what do you think
about the nexus 9 you and I were
discussing this just before the show
yeah um well we reviewed it and we pray
sit in our review in some areas and
knocked it in others the software
experience is great it's a great way to
get into lollipop and it runs it really
well its got the Tegra k1 processor
handles and everything's super smooth
super quick on our units though the back
depressed is a bit on the Nexus logo it
the black unit gets really fingerprint
see especially like to just the screen
the back to the front facing speakers
are great they're not like super high
quality but it's nice having them on the
front I just felt like it didn't live up
to HTC's industrial design standards
we've long come to expect so the
greatest hardware from HTC and yet here
this comes out and just doesn't feel
like it lives up to to what you get from
HTC in in a by-product really hey I've
got mine here and the screens not great
and it leaks really badly oh yeah it's
leaking at the bottom of mine right now
I I don't know I mean luckily I picked
it up on the HTC deal for two hundred
dollars four hundred dollars yeah 200
bucks great tablet I'm not sure I you
know yeah it's hard for me to knock it
at two hundred dollars yeah and we were
talking before the show one of our
favorite or other favorite android
tablets is the Nvidia shield tab
front-facing speakers tiger k 1
processor they've promised lollipop is
coming and they have a focus on games if
you like that so like it's a little
smaller but I think overall like the
build quality everything there too
me is more attractive unless you need
the bigger screen and need pure
absolutely pure law lollipop guaranteed
quick updates and stuff like that well I
guess they're not really guarantee any
more right like that's out that it has
he got my nexus 7 from last really
should yeah right but yeah just continue
tradition devices in Shawn's hand uh it
looks like a phone but I so yeah I ain't
it's a decent tablet I don't like it as
much as the nexus 7 yeah I like the
nexus 7 it was sort of unique like it
felt like a book we've said that in the
passage I like the form factor better
mm-hmm leticia wrong and and I am
excited to try the the keyboard
accessory we haven't played with that
yet and see how well it does for work
and stuff like if I can actually use
this to write blog posts stuff I'd you
know I'd find a lot more value in it
that's just my guess no I totally agree
with you uh from michael van houte i
hope i said your name correctly Michael
do you guys think the nexus 6 camera is
good mainly because of the hardware or
because the new camera API and lollipop
the nexus 5 had decent hardware camera
wise but performed average so i can't
speak really well to the camera on the
nexus 6 we're still working on our
review but i would guess its a mix of
both to be honest I know Google's tried
to put a focus on the camera api's and
the hardware should be up to snuff but I
honestly haven't played with it it's out
in irvine long enough to like make a
judgment call on that so i really don't
have an answer but if it falls in the
same footsteps as last year and it's not
great hopefully google does issue
updates and fixes it but I'm hoping it's
good out of the box yeah I I would
imagine it's a combination of things
because the camera on the Nexus 5 was
probably one of the biggest complaints
yeah out of the box and then they got
better
yeah yeah exactly ah let's see what else
have we got here but uh here's a good
question from Sasha Mahal about what
will 2015 be the year of wearables I
think I mean I think it's just getting
started everything is so so new in the
wearable space everybody's still trying
to get off the ground but I think we're
starting to see real use cases we're
starting to see mass adoption where like
you know it's not just early adopters
anymore and this is I'm talking
wearables and that means fitness
trackers and stuff and then you know I
think as people used to those or C value
and that maybe they will start to see
smart watches too but I think smart
watches conversely are very much in
their infancy in general I think this
will be a bigger year for wearables
across the board I I think though we
still okay so we know the Apple watch is
coming next year and that should push
wearables in the SmartWatch space more
into the mainstream and more into the
public consciousness I am still not one
hundred percent convinced that the
public wants smartwatches and wearables
right it's just there won't be a niche
for them but do you think that the mass
market the average Joe walking down the
street gives a hoot about smartwatches
yet no not at all i think they just look
at I'm like oh that's cool I believe I
can never change yeah I think it can
change but it relies on I think two
major factors like through a there's no
huge killer app for the SmartWatch yet
tracking could really boost that killer
up um but it's gonna have to be really
good and really accurate and we don't
see that yet and be I don't think
battery life is even close to where it
needs people need to be able to put this
on the wrist and not worry about it in
the sense that the pebbles kind of there
but not really right like it's still not
perfect I think no to get my mom I'd say
to wear no yeah i mean i basically it
needs to have good i keep losing it for
a little bit there Todd so that that's
why I keep breaking up I basically where
the the pebble is a notification thing
ooh hey there is no one killer app on
the pebble that makes me go oh I have to
wear my pebble know it's just it's a
nicety to me to be able I'm typing to go
okay I got an email from so-and-so okay
I got text message yeah mm-hmm and that
that's about it and so I just I don't
see Joe and Jane Smith that's what going
oh I couldn't live without my SmartWatch
right exactly like I when I wear my
regular watch instead of a SmartWatch
rarely do I stay ah man if only I had
you know my android wear on today I
think that's changing is getting better
and especially during a busy work day
it's a lot more valuable to me like I
see no need for Android wear on the
weekends right so if you don't need it
all the time then like why why are
people going to be spending you know
three hundred dollars and more on these
products I think it needs to have real
real life value like I can't the same
way a smartphone is like when you first
bought your first smartphone you were
like whoa I've been missing out on this
for so long like I can't live without a
smartphone in that kind of sense like
when are we gonna hit that level of I
can't live without a wearable I don't
see that this year but who knows it he
like very 70 to 90 yeah right yeah mine
was the samsung blackjack on singular
whoo windows yeah so yeah I to his
question yeah I do
I think wearables are going to be the
big focus in 2015 I don't see
smartphones changing that much tablets I
think are pretty much and let's let's
actually let's discuss that for just
half a second the we we've been tearing
a lot about you falling ipad sales and
all that and I know we've touched on
this before but in general how oft as a
person need to upgrade their tablet yeah
like not that often I mean fruit I get
it like when you add in a 2x processor
and it's like this is amazing for photo
and video editing and gaming you know
with metal and all kinds of stuff then
you might like a small select population
might be like I need that tablet but for
the rest of us who use the iPad in bed
for magazine reading for books for email
and for messaging there is no real need
to upgrade and and not for many years
and I think for that to change you know
you need we need to change the use case
scenarios of these tablets and I think
that's why we see Apple Samsung a lot of
people targeting the enterprise because
for example we saw yesterday a report on
Apple hiring a new sales team didn't
target the enterprise it's seeming up
with IBM and I think that that's that
can help you know boost those sales
where otherwise it wasn't selling much
of anything at all like I know okay like
the iPads in enterprise where you know
that but it's not there's not a huge
support system in place and that's
what's going to change with that book
here for enterprise they offer twenty
four seven support they have you know
guide it's a woman you know a team
member assigned to every team to help
you deploy this and I think that's where
you start to see especially in a
demanding place where say Enterprise
need something for modeling or something
then maybe they do need to upgrade more
frequently at least more frequently than
a consumer that's using it for email at
home I don't know the answer but I think
as as we rely on tablets more for more
than just regular stuff then we'll start
to see you know annual adoptions seem to
be more necessary but when you think
about it we only upgrade phones every
two years to if you're on a contract I
mean people like you and I upgrade
more frequently that foot regular effort
and computers to my desktop ears I mean
it's desperately in need of a swap out
but I think they go you know about three
years so yeah no se but yeah I like I'm
not a degree you know I've got the the
last 17-inch macbook pro which was 2011
it still it has a couple issues i might
just swap the hard drive out in but in
general I have no burning desire to
upgrade so I don't know why people are
so freaking out about the idea that
apple's not selling as many ipads as it
did a year ago that doesn't mean the
tablet market is dead I've seen people
got a wallet you know maybe tablets
weren't what we all thought they were no
I think they are I just think you all
have to get used to the idea we don't
need to upgrade them every single year
right yeah ok it's almost like like a
catch-22 too because you buy a tablet
from apple and you're gonna get the
latest software update at least in its
gonna at least work on tablets say about
a year to wool right in about two years
yeah whereas the older I passes work as
well and so so especially you don't need
to upgrade like if Apple said ok iOS 8
here it is it's amazing it offers all
these new features but it's only
available on the new devices well then
maybe people would be more willing to
upgrade and resell there are other ones
and there would be a totally different
idea but I think everybody's glad that
apple doesn't do that and nobody does it
I mean Samsung's video issuing updates
to its older tablets a lot of me HTC has
they're not yet a promise for some I
don't know if they have it for well I
guess this is their first tablet right
in a long time so first time about a
long time but if they issue other
tablets hopefully they have the 90 day
guarantee that's yeah yeah exactly a
good question here from saha raja and
this is definitely more in your ball
court uh what is the point of 64-bit yes
i think it in me I saw this question and
I was trying to think more about it but
it should enable more powerful
applications to run at the same time and
better take advantage of memory
I'm if I'm remembering correctly on how
64bit works and we saw that obviously
with the move from 32-bit to 64-bit
windows and now it's happening on on
Android but in order for everybody to
take advantage of it I'm almost certain
that app developers also have to design
their apps to run on 64-bit processors
so I think hopefully it just means that
everything is going to run smoother you
get more powerful apps and it can handle
it better on a processor I guess that's
the simplest answer ok this just came
across Twitter from a chart a big tip
caen excuse me Samsung's Hong says
global wearable market will grow to 135
million in 2018 from 22 million in 2014
seems plausible as they get more I mean
I'm just think I'm more shocked that
they think that they sold 22 million
wearables in 2014 yeah is this their own
bundle deals too which makes it more
desirable but if you think about it 122
million that's what a 30 United States
you get III could see i guess the entire
wearable market globally and that's if
they're being sold everywhere yeah i
mean it seems plausible if it's a 22 now
that's only five times right yeah this
is not a question but it's a commentary
on what we were just saying about
tablets from Scott OTT I want I want to
want an ipad air 2 but I can't want to
it's frustrating I no longer need
something between my Moto X my imac and
kindle paperwhite I do have a first gen
ipad that used for words with friends in
an occasional I book that's a good point
we have so many other devices now I
think that tablets not just iPads but
tablets in general they have to fill a
very specific task for you mm-hmm you
know like my iPad yes I use it for some
work stuff but it's primarily an
entertainment device for me especially
when I'm on a plane but I don't think
everybody you know if you have a laptop
and a phone or a desktop and a phone
not all those people need a tablet right
hey I keep thinking now that I have the
iphone 6 plus like I don't really need
the ipad me although I like having the
slightly bigger screen and I'm like man
now I kind of want the ipad air 2 and
maybe I'll get rid of the mini it's it's
hard and I understand where you know
you're talking from on that too and this
applies sorry I also have the note 4 in
the nexus 9 so like I it's same
situationally I don't know where I want
to go with this and i also like smaller
tablets so it's it's tough for me i
really want a tablet that i can actually
work on and i have it a lot of people
say that you can really do that with the
ipad air 2 and i think you know for a
lot of some industries where you're
doing email and obviously working with
words and stuff like that which is now
free then you could do it but for me I
guess it's really hard to like blog and
stay in touch with everybody on chat and
get worked on like a multitasking for me
just isn't right there yet I can do it
with the surface pro 3 but it's also you
have thousand bucks yeah exactly from
Dominique Weber what do you think about
the feel a landing which is the comet
lady I think it's insanely exciting i am
a little concerned the harpoons didn't
fire they're trying to figure that out
right now considering that the the probe
is up there for 10 years you know it the
fact that one thing has gone wrong
sublime it's yeah unfortunately that's a
rather important thing because I helps
anchor it to the comet so they're trying
to figure that out right now but I think
this is a massive step forward for space
exploration and I I can't wait to see
where we go from here yeah I was
incredible it's it's weird to think
about right you just land it on comet
yeah i know crazy from joey davidson he
sent this a link to me while we've been
on the show so i haven't had a chance to
watch it yet have you guys seen the new
samsung rap video should technobuffalo
only do videos and rap for me out um I
saw it simple we I couldn't watch e yeah
I don't I'm trying to envision him at my
and jon rettinger
rapping and it's it's not pretty yeah
pretty at all I guess for our viewers
it's titled is it is this talent
management thing I assume samsung
sustainability report 2014 talent
management google that on youtube that
looks like what it is i can't watch it
happens and i want people to hear yes
but we will watch that but no I don't
think TechnoBuffalo be going to wrap
only videos anytime soon oh please no
from Dominique Weber do you think Apple
stop releasing new iPads every year now
that sales are down I think they could
skip the ipad mini this year for sure
yeah but I feel like they're like oh
here's such ID and we'll make it as an
option I think maybe I don't see it
happening but they need to start showing
us why there needs to be upgrades and I
think that's why the rumors of the ipad
pro makes sense with multitasking
functionality if you can run two apps
side by side again people like me don't
want to carry a macbook air everywhere
what you said man I'm not complaining
it's not a heavy device but if you if I
could just take my tablet you know wait
for the weekend and I need to do some
work or something like that then maybe
this is the sort of the device I'm
looking for and so I think if they can
fill a gap each year then they should
continue releasing them but in the case
where you're not really filling a
massive gap then I think this is going
to continue because there's no read you
know there's no reason for us upgrade
which is sort of what we've been doing
yeah from Sasha Mahal who's the nexus
player for especially if someone already
has a chromecast apple TV and or Roku
player and how does this come back to
gadget overload I glad well first off I
think most people only need one
streaming device and the your average
consumer at most is only going to buy
one they're not going to be like me who
I have a fire TV you have everything I
well that's when I cover so I do yes I
even have a fire stick on order you know
it's nice ridiculous but I think it's
for
just like the apple TV is for people
there are locked into the apple
ecosystem the Nexus player is for those
people that have chosen to go with the
Google Play ecosystem yep you know it's
it's exactly that's exactly and it adds
functionality over the chromecast so I
think I mean it includes everything the
chrome pass does and then it has its own
app store you know it's quick access to
the movies you've already purchased so
it's not necessarily going through your
phone your tablet it's all right there
you can add a controller play games it's
sort of like people who really like the
chromecast or invested in Android and
want something a little bit more and
it's also not just so this is just again
we come comes back to a reference
platform this is just a reference for
Android TV which other manufacturers can
create so we're going to see I'm certain
other other versions of this and it's
also going to be built into future TV so
I wouldn't be surprised at CES that we
start to see TVs with android TV
built-in so it's not just necessarily
for people it's sort of where it sort of
androids next step in the living room
and whether you buy it or not as a
totally different question but it's
where it's going exactly and last
question for the day from Sasha Mahal
what do you think of the Amazon echo I
have no idea what they're aiming this at
I made a joke on twitter i put a i put
an iphone with Siri on top of a paper
towel roll and said i just got it and
it's not just Syria like I you can say
Cortana and Google now too but for me
that's that's what I thought about it I
was like what the heck is this big old
Bluetooth speaker that you know you
address and say hey Alexa you know
what's the weather or whatever but I
think in the future the goal is and we
see this right now you can add things to
your amazon shopping list so you buy it
later and i think in the future you'll
say hey you know Alexa buy me some eggs
and hopefully they won't show up cracked
like mine did this morning thanks fresh
direct but like but I think that's it
like a direct portal voice right into
amazon store amazon by media chromecast
already has your account you know you
want it if you have prime it'll be here
in two days like why would i have to go
computer I think that's where it's going
to be important but it's not there yet
so right now it's just sort of this
smart home voice console they can listen
to you and play music and stuff like
that the idea is neat but I also think
that my gut reaction is that maybe
amazon is keeping this limited to you
know interested parties are they have to
sign up like where else in the world you
sign up for interest to buy something
like in the extreme luxury car market
like where else and you know but not in
gadgets and I think maybe amazon is just
gauging this to see where the demand is
before it goes all kinds of nuts on it
like it did with the fire phone which it
took a bath on so that's nice I I don't
know I mean yeah I registered for an
echo simply because we'll need you know
one for review and so on but I
registered to do with it I just don't
know about L hey Alexa you know order me
a chromecast like you said I don't know
much mand that's what I keep asking like
do we really need that is that how we're
gonna shop in the future maybe i don't
know but i can't i don't know i did like
it's weird to think about like am I
gonna because it has like a whole room I
can sit here and say like oh that you
keep out hey uh Lex old Ernie the Nexus
6 you know I'll be like yeah mmm like is
that gonna work is that something people
wanted you yeah I maybe not but at least
it's trying I'm gonna have to see it in
action before I make any sort of final
decision on it but right and it be clear
that's not how it's gonna work at the
start it's like you can add it to your
shopping list start that's just yeah
which is why I think it's kind of
pointless right I agree well that is
going to do it for this week's episode
