good and bad and I want to come talk to
the expert on all things that fold and
happen to have a phone with me
you'll probably guess where I am galaxy
fold very exciting it's new it's
different and it is in typical Samsung
form full of controversy yeah
that's unfortunate really I mean
rightfully so mmm you think it's a
samsung held to a different standard in
phones in general right and then you get
one with a brand new form factor and
price pre on the price so okay outrage
going on mm-hmm
right or wrong you know the thing with
this I feel like it's commensurate with
the amount of hype so like in other
words if you have this much hype
associated with a product there's gonna
be a certain a subset of individuals
that for whatever reason don't like it
and they're looking where do they latch
on to what is the thing that they can
grab to like to justify not wanting it
for example cuz the other group is so
into it
guys like me they have to watch these
videos and I'm like this is so cool I'm
playing pub G like this green is massive
this is a whole new experience I'm
getting you know the hype factor the
height meter which I can't help because
I'm a tech fan and like this is so
different it's refreshing and so when I
dive into this thing right here it's
like I'm just emo ting that the feeling
the sentiment that's what's happening so
I feel like it much like has happened
with previous devices there's gonna be a
group of people that are looking for
these types of stories that kind of go
the other direction which is fine I
think what I think it's it's relevant I
think these things should be
investigated to that point but the truth
of the matter is that right now it's a
it's a small it's how many people even
have these I'm guessing there's a thirty
of them out in the open is it even that
many it could be it's let's put it this
way it's nowhere near in actual shipment
to to a wide array of regular customers
its reviewers it's guys like you and me
and a handful of others that have these
in our pockets right now
here's here's the thing though there's a
thing I think what what's important to
discuss here is the difference between
the two problems the two different
scenarios that arose on social media you
have the one which is like we try to
peel off this thing the user error we
try to pick but but even in that even I
mean you flip this over right like this
it's it even in that situation well
first I should ask you did you think
about peeling it off never never never
occur to me
did you like no no no I never thought to
peel it aint occur to me either but it's
weird that it didn't because I have
peeled off screen protector I usually do
it all the time like this is a weird I
think I'm debating myself when I talk
about this phone like I want to give Sam
some credit and they're developing
something in the open it's an it's a
first new form factor be seen since what
the note with your original no it's even
more radical than it's never seen
anything like yeah so I want to give
them more leeway from Frank so I've been
doing it all along I've been doing it
since I got my hands on this thing I
feel myself making excuses for it
because it's so ambitious and because
it's we haven't it's been so much of the
same it's a slight iteration from
smartphone and smartphone and they all
show up here on the table on this
channel and you're kind of nitpicking
slight differences between them and to
have a brand new fresh form factor you
want it to keep happening you want to
almost encourage these brands to keep
doing it so that you have something
fresh to evaluate so that's the thing
why if brands are gonna be critical or
criticized and chastised for trying
something new and maybe it fails what's
the motivation to try something new and
push the envelope again mm-hmm Hey well
I mean to sell them hopefully but you're
right though it's this is one of those
areas where it's hard to hold the
customer accountable ultimately if a
regular human bought this thing and it
was destroyed within two days I mean
that's gonna be a significant pain point
yeah for them probably forever
versus guys like us I was talking about
this with Dave yesterday guys like us
what's like well I don't know you sent
an email and maybe you get a fresh one
so we kind of need to adjust our lens
when it comes to you know a clearer
perspective or
perspective closer to a person spending
their dollars to get one of these things
but you're but no you're completely
right it's like if we want to see this
type of experimentation take place then
we are going to have to make a certain
compromise so something's gonna have to
give I mean there's calls for I want
something new I want a new form factor
and then we have a new form factor
mm-hmm and obviously you should be
critical you're spending $2,000 on your
phone general consumers buying this
that's a lot of money that's a ton of
money and the product should be held to
a certain standard look you also have to
understand very early first gen product
you're buying essentially a beta product
that's been shared with the Pope yeah
it's like a Samsung Kickstarter yes okay
perfect
so your Samsung right now let's say
you're you're sitting in Seoul how do
you handle these issues right now what
do you what do you don't first first of
all they they put out the statement
which is good sir statements are good at
least you're not silent and they
reference the fact that they're gonna
inspect the units that are available to
them to inspect I don't know what
they're gonna find the one that kind of
messed me up was the case the verge case
yeah the dieter case where he just had
like the picture I saw it was just a
like a little bump and then a line in
the display so I mean I can't without
any more information I don't know
exactly what occurred there so he said
they put it on clay like they used clay
so the user for all their phones
we think it might have gotten in through
the hinge really I think you're gonna
put this in your pocket stuffs gonna be
in your pocket play that that could
happen you might have play in your pot
pocket full of clay all right so what do
you do see predestine yeah you put our
statement look man I feel like this is
kind of our job to an extent
like maybe we maybe we can rationalize
more than they're able to only because
they still have to sell the thing and
their brand name is on it what I said
yesterday in a sort of discussion that I
was having about it was I feel like
people just need to be aware of what
they're buying
like just recognize from the jump that
this is not a solid state smartphone
that this you can't it's hard to even
compare it to typical smart phones I
notice this with my
self carrying this thing I'm babying I'm
a little jet 100% and I don't know if
that comes through on camera that's the
problem is I think when when we interact
with it we discuss it in the same
framework as a typical smartphone the
feeling that might come through is that
we should evaluate it like a typical
smartphone and I really don't think
that's the case I think this is
different enough it's a fresh enough
form factor that we really need to think
about the treatment necessary let's just
know IP rating here no one's telling you
it's super durable beyond the fact that
you can open and close the hinge 200,000
times according to Samsung which is a
very doesn't big number sure and
untested in in real in real life
obviously but what can I say I think
this is a phone that's meant to be
babied for real and I I think I think
there are enough people out there that
are willing getting that so devil's
advocate are we being too forgiving are
we giving Samsung too much of the
benefit of doubt because we want to like
the phone why I I think that's an
inherent issue with anyone who's a tech
fan sure in general like I've had this
thing out in public there's a lot of
questions people want to hold it it's
there's there's a cultural aspect to
having the the latest thing and
obviously the latest thing yeah it's
appealing to us and it's part of the
reason we got into this particular
business so it might be a blind spot you
could be right
I seen there are there's obviously the
other take and I think it's important
for us to express that as well which is
that why why should we promote a
half-baked product right why should why
should we ask people who watch these
videos to take a risk minutes I don't
think we should I'm going through it so
are we going easy like in the same
breath I'm saying I love using this
thing I'm saying don't buy it
like don't I I'm saying if you are at
all scared of this particular outcome
there's one way to guarantee you won't
have it you can stick to a standard
boring yes lab of a smartphone that you
there's your solution right there so
it's like I think it's just important to
sort of curb the way that we the way
that we discuss it kind of like softened
it up curved off the end of it and just
be like this is what it is these are
our expectations and like I said earlier
I think this phone needs to be
interpreted standalone not like those
other devices yeah just and it's like
it's somewhere between a tablet and a
phone it's got a hinge it's kind of like
a laptop it's a weird new device and the
treatment of it is gonna be weird for a
bit if that movie if the giant hinge
it's this moving part this is not
something we've ever expected of a
smartphone in the past so I just feel
like there is gonna be inherently some
compromise it's just about being aware
of that compromise so I won't ask
another question 7 this is with first
question I want to ask and we sat down
but I had a build to it I build the hype
to get to the okay it's obviously a lot
of commentary going on nothing galaxy
fold and people who have never seen it
touched it and may never see it and
touch it mm-hmm what would you say to
those people who are out there whether
they're in the tech community you talk
about haters right now we're fan haters
people that are commenting on things
they've never seen mm-hmm and and
putting themselves a position of
authority without ever seeing it but you
but here's the thing
and isn't that a big part of the space
in general is it so much of its
speculative like when we make a video on
one of these devices what percentage of
the audience has it whether it's this or
something else
but they have an opinion yeah oh yeah
pinions are cheap you get those ones for
free wake up in the morning you have one
of those after your coffee and whatnot
you know so I think I don't know that
there's a way to stop it I think I would
say it's just it's a bit uh would you
even want to stop it if you could he
says it's not really what I want to do
it's not like I don't want to wake up in
the morning and then and then just hate
on some ambitious product like this like
I don't I don't want to it I of course
this there are products that I like more
than others I have the benefit of being
able to get them in my hands and
actually evaluate them other people
don't have that opportunity so they are
often having to judge from a distance
but you're completely right people do go
overboard it's uh but that's the whole
culture that's the news cycle
that's the hype train that's the hot
take it's all of it it's like it's very
seductive the idea of how
one liner like I knew it was gonna be
garbage but but to be honest with you
the fandom in the space it never ceases
to amaze me it blows my mind all the
time
that people are like so dedicated to a
particular brand that their love for
that brand extends into the hatred for
others it's it's very bizarre it's
always been bizarre to me the way I look
at it is like if this thing if this form
factor succeeds in any way it's only
going to push the other manufacturers
the other brands that you do like to
potentially move in that direction as
well so if you're an Apple fan it really
is not helpful to hate on Samsung like
these two players are established
they're in our future they're there
they're here for the rest of our lives
so if they can push one another the only
and if the only person who's gonna
benefit in that exchanges is you the
customer so before we started filming
we're downstairs talking we're talking
about sports and you mate you said
something that resonated
it's like sports fandom you know you're
rooting for the J is it at least whoever
you're rooting for
you're not rooting for the other guys
mm-hmm right you're loyal to one and to
root for something else is doing a
detriment to your team to your squad and
it's interesting you see tech take on
that same same loyalty that same
dedication and sports it's had for years
mm-hmm
it has been a transition for sure I
think these devices have become more
important to people and the investment
has become more important to people and
culturally they are representative
representative of an individual if they
put it out on the table they want it to
somehow represent who they are in a way
and so there's a whole personality
associated with it I think it just it
does if you want to flip it on a
positive optimistic end you could say
like it's it's cool that these things
matter so much to people that people are
interested in them to begin with them
that people are interested in an
innovation or different brands within
the space but it's like a lot of other
things it can it can quickly get tainted
and weird and totally shift gears and
become personal attacks and and very
bizarre and truly not helpful to the
conversation or to pushing the thing
forward that you happen to be a fan of
so using the sports analogy just because
I'm a fan of a particular team doesn't
actually mean I can't appreciate
greatness elsewhere like I think being a
proper sports fan actually allows you to
do that I think a low level sports
his only my team can do something great
how I play sports myself I think it's
just as important to be able to lose a
game and say you know what they deserve
to win
not necessarily there weren't winning
and losing as the agenda but how you
play the game this is a big one so
before the screen started peeling off
and phones are breaking it's all about
the crease that crease oh yeah down the
middle yeah okay I don't know I go back
and forth I go back and forth on this
crease so and then it my instinct is no
I think that the trade off is amazing
enough the wow factor is still there for
me yeah so every time I pop this open
I'm still like wow am I really am I at
the coffee shop right now like am I am I
having breakfast right now and this I
have access to this way because I wasn't
the type of person was gonna carry a
tablet around yeah like that wasn't it
was never gonna occur it was whatever
was in my pocket what would be what I
was using in those different
circumstances I pop it out I'm still and
I'm still in that Wow's own so much that
the crease is like it's it's way down
the list of things that I'm that I'm
interpreting so I'd say no I say it
doesn't bother me I'd say I don't care
but I would but I would say it'd be
better if it didn't have it oh I'll go
that far I mean if there was a way to
engineer around the crease then bonus
points but I'll take this experience
with the crease over the typical
smartphone experience in most
circumstances
so assuming there weren't any other
issues with the phone the crease is not
a reason to not buy it if you're in the
market if you want to spend it if you
want to for in fact when you want the
latest tech yeah I don't think so I mean
the other thing to mention is that like
this is a very brightly lit environment
you can see the crease show up here in
the reflection but you realize that
typically you're using this indoors in
the evening there's a lot less competing
light source and so in those
environments it actually diminishes the
appearance of the crease even more so
like lying in bed for example or on a
couch there oh that was you really enjoy
that
I was sitting there watching yeah I
didn't take out my iPad yeah the first
time yeah you wouldn't know I I have in
my house I have all kinds of iPads iPad
minis there's actually Maps really
closely to the iPad Mini but it's
actually lighter yeah and the bezel is
smaller and so when you get when you do
the rest on the pinky like this look
you're doing it you're doing right there
yeah yeah it just it's it's you feel
like you could hold like that for a
while
it's comfy it was shocking to see how
much real estate you had so it's all you
did a video he compared it to everything
else you know in the iPhone across it
not it's not that different
yeah so that was that was shocking to
actually see and sometimes that held the
phone and had it you realize it mm-hmm
and the more I use that the wow factor
hasn't again it hasn't gone away it's
still cool I mean you've used a lot of
phones is this people are asking you
more about this than either phone that
you've you've had oh absolutely yeah I
mean signing close but this in the
original note we're the two phones that
people stopped mm-hmm
and like they were more or the original
iPhone sure yeah but as firstly yeah
we're definitely yeah as far as like
paradigm-shifting phones that really
changing like the rectangle mm-hmm like
this is a really big first step and I
say this in like the broad breadth of
foldable phone so you can throw the made
X in there like it's here mm-hmm
it's a product that you can choose to
buy or not choose to buy but this is
incredible yep it's just I think it's
important it's important to also mention
it's just version one yes like it's it's
incredible as everything you just said I
think it people tend to interpret this
stuff very in a very polarizing way like
does that mean he just said that it's
perfect no he didn't just say it was
perfect
it's like for some reason I feel the
need to always kind of put that next
piece in its gen1 and it's expensive
everything we're talking about is true
it's amazing it's cool the cool factor
is a thousand and so forth but it's
expensive in its gen one so if you're
not a Gen one kind of person if you're
not experimenting through your tech
purchases if you can't bear the
expenditure of like this risk because
any gen one is a risk of anything oh
it's then it's probably not the place
for you as cool as it my team
might want to hold off to the next-gen
its way it's quite possible but it would
be unfortunate if the product was a
complete failure and he had to like and
he had to escape the segment altogether
and they gave up on folding phones so I
hope some people buy it so that I think
so I could keep having it I hope some
people buy it but I don't think it's for
the hesitant purchaser who wants like
the rock-solid smartphone of 2019 no
this is not not it what's exciting those
when this filters its way down that's
like it
it's a halo car you know it's it's the
i8 yeah yeah in a second that technology
makes its way down the line correct yeah
yeah and volume helps if if there is any
level of success here then they can
increase the volume which therefore they
can innovate further they can get the
cost down a bit as the volume goes up
the margins can shrink there's all kinds
of good things that happen if the
product is successful so I hope that it
is as weird as that is I hope that it is
because it just represents something so
different and and it encourages this
this type of experimentation from the
brands that we're hoping to get it from
that's a fair point I mean looking at
this in where it's where it's going you
can see two three generations from now
this being the note weight with an S Pen
on here this is probably Samsung's
original vision you know with the note
yes it's a big screen experience that
you can't get you can we make a
rectangle so big before it's a tablet or
just doesn't fit in anybody's pocket
mm-hmm like this is this is next yeah if
you were trying to make a tablet for
somebody's pocket I just don't even know
how else you do it it has to fold yeah
yeah there's no other way so it's a last
question
thank you near the Audi fold so made X
that's what's before okay so that's hard
to say without looking at I mean I will
just I'm just speculating obviously
benefit a folding in word is you're
protecting the plastic display by having
it covered but the downside is this mini
little exterior display now granted this
guy is narrow so one-handed use benefits
a little bit by the narrow because of
the narrow screen that said there's
certain functionality on screen just
feels like like you you're gonna like
need to zoom in it just doesn't feel
right on this typing is typing a small
yeah it's typing for example various
other things where it says it's not a
typical 20 19 smartphone experience on
the outside so also I should mention the
huawei device is more expensive it's
like even 500 bucks more than this I
think though so holy moly
or going even further into the luxury
territory I really want to get it in
hand if it feels as fat as this one it
might be difficult one-handed to really
interact with you too much and then you
start to question well then why are you
folding out because the display is so
big to begin with in the folded mode are
you going to be compelled to utilize the
full display as frequently is on this
where it's almost like the exterior
screen motivates you yet to pop it open
this frequently is like a second terrace
the secondary screen exactly primary
screen inside right as opposed to you
could probably make the alternative
argument yeah on on the mate I'm split I
gotta try it first I really can't say
for certain I'm glad this one is here
and I think being the first one on the
desk you get some certain points for
that you ready race to the moon and
whatnot but I'm gonna wait I'm gonna
wait to see fair enough thank you for
the time yeah thanks for walking me
through this it was nice to get inside
