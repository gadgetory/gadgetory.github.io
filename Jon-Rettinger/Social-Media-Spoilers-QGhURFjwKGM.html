to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back there pisode of
rettinger rant I'm your host Jon renders
the show right ranked and rave on
something that's pissing me off it up
this week something is really pissing me
off spoilers spoilers on TV shows and
movies that people put out on the
internet cut it out I ain't you don't do
it you know who someone who's done it
maybe you're the person who's done it
this is right just rants go and get
started so probably like you I love
myself some TV I don't always get a
chance to watch episode when it airs for
instance Breaking Bad I love Breaking
Bad I've been watching it from season
one following what happens with Walter
White as he goes and makes his crazy
glue things that you should never ever
try I absolutely love the show and one
day i was browsing the LA Times I live
in Southern California as I'm prone to
do and I hadn't had a chance to watch
the episode that aired the previous
Sunday and in giant bold letters the
headline of the article was what
happened that episode now I would not
spoil anything for you ever but come on
LA Times and I seen happen on facebook
all the time to not but on Twitter hey
did you see what happens on X show this
happened did don't do that be a good
human being it is an awful awful stupid
bad thing to do I remember when the show
gossip girl and I never watch it by a
friend who did and she posted on her
facebook status hey I can't believe I
remember the character's name was the
gossip girl she posted it like an hour
after the show ended I have never seen
such angry angry comments at her and I
got it she was dumb and she should have
known better than LA Times was dumb I
shoulda known better in fact they got so
much negative nail and negative email
and feedback on social media can they
totally changed a headline to be spoiler
free as everything should be at least we
should have like a predetermined time
like you can't spoil anything for two
weeks after a show airs and that it
takes a little while to watch it two
weeks don't say a word about what
happened it's mean it's not cool you
invest your time in these shows you want
to know what happens you don't someone
to spoil the ending for yeah it's just
not nice you don't want someone to walk
up to be like hey
he was dead all along I was just gonna
go sit down and watch that movie not
cool dude like in quotes pulp fiction
for a second be cool with a buddy
because stop spoiling your favorite
shows it's not gonna make You friends
you're not gonna possibly influence
people and just me people really matter
you so cut it out seriously don't do it
think twice before you do it is that
tweet that facebook status whatever that
blog post video whatever it might be
worth it if I can spoil something
putting giant letters spoiler alert
humming people can hear muffin and not
hear what you are going to say or not
read what you're gonna say and that
makes life a little bit better for me
this got me really mad though I got a
show called brand so I figured a what a
better way to get it out if this I'll
feel better so am I wrong here to be
you'll be able to post ever they want
spoiler free or spoiler plenty I want to
