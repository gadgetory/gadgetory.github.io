and today we're taking a first look at
Halo 3 ODST this unboxing will serve as
an intro to my actual review which will
follow after I finished the campaign and
explore the new multiplayer content so
wait for that later this week as you
probably noticed most gaming sites have
already come out with their OD SC
reviews and the game is getting some
pretty solid scores especially the
larger gaming sites seem to be rewarding
ODST high scores that leads me to
question that our review is giving ODST
a good score to avoid angering the halo
fans that swarm in the multiple millions
I'll definitely try to answer this
question in my upcoming review halo ODST
was initially planned as a small
downloadable expansion but I'm guessing
the guys at Bungie reckon that halo 3
has sold so much that people are
definitely willing to pay a full retail
price to get a little more of the Halo 3
magic they were probably right people
will pay a full retail price but is it
justified can it expand you to really be
worth the price of a full game this is
also an aspect that I will explore in my
full review but in any case halo 3 ODST
ended up as a standalone game and as you
can see the box promises a new hero new
campaign and new multiplayer there's
also a sticker of Halo Reach multiplayer
beta Halo Reach is Bungie Studios final
installment to the franchise those who
buy halo 3 ODST will get access to the
multiplayer beta it's definitely an
extra incentive for some but it could
also be a device to justify the high
price tag I also have to mention that
I'm not too big a fan of widespread
multiplayer beta because when people who
haven't had access to the beta buy the
actual retail game on launch day for
example and start playing multiplayer
for the first time they will be getting
their asses handed to them by people who
have been playing the game for weeks on
the multiplayer beta I would go so far
as to call this an unfair advantage so
inside the box we have an Xbox Live Gold
membership trial for 48 hours we also
have a UNSC field operations guide which
is obviously the operation manual for
ODST
and we also find an ad for Halo Legends
animated series
and for halo reach the halo ODST box
contains two discs one for the campaign
and the second disc is dedicated to the
multiplayer experience but less fire if
the campaign disk can see what halo 3
ODST is all about
whoops sorry about that wrong console
let's try that again
Marty O'Donnell's musical score that
you're hearing in the background has
always been one of my favorite things
about the series it has definitely set
the tone for the world itself and the
action so I'm quite excited to hear what
the composer created this time around
for ODST
but that's about it for this unboxing
video I better get playing if I intent
to make a thorough review on the game so
catch you later I'll be signing out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
