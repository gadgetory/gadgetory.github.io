like this this time though they look
like this meet the I'm assuming not
retail packaging for the brands new
Nokia Lumia icon all done up in this
Pelican case with icon logo right across
from it so go ahead and open this
gigantic thing up see what we've got
inside it's like I need sound effect Shh
with like dry ice coming out here so
this used to light up but I'm guessing
the batteries died if you can see
there's cords and look like there's a
little switch up there as well but
sitting here in its little styrofoam
house is the brand new Nokia Lumia icon
notice it's not the Lumia icon 30 28 or
whatever no more numbers this is just
the Lumia icon coming February 20th to
Verizon Wireless for a one hundred and
ninety-nine bucks pressed out to the
side for just a quick second see what
else we're gonna have this gigantic box
and I don't assume most of stuff that's
in here it's gonna make it to the retail
packaging we've got a micro USB cord for
charging and syncing we've got it wall
warts we've got some Verizon SIM card
stuff and get to know your phone and
that is about it they also included for
us some monster headphones and these
look pretty monstrous and also pretty
awesome
they are bluetooth headphones with NFC
enabled also had think some noise
cancelling business is in there push
those off we got a Nokia monster bag
with little clip on it I think we got
some other things living under here for
the headphones to charge them another
little wall work cable to sync you've
got a 3.5 millimeter monster cable the
flat sort of non tangle variety some
booklets and that is about it let me go
ahead and push this giant thing off to
the side and let's take a look at the
phone so here is the nokia lumia icon
this phone feels incredible in the house
it's not gonna translate on video but
its guts through that cold metal feels -
it feels significant it just feels
really really nice so what are you
looking at here you're looking at a
5-inch screen with a 10-8
a resolution so it's 1920 by 1080 which
is free math whizzes 441 at PPI it's an
HD OLED screen in fact I'm gonna go
ahead and power it on while I'm walking
through everything else the phone has so
Windows Phone 8 at launch it presumably
Windows Phone 8.1 is not that far away
so hopefully this would get that upgrade
it's being powered by you 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 800 chips so plenty
of power packing to this guy it's got
two gigs of RAM 32 gigs of internal
storage but you can also have some
external storage as well also going to
come with seven gigs of SkyDrive storage
Nokia phones are usually a lot about the
cameras and this one is no exception you
got a 20 megapixel sensor living right
there on the back with a dual LED flash
on the front you're going to have a 2
megapixel sensor 802 11 ABG and an AC at
24 20 milliamp hour battery that has my
favorite wireless charging it's the
chief standard and it's available in
black or white you can guess which
version we have here in photos let's do
a real quick tour of the phone so you've
got your standard windows buttons here
you've got your back button your home
button and your being a search button on
the right-hand side a device you've got
volume up and down you got your power
unlock and dedicated camera button that
all windows phones have and I love that
there actually is a dedicated camera
button on the top there's a 3.5
millimeter headset jack under that door
is your SIM card and your external
storage on the bottom that's where you
are going to charge your phone it's
being flanked on the back and front by
some noise cancelling microphones and
that is it for the nokia lumia icon let
me go ahead and get the row a start up
here take a quick look at the phone
alright so we've got the icon all
powered up here and here is Windows
Phone 8 and all of its a live tile of
glory and awesomeness so a few
highlights we've covered Windows Phone 8
in pretty big detail you can of course
resize all those live tiles you can see
all the information at a glance and you
can customize the different colors what
you see here it does come with NFL built
right in so you can catch one your games
I know Verizon does a great job with
their mobile sports go ahead and see
what else we're going to have here all
the standard stuff some of the Bing
search a lot of the Nokia camera after
here which Nokia is really well-known
for the cameras are pretty much on the
some side I will go ahead and hit home
it's been a very quick first look at the
Nokia Lumia icon let me bring in some
comparison phones though so you can see
what it looks like size-wise here we've
got the Lumia 1020 I can see on the
front and certainly a difference on the
back with that PureView camera hump
right there we'll also bring in the
gigantic brother the Lumia lineup here
is the 1520 let's see what those two
look like on the back and if we trim
over to the front you can see what
difference there is on the front of the
screens again this is going to be
available on February 20th buy time you
watch this so maybe we'll be after
February 20th the launch price is 199 99
but of course you're gonna want to check
your carrier to see what it's going to
be and it's available for Verizon
Wireless those prices are always subject
to change one cool thing about this one
that I noticed usually on the back of
phones and get sort of FCC logos and
branding on the very bottom here though
it's actually on the bottom of the phone
each tin to the metal looks really cool
it makes the back of the phone look very
clean I know kid did a really nice job
my attention to details there industrial
design I think is among the best in the
industry so there's further proving that
here and I got to hope you enjoyed the
