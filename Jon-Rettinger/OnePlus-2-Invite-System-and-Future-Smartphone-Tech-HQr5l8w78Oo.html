to you by harry's what's going on
everyone back the episode of ask the
buffalo this is the show with in my butt
in the scout sometimes I got a dog right
here to answer your questions with phone
you should get what tablets you should
get what's coming catechins of all the
rumors you could ask me anything you
want let's jump right in first question
comes from ims to d1 at java for lakers
do i note or do I edge I'm gonna assume
you're talking about the galaxy s6 edge
because you can just meet in the middle
and get the note edge but I would say go
for the galaxy s6 edge got that new
Samsung build quality that you don't get
with the note line the one caveat though
if you need expandable storage then you
might want to go note I guess second
caveat if you also want a removable
battery then go Note edge but you don't
either those two then by all means go s6
edge want to share for review though on
all the devices will put put the link
down this region there's a question I'm
starting to get a lot it comes from Matt
hit 27 us at John for lakers you think
the oneplus 2 will sell on an
invite-only system in the beginning all
those an invite will get priority I know
everybody hated the invite system was
kind of necessary evil 0 for 1 plus
which is essentially just a start-up
they didn't have the cash just make a
ton of phones and chip mount and wait
those phones to sell to make their money
back they were essentially making phones
as those invites went out syre invite
correspondent to one phone the reasoning
goes though that they now have enough
capital reserve and went out actually
for additional funding be able to
release the 1+2 like any phone so if
you've been hiding after one plus one or
could get your invite for a while don't
worry you should be good to go now stuff
the questions real fast you looking at
me you can probably assume there are two
things i don't like putting on a nice
clothes and shaving my face and that's
where our friends at harry's come in the
folks at harry's offers super high
quality razors they cared so much about
the razor blades they just breaking went
out and bought the entire factory in
germany where these blades are made if
you want to get really good quality
razors you don't want to spend a ton of
money here is the place to go the
starter kit just fifteen bucks that
includes a razor three blades and your
choice of hairy shaved creamer foaming
gel i'm a jail man myself and as that
bonus you can get five dollars off your
first purchase when use code
technobuffalo when use our code you also
get in
months worth of shaving for just ten
bucks again that's co technobuffalo make
itself smooth or just shave like chin
straps that'd be cool or like a Tony
Stark beard are you kidding next one
comes from at B vivo share 1988 who
asked at John for lakers looking back
five years phones become a major player
in everyday life where do you see phones
in another five years what word for your
friend o convergence of already seen
phones go from phones to email devices
to texting to calendars are gonna see
the next thing of convergence I'm not
sure though what that's going to be
perhaps you'll see phone become your
computer and there'll be some sort of
dockable system i prophesy your phone
take your place of a tablet of one
device and screen can actually fold out
that would kind of be my way you're
gonna see new designs for phones they're
gonna serve lend themselves it's a brand
new types of convergence that's kind of
something i'm super excited about what
do you guys think what are you excited
about next five years what do you think
is coming I want to hear your thoughts
on it you guys for watching this short
episode of ask the Buffalo between you
and me nobody else watching don't you
three questions this week I'm sleep well
last night I struggle with insomnia
sometimes and it came back I slept for
like 14 minutes maybe 60 minutes and I
was watching the clock all night it's
tough if you shop with insomnia I filia
if you don't you're a stupid lucky
bastard head and I think you guys for
watching hope you enjoy it give the
video a thumbs up I appreciate the big
subscribe but with the latest sector of
Buffalo videos as they come to you to
the next time i'm jon rettinger so you
guys like video buh-bye Oh
