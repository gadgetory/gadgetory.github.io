here today we've got a bit of a samsung
family tree in one hand we've got the
new hotness to just announce samsung
galaxy s4 and the other i guess now
we've got its older brother i would say
this is the samsung galaxy s3 which
might be two guys has your head sale
they stack up so the big difference here
is obviously the screen samsung has
stepped up to a full 1080p display and
now things are five inches aesthetically
though there's not that much during your
Samsung sucker at the motto of an ain't
broke don't fix it got the home button
the same place the capacitive buttons
living in the exact same place as well
the volume rocker on the left and right
sides are pretty much exactly the same
to go ahead and put those side-by-side
see it moved up just a little bit here
on the s4 but not much and the power and
lock button exactly the same spot if we
go ahead and put them right on top of
each other you can see there's really
not that much of a difference here
certainly a little bit thinner and
lighter on the samsung galaxy s4 but you
still retain the removable battery and
expandable storage that folks tend to
love speed here depending on which
carrier which version you get Yuki to
get an octa core or quad core you can
certainly see the speed here yes three
was no speed slouch so nothing that
really you can tell difference a lot of
new features though are in the camera
you've got a ton of new features here in
the camera including dual view and the
eraser mode that's where the big
differences are certainly there are some
subtle nuance tweaks as well no black
bar living up there at the top the lock
screen has some cool new tweaks below if
you go ahead and touch that and put your
finger over it you can see it follows
you using that air gesture right there
which we don't have on of course the
galaxy s3 and you go ahead and unlock
the phone I'll we can go ahead and jump
right to that and of course air view is
one of the features we showed an
upcoming video if you go and put your
finger right over it'll sort of show you
very quickly what a message looks like
very neat overall so of course we do a
full comparison these two once you get
the galaxy s4 and techno before the last
one to you guys real quick comparison
about how these two phones stack up give
this video a thumbs up I leave your
comments down below let us know what you
think and of course will
give you the full comparison I'm John
render technobuffalo I'll see you next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
