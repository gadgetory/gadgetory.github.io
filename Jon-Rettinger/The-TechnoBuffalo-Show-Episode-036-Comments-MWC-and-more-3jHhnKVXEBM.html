TechnoBuffalo show I'm of your to house
for today Sean ani editor and chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody how are you doing today Todd
I'm good like I was just telling you
I've been getting some good sleep this
weekend sleep is always a good thing is
definitely a good thing so we got a
couple of topics we want to tackle this
week and the the first one we want to
talk about and we're going to try to be
nice about this is comments on the site
and the first thing I want to dress is
we we get a lot of people saying you
know you know it's getting too radical
in there you need to fight the trolls
the thing is we do fight the trolls the
we band them you know we block them via
IP address email address everything else
well the problem is the dedicated trolls
create another email address they rotate
their IP address and they come right
back yet and so we do attempt to fight
the trolls and you know short of
discontinuing comments which is not
something we want to do it's just
unfortunately an ongoing battle and as
I've described it previously in the
comments it's kind of like playing a
giant game of whack-a-mole because as
soon as we knock one down two more papa
so we are working on that the other
thing I wanted to address and this
relates directly to todd todd wrote an
article about you know why he is happy
to use apple products and their customer
service there were quite a few comments
and todd decided that he wanted to do an
article about addressing some of the
questions raised in those comments and
inevitably we have been accused let's
see Todd's been accused of holding apple
stock todd has been accused of taking
payments from Apple using better words
to describe apple products that may be
one of my all-time favorite comments
that someone actually implied that Todd
changes
verbiage we're talking about apple to
make them sound better folks I read
probably ninety five percent of what
Todd publishes his verbiage does not
change based on on what he he is writing
about so you know I just always want to
address this we do not in any way shape
or form take payment from a company like
Apple or Google we have done sponsored
posts those are always disclosed they
state very clearly this post was
sponsored by someone's up also never
from Apple anyway I i er Apple to
actually talk to us yeah that's another
thing everyone needs to realize Apple
really doesn't talk to the press you
know if Todd own stock ethically he
would have to disclose that legally he
would not because it's not referring to
apple stock but ethically he would have
to disclose that he does not own any
Apple stock no Todd why'd you say that
inside I don't know an apple stock hey
if he owned enough Apple stock he
probably wouldn't work here so yes the
sponsored posts are always disclosed at
all times and yeah we are never ever
ever sponsored by apple yeah I think
just to take away two is like I wrote
about my experience and I wanted
everybody to know you know about a good
experience i had and had it been any
other company i would have done the same
thing it happened to be apple and i
think our commenters you know as we've
talked about people love to you know
defend android and defend apple and i
think that's great i mean go at it I
think it's when they start going against
each other you know me I fine you know
tech me all you want but it's just like
you know do so professionally and have a
good argument then then we're all good
and I think you know that's that's what
was good though but there was great
discussion in that first post and that's
why I want to do a follow-up post like
sort of highlight some of the discussion
there are a lot of people made some
really good points about you know Apple
carries create in the United States but
when you leave you
States is not good this something i
didn't know because i haven't had any
experience with that so and uh i think
somebody worked for AT&amp;amp;T and said like
hey you can bring in your device get it
swapped out too so there was good
information there and i just wanted to
highlight that but of course you know
and i think we talked about this to a
little bit people are going to defend
their purchases in a way that makes you
know vindicates the purchase like sure
and i expect that you know like maybe
you bought a honda and you really love
honda and so you're going to say like if
somebody's going to shoot down honor
you'd be like no no I love Honda Lee how
dare you see that so I think feel like
that's a big part of it too yeah but see
that's something it's never me because i
believe i've talked about on the show
before when the blue were a HD DVD war
was going on i went HD DVD i I did my
homework I felt that was the superior
format that's what I purchased as you
could tell by walking to any store
looking at the five dollar blu-ray bed
and I obviously picked the wrong format
but at no time did I ever feel the need
to the little blue ray it was that was
my purchasing decision I that's what I
went with right yeah it's stung when it
lost but I was just like you know you
live and learn you move on yeah so I
just I've never understood why people
feel the need to be little or attack the
the format that they you know OS format
whatever that they aren't using fine
right you chose what works for you yeah
I just did it that there's been
something that's been always very lost
on me that I don't know why so anyway
yes we we are very aware of the problems
in the comments and you know as for
leaving comments we love engaging with
you all of you we encourage you to
engage with us and if we get something
wrong call us out on it all we ask is
call us out with a little bit of
professionalism yeah you know we
understand your all's not professionals
but there there's no need to
say that you know we're an idiot or you
know believe us our skin has gotten
thick enough that doesn't faze us and I
don't believe I've ever gone home crying
well right but for totally different
reasons anyway so moving on to our other
topic Mobile World Congress Todd you
leave yeah take a few early embryo yup I
leave on tuesday and i have meetings
leading up until the show which actually
kicks off on i think it officially kicks
off on the second but like all of
everybody's big events there on the
first so i want to say like HTC huawei
nokia you bring up the calendar samsung
obviously and then there's a pep calm
and stuff like that so 10 meetings in
between every one of them so it's it's
going to be a really busy first day even
before the show starts yeah and for the
first time ever we're sending it with
help yeah I'll have a videographer so
we'll have some great quality videos on
the YouTube channel yes Rock Run harita
is going over to Spain with Todd so big
help because otherwise you just see me
with my hands and the past I didn't have
the best camera so I I've done that like
once or twice you know i think was like
CES 2012 or something like that and i
was like I know so my my hat my tip of
my hat to you Todd hey I don't know how
you manage to do that for so long well
and actually we have a question from
Sasha Mahal about who will be at mw2
which we just answered taught in Iran
parita will be there mm-hmm this will be
how many mwc s for you oh boy four or
five yeah somewhere around there yeah
it's been quite a few third year with
technobuffalo going I don't know if I
think it's my fourth altogether
and we have another question from Sasha
bahal related to mobile world congress
in terms of scale how big is mwc to
compare to CES or Eva ah I think in
terms of actual like attendees I think
there's like 70,000 something like that
CES this year I think had like 93,000
but then I had you know like exhibitors
and stuff too and I don't know what if a
is but in terms of news coming out of it
Mobile World Congress is huge CES is
huge and Heath latifah this year was
surprisingly big so I don't know like in
terms of you know the amount of people
but what's being announced in terms of
being pressed their mobile world
congress and Aoife are becoming too huge
global shows yeah yeah definitely I what
about do you know anything on the square
footage I don't um it's really big why
don't you have these facts and figures
right at your fingertips done yeah well
they actually switch the conference
center two years ago in Barcelona from
one of the theaters to another one and
this one is a the old one used to be
like it was almost like city center area
and you'd walk in these huge big pillars
on either side of you and then there
would be like conference hall sort of
lining on both sides and then towards
the end and it was like an outdoor Hall
separating everything um obviously they
weren't boots and that's where now the
new one is very much more like CES like
you're indoors he walk from mike hall
one like Halle Berry back which show was
that you were at the head the putting
green that was Mobile World Congress
last year there's usually like a little
pudding area I'm sure it'll be there
maybe I should do something like that we
still don't know exactly why the putting
green exists but it's like they call
like a social area or something yeah
yeah so there actually is a little fake
grass putting green earth which is just
the bazaars thing I've ever heard about
at a trade show yeah the food in
Barcelona is amazing as you can expect
so that's what one of my I really look
forward to that part of a World Congress
yeah i am telling the
you're going to get to experience it you
get to go to all the great me because
you know you get to go to Germany you
get okay you know I'm in Missouri i'm
going to irvine next week yeah I'll over
there Orange County yep so uh which
actually has a really good barbecue spot
I've never figured that one out yeah we
went there last year great barbecue yeah
lucille's yeah I really enjoyed
lucille's BBQ but moving along here so
in this guy relates to mwc from sasha
baja what do you expect to see at mwc
besides the s-sex in the m9 well I think
we're going to see something from Nokia
the part of the company that Microsoft
didn't buy remember they bought the
devices and services and that's now
Microsoft's mobile team and then nokia
still existed and they launched the n1 i
think it was the android tablet they
have a press conference I think we might
see some news from them i don't know if
it's going to be device-related but
perhaps and then I also think we're
going to see some windows 10 stuff
windows 10 for phones but as we saw the
other day there's still the gdr2 update
coming for windows phone 8.1 so maybe
we'll see like new hardware that will
obviously work with windows 10 for
phones but maybe it has that gdr2 update
on it I don't know but I'm hoping
microsoft introduces some new you know
something to replace the 930 or 920 and
fifteen twenty ten twenty all the Lumias
that still have nokia branding stuff um
and then I think we're gonna see a lot
of probably a lot of wearables and stuff
like that from various companies but I
don't know you know blackberry has a
press conference maybe we'll see one of
their new phones a lot of it's sort of
you know a surprise until we get there
at six and M Niner one of the you know
two of the topics that have been teased
for a long time now so there's they seem
pretty definite you know galaxy s6 edge
2 I think and maybe they have nine plus
i don't know HEC just tease this morning
on twitter expect something huge and
that could just mean like oh it's a big
announcement but i don't know me
either and have their phablet to seems
early me yeah I don't know I i I'm
curious what the heck HTC meant by that
tease but I maybe they just think the m9
will be huge i right and also they're
wearable I think we'll see one from HTC
with their under armour partnership and
then samsung's new round Tizen
SmartWatch is supposed to be make an
appearance so here's a question related
to you travelling to all these countries
and I actually don't know the answer
does how many languages do you know Todd
that's from Brisbane Franco only one
unfortunately I wish I knew more and I
actually lived in Arizona and took
Spanish for years but I wouldn't say
that I'm fluent in it at all I i know
enough japanese to basically say excuse
me I'm a giant American and I'm in your
way yeah but my that order coffee and
food in all of these countries that's
not I actually I got one thing I did in
Japan was I started like on my third
trip I started carrying around a little
notebook with me and their restaurants
there will have like wax representations
of the food outside where they'll have
pictures so I'd look at that and see
what I liked and then I would just copy
the kanji exactly oh there you go and
then when they came to take my order I
would just show them that it worked
great that's a great idea yeah it worked
in the past I've used google translate a
lot to like I'm telling a taxi driver
where I have to go and we're lost in
translation somewhere you know you can
type it in in English it'll translate
and on everything's great so that that
was the other thing I did every time I
got there the when I would check in i
would get a business cards from the
front desk oh right yeah yeah and then i
could just hand them to the cab driver
but yeah yeah the of course now this was
back before camera phones were really
around so now you yeah i could just take
a picture of the food i wanted or
whatever right yeah but uh probably yeah
there's a part of me that wants to go
back to japan just to experience it now
with all the new techno
ecology well with google translate and
everything else I just it'd be a very
different experience I don't know if
loopers in japan i assume i don't know
but in germany it was just relaunched in
Berlin when i was there for evo which
was uh which was awesome to have uber I
mean yeah oh I use is hard to find cabs
I use the heck out of uber when I was in
Manchester this last trip yeah it just
launched her like eight months before
and uh made life so much easier yeah it
does especially when you're running from
press conference to press conference and
they're like on march first it's we're
not going to be at the conference center
it's sort of like Las Vegas when they
hold them all in different hotels so
going all over the city to try to get to
each one hun time yeah very useful yeah
exactly also from Brisbane Franco will t
be review the BQ and Bluetooth device I
never know if I'm pronouncing that
correctly to uh released last week for
low-end device it seems interesting has
the OS is novelty and we also consider
viewing the jolla phone although a bit
late to ask that now um where was then
boon to phone release in Europe but
they're doing the way they're doing it
is sort of like you can buy one if
you're following them on Twitter and you
see like where it's going to be
available for retail and stuff so it's
sort of like I think it's a flash sale
it's not like everybody can get it so
it's our I'm sure I we'd love to review
on I know we followed them for a long
time all the way through you know his
first demoed it early pep calms and show
stoppers and stuff up to this launch so
it's great to see it finally launch and
I'd love to try it out but um we don't
have a review on the weight right now
probably know we just simply don't have
a unit widely aveiro available yeah it's
kind of like someone's going to apply
the Puerto Rico bright / at some point
that's gonna be fun yes I Google's
modular phones yes we do plan on going
to Puerto Rico to get the our phone as
to this yes if we can get those funds
we'll gladly review them it's just a
matter of getting them that is
definitely always on our radar so before
we move on is there anything else you'd
like to say about mwc no um it's going
to be really busy we're going to have as
much news as we can put up on the site
so keep an eye out exact words ticket
get you everything exactly um so from
and this is a good question for Todd
because he is co spearheading this
project from Sasha Mahal what is the
main reasoning for starting a newsletter
for TechnoBuffalo yeah I think it's
something we've always talked about
doing for a long time but our
competitors are doing them the main
reason we thought it would be a fun way
to pick out some of the stories we like
so i curated it actually the first one
and moving forward it'll be you know
input from everybody but some of the
stories we think are the best ones on
the site that we think right readers
might have missed and so you can if you
want you sign up for the newsletter
right now it's going out wednesday at
ten a.m. in the morning hopefully we'll
schedule it so its local in the future
but really it's just about serving you
content we think you might have missed
and it covers all departments so you'll
get mobile gaming video news all kinds
of stuff so it's really just a fun thing
we hope our readers like and just for
clarification that's 10 a.m. eastern
time in the future we hope to make it 10
am-4 every tour ever you are yeah yeah
yeah so that that is coming down the
road um and then we've got a question
here from keegan anderson apple cart
rumors say it looks like a minivan has
Apple decided to accept that they aren't
completely baby I can't believe it would
actually be a minivan I feel like cuz i
saw you know like the leak like car it
was like an actual like chrysler minivan
I don't know maybe they have like a
shell that they're using on purpose or
who know if there's even a car I know
xge um sorry X GM CEO yesterday said
like Apple has no idea what they're
getting into like we're taking steel and
creating a car out of it like apples
never done that but you know today there
are all the reports that Apple's sort of
grab people from what GM and Ford and
Tesla to help build a car so I don't
know it again this is sort of like what
we talked about in last show it's like
this rumor has been going around for so
long that at this point it's like until
I see something like I just have a
really hard time believing it and maybe
like we said maybe apples experimenting
with it or maybe it's seeing what it can
do to improve you know technology for an
existing car maker so for example
yesterday that the GM CEO a former GM
CEO the guy who said Apple has no idea
what they're doing he said if I was
still at GM I give Apple full control
over the infotainment and all the
entertainment in my cars that's a pretty
good compliment and I think that maybe
you know maybe Apple is working on
something that that it could you know a
manufacturer could say here you guys
take full control of this part of the
car or maybe they're really building a
car yeah now as for the minivans we know
yes we've seen the pictures and even
some videos of them but my suspicion is
that is not the car I think that is
actually a street view and that's pure
speculation i think it's apple doing
their own Street View right yeah that
was the other thing yeah I i don't think
the minivan is the car but that being
said I I still not convinced they're
working on an actual honest-to-goodness
car but you know I guess we'll find out
some point or we may never find out i
mean you know we've brought this up
before you know we've heard about the
Apple TV now for years and even to the
point of people saying they've seen it
in jony ive's office and everything else
who knows you know I did that it could
be that this never comes out they could
be working on we never see it and I was
thinking yesterday to GM guy could have
been saying this because he doesn't want
Apple in this space so that's always a
possibility to shoot down the rival
before they even get it I mean I know
he's not technically in a space anymore
but he was right right right uh from taj
mahal what are your guys thoughts on
home
automation and what is stopping you from
making each of your home's smarter we've
actually I know I've uterus this before
on the show for me it's that there's
still too many platforms you know I
desperately want home automation I
actually am talking or not talking
thinking about buying a nest thermostat
because now it works with Dropcam and it
works with ooma telo both devices i
already have so if i buy the nest
thermostat then it becomes a hub for
those devices and that intrigues me I'd
like that idea and because nest is
making it somewhat of an open APK so
maybe you know but for right now for me
at least it's just a matter of there's
too many platforms and nobody seems to
be able to decide on one standard on one
yeah I actually um so what stops me as I
lived in an apartment and I don't own it
so I can't you know I'd love to put a
Bluetooth lock on my door and have all
kinds of fun stuff but I can't go
banging up the walls but i did my
father-in-law is beach house i did put a
nest in probably a month ago two months
ago super easy was really fun to do so
I'd say the only thing stopping me from
home automation is that I don't have a
home I'm in an apartment what I'd love
to do it and I guess I could do the
outlets you know the smart outlets and
stuff like that but it's a one-bedroom
apartment I mean I walking three feet to
my lamp is sort of just like I'll just
do it I'm not gonna buy it but I'd love
to you know if I had two stories and I
want with the lights on downstairs
that'd be great about to do from David
berkovich you should rename the podcast
show to the ton and Todd happy hour good
y el nene it would be a great name I own
maybe have some cocktails yeah that's a
coffee tales yeah exactly hits a high to
low go I don't know we're not sponsored
by start yes agent uh from Sasha Mahal
how about making Joey a substitute for
Todd when he's not here I the whole
problem with Joey and
it just get this out of the way because
I know we've had some skip weeks where
it seems like oh you can just drop Joe
Ian the problem is Joey and his team
have been up to their eyebrows and he in
games to Romania and you know that
that's something I know we we've
addressed this as well before the the
thing is go with the phone you're using
it in your everyday life with a game if
it's a 70-hour game that means Joey or
error Quran have to sit and stare at a
television hours and get through this
get through it so it's just simply been
a matter of unfortunately joey is
swamped now that being said there is no
show next week because i'll be in irvine
and Todd will already be in Spain and
it's always difficult for me to do a
show while i'm out in irvine the
following week i am talking to Joey he's
checking his game review schedule
hopefully in two weeks Joey will be on
the show if he's not I will get somebody
else I do not want to take two weeks off
again so no show next week i toid the
managing editor just I am me that's not
the only problem with Joey ah yes Joey
has a lot of problems but in the aspect
of being on the show so no matter what
there is no show next week but in two
weeks there will definitely be a show we
will figure that out the people I work
with from keegan anderson what are we
expecting from pebble i really want one
but the black and white screen is not
appealing even with the week long
battery life any plans to change that no
i don't know but i feel like they
wouldn't give that up they shouldn't
give that up because it's sort of like
why we recommend pebbles right now like
if you don't if you need a long battery
by pebble um yeah right but i hope they
do something with like color e-ink maybe
um and they also teased when they said
they're having they have new hardware
coming these tees the new software
platform too so maybe it's a little
smoother quicker and then they said they
had like new controls for the software
so presumably
different buttons or something like that
and I wouldn't be surprised but I'm not
positive I'm just guessing here if
pebble this time around release you know
like say it's like pebble two point oh I
don't know I'm just making it up say
it's pebble 2 point 0 and then like
pebble steel two point oh I think they
should do at the same time this this
time around policy definitely yeah I
definitely think they should come at the
same time yeah make buying decisions a
little easier from Dominique Webber and
this is an interest question how did
that partnership between TB and Volvo
come along the way any of these
partnerships be it you know sponsoring
videos or whatever you know either the
usually the company's reach out to us
and say hey are you doing anything
related to this event we tell them yes
they come to us with what they're
looking for and if it you know we do
turn down some sponsors we don't just
take every anything that comes along
it's not a sponsor though just our
coverage on them was just through an
agency that represents although reached
out for some of the broadcast work we do
10 didn't then they sponsor some of our
videos no thank you no back at sea yes I
mean not all though oh what's that okay
well no although it's just like any
other company just ya know that Todd's
trips were not sponsored no you know
yeah but it all right so speaking to
anyone that sponsors us that's how it
happens so but no I for some reason I
thought both of the sponsored seat I
don't want that I i can't remember last
win why we do with all a car company
coverage so like lexus honda I when we
review their stuff or write about it
I've tried to just sort of write my
articles are on volvo around experiences
with the cars because I'm not okay John
is you know they have nerve on they know
a lot more but although actually has an
office nearby me so it's easier for me
to grab the cars and play with them and
be with them so that's actually how it
work just kind of like local in New
Jersey yeah uh from Brisbane Franco with
all the new linux based mobile OS Tizen
sailfish and boom to Firefox
me hitting the market do you think
windows found and blackberry are still
able to maintain the third position now
yeah I think so simply because we won't
be lumping all those into the same name
yeah those are all going to compete
separately and they're right eat it eat
at each others chanted market share in
emerging markets which is where all of
those phones are targeted including
windows phone and blackberry especially
so right so yeah it's going to come out
to one winner I think windows phone is
probably going to try to take a lead in
those markets and I think it already
does a lot of areas so yeah hopefully
that's on track but who knows I mean I
like some of those operating systems
Ubuntu looks great Firefox is super low
cost but androids going there too with
Android one so i think that's that's the
thing is these guys are going to face
google's initiative which is android one
in these emerging markets with low-cost
Curie android devices so yeah pretty
tough yeah the charts unfortunately
aren't going to just say linings and
consider what is the the core of each of
those operating systems they're going to
be considered bison and firefox and so
on so yeah it won't be easy for it to
get into a third place spot yeah I mean
uh lease on the next ship so yeah uh
from Sasha Baja what are you guys
thoughts on the new viewmaster by Google
and Mattel will it be a gimmick or be
great nostalgia experience I think it's
giving it it seems silly I mean I get
the idea looks like augmented reality
and virtual reality for kids I don't
know what it costs it they didn't say I
don't think but to me I'm most impressed
by the gear if you are right now from
Samsung I feel like that's sort of a
real experience it's a neat this view
masters a neat little google cardboard
based thing but I think it's kids toy
speaking as someone who was way into
view master discs when he was like four
I like the nostalgia aspect of it but
hey you know kids have so many other
distractions these days mmm it's a cool
novelty but I don't see it doing much
yeah I feel like a kid these days can be
like where's my iPad exact I don't know
I need to play candy crush can this play
candy crush but going back to the
comments for just a sec second from
brazen Franco one really annoying thing
on the comments section is the flag
trolling and that we can't post pictures
and links unless you have super mod
powers okay the problem with the links
in the pictures is that those are in
all-or-nothing situation we can't turn
on links without turning on pictures the
the concern we have with the pictures is
while we have filters set up for certain
words we can't control what's in a
picture yeah so we're very very
concerned about exactly what would be in
those images and there's another layer
of moderating that we would have to add
we are looking at it we are actually
talking with discuss and seeing if there
isn't something else we can do but yes
we've heard all of you we know that you
want links and pictures but it's a yes
we could just walk over and flip a
switch but we also are discussing what
are the ramifications of flipping that
switch so that is why it's not happening
immediately uh let's see now very timely
here from william zing do you think Sony
is going to give up on the hardware
business since there are reports that
they are selling most of their hardware
divisions yeah it's interesting I mean I
guess if you look at it now what's doing
well for them has done what PlayStation
and some of their camera businesses and
then they're gonna I guess are looking
at getting rid of mobile and their TV
businesses which you know if it's not
making money and it hasn't been for a
while maybe it's time they do that and I
think they also said maybe audio right
which is interesting so it would be I
saw i was talking to Roy about this
yesterday and where we was actually on
CNBC
I think yesterday right talking about
this very topic and it's only no longer
a hardware company and I saw some
headlines its it said the same thing I
think you know yes and no play station
is still very much hardware right but if
it's Roy said Bolden it's also sort of
like an entertainment hub and once you
own one maybe you're not buying it that
frequently it's not like you're still
you know buying a sony phone than a TV
and a playstation that that's
electronics company so i don't know it's
weird maybe they are sort of really
exiting the hardware business if you
think about it that in that aspect and
focusing on playstation seems like a
good idea I mean you get sales on the
unit itself and then obviously on the
games and everything through PlayStation
Plus and everything yeah I don't know I
I understand why they exited the pc
business but I any readers yeah well any
readers but I don't know I I'm concerned
about Sony Sonny's got a lot of issues
right now so we'll we'll see where it
goes I mean I'm an old-school sony e oh
I had an original well not original
original but very early Sony Walkman and
all that I've always had a deep
affection for somebody but I don't know
we'll see how they come out of this I I
have faith that they can restructure
this mm-hmm but we shall see from
Dominique Weber how happy are you about
Wi-Fi routers like arrow that set out to
make setting up router is easier you
said I haven't used it either you know
the thing is that's one of those
situations where I've never found
setting up routers to be difficult yeah
that being said I know if I told my
father to set up wherever he'd look at
me ago that's not as gonna say easier
the better you know it's a company that
if you know maybe somebody will pick by
Euro and build that technology and their
own stuff and make it easier but it's
exactly what I was talking about with
you I think on an earlier episode when I
went down to set up that nest that we
were talking about the smart home it
won't connect to a certain router with
optimum online because optimum controls
all of the router settings which is
ridiculous I've never
this before New York I do i hear a loud
I do I'm fired your router and all this
stuff but if this gyro thing you know
can make it easy so that people can buy
an S and not worry about configuring the
router or if it works or not then that's
great so not only just setting it up but
then also using the router to power
other things in your house in this case
an ester whatever it is you want yeah I
think it's a great idea no definitely if
it helps people out from Britain Franco
with a raspberry pi in a little
knowledge and see and hobby level
electronics you can have home automation
now yeah yeah that's not me I I don't
know NEC took c plus plus for several
years but i don't probably don't
remember any of it yeah exactly exactly
I and one last question here from Jordan
Becker your opinion on the Nexus 6 we
get this one a lot yeah I love it it's
expensive but I love it it's crazy yeah
yep well I believe that is going to do
it for this week as always we appreciate

Irvine and top will be in Spain and the
week after that it will be me for sure
