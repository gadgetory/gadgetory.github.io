to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
and welcome back their pursuit of
renter's risk to show her and just talk
about anything technology related and
sometimes we not technology related
that's going on in my mind this week
though I'm going to go from just being
John the tech reviewer you can call me
today John Adamas I'm gonna give some
predictions for CES 2015 so for those of
you that might not be familiar with CES
it stands for consumer electronics show
CES and it is the largest gathering of
consumer electronics vendors and media
and enthusiasts of the industry in the
US every year now the show is waned in
recent years used to be where huge
products were announced Microsoft gave
keynotes and it just was a giant
extravaganza geeky awesomeness that is
sort of Peter down a little bit
companies reporting to have their own
keynotes at different times to announce
their products which I guess you think
about it makes sense you host a big
keynote at CES on Tuesday someone else
has a big announcement on Wednesday and
you've already lost all of your steam so
I can understand that but we are seeing
it CES there's the unveiling of new
technologies that maybe aren't
necessarily new products but serve new
ideas and new things are going to
incorporate themselves into products
over the coming year so i present to you
dear viewer and reader my predictions
for CES 2015 I think 4k certainly going
to be everywhere but that is yesterday's
news I think we're going to see is more
creative use of OLED technology a few
guys are wondering what oulad stands for
it stands for organic light-emitting
diode which is just nerd talk for the
pixels on the screen essentially emit
their own light so not to have any
backlighting or side letting you have
with current LEDs it means pictures
generally look a lot better blacks look
a lot black or the little less washed
out current LED TVs already look awesome
I think we're going to see sort of more
curves that serve we saw last year at
CES a first round of curved TVs are
going to see more mass market curve
displays at lower prices we're also
going to see
thinner and thinner bezels almost to the
point where bezels don't exist a sharp
for the past few years has shown bezel
list panels and I mean like beds olas
there isn't even a little bit of a line
on the side I think we're going to start
see that bezel is technology make its
way it gets from a product which is
absolutely freaking awesome and
ridiculous to see in a real life I
mentioned 4k was so last year the year
before you before that 8k which is crazy
we've already seen it sort of on one or
two things last year it's gonna be
making more of a prominent showing at
CES not as a consumer product like hey
you've got 4k TV you bought this year
it's outdated because now we're going to
double the K is more of a proof of
concept that it can be made if consumers
wanted it can be mass marketed although
I I've seen AK I've even seen 16 k and I
don't see much of a difference but hey I
think it's going to be there I'm
speaking of bezel asst I think we're
going to see new smaller bezel as
platforms it'll be used for next
generation of tablets and smartphones we
saw things like the LG g3 with super
tiny thin bezels sharp had their akko's
phone which had almost no bezel on it at
all which is kind of a crazy thing to
even see I think that's going to start
filtering its way down to consumer
products I would wager we start seeing
that towards the middle to end of 2015
as new flagship phones start to be
really so look for that as well okay
also maybe see the first round of
Snapdragon 810 products are to filter
their way out that beastly processor
Qualcomm has been showing on some
reference devices inc we'll see it
filtered swaying to some consumer
products we might actually see those
products we might actually at CES and i
look for folks like Samsung HTC and LG
to be the ones that are making those
announcements speaking of smartphones
whether you want them or not I think
we're going to start seeing 4k displays
on smartphones which for me seems
absolutely asinine and ridiculous but
you know there's a spot to be spec work
for something I don't know if we're ever
going to see those mass-marketed I think
battery technology is not nearly where
needs to be yet which we'll talk about
in just a second but those are coming to
K on smartphones 2014 I think double the
amount of K is going to be a big push
for 2015 all inclined to think it's
going to
oh the way of 3d smartphones and last a
year and then just people aren't kind of
care that much about it because the
screens that big unless you're looking
at a 4k image on there you're not going
to notice a difference because I know
you guys are super excited let me stop

TechnoBuffalo again that's ly ND a comm
check in buffalo back to the predictions
and i think finally we're going to see
improvements in battery technology my
fingers are crossed there's going to be
a new tech that's going to increase
battery life lithium-air something
that'll make its way into smartphones
more realistically I think we'll see new
charging technologies I've already seen
quick charge turbocharger if you want to
call it a way to juice up your phone
much much faster and go see the
evolution of that you know getting 80 to
a ninety percent in the 10 to 15-minute
window new wireless charging maybe we'll
finally get almost some sort of standard
for wireless charging there's been so
many different variants out there what I
would like to see is whether it's gian a
boulder another wireless standard
enabled surfaces so you don't have to
have a wire plug in to a charging pad
you can just put your phone on a table
and let it charge and that would be
pretty cool there's been talk of some
charging over the air to or as long as
you're in a certain area and got your
phone with you it'll start to charge
that's coming too but that creeps me out
way more than spring up on that table I
don't want that run through my body but
I that that's just me not necessarily on
a smartphone side but peripheral e
related I think we're going to see the
next evolution of the connected home
that sort of been a big push of the past
few years and we're going to see the
next line of products for that so I'm
not talking like light bulbs that we've
seen or even thermostats or even smart
locks which are kind of new over the
past 12 to 16 months we're going to
start seeing smart appliances move
beyond just refrigerator i'm talking
like your blender your coffee makers and
things like that that can all be
controlled from a central hub presumably
which will interact with your phone
or tablet and last but definitely not
least the automotive world in consumer
electronics have been coming just like
this over the past few years and cars
are making a bigger presence at these
type of shows and we're going to see the
next stage in autonomous driving last
year audi was showing a car that could
park itself and could drive up and pick
you up this year rumors are BMWs gonna
be showing that technology a day's going
to be showing how that technology has
improved Cadillac and GM particular has
been saying there's no the technology
actually in cars by 2017 think we're
going to see that make a big big big
play at this year's CES so a lot of
topics are going to be at CES 2015
that's coming up and very early January
and of course technobuffalo will be
there and full force to cover it what
thing do you like to state the show what
things you want to make sure we cover if
any my prick shins come true and I think
a lot of them will these aren't like
far-fetched crazy predictions is just
sort of based on industry knowledge and
things that I've heard and rumored over
the past few months that you guys for
