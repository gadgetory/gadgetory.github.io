technobuffalo here and today is a hat
day which for those either watch these
videos know that means I did not feel
like combing my hair today so that
happened we had a lot of stuff happen in
the wide wide wide world of technology
but there's one thing in particular that
i want to show you in this video first
we run through some of the content that
we had ditched that feature phone for
cash at t-mobile awesome nokia n9
appeared the teaser video new Dead
Island trailer sets the mood but what
I'm really want to show you guys is
their third installment in our new
infographic series we have done one on
the new imac launches we did one on the
Samsung Infuse 4G that 4.5 inch a sort
of 4G phone that 18 Keys got out now
we've got one for the iphone 5 for the
iphone 4s depending on who you ask we
took all the rumors that have been
circulating put together what we imagine
the iPhone 5 is going to look like this
is nothing from Apple it's just based on
rumors and speculations we wanted to
have some fun with all the information
that's coming out there so you can see
what it looks like here it's got that
four-inch almost edge-to-edge display we
can talk a little bit about the design
talking a little further about that
display the a5 processor thinner design
and go ahead and read all this links to
this is going to be down below and of
course you can check it out on technical
Buffalo talk a bit about that camera
supposedly it's going to be produced by
Sony full 1080p video capture and again
this is just speculation I wanted to
make it look like it was sort of an
apple ask site iOS 5 talking a bit more
about what we expect and what we'd like
it to see release information expecting
the September timeframe can see made a
box here for even what the iPhone 5 is
going to look like the awesome John
quach went ahead and did this really
really stellar a graphic work for us and
this is where things kind of get cool so
we're putting some rumors of a all
aluminum back and see what that would
look like some redesign buttons you can
see the front of it here you can go
through and play with all these designs
he would look like in white the front of
it there it isn't white some other
profile views
the back of it and there's sort of a lot
of cool stuff to go through and see this
definitely go ahead and check it out the
iphone 5 the iphone 4s whatever Apple
decides to call it when we finally see
it probably in that September time frame

further define the site so your feedback
