technobuffalo too sad day I don't even
know you know the the announcement today
HP's conference call couple hours before
the conference call their their earnings
call have a routine thing in the
business world earnings call till I tell
people how you did last quarter and a
couple hours before it story started to
break there's a press release and stuff
that I HP was killing off the webos
hardware business and so they had the
conference call and all that stuff when
you're talking about all day and John
said to me hey man why don't you do a
video why don't you do a I think John
used the word rant he likes the word
rant to a rant video it's like in
expressing my feelings video it's like a
eulogy because I'm not that long ago I
wrote a letter on the website an open
letter to HP begging them pleading with
them to do the right thing do something
with webos get those get they get the
flagship phones out make them work right
you know was back in 90 is it februari i
guess a while ago back in verse don't
let you think about the good old days
wasn't that long ago look at look at how
sad this is there's not even so you had
a phone in here i was going to do a
whole gimmick where I took my palm phone
you know I webos phone and I was trying
to call HP it was going to be like hi HP
can I talk to the webos division please
no there's nobody there why cuz you
killed it but I couldn't even do that
because I can't even find the phone yeah
this box depressing so it wasn't that
long ago John and I headed out to Fort
Mason pavilion in San Francisco for the
big HP webos event and they showed the
touchpad and they showed the pre three
and the veer and you know it was
exciting they promised to get products
out faster and the touchpad looked
phenomenal and you know they did the
thing where they took the pre three and
they clinked it against the touchpad
screen and
transfer the webpage all that stuff and
everybody was excited and now it's what
it's not even a year later 49 days since
the touch pad was launched and it's dead
that a day short of the record i think
it was Michael Gartenberg was treating a
day short of the record helped bike in
the shortest lifespan of a mobile
product in the modern era but I don't
know man I'm you know I'm more sad I
guess Mike Pearlman was right with his
headline webos croaks Noah Kravitz cries
I'm sad about this because I really
could that you know that they're there
are a couple reasons why first of all I
guess this war turns into a rant first
of all webos is great the the palm or
the HP products rather buggy you know
touchpad buggy pre three never even came
out I guess it launched very quietly in
Europe maybe I mean they said on the
call they're going to be it'll be
shutting down q4 of this year i think
the hardware division so like what does
that mean they're going to ship more
they're going to ship the pre three in
America who's going to buy it the pre
three never came out and all that but
still webos just a great operating
system and an on touchpad it looked you
know like it just there look like
potential even though it's buggy when it
came out even though I personally am not
all that high on tablets there's
potential to do it a little bit
differently you know and in a very
elegant stylish way and I've always
thought the webos was sort of my
favorite parts of iOS my favorite parts
of Android kind of matched together but
with its own unique you know unique
visual thing happening the notification
system is excellent but the the
operating system is clean and that just
the design of it is a little more I
don't know it speaks me a little more
than an android does but does more kind
of under the hood stuff than iOS does or
you know more advanced with the
notifications and multitasking
everything anyway it so it's sad to me
because you know just so great and now
they're shutting down the hardware
business the software business isn't
dead don't know exactly is going to
happen with them and
I'll talk about that in a second second
thing is just that you know this was
what everybody was afraid of when it was
announced that HP was buying webOS and
this could go one of two ways this could
go the good way where you know palm
didn't really have the money then have
the resources on their own when they
made their first come back to really do
enough you know that the hardware
manufacturing and quality control and
distribution channels and they didn't
have the muscle to probably negotiate
better deals and I still think that you
know that original deal to go with
sprint as the no disrespect to sprint
but but that was just it was bad bang
from the start to have sprint be the
exclusive distributor of the pre their
their reach just isn't big enough and so
you thought wow now they're getting the
chance with webos and the palm people
and everything they're getting a chance
with a company that's big that knows how
to make hardware that knows how to
distribute that knows how to do a lot
stuff and then this could be great they
can finally have the muscle they need or
this could go the other way which is HP
and palm seriously how's that going to
work palms all like the pre and design
and this future looking software and
stuff and big disruptive and that's not
what HP is about and this could just
turn out badly and it's turned out badly
you know is a 1.2 billion dollar mistake
in essence the other news you know come
out of this this this call these
announcements today is that HP is either
going to spin off or probably probably
spin off but possibly sell their
consumer PC business they're all about
the enterprise now so I don't know you
know maybe that's why I that's why beats
decided to go with HTC maybe they knew
this was coming because the whole thing
with beats audio and HP computers and
all that who knows but anyway so just
kind of sad from that standpoint that
another case of a giant company
swallowing a smaller more kind of fast
moving or innovative or disruptive tech
company and it's just not working out
which is too bad so that's a bummer
bummed out
you know and then there's the mobile the
mobile scene and you know let's face it
every tablet maker not named Apple has I
don't want to say you can't say failed
you can say everyone's failed but they
have not performed as well as they would
have hoped to this point in time there's
no but a Paloma nating the tablet market
I'm not saying the best or the worst or
and I'm not having judgment I'm just
saying you look at sheer volume and ipad
ipad 2 just killing it compared to
everybody else you know and touchpad
this this report came out earlier this
week just yesterday i guess the best buy
had they wanted to send a bunch of touch
pads back because they'd ordered like
two hundred and seventy five thousand of
them or something 270,000 and sold not
even 25,000 not even ten percent and
just kind of shows you the tablet market
metallurgist rim way out in front and in
the smartphone market you know with
everything that's happened this year to
nokia and rim and Windows Phone 7 I
think being really interesting and
innovative but not you know not it
didn't fly out of the gate we'll see
what happens this fall with Nokia on
board of the partner and and the mango
update finally coming but really at this
point you know it's a two-way race
blackberry still is a huge market share
obviously nokia huge you know in the
lower end market but in the high-end
smartphone market it's a two horse race
right now between apple and android and
blackberry you know hopefully getting
their thing back together we'll see and
i just hate to see a player with a lot
of potential with a good product or at
least good software i hate to see that
player drop out of the race now
hopefully webos will wind up being
licensed or i think more likely bought
by somebody else but it might even it
might be too late you know no matter
what so it's sad for me from that
standpoint from somebody who's an
enthusiast a fan of mobile technology
and also professionally been covering
this stuff for so long because
competition you know breeds innovation
and ideally just brings better and
better stuff to consumers into the world
at law
large and you know losing losing losing
a player losing a good player or player
with talent and potential is a sad thing
all that being said what's next i'm
sorry from kind of low energy here just
won't talk about this tomorrow what kind
of bummed out by i drink an espresso
right before this to fire myself up but
just it's it's sad man i'm sad Mike was
right you know the tears I can feel them
you can't see him I can feel in the
inside so um so what does this mean
let's get let's pick this thing back up
I'm gonna I'm gonna carry this around I
want to use this for something I fit my
iphone in it carry my iphone in this
palm case just uh I don't know just cuz
now I won't even fit it's too big the
way you carry something I use this in my
wallet or something for a little while
so what does this mean what happens now
webos I would love to see HTC by webos I
don't think it's going to happen but
it's an interesting time earlier this
week Google buying motorola assuming
that deal gets approved that's going to
shake things up in android land no
matter what google says about continuing
to you know android being open and
continuing to work with their different
partners and no matter what the htc's
and samsung's of the world said earlier
this week in the form of very short very
dry very similar sound and can quotes
there's no getting around the fact that
if google owns motorola Motorola's can
have a big leg up in terms of android
development in the coming years and i
wouldn't be surprised at some point I
don't know that Android will ever
officially go down to just a one vendor
system that motor will be the only
android vendor but I would not be
surprised as we get into 2012 to see the
higher end android devices coming first
from motorola so what are these other
companies do Samsung HTC already
invested at least a little bit in
Windows Phone 7 Samsung has also got
their bada operating system you know not
not for the Americas but they've got
that going on as well so they have a lot
of experience obviously it's a huge
company but they've got a lot of
experience even just Samsung
well in software development they've got
their whole TouchWiz system for the
tablets and the phones we've got their
whole bottle thing they've got you know
Samsung App Store and now the media hub
stuff where you can rent buy music and
movies and all that stuff HTC very
similar thing they don't have their own
OS but sense is pretty extensive at this
point and they also have been making
some some purchases lately obviously
Beats Audio they've been doing stuff
with onlive some other you know software
services companies they have their own
thing going now with you know buying and
renting movies and all that sort of
stuff so they have to be sort of
wondering both of these companies but I
think HTC in particular has to really be
wondering do we make a move do we need
to have our own operating system do we
pull back from Android do we put more
into Windows Phone 7 I don't even know
something like sense is going to be you
know allowed by Microsoft level and a
viable move a differentiator so what do
they do here and I don't know I don't
know that you know HTC isn't going to if
they bought webOS if they were able to
buy worthless that's even on the table
there I'm going to take it and like all
the sudden overnight start cranking out
web OS smartphones is not that easy but
they they're just they're uniquely
positioned very popular they've been
profitable lately and they've been
killing it lately they make really good
hardware and they know how to develop
software and they even now have shown
some chops over you know the past six
months to a year in particular and
knowing how to brand and market
themselves Samsung obviously you know
similar thing but i can see HTC you know
really wondering is this a chance to and
who knows what they've got in the works
who knows what they've gotten the HTC
skunk work labs skunkworks labs and if
they've been you know they've been
working on a full-fledged operating
system because they've been doing since
long before android you know you go back
into the days when i when i used to do
this for that other company and i
remember those those first HTC Sense
phones you know they've been building
phones for a long time and programming
software for a long time so they may
have their own operating system or
pieces of it in the works already but if
they own an operating system and they
didn't have to rely
on google or microsoft for that matter
or they could just pull back and they
could keep manufacturing phones for
those companies is a straight OEM but
then also have their own IP that they
could just do with what they wanted and
never have to worry about are we going
to get the support from google that we
really need to stay competitive we gonna
get from Microsoft or as Microsoft going
to give it to nokia first is google
going to give it to motorola first or
for that matter you know is microsoft
now feeling like with whole stuffs gone
this week filming wow we need to make
our own hardware and house we got to
either you know firm things up the nokia
thing goes deeper or look at doing
something with rim or who knows what
really interesting time you know we
people always joke or not joke it used
to be that summer was the dead time the
quiet time in consumer tech in a mobile
especially august quiet month not
anymore man this week is just been crazy
you know r.i.p palm and I guess our IP
the touchpad and the pre and the veer
and all that stuff again it'll be
interesting to see what happens I mean
just a week ago you know I was getting
PR emails from from age PSP are people
saying stay tuned 33 can't wait coming
soon so the rug has been pulled out from
a lot of people today a lot of people
you know looking for new jobs you're
thinking about new jobs a lot of people
thinking about you know switching from
web was to a different platform and then
a lot of people wondering what's going
to come next house it's going to shake
up the industry I don't know I do think
we'll wind up seeing something done with
webos HP spent too much money to just
write this whole billion-plus dollar
acquisition off that quickly but what
happens with it remains to be seen it'll
be interesting but I for one would love
to see a company like HTC pick it up I
think they're well suited stay tuned
whatever happens we'll cover it and you
know I'll find something else to get
fired up about but right now where's my
I'm a little sad I don't want to carry
this thing around and no
you used to shine my head that said
we're giving a bunch of stuff away so I
there's good news there's bright skies
we're giving a bunch of stuff away on
the site starting depending on when
you're watching this starting tomorrow

much more coverage of everything the
phones the news the rumors all that
stuff on TechnoBuffalo calm and John's
headed over to Germany soon to cover IFA
that's going to be awesome so palm webos
we hardly knew you palm we knew for a
long long time I remember when I got a
palm 7 review unit way back in the day
palm 7 Palm Pilot this is one that had
to flip up antenna that thing was not
good-looking but I was working at calm
New York at the time and we were renting
an office to LA like ridiculous fancy
waste money custom office was finished
being built out and we wound up having
to work from home for a couple weeks
because the lease was up in the first
place but the new place wasn't ready and
so I was able to finagle a palm 7 review
unit because I was writing for this
little website called powerbook Central
and I remember walking around the
streets of Manhattan with this thing
being like oh man I could work from
anywhere so I've got this wireless thing
I couldn't really get much done with it
but it's still kind of cool so soft spot
in my heart for palm for webos obviously
we miss you but whatever's next we'll be
there see you next time everybody
