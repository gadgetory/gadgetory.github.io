here today February 15th Steve Ballmer
and associates took the center stage at
Mobile World Conference in Barcelona
Spain and unveiled to the world the next
version of Windows Mobile which is
officially being called Windows Phone 7
Series get used to that name you're
gonna be hearing it quite a bit it's a
little bit long Windows Phone 7 Series
is the name of Microsoft's next mobile
operating system see me look guys I got
some notes in front of me the conference
just ended let's go over some of the
recaps first and foremost this is not a
update to the 6.5 or a windows mobile
6.1 Windows Phone series that you've
seen this is a complete recode rework
from the ground up we've seen for a very
similar-looking Windows Mobile since all
the Pocket PC days of years past and
then we had Windows Mobile 5 Windows
Mobile 6 they all look relatively
similar this day complete utter rework
with a entirely new design and user
interface so first we've got xbox live
and doing integration yeah which is
quite nice they're all sort of done with
these new tile interface and they're
calling these live tiles or smart tiles
essentially what they are are little
widgets that update in real time so you
can have tiles for Facebook updates you
could have tiles for email it's sort of
these new way that interact with the
phone these are those tiles are
customizable that you can scroll
vertically you can add as many as you'd
like you can add tiles for your friends
and family let's say you've got a girl
friends on Facebook that you have our
own tile and actually updates your
Facebook profile the tile picture is
going to change you'll see some images
and I'll put them up as I'm talking
about what the home screen looks like to
get a sense of what it's going to be to
interact with the device it's really got
a lot of social networking integration
built into this tile interface so I'm a
bit skeptical as to how much information
you can actually get on what home tree
they're gonna be a lot of vertical
scrolling which you know may be good or
bad depending on what you think but
you'll be doing that vertical scrolling
on a capacitive multi-touch enabled
screen natively which should be a big
plus
for Windows Mobile fans the past gone
will be the resistive sort of squishy
touch screens so you can throw those
extra style asses out then that'll be
rockin and capacitive screen like the
iPhone and Android and even blackberry
community has for some time so let's
talk a little bit more about these tiles
like I mentioned they're sort of
stand-alone widgets that will update in
real time obviously the and internet
connection and they'll always be able to
give you information as it's coming
through so your email updates your
Facebook will update Twitter and this
sort of brings all these things together
all the emails and all the contact lists
that you get from you know work email
your corporate email personal and all
your social networking think of it
similar to pumps energy on webOS that's
also present throughout the new Windows
Phone 7 Series if you've seen what the
Zune HD interface looks like that's very
similar to what the menu system of
Windows Phone 7 series is going to look
like which I was a big fan of I really
liked the Zune HD interface it is very
smooth list-based and it worked very
well and I think we're gonna see sort of
that same working very well into Windows
Mobile Windows Phone 7 Series
No More Start menu no more sort of lists
that you saw on the home screen we're
just a bit of icons you're not going to
get a very immersive interactive
environment of which is quite nice
Microsoft's is also going to put a much
tighter control over the hardware and
software so they're going to be minimum
requirements that each vendor is going
to have to meet in order to run the new
operating systems you're going to see a
certain level of performance amongst all
the films to be quite nice on the
downside if you're a fan of touchflo 3d
or TouchWiz or any other user interface
that has been put on top of Windows
Mobile in the past you'd be disappointed
because Microsoft is going to be no
longer allowing custom skins on the UI
so depending what you think about the
opportunity system that's either good or
a bad thing sort of on the positive end
you're gonna always get this in
experience from phone to phone certainly
this work back to my very mother now
it's got a QWERTY keyboard of let's go
keyboard or whatever it might be the
experience is going to be
similar which I think people may may
like this is another cool integration
they have you can have all your photos
from the web and on your device or to
come into one heart getting back to this
sort of palm sandy type thing it's
everything Microsoft kept saying your
whole life on your phones everything
that you do online in the digital world
sort of be integrated right into your
phone sort of nice looking package
you're going to sync over Wi-Fi which is
another sort of cool feature there's
also sort of probably most importantly a
completely new browser a new version of
Internet Explorer or mobile Internet
Explorer as based off the desktop
version which is multi-touch enable the
funny looks like Microsoft has built a
very capable browser when I can compete
with the iPhone and the androids of the
world they showed it off in a few videos
and it looked to be very very nice
there's no mention of Flash support
although it will not be supported for
some time but Adobe and Microsoft as
both said the flash will come to Windows
Phone 7 Series so overall it looks to be
a complete and radical departure from
Windows Mobile the past I think it's a
very bold move by Microsoft primarily
Windows Mobile had been geared at
professional so it was aimed at sort of
the enterprise crowd I think Microsoft
perhaps realize that that crowd was
being diluted by a ton of different
operating systems and decided to put
together package that was more broad
reaching the new OS is certainly not
geared just at the professionals it's
routed everybody sort of taking aim and
again at Android iPhone and even you can
blackberry with some other email
integration it looks to be a very nice
package it doesn't look like anything
you'd expect from Microsoft with
anything to expect from Microsoft from
years past it looks to be a very
complete feature-rich operating system
which certainly will have years and
years of support as a very least a
fantastic departure from the antiquated
six-point-five architecture that we've
seen in the past which was based on
their 5.0 architecture which is based on
Pocket PC it's really stayed the same
taken Microsoft a bit of time to get to
this point certainly we're three years
past introduction of the iPhone or a
couple years into Android and sort of
many many years into blackberry and we
hadn't seen any drastic change to
mobile until this point so it's gonna be
a brave new world out there for the
smartphone loving crowd around the
holidays of this year we should start
seeing the first phones rule out prices
and carriers obviously nobody knows
quite yet so what do you guys think
about Windows Phone 7 series it's quite
a lot to say it looks to be a pretty
decent operating system know what I'm
looking forward to playing with so what
are your thoughts you to pick up a
device you excited about are you gonna
wait for a new phone or do you have
absolutely zero interest maybe you fall
somewhere in between kind of curious
what you have to say anyway I'm John
rende you're from TechnoBuffalo for all
your Windows Phone 7 Series a picture
check out the channel and TechnoBuffalo
comm I'll see you guys in the next video
