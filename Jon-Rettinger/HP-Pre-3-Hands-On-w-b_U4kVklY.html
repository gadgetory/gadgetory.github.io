HP representative is going to give us a
quick tour of the OS and the device
itself don't mind starting with a recap
of the specs yeah absolutely so this is
the HP 33 it is a our newest generation
of the Creed line that is targeted at
the kind of customer that wants it all
and that is they're managing both their
business and their professional life
it's got a blazing fast 1.4 gigahertz
the latest generation of the Qualcomm
processor the 8x five five series
processor and so it's got a lot of speed
as well and so in addition to they you
know sort of beautiful display that
allows you to have a lot great
experience for web browsing and video
playback what kind of display we're
looking at a 10 to 3.7 inches this is a
three point six inch capacitive display
with a wvga resolution and so it's a
great display for for seeing all kinds
of media content but we also have the
nice slide out keyboard here which is
the largest keyboard that we've ever put
on a web waste product so it's a
fantastic keyboard for business emails
to be able to you know manage all your
professional content as well ok
connector be cute yeah
it feels the world's better than the the
pre the keys are much larger is there
any sort of on-screen keyboard option as
well in this no this is for just the
physical keyboard on this device you
mine walk you through the device itself
as far as a mountain standpoint in the
rabbit anyway it's got a great finish
here in terms of a soft test finish the
video camera we've also improved as well
so this is a 5 megapixel autofocus
camera with with the flash for business
customers we've also incorporated a dual
microphone so it's a great phone and
it's a great speaker phone as well so
this is really meant to be kind of a
portable office and the camera can
record HD video that's right absolutely
so for those for those great moments
that you want to capture it captures HD
7720 p video ok and on the other sides
of the vices you've got so here we have
the three-and-a-half millimeter headset
jack the standards ringer switch that's
popular in all of our all of our devices
power here on the side and then the
microUSB for both charging and for data
access on the media party
and any word on on battery or what sort
of a million power it's going to be
shipboard the battery life is expected
to be on the order of what we have on
our current devices with the
improvements in the efficiencies of the
process okay and so in that general
range we've also incorporated the
touchstone technology in the 33 as well
90 way a seismic karishma device people
might be familiar with of saying it
possible to get to see the screen size
here and see what it looks like from a
thickness standpoint as well they turn
on the side it's a very thin for having
a full qwerty keyboard absolutely we
wanted to have it I'd have a special no
no no products with the particular great
the screen is of very bright when you
look so much higher resolution in the
current model out there anything else
you'd like people know about the pre
three the main thing about this device
is it's really meant for that you know
customer that's a that wants at all they
want a great screen great resolution
rate you know kind of productivity as
well as managing their business expo
except early and this is being called
the HP 33 no more plum brandy HP 333
