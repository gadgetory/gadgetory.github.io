to you by Linda calm how not to make
your xbox one backwards compatible a new
destiny trailer and an ebay buyer buys a
picture of an Xbox one what a loser
let's get out of controller hello and
welcome now to controller the weekly
TechnoBuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
release isn't an easy to digest capsule
form at i'm your host Ashley skele it's
always a big week in gaming so let's
start out with the news oh boy you guys
this is a pretty important story
Microsoft's Major Nelson took to the
Internet last week with a very urgent
public service announcement that image
that some of you may have seen online
you know the one showing you how to
quote make your xbox one backwards
compatible yeah it actually just
probably bricks your brand new console
the prank started making internet rounds
after some users found that dev kit mode
was curiously available on every Xbox
one and some jerks decided to capitalize
on the backwards compatibility
complaints gamers have made regarding
next-gen consoles guys don't get tricked
also maybe don't use dev kit if you have
no idea what you're doing if you've been
salivating over bungees upcoming shooter
destiny we've got great news the
flagship title now has an official
release date looks like destiny will be
hitting xbox one xbox 360 playstation 4
and ps3 on September 9 2014 of course
this is a pretty big deal for Bungie who
made their name with the Halo franchise
and there's a lot of hype and excitement
about Destiny's co-op play sci-fi story
and lush backdrops we saw a little more
on the game last Saturday on spike vgx
which did absolutely nothing but make us
even more excited to play it hurry up
already because I want to use that
needle or grenade and I want to shoot
some freaking aliens apparently there
are a ton of weird and bogus listings
for the Xbox one on ebay but one buyer
in particular got a nasty surprise when
he thought he bought an xbox one for
about 750 bucks I got a photo of one
sted that sounds pretty shady except the
seller very clearly said it was a photo
of the console for sale the buyer then
told news outlets he even saw that the
listing said photo but figured it was a
real console because it was in the video
games of consoles category there's some
statement here about a fool and his
money but the bidding bonehead is pretty
lucky though because ebay is demanding
the celery from the money and a local
electronic shop gave this guy an xbox
one for free oh let's play as a feature
on our gaming channel where a member of
our writing staff plays a game and talks
about it this week Joey has finally
gotten his xbox one capture set up and
he's playing peggle 2 hey I know it's no
grand theft auto 5 but you know what
it's fun and Joey shamelessly enjoys it
so hashtag deal with it we'd like to
