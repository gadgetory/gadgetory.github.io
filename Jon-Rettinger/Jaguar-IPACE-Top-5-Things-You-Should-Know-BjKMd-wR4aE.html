the all new electric Jaguar ipace we've
had the privilege of driving at a few
times we did a video showing what that
was like we shown some technology but I
wanted to combine everything and tell
you two top five things to know about
the all-new electric eye base
as you're doing your research online you
might look at the dimensions of the I
face and be like that seems small and
eerily similar to Jaguar smallest sedan
the X II but the numbers don't tell the
full story so while length wise are
almost identical when it comes to
storage inside space inside room for the
passengers the cab forward design
because you know no engine up front
gives you a ton of room for storage a
ton of room for for all your friends and
you look at the car online it looks kind
of like a car and kind of like a SUV the
car's got air suspension to kind of
raise it up and down and that's by
design it is a crossover but has a
utility of an SUV the next thing this
car is fully electric there's no gas
component at all it's being powered by a
90 kilowatt hour battery pack and it's
got two electric motors sitting 1ih axle
so technically it's all-wheel drive it's
gonna give you 394 horsepower and
because it's electric 512 foot-pounds of
torque which is going to rock it you to
0 to 60 in about 4.5 seconds and you get
a max range of about 234 miles and
obviously the cars electric so you're
gonna want to charge it up most public
charging stations use a 50 kilowatt hour
fast charger if you pull in and almost
zero and leave it charging for 85
minutes you will come back with about 80
percent battery left but just want to
plug it in at home using but typically
call the level 2 that's like the same
outlet you would use for a washer and
dryer about 10 hours to give you that
same 80 percent so if you'd like your
cell phone plug in at night come in in
the morning car's fully charged and
obviously being a flagship in the first
electric and Jaguar there's a ton a tech
in here so it's got the latest of what
Jaguar calls the in control touch pro
duo it's it's two screens so you've got
a big 10-inch one up top you got a 5.5
inch one down below got a Wi-Fi hotspot
you got a carplay and android auto
capabilities and Apple watch companion
app a heads-up display and a slew driver
assistance features including the
ability for the car to pretty much park
itself so a ton of awesome technology in
the all-electric ipace the last thing to
know is how much is a car gonna cost
question there is how many options do
you want but if you start with no option
box is ticked it's gonna start at just
under $70,000 that's under $7,000 still
gives you the same range the same crazy
speed all the torque that you'd get if
you hit a lot of those option boxes and
it's also gonna give you an air
suspension standard so that's is five
things to know about the all-electric
Jaguar ipace it's a competitive field is
enough to stand out in your minds if
you're shopping for an all-electric EVD
i love to hear your thoughts on it leave
in the comments down below
