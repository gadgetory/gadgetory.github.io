walk you through the features of the new
iphone OS three point out so today March
seventeenth 2009 alcohol the press
conference at their campus and Cupertino
to go over the new features of iphone OS
3.0 so let's do keeping track the iphone
3gs running two point O of our version
of two point oh and the first gen rant
iphone one point o people are really
excited about this announcement whether
free point o was going to bring a new
phone or dish for new features ended up
just bringing new features and I want to
walk you through each of them
individually so let's get started and
let go through these and you order that
Apple announced them so you guys can
keep track first thing they said they're
giving out or announcing 1000 new AP is
philly that don't know like api is an
application program interface
essentially it lets developers build
applications access a new feature of the
iphone so the first instance of this new
API is is they now game developers
access to google maps so programmers can
actually embedded google maps into their
applications which is very cool also
with full feature functionalities build
a pension zoom in different applications
that are using google maps so that was
kind of fun so next and long overdue is
one of the old API is a announced as
well as they were giving developers
access to turn by turn directions so
finally you can turn your iphone into a
bona fide gps the only catches
developers have to bring their own maps
to it they couldn't get licensing i
suppose from google to put the maps into
there so look for turn-by-turn
directions coming the very near future i
get lost really as leg don't always have
a gps with me so i am very thankful to
have this next thing push notification
well us isn't true background running
apps like people wanted Apple claim that
backgrounds applications running at once
so more than one going at a time during
battery too much what they did was they
establish now push notifications so that
does essentially it's up in the server
somewhere sends information to your
application so
you have let's say instant message
program Brooklyn doesn't have to be its
Arab you're running but when you get
into the message that gets pink to a
server in the sky and I can set right
down to your phone and you get the
message that pops off actually is a
great way to have application and
running without having them actually run
and you get instant notifications which
is actually very cool so talking about
the push notifications one of the
applications they showed off that use
this is an ESPN application so you can
actually get in game scores you can
actually now watch streaming video in
the application so if you're a sports
fan like me and you're on the balcony
wanna who won the game you'll
automatically get an update so show up
right on your phone telling you in game
scores and who won't which is actually
really nice so Apple is also positioning
the iphone and ipod touch to really be a
strong gaming platform they announced a
lot of gaming central features today so
the first one they announces in-game
voice so imagine playing with a friend
being able to talk to each other it's
actually a very cool feature and
speaking of talk to each other they also
announced peer-to-peer app connectivity
so meaning if you're playing game with a
friend and your buddies got the game at
home you can actually connect wirelessly
and play against them use this apples
Bonjour system which I'm not gonna be
technical with you guys essentially it
lets you guys link up no we have to pair
bluetooth devices or anything they'll do
it all automatically it's actually
really nice so it seems like a
politically positioning me ipod and
iphone to be a really strong gaming
platform they may give the DS the new
dsi and possibly the PHP a really big
run for his money they've got a ton of
developer support so definitely look for
that um and now they got they went
through a couple developers and showed
some games small the company made the
ocarina app show in a new game but then
they got to the big announcements the
big consumer features and the first one
was cut copy and paste and all I can say
is freaking finally so this is cut copy
and paste is one of hundred of new
consumer features that will be in OS
three point now essentially what you do
is you'll double tap text and it pulls
up kind of a big magnifying glass you
can pinch over to where you want and as
soon as you
pinch / you get a cut copy or text
bubbles that show up on your screen
click it and you can go anywhere you
want tap the screen you'd be able to
paste it right in and that will work in
mail it'll work in text it'll even work
on Safari so that's a long overdue
feature and a feature that a lot of
iphone haters were saying you know it
definitely needed so it's happy that it
got happened here second thing they
added and with the copy of hey it's the
ability to send more than one photo in
the mail if you can actually cut
multiple photos and send them right off
of the mail it's actually really nice so
one of the other big missing features
new iphone one of the things that I've
been saying for quite a long time his
Apple has a fantastic landscape keyboard
but you could only use it with your type
in a URL you can now use that landscape
keyboard in all of apple's key
applications so that means text mail
again like I mentioned the internet
application Safari calendar you can use
it anywhere in Apple's native
applications which will be really nice
to really increase the accuracy of
typing I'm not so good when typing
normally on the iphone keyboard but I
get much better when I have a landscape
keyboard so that will be very very nice
the next big features apple announced
and one that most phones have had for
quite some time but the iphone seriously
didn't was mms that's ability to send
picture and voice messages similar to
ways like text messages and as Apple was
going through and talking about these
new features a couple of things dawned
on me first really only a company like
Apple get people excited for features
that were available on phones six seven
years ago namely mms and copy and paste
it also made me think when they were
announcing these features making a big
deal about it kind of how upset I was
that we didn't have these to start an
iphone in such a revolutionary device
and really changing the global community
in the mobile world but it had some
really big glaring holes and I think
these updates are going to help patch
those holes I don't know if these were
kind of been reacting to some of the
palm pre features or if Apple head is in
the pipeline for a while but it is nice
that competition was driving new
features so the next thing they talked
about this
to the mms was voice memos which is just
as exciting as it sounds hey voice memos
record your voice memo now doctor's
appointment tomorrow either at ten
that's it looking fairly excited this is
my phone cuz you can't tell next thing
they announced was updates to the stops
application there now is support for
news and landscape mode so you can get
some news and turn it on its side
against my landscape information i use
the stocks app so it'll be nice to have
that but nothing terribly exciting so
they got to some more interesting things
so with software two point oh they
announced search functionality in
contacts now with three point oh they're
bringing that same search functionality
all across the operating system which is
actually really nice build a search and
Mail Calendar ipod or notes type in a
word it will search it all for you which
is actually really handy so imagine if
you get a lot of emails I use my phone
for business a lot and it kind of search
for an email you have stored from say
John Smith go ahead and type jon smith
it'll pull up all the messages that have
come from you can find the one you want
not having to scroll through days weeks
possibly even months of messages if you
can help go into your ipod and search
type in what you're looking for let's
say i want to listen to Green Day type
in green day boom there it is nice and
easy so the search function is actually
going to be very important what I'm
about to say next when Apple launched
the first generation iphone the f /
wasn't there i really only had one home
screen you had your grid of icons for
the built-in applications and that was
it with two point oh we got the app
store and kind of new sliding home
screens to accommodate your multiple
screens of applications so Apple
announced today a new home screen option
it's not a replacement for your home
tree that you have now it's a new option
that you can use and they're calling it
spotlight it's actually a spotlight
lives in your list of applications it's
actually they'll just look like an icon
click it it'll pull up this new kind of
quick launcher and you can choose all
your applications that you want from
right there it also has all the search
functionality built right in so you can
search for anything you
on using this new home screen called
spotlight actually it is very cool and
it has get at Universal Search they also
added a ton of other cool features
stereo Bluetooth also known as a2dp
essentially means you can use a
bluetooth speaker and send music right
to it which is something windows mobile
and Nokia's had for years and Apple was
definitely missing so that's a nice kind
of catch up feature the big question on
everybody's mind is when is 3.0 going to
be available well the good news is if
your developer will be available today
if you're not a developer like most of
you and I are not be available this
summer it'll be a free upgrade to iphone
3g owners it'll be a 995 upgrade for
touch 2g owners so something to keep in
mind if you have an original iphone you
will be able to upgrade but you're not
going to get the mms and stereo
bluetooth features unfortunately but at
least you'll get the improves I assume
stability and the other cool things that
come with three point oh now maybe this
is going to come pre-loaded on a new
iPhone Apple didn't announce any sort of
hard work but this summer you will be
able to get OS three point out so guys
in conclusion I'm really happy that
Apple announced these new features they
were much needed in the ways of just
catching up to the competition there so
far and ahead beyond in certain ways
like touch screen technology and ease of
use and to leave miss but they work far
behind some of the key features namely
M&amp;amp;Ms and cut copy and paste and that
really has been rectified right now so
the big holes that were in the iPhone
platform have now been filled and I
guess now the next move is up to the
competition see how they respond and see
how they can push apple an apple can
push them in return to bring new
features to you and I both so guys I
hope you enjoyed their kind of a real
quick overview of what was announced
today I can't wait to get my hands on
the new software and as soon as I do
I'll be sure and give you guys
demonstrations of them so be sure to
stick around to the channel and for
exclusive content be sure to follow me
on twitter twitter.com / John for lakers
i'll see you guys next video
