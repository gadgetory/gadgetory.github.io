for Lakers comm here with an unboxing
for you of the Xbox 360 elite I had an
xbox about two years ago and sold it and
I've had a Wii and PlayStation 3 in
between them but the yesterday I decided
to sell the we haven't turned it on in
almost a year and I really just wasn't
using it so I sold it with a few
accessories and games and repurchased an
Xbox
I'm really looking looking forward to
reviewing the new Xbox experience as
well as trying out Netflix streaming on
the 360 a real big movie guy so I think
the ability to stream Netflix content on
the TV
should be a real nice addition also a
lot of my friends have a three sixteen
so I'm looking forward to getting some
online gaming going on with them and
also with you my name is John for Lakers
on Xbox so go ahead and add me and we
can we can game a little bit together
also guys the first video I filmed with
the flip Mino HD so if you're
considering getting the camera be sure
to watch this
especially closely for video quality to
see if it meets your needs and wants and
also special thank you to youtube user
Taito JR for making the intro you guys
just watched it's one of the intros i'm
considering using so be sure to check
him out I'll put a link to his channel
up in the sidebar do we guys enjoy the
unboxing and I will see you in the next
one buh-bye alright let's get down to
the unboxing so here is the Xbox 360
elite console I also picked up a year
subscription to Xbox Live with a free
month and a trial of Netflix and a copy
of call of duty world at war I love the
Call of Duty game so I'm really looking
forward to giving this a whirl so put
those aside and let's go ahead and open
up the system and see what we got going
on so here's the Box Xbox 360 elite it
comes with two games I guess is a
holiday bundle Indiana Jones Lego
Kung Fu Panda probably not going to play
either those anyway says what's inside
it stuff about the console on the back
you got some information about it right
on top and on the side of it here says
what's in it and kind of compares the
elite at the other consoles
this one has a 120 gigabyte hard drive
and comes with an HDMI cable headset and
rest of stuff we'll see when we open it
up and on the back of it
we got a picture of some games and some
text nothing terribly exciting there the
ultimate system for games entertainment
I'm actually really looking forward to
being able to stream Netflix it's
actually one of the significant reasons
I got this so let's go ahead and open
this thing up here go ahead and break
the seal right there
all right slides out like this put this
down and lift the box top up all right
here is right on top is the console
itself it's really kind of packed in
there we'll review this more thoroughly
in a second guys can see my cat is a
little bit curious about what's going on
there at the box there she is
that's Mercedes she's a little bit away
right now so let's move her a little bit
all right important
please read he experienced any issues or
concerns while setting up your new
system stop do not return your Xbox 360
buh-buh-buh probably should read it
we're not going to get the most out of
your 360 chat whatever so if those you
guys did say I don't buy anything
anymore I definitely bought this Xbox
360
looks like warranty and some xbox live
info acts now to protect your investment
of the amazing Xbox 360 funny they got
some ads for old games up there what is
that the perfect
that came out when the system launched a
few years ago probably update that all
right let's see it else we got in the
box lots of bags pull this back a little
bit first bag it's crates like a whole
bunch of little unboxings inside of one
big one hits it kind of cool actually
before I get to the boring stuff of
cables probably the rest of these bags
let's take one last look at the console
here and see what's inside so here is
the Xbox 360 elite we will take off the
plastic it's not a very heavy console
actually I'm remember it being a little
bit heavier so we will pull that back
that the block is nice it's kind of a
matte looking black it's not glossy so
there's the front of it there's your a
power button there the eject button an
IR port and two memory card slots and a
connect your wireless controller and the
slot where the DVD tray comes out right
here there's port for two USB
controllers on the left hand side
there's 120 gigabyte hard drive and you
can release that just with that little
lever right there and some mesh for for
cooling on the back of it which is where
all the ports are see how we got we've
got HDMI and that big slot for
connecting component cables it's kind of
a brick that plugs in there and the
component cables come out to your TV
Ethernet cable and the USB port for the
wireless USB adapter this does not come
with wireless I wish that a wish that it
did and these two massive fans for
cooling and where the power cord goes in
just some mash events on the other side
of the console so we go we'll go ahead
now and put that off to the side the
fact in plastic here is the cat didn't
get too
and we'll see what else we got in the
box so we just saw the headset it's like
actually on the headset - there's a kind
of a neat little remote here so you can
turn it on or off whether you want to
talk and there's a little volume wheel
all right so move it right along -
what's in this mystery green pouch we've
got this thing so that plugs in that big
brick port looks like on a composite
possibly all those optical audio and
yeah there's your video addressing so
optical audio port into videos that's
kind of a new addition ton of a ton of
cables for the stands for sure let's
keep going
oh the controller I love the Xbox
controller
go ahead and open this thing up black
controller kind of familiar feel to it
yeah as I'm sure you've all seen the
Xbox controller shoulder buttons on top
and kind of battery pack on the back it
looks like inside they also included a
few batteries that was nice of them -
energizer doublea's so we put in some
legitimate batteries don't know how long
they last but least they're in they're
in the black controller matches the
system let's see what else oh this is a
real exciting one here take a u.s. yeah
Ethernet cable really freakin fancy so
there's either Nets
lots more cables here uh well they
included an HDMI cable that's nice of
them so gray HDMI actually had an extra
one laying around I thought I was gonna
have to use but save that for something
else I only have one USB port on my TV
which kind of sucks but that's keep
unplugging and unplugging it that TV
right there it's a 50-inch LG go back
here to the box hey we're all right and
see what else we have this thing this
has got to be the component cables yep
there you are so plug into that massive
brick Wow TV or HDTV you can select and
just your audio and video connectors
nothing too fancy there and I should be
those two games somewhere in the box so
let's see lift this up we didn't solve
on the hard drive there those games are
not in the box
there's a power chord I think it's going
to plug into the massive power brick
we're about to see ah speaking of
massive power brick take a look at this
bad mamuh JAMA this thing is huge
they've still not made this smaller
since I don't think since when it came
out I mean this thing is like the size
of the Wii itself mm crazy
imagine if they put this inside the
console thing would be huge so power
brick so guys that's everything in the
box lots of fun stuff I'm looking
forward to setting up the console and
getting my Call of Duty on I don't know
what my May I'm gonna set up there is
but once I do set up a xbox tag I will
I'll let you guys know and we can play
online whenever I'm on there and get my
Netflix streaming going see you guys in
