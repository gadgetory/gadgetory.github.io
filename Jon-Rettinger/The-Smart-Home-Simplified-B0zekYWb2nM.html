when I go to events I walk going with
like maybe a new phone maybe a t-shirt
or two this time though I've got myself
a house so I kind of feel like we're on
a episode of cribs in my house for only
24 hours market matter here as well Matt
Matt's filming so this is the house
we're calling it the Eco B&amp;amp;B everything
around here is smart and connected every
light switch on the wall of the switch
plus of course you got the Eco B
thermostat up on the wall the idea is
that this is just your house it's what
your house could be pretty simply and so
everything here is obviously connected
so stuff you can do with Alexa obviously
you can do here Alexa turn off the
lights in the living room Alexa turn on
the lights in living room so it's not
like what Alexa can do that's cool it's
a fact that it's built into a light
switch and the tiny little speaker on
here
sounds surprisingly awesome so you're
taking away the need for a can echo dot
on a counter and you're putting into a
physical light switch it's also using
far-field tech so I could stand pretty
far away so obviously their light
switches and they do smart things but
there's also normal light switches you
can push it and it turn things off you
can turn things on and if you've got a
mute buttons and stuff on it as well so
like I got kids at home I don't want my
kids yelling it to play moa√±a soundtrack
by various artists at 3:00 in the
morning which they do pretty regularly
it's also got obviously motion detection
on it so it's gonna know when you walk
into a room it's gonna know your
schedule it also set it to turn lights
off automatically if it doesn't tech
motion at certain intervals and
obviously being like an eco B product
you can use your voice to control your
you could be thermostat we've got the
four in this house which has Alexa built
in too so you talked to your switch and
your thermostat so I gotta say you come
home you're like a super long day you
just want to like sit in your rocking
chair put your blanket on and just relax
and listen to some music you could do it
Alexa play death metal in the living
room
death metal from Spotify playing on any
room I like to play house of cards can
use lights which do that usually you see
I like so like got it up in its a little
dot format but it's not always near you
you can't always hear it but went into
light switch you can add a touch more
convenience so like in the kitchen like
literally in the kitchen I can be like
Alexa make me a coffee thanks
Alexa tell the cat to roll in dirt
wildlife out here how do we know what
restaurants are in Austin what we didn't
even say it
that was I swear that was a hundred
percent not staged
all right John we just went to dinner so
it's cold out I'm hoping that it's gonna
be warm inside although I know you guys
like it free they know we could turn up
the heat there you go there we go oh it
worked
impressive what are you going to name
this cat leave them in a comment section
down below what are we gonna call this
guy up for cat how's about to come in
I like so lock the front door locking
hang on
but other like midnight now we're
getting ready to call it a call tonight
over from our only night during the eco
B&amp;amp;B mark is in the guest bedroom getting
ready so I think we should probably mess
with them since they locked me out Alexa
turn off the lights in the guest bedroom
usually we go to these like smart home
installations it's like meet the smart
home in the future stuff you might have
in like 10 years it was cool to come to
a house where everything is already here
and working you can already buy it make
it work and a lot of home as they've got
short pieces of smart homes but living
in one where everything worked was
really cool what I liked about the
switch plus is that it takes the place
of an echo dot which is her stationery
on your counter you've got light
switches everywhere so you put two three
or four these around your house and
suddenly your whole home becomes
connected and can hear your voice it did
a really admirable job with a far-field
technology - it was far away it could
hear my voice and if you're in a home
like this where there's thirty of them
all around it'll activate the one that
can hear your voice the best it was cool
to see that work the occupancy sensors
are really neat and if you're not like
super into the Amazon eco system would
also play nice with home kit and all the
rest of this stuff that you could be
plays nicely with before you guys head
out if you like what you Kobey's putting
down with your switch plus and the eco
before they're giving away humongous
prize pack with lights and switches and
speakers will link to it down below in
case you guys want to check it out hope
you guys enjoy it's kind of different
silent video we never did one like this
will be stayed in a place all together
until next time I'm John Retton
TechnoBuffalo that's the guy's neck
