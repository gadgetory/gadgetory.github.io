you're watching this video chances are
you are the resonant go to nerd in your
family so for you I've got a list of top
tech under a hundred bucks let's start
with chromecast ultra let's say like an
Betty doesn't know how to use Apple TV
she's not in Amazon's ecosystem and she
thinks a Roku is something that she
caught when she was younger
chromecast ultra is going to be for her
or for the anyone in your life that just
wants a cast up from the phone right to
their TV this new one lets you stream up
to 4k Ultra HD content and HDR over your
Wi-Fi network it also support Ethernet
if you prefer it really fast load times
- compared to the $35 chromecast this
one is definitely worth the extra money
we've got to know each other well over
the years and I lose stuff and I did a
video on this product a while back but
the Tile slim put that sucker red in
your wallet or your purse and you will
not lose it we've got one in a stroller
for each of our kids I have got one of
my wallet ones in my wife's purse it's
got a really good app that works on both
iOS or Android lets you just find things
that you might miss you can get stickers
you can put double-sided tape on stick
it to all kinds of things but if you're
prone to misplacing things you got a
friend or family member who just loses
their stuff all the time you're sitting
getting that phone call can I borrow
your credit card so I lost mine get in
the title slim starting at just 30 bucks
this one I actually bought a few of them
on Black Friday for $39.99 a low try to
buy them now you're gonna probably see
around 49 50 ish bucks this is the echo
dot second-generation I was expecting
too much the echo dot I figured that
small speaker was gonna sound really bad
didn't have the little twirly thing on
the top but the echo that I love but
I've been really impressed the echo dot
in fact my wife had just put in our
bedroom use it as our alarm clock tells
us the weather in the morning it's a
great thing to have really in any room
if you want it to play music if you have
a kid you want to play lullabies
although I did try to put it in my son's
room when I woke up in the middle of the
night with him saying Alexa tell me a
joke over and over and over again so
maybe don't put it in your kid's room
we've been big fans of lifx for a while
the color-changing bulbs that are Wi-Fi
and don't need a hub and they are back
with the life x generation 3 + z which
is an LED strip and it works
really Wells they've seen youtubers like
us we've been envious of those colored
strips that people are putting in
backgrounds under their TVs this is how
they do it it's gonna cost you about 60
bucks the gen three bulbs are super
bright in fact 1100 lumen 16 million
colors and thousand shades from warm to
cool whites so you can find the color
that best suits you I've got four of
these in my kitchen again the best part
for me is I don't need a hub to control
them this next one is gonna be a little
bit weird but it's a universal stand for
your laptop but hear me out before you
yell at me in in the comments so it's a
laptop dock it's by the Ike winix and
it's called the Eden it's an aluminum
laptops and you can adjust it for any
notebook whose thickness can be all over
the board from 10 millimeters which is
0.4 inches to 30 millimeters there's one
point one eight inches it work like a
MacBook Pro MacBook Air Dell XPS
Universal dock I've got my laptop dock
at the office I like to have it sort of
up it helps with fans and ventilation so
it's not flat on the surface and you
have to worry about one that's only
gonna work with your computer it's
Universal it works really well it looks
nice it's got a rubber mats gonna
protect the notebook and it's gonna cost
you about 60 bucks this is the Superboy
it's gonna cost you $80 if you let you
play your favorite Super Nintendo Super
Famicom cartridges so you're not
downloading anything you are just
putting the cartridge directly into this
portable thing it looks just like a big
controller that's also has a built-in
3.5 inch LCD screen your chargeable
lithium ion batteries to get five hours
for gaming on the go
it's a fun in the stall jet portable
console I've got one and I will admit
that I waste more time that I probably
should blank Super Mario World so that
is our list in the top tech under 100
bucks there's something for everyone in
there obviously there's a lot more tech
we could pick from but I want to pick
some things that maybe you didn't see on
every listing because I've legitimately
bought things that we really use in the
office if you liked this video give it a
thumbs up to let us know be sure
notifications are on so you get alerts
every post something new so you don't
miss anything until next time I'm drying
render from TechnoBuffalo happy early
holidays so before you guys run out to
go buy your new tech I want to tell you
that you can watch your favorite
Discovery Channel shows anytime anywhere
using the Discovery Go app a link to it
down below if you want to check it out
so for me it's the Deadliest Catch
dungeon Cove

disaster person that's up to you link
