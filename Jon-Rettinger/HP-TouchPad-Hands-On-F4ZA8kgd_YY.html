from second Buffalo I'm here at the HP
web OS event yeah I didn't say palm
because they're not talking about palm
palm is gone apparently all you see is
HP webOS everywhere are c HP webOS
across from university number column
anyway they just announced three devices
the veer which is a teeny-tiny webOS
smartphone the pre three which is kind
of their flagship smartphone and then
the touchpad which to me is the star of
the show the tablet device it'll ship
this summer they're not letting people
touch it but they are doing demos and so
let's go see if we can get one
if they want to touch on
give up patient revives access
just as you'd expect
cages
just that easy not going to argue the
supports whispers think so it
it does shows you baby
I'm not sure
let me also show you a game so you know
we mentioned the processing power in
this
so we have this really cool
my entire game as a demonstration
autopilot mode take it off
I'm not very good at this yet
see how good it looks
on fire
card you get rid of it like that now you
might have noticed since I've been
showing this to you that I got a bunch
of text messages this is another really
cool feature we're showing today this
does not have a phone in it but it's
connected with a phone I do have in the
station here and so I can reply to text
messages right
this is a good chance to talk about the
keyboard you know it's a fibro P horse
we have the numbers visible and we have
the symbols present so it's much easier
to type States and times and things of
that where you've got numbers in
characters not to switch back and forth
the whole lot present hold here can
change the keyboard sighs so by smaller
fingers and I'm you know I'm more prefer
a small court I can do that or if I want
to go big maybe just because I want to
type more you know want to have like a
long term email or something like that I
can do that
stuff that easier decides which they
always how you close that one let me
show you the web browser experience this
is based on the latest web hits help we
have partner acceleration a lot of html5
features and also flash so you get the
web way you're expecting it
the web browser
we see the back the back consider I just
need a minute to reset so yeah quick
question does the OS work in landscape
mode if I had a portrait brother
this is you'd expected Wow
as Unix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
