opportunity to play with the latest
smartphones which for me is a dream come
true because I love mobile tech and
everybody in the office here loves
mobile tech too but sometimes you can't
agree on what the best phone is and that
kind of was until now so when our
editor-in-chief Roy Troy and our
executive editor Todd Hazleton both said
their favorite phones and the phones
they are using right now is a huawei
mate nine I figured I should take notice
maybe give it a shot myself so initially
just looking at the screen I just
assumed it was qHD but it is not it is
1080p and it looks really nice the
camera on the mate nine note can
definitely be a little bit hit or miss
it's totally capable of taking a really
excellent shots but it's not nearly as
good as I've had with a pixel XL or the
iPhone 7 plus tata roy were saying how
awesome battery life is this phone could
last for days and days so I was
expecting really great things I started
using the mate nine and they're kind of
right battery life is really unmatched I
also really liked the industrial design
on the phone it felt really good in the
hand they liked the fingerprint reader
although the spot where you put your
finger was a little bit small it felt
nice it kind of had that HTC industrial
build to it the phone seemed really
zippy throughout everything I did it
never had any service slowdown I was a
little bit dubious about the Kyurem
processor but no issue at all with any
sort of speed decrease I played games
watch movies multitask everything worked
perfectly
the main night is really good at a lot
of things it's not great in anyone but
it's not bad in anything either it's a
really well-rounded phone I could see
what Todd and Rory liked it but the
caveat comes with probably don't pick
one up right now I did a video a few
weeks back saying you should probably
wait to buy a new smartphone and that
still holds true I want to see what
happens at Mobile World Congress so at
the beginning I said this was Todd and
Roy's favorite phone I think it's
probably one of mine too at this point
as well it's not as flashy or even as
fast as the pixel and the pictures
aren't as good but does everything
really well there's a few things that
those devices don't do the pixel XL and
the regular pixel you guys tried to make
nine do you like it do not like it let
me know in the comments down below give
the video a thumbs up we certainly
appreciate it until next time John
