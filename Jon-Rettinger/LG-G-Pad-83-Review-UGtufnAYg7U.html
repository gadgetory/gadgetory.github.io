here and I'm reviewing the LG G pad 8.3
it's an interesting tablet on paper but
can it stand up to the Nexus 7 or the
Kindle Fire HDX or even the iPad Mini
stick around to find out okay so we have
to discuss the hardware on the G pad
this is a really nice looking tablet the
brushed metal and plastic lends itself
really well to tablet design but on that
same note it's still slab just like its
competitors that's not a bad thing but
it's not a good thing either since it
makes the G pad a little bit forgettable
everything is laid out really nicely on
the G pad on top there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack an IR blaster and a micro SD card
slot that's expandable up to 64 gigs a
volume rocker and power sleep button are
on the right side of the tablet and your
micro USB port and microphone are on the
bottom there's a rear facing five
megapixel camera a front-facing 1.2
megapixel camera and dual speakers along
the back or right side of the device to
round out the device's externals I
actually really like the way LG placed
the speaker's here holding the G pad
with your left hand doesn't cover the
speakers really at all if you know where
they are and when you hold the device
with your right hand you're completely
in the clear and rotating the device in
a landscape mode puts the speaker's on
the top rear of the device and they
sound fantastic when you're watching
videos this screen is gorgeous it's an
IPS LCD with a delightful resolution of
1920 by 1200 the very same resolution as
a 2013 Nexus 7 and the 7 inch Kindle
Fire HDX the G pad has a slightly lower
PPI than those two tablets though
because is a larger screen size but you
won't notice I promise the viewing
angles are really nice on the G pad and
the colors aren't oversaturated like
some AMOLED screens can be you'll
definitely need to crank up the
brightness outdoors though because the
screen is a little bit hard to see when
you're outside specs wise the G pad has
a Snapdragon 600 processor under the
hood that's not top-of-the-line but it
also performed well when I used it and I
felt like the sacrifice of raw power for
battery life was probably good one on
LG's part the G pad ships with Android
4.2.2 but LG's got their own custom
variant onboard just like every other
Android OAM Samsung loves to add s to
their app names and LG likes Q so you'll
find at row
of LG branded apps on the G pad Q pair q
slide Q remote knock on slide aside
smart screen smart video q memo and
notebook I go over each feature and what
they do in full in my written review so
you can check out what each one is if
you're interested but I really do want
to mention slide aside quickly which I
thought was the app of the most
potential but the poorest implementation
so it works like this you're in an app
and if you want to kind of store it off
to the side you swipe left with three
fingers and the device will keep that
app there for you just off-screen well
that's all well and good but you can't
pin apps there meaning every time that
you access any of the maximum of three
apps and sly decided D stickies it and
you have to redo that three finger swipe
motion over and over again I'd love to
be able to choose which three apps I
always wanted ailable but that option
isn't offered as for battery life the G
pad has a huge 4600 milliamp hour
battery under the hood for me that meant
a full weekend without needing a charge
but as a disclaimer I tend to be a
moderate tablet user and I keep my
brightness down to under 25% most of the
time I live in a cave the second time
around I tested the battery I cranked
the brightness up to 100% and used it
the same way as before and the G pad was
looking for juice around 12 hours later
so for what it's worth if you're a power
user who needs a super bright screen
this tablet might barely get you through
a day's use overall I think this is a
good tablet but that's actually the
problem there are some great Android
tablets out there this year's Nexus 7
and the Kindle Fire HDX are both
excellent mid sized Android tablets with
some X Factor to spare and both of those
devices start a full 120 bucks less than
the 16 gig G pad that's a lot of extra
apps and accessories you could buy so
for me it's just not worth the price tag
if this tablet was 250 bucks it might be
really great but at the end of the day
there's some intangible aspect missing
from this perfectly decent little tablet
that's why I gave the LG G pad 8.3 7.5
it's just price too high and doesn't
quite hit any high notes to be worth its
cost and on top of that it's just not
compelling enough to do battle with its
higher profile competitors well that's
it for my LG G pad 8.3 review leave your
