TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of the Lumia 1520 the latest
flagship from Nokia I put it through its
paces for the better part of a week
let's go ahead and see if it's the phone
that you want to obsessively check every
15 minutes for the next two years let me
begin this review the way I do all of
our reviews with a disclaimer I use this
as my daily driver for seven days and
then two additional days in conjunction
with another phone let's jump right in
to hardware the 6-inch 1920 by 1080
screen is friggin gorgeous windows phone
looks meant for 1080p screens pictures
text and video all look ridiculously
awesome the biggest surprise for me was
the viewing angles were really good and
even direct sunlight you could still see
the screen and usually direct sunlight
is like the bane of all cell phones
existence it worked
awesome also worked well with polarized
sunglasses if you wear them like I do
I've also made a pretty decent
ereader and a pinch because the screen
is so big at 6 inches this is the first
time that Windows Phone really got
premiere hardware and in all honesty
it's not that different which is
probably testament to Windows Phone how
well optimized it was before similar I
guess to kind of an Apple model where
they control the hardware and they
certainly control your operating system
the things you just work pretty well the
big differences I noticed was it booted
up quicker that's what the snapdragon
800 and two gigs a ram so it's got you
know pretty beastly specs here apps also
open faster there was no lag at all I
didn't feel like I had to do any sort of
memory management but never felt like
how to do that before anyway one of the
big stories here though aside from the
gorgeous specs and the incredible screen
is that guy on the back it's pretty nice
camera at about 20 megapixels doesn't
have the giant 10:20 style camera dump I
really like that I'm not missing the
extra 21 megapixels I'd really prefer
how sort of almost flush this is to the
back some really cool Nokia app so that
go with the camera no carry focus is
beyond cool essentially it's like a
light dro camera uses sort of fake light
filter near-field technology lets you
refocus after the fact and save a
picture and it works really really
really well
Nokia camera also has a ton of options
you can get down to really almost your
DSLR
type customisation and the default
camera app is pretty functional and if
you noticed I just mentioned three
different camera apps that's way way way
way too many apps unify them two were
made by Nokia one is a default one
Microsoft now pretty much owns Nokia so
just give me one app that does
everything let me select the mode that I
want I don't have to have nine different
camera apps didn't make much sense to me
but since we are talking about the
camera low-light shots were awesome not
quite the quality of the 41 megapixel on
the 1020 but pretty darn close us can
easily go head-to-head with other
flagships including the iPhone 5s and
already the best of Android one of the
best cameras on the market right now so
how was the Lumia 1520 to live with it's
big but it's really fit and they found
that surprisingly fit pretty well in my
pocket and again just normal dude jeans
I don't they were tight pants super
baggy pants just regular pants it
actually fit pretty well due to the
thinness and first time I looked at a
Lumia device been like huh pretty spelt
so hats off to Nokia for cramming you
know a lot of hardware in a really
really thin package I loved the extra
row for live tiles I never had to go
into my applets pretty much at all I
could see everything on the home screen
I had actually struggled to find extra
apps to put on the home screen I just to
fill it up the Windows Store has gotten
way better since I last visited core
apps that I use are now all there like
Instagram is finally there although no
video yet but Instagram is finally there
so the ones that I use the most you know
I got Twitter you have Facebook
Instagram LinkedIn Foursquare are all
there there's the big ones that I use so
I brought up a point to Todd Hazeltine
who did our written review of this which
you can see the link down below to get
all kinds of camera sample images we're
talking about the phone I've been saying
that I missed Google now on Android
devices you brought up a really good
point why do you need well now and you
can steal the information right on the
live tile and that was actually a very
valid thing to say I could see
everything around a live tile I could
see my sports scores I could see you
know shipping for packages like a
seaside traveler and see absolutely
everything I thought really needing to
open up Google now so made a lot of
sense to me and so it was nice to see
that it was there
it does seem kind of weird from a size
standpoint that Nokia went from 4.5
inches on 10 26 inches if I had a bet
though I'd say there's a middle ground 5
inch phone coming very
very very soon probably sometime around
Mobile World Congress made me February
ish
giant phone also packs a pretty giant
battery 3400 milliamp hours it was
pretty awesome and it worked very well
able to get through a whole day with 40%
so my usage is generally comes off the
charger around 7:00 in the morning let's
get it to Wi-Fi almost holiday either at
home or at the office there's probably
more social networking that I've cared
to admit on here
probably about an hour and a half two
hours of phone calls not pulling in two
email accounts every 15 minutes or just
in most frequently you can check with
not an exchange account screen
brightness set to about 80% I like a
really bright screen and then just some
you know video watching something like
games so that's my usage so I'm gonna
get there full day I'm pretty happy so
if you just turn down the brightness you
could very easily stretch it out to
probably two days we saw this guy
debuted at rather in Abu Dhabi was
really excited wireless charging was
gonna be here no need for external case
and then AT&amp;amp;T Nokia someone those two
companies new to the phone and no
wireless charging here so WTF I really
would have liked you've had wireless
charging at that haven't put a freaking
giant stupid back cover on this phone
use announces wireless charging to gives
me wireless charging I did this in a
rants video I wants it give it to me
please
I do really wish there's a digital
assistant something like Siri or Google
search but supposedly that's coming and
the call yet Cortana which is kind of
cool no Notification Center was also
kind of annoying but supposedly that's
also coming also Microsoft and Nokia
whoever please let me charge the phone
it's powered off it's right the dark
commute atern my phone off at night I
like to turn notifications off so let me
turn my phone off and charge it why
can't I do that I do feel and Todd agree
with me at this phone was kind of
designed for the next version of Windows
Phone and I'm really excited for what
that's going to be and hopefully we'll
see that very soon I could use this as
my only phone and be pretty happy so if
you're very app centric you definitely
want to check to make sure the apps you
use you're gonna be here if you do want
a great phone with a great camera a
beautiful screen this is a really good
choice you owe it to yourself to look at
Windows Phone a crush off with iOS and
Android to find that starting to stack
up pretty well other phone gets a very
solid eight point five and a high
recommendation for me hope you guys
