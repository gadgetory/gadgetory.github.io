rainy rainy Thursday at least up here in
Oakland California welcome to good to go
I'm Noah Kravitz from TechnoBuffalo calm
I'm James Kendrick from zini net mobile
news James I'm just going to go out on a
limb here and say it's not pouring cats
and dogs down there in Houston brilliant
sunshine 80 degrees I knew there was a
reason you know I was too happy about
not going to orlando this year for ctia
yeah i knew there was a reason and then
the rains rolled in so what are you
gonna do yeah that's true lots to talk
about before even getting it to ctia you
know AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile murderer some big
news of the week they they sprung that
on everybody on a Sunday which was all
still mode did everything kind of the
biggest news in the telecom business so
far this year and they just kind of
threw it out there and just to see what
would stick to the wall yeah it's
interesting you know that the timing of
things good news people try to good news
you know people people push out you know
based on a number of factors bad news
I've always seen pushed out on late on
Fridays so this sunday you know sunday
on the Eva CTA a maybe that's just when
the deal went down who knows but what
are your thoughts you know I well I mean
I've talked a lot of people a lot of
t-mobile customers and it seems like
they're all ticked I mean I don't think
any t-mobile customers happy at the
thought of becoming at some point an
AT&amp;amp;T customer yeah I had as it may I
think ultimately it's probably a good
thing for t-mo but that's that's my take
on it now now I would agree if you said
it's a good thing for Deutsche Telekom
because they're all they came out really
nice and the whole deal I think yeah
they got they got our one report I read
had you know they were asking sprint for
25 billion and AT&amp;amp;T offered 39 billion
whatever the case they got a nice
you know if the deal goes through a nice
sum of cash for you know how the ugly
stepchild they were trying to get rid of
any way and more importantly and you
don't hear a lot of people talk about
this I think this is pretty significant
they also being a German telecom okay
come away with eight percent equity an
AT&amp;amp;T yes and that's yes that's a big
deal to me because now after the merger
if it goes through AT&amp;amp;T is the biggest
us telecom right and they're going to
have a percent of that which is no small
no piece of it now eight percent and a
board seat now what about you said it
would be good for tmobile in the long
run are you talking about t-mobile USA
t-mobile USA which is the only we should
point out that's the only portion of
t-mobile that's affected i mean the the
the international or non-us operations
of t-mobile or not a magic by by the
snow now i think it is because I've been
watching t-mobile for a long time and
it's now clear and we talked about this
last week you know LTE is becoming the
de facto 4g standard going forward and
t-mobile has absolutely no way forward
right to LTE they have no plans right
that I mean they have no mechanism to
get there and I think well as we see
healthy become more of a standard we
were going to see t-mobile's start
really strong I don't know what they
were gonna do quite frankly going
forward I mean I know current t-mobile
customers don't care right now but
long-term I was really you know what
they were going to do going forward down
now we know they really have to do
anything doubling hspa+ capacity can
only go so far and that's not the way
forward for you know it's like oh that
AT&amp;amp;T yeah I am
I'm not currently a t-mobile customer I
used to be but but you know you can put
me you can let me in squarely in that
bucket of people who are ticked hiya I
just see it as a big lou's for consumers
no matter how you look at it obviously
you know like you said there's a win in
there a few parties win here you know
eighteen eighty 80 when waiting on I
would actually this is sort of you know
at a out of left field I would argue
that Verizon wins a little bit they'd
rather I think they'd rather see this
then then sprint you know become a
legitimate player now there's basically
one competitor for them instead of you
know a three-way race and that that's
certainly a debatable point but I kind
of see it that way at least initially
we'll see how it plays out Apple
arguably wins a little bit google i
actually think kind of loses handset
makers I think lose I don't know I don't
be overly bleak about it the rain maybe
has me down a little bit today but you
know at the risk of being reductionist
competition is good for consumers and
you pull a competitor out of the pool
you know no I think that's very true
that that's always a bad thing yeah so
what is a assuming this goes through
which is a big assumption and we can
touch on that if we have time you know
one thing I'm curious about is what a
sprint do now I don't think sprint does
anything any differently than they were
doing anyway I mean sprint is moving to
LTE they've already said that that's
their way forward you know long-term are
they going to remain viable as a network
I don't know when this deal doesn't
matter in that in my view I mean they're
either there or they're not there they
have taken I think really good actions
to be competitive with their true
unlimited with dan has seized current TV
ads running now which I think are very
true where he makes fun of the fact that
other networks like AT&amp;amp;T have different
definitions
missions for the term unlimited right
right which which we've talked about
before read um I think I think Sprint's
doing all the right thing and they are
moving till tea they've already rewarded
they are stated that's where they were
moving I think this this really hurts
them though in the sense of you know
going from one of the two smaller of the
big four in the u.s. to being the only
little guy so to speak and also now you
know the gap between them and number two
becomes that much bigger you know eighty
would become the number one with what a
hundred and thirty million subscribers
yeah now and one of the thousand yeah
and when you get into things which you
know frankly get a little bit out of
what I usually cover but things like
lobbying the government you know net
neutrality things things like that where
there has been a little bit of a pattern
of t-mobile and Sprint being on one side
of the argument and sometimes joining up
to fight again say you know verizon you
know things like that things like
negotiating with handset makers things
like you know it there there was a
little bit of a sense of sprint and I
mean spread a little bit less so since
they enacted the ten-dollar premium data
fee though as you said the true
unlimited is still a very big selling
point for them but sprint EVO will being
kind of the cheaper of the four big
carriers in terms of rate plans and now
you know can sprint afford to i don't
know i just i think i mean when i first
started covering mobile i remember you
know about a year year and a half into
it talking to some PR people saying you
know I don't get it with sprint they
they innovate they have you know at
least where i use them they have pretty
solid service their data speeds are good
they're at least trying to innovate even
though some of the thinking way back to
like the upstage music phone which
wasn't a huge success but they were
trying to do innovative things like that
they still are you know evo 4g and this
week the evo 3d being launched and
everything but they're always just
having trouble you know really bridging
that that gap to try to get up into the
big boy leagues and
you know I think this is really a blow
to that in that sense see I see it the
opposite number one sprint as themselves
are no smaller than they were before
this was an ounce from assuming this but
let's say this deal was consummated
right right sprint is no different than
they were before the deal I think
they're actually in better position
because they are now or will be after
the deal conserv 8b the far cheapest of
the big three right I think that's
actually a very competitive thing that's
it that's that's that's the niche that
they've carved out like you said that
and I think that they have at where
t-mobile failed they have carved out at
least through the the you know the
clearwire affiliation with the wimax and
to get real 4G speeds if you will out on
the market first I mean they did that
really quick they did that they turn
that into at least a competitive
advantage and they are moving to LTE
like everybody else we don't know where
that will wind up or how the clearwire
debt is going to impact them but but but
the bottom line for me is do differently
without this ATT tmobile deal as it
would with so right I think in that
respect it's it's it's kind of a wash
right red yeah no fair argument for sure
um I wonder if I wonder if this will
have any impact on how Google does
business with the carrier's you know
they weren't t-mobile wasn't the only
one to launch a with google phone for
sure but they've kind of been Google's
go to at least more than any other
carrier for these with Google devices or
kind of the new you know obviously the
g1 g2 the the nexus nexus one was you
know the team
mobile banded and timo will work with
them a little bit when you know that
kind of half-baked attempt to sell the
phones directly without a service plan
that kind of thing and I wonder you know
I think it was coincidence that this
week you saw you know sprint at CTA with
a bunch of Google devices but just kind
of going forward to be interesting I
mean there's a lot that's interesting to
think about with what's going to happen
with Android and sort of that split
between the premium Android devices and
then the ones that the carriers are you
know perhaps going to more and more look
to modify to suit their own needs
something came out today the Angry Birds
developers posted on their facebook page
that ATT is going to be putting the
amazon appstore on at least some AT&amp;amp;T
phones going forward which we knew they
would have to be and to tell you the
truth I don't lose do they lose sight of
the fact that Android and Google is now
the elephant in the room ok ATT cannot
afford to ignore or or or give short
attention to Android they can't write
because they've got nowhere else to go
windows microsoft is shooting themselves
in the foot with muslim seven every
single day it's it's like there's
nowhere else for them to turn and
they're gonna have to play ball if they
want to play ball at all you have to
play ball with with google at some point
we are going to see and i'm actually
working on an article about this we are
going to have to see and i think we will
see google realize how big an elephant
in the room it is now in smartphones and
step up to the carriers and get in their
face so you know what this is the way
this is going to work from now on right
yeah otherwise you're out of the game
cuz you got you've got no alternative
here yeah the the sort of faux opens
open-source stance that they have right
now least to me doesn't serve anybody
well it doesn't sir it doesn't serve
Google at all but I do it all I think
that's where they're going to have to
step up because I think this whole
system updates thing that has been
brought to fore from again by Microsoft
yeah is actually been an ongoing common
theme with andrew is fragmented big
carriers have too much control consumers
just flat loose but we don't we don't we
don't enter into the equation at all
right and and that is the wrong to be on
every business level it doesn't even
make sense that's the thing is it still
you know the folks watching out there
saying I'm a consumer i rooted my phone
you know yeah they still win but but if
that's a very small percentage of the
people actually buying phones yeah and
that is not a good reason no to yeah and
that is that's not a good method to have
to get up existing updates but you know
that the absolute the amazon appstore
example is interesting for a number of
reasons but one of which you know it's
there are a means become a joke online
the eight easy steps to installing the
app store which i haven't actually tried
to do but apparently you know it
involves just things that the average
consumer was never meant to do on an
android phone i've done it and you can
actually go online and do it now yeah
and they email you a link and you click
it now they emailed me a link i click
the link and it said install and that's
what i did now and that was ethical T
comes comes with the AT&amp;amp;T phone because
they AT&amp;amp;T locks android phones down to
third party apps yep but as you see
they've already had to back off of that
and that proves how much stroke Google
and Android has even with ATT now I will
say it that the the tides are turning
here
what was the ATT was it the backflip the
AT&amp;amp;T android phone that had yahoo is the
default search engine i forget which one
it was yeah they did that and then they
locked down you see you couldn't install
anything not in the android market which
meant be right no sighs on abs yep yep
but I mean they back down that in two
days but you know the app store it was
big the App Store thing is interesting
because it just sort of highlights you
know Google's sort of almost
non-committal stance if you look at
their actions you know we're open source
but there are these you know sort of
things you can and can't do and it's
also feeding into you know more carrier
controlled way we're doing it now it's a
business for us but we're not going to
step up and lay down the law so that we
can actually realize it as better
business we've got an app an app market
out there but we're gonna you know but
it's okay for somebody else to create
their own app market even if it you know
turns out to be one that's better than
ours just all these different use cases
that that um I don't know I think
they're great that not to dwell on the
Amazon article I'm vm son case I'm
working on an article about that it's
great for somebody like Amazon it's
potentially great for you know a carrier
I mean like sprint if they're Sprint ID
thing or something they can do with it
you know really gets going it's been
great for HTC that they've you know
really built a solid business
customizing sense to run on top of
differentiating their devices that way
but it just you know it's sort of just
neither here nor there for for everybody
from the average consumer to Google
themselves so I I agree with you I think
it will be interesting to see if they do
step up a little more and how they you
know how that's perceived and how they
have they cast it i'm working on an
article on we'll show them how to do it
there you go anna and i hope they do
because i want updates and yeah I want
them when they're available and i wanted
to decide if i apply them or not I mean
it's just that simple right
I paid for the phone and I want control
over what I do with it it's real simple
well you do have control over we're wait
we're we're way over time we got going
and I was watching the timer and we're
way over that's why we could we could I
were just barely scratching the surface
of this stuff oh yeah it's a long topic
one once we got on to updates it was all
over yet yeah I know real quick neither
you nor I was in Orlando this week I'm
going to go out on a limb here and say
the most interesting thing I saw from a
distance was Galaxy Tab 8.9 tablet from
samsung because it's the first honeycomb
device with customized user experience
layer there's a version of TouchWiz it's
basically from what I could tell you
know mostly just widgets and some things
being replaced settings dialog boxes and
stuff but it adds a layer of potential
usability to Honeycomb I hadn't seen
before yeah it looked pretty good yeah
any-anything catch your eye from the
coverage you saw for tablets tablets are
the hot thing right now and we're
starting to get above every size and
their every shape and every color and
it's a good thing I mean competition for
US consumers so we get a lot more choice
all right well you said we're way over
time and the rain is now it didn't light
up let's looking out the windows like
the rain stopped not hasn't stopped
stuff maybe I'll just go run around the
rain for a while anyway James always a
