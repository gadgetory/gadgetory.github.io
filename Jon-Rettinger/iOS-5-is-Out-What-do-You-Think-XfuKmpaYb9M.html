TechnoBuffalo here today is iOS 5 days

iphone 3gs ipad 2 ipad plug it in and
get downloading also enjoy the fact this
is going to be the last time you're
going to have to plug in your device and
download the operating system cuz you're
gonna be able to do it over the air from
here on out so with iOS fire going to
get a ton of new stuff including new
notification center with stuff and
notifications and things that move in a
sort of widget way very Android esque
let's say you're going to be getting
Twitter notifications so hooray for that
you're gonna be getting a message I
don't get me getting a ton of other cool
new features you're gonna get the Wi-Fi
sync that i mentioned lock screen
notifications so hooray for that finally
as well and technobuffalo shirt you this
is not going to come with iOS 5 it just
cuz i'm showing my pride as i go back
down to CTA to check out some new
gadgets so are you guys gonna download
iOS 5 you excited not excited you care
do not care also ipod touch users you
can download as well i fail to mention
it it's available so go do that plug
your phone in and check for updates if
you have itunes open and it says no
update available try quitting iTunes and
restarting it I've been using the gold
master for about a week and it works
it's pretty much exactly the same iOS
you've known to love or hate with a few
new added features i am happy to see I
message though so I can now use it with
other folks that have iOS 5 installed on
their phones and I can do weird stocking
things like see if they've read it and
replied and all kinds of other I message
e stuff that's probably the thing I'm
most excited about for obviously we've
got iCloud and all that other goodness
I'm rambling but you know what are you
gonna do it's funny iOS 5 comes out
today that rim is having another outage
which is multiple multiple many many
outages so I am for the time being not
going to be using blackberry I'm going
to go
back to iphone for a short while before
I think I make a switch over to windows
phone 7 sometimes that HTC Titan comes
out on AT&amp;amp;T that may be my new daily
driver or if you recommend another daily
phone for me leave in the comments down
below leave it in my pants is where I'm
pointing you know only only in video can
