five new phones we were reporting that
this week meanwhile you got Verizon
ending unlimited data plans ATT is
slowing data speed keeping track of all
things
cell phone centric forests is John
reading ur of TechnoBuffalo comm John
thanks for being with us my pleasure
thanks for having me alright so you know
what you said there's just too much to
talk about how about just the best of
the latest and greatest from each of the
major carriers absolutely not
absolutely there are ton of phones to
choose from and it's hard to pick the
best one so from these lists of phones I
have emitted further than one that
everybody knows about and that is of
course the iPhone 4 I've got them
available here in two post-market colors
yeah so we'll talk about AT&amp;amp;T first
we've got the LG thrill this is a full
3d phone it uses something called
stereoscopic 3d which is nerd talk for
glasses-free 3d so without any glasses
you can go ahead and look at this and
see the content coming right out at you
John that would be for somebody who like
likes to watch movies obviously on their
phone right I mean do I really need a 3d
phone
so certainly 3d is an added benefit you
get something like a dual-core processor
processor and a beautiful screen it's
something added to the phone it's great
for 3d gaming and if you really want to
kill your eyes after 20 minutes you're
going to want to turn that off ok great
now you're going to arise inand Android
right yeah boy it's got this charged so
we are continuing the Android trend here
with the Droid Charge this is a full 4G
device you're hearing 4G thrown around
quite a bit
Verizon's 4G which just stands for
fourth generation wireless technology is
fast so you've got a single core
processor with LTE speeds to be able to
pull down network speeds pretty close to
what you get at home this thing is an
absolute speed demon it's a 4.3 inch
droid charge I like knowing about that
again the speed is also important to a
lot of folks to sprint that's my carrier
well let's go ahead and check out sprint
and this guy is brand new for Sprint
this is the Photon 4G keeping with that
4G Trent this is support for Sprint's 4G
WiMAX network beautiful 4.3 inch screen
kickstand on the back it can shoot full
720p video so you have a pocket
camcorder anywhere you want to go all
right
but that's also a touchscreen to some it
is all these are all touchscreen now
t-mobile last one the last one we have
for t-mobile is the mytouch 4G slide and
according to t-mobile and all the press
have been sending out this is the most
advanced camera phone on the market also
rocking Android and I know you like it
he's got a full QWERTY keyboard the
camera on this guy can shoot full sweep
panorama you can do burst modes and
actually it rivals some standalone
cameras that you might get at your local
shop I like that and it has a real
keyboard physical keyboard that's our
t-mobile John roediger over a
TechnoBuffalo awesome thanks so much
