Buffalo to show I'm live your to host
edition on e editor-in-chief the site
i'm joined by deputy managing editor
Todd Hazleton everybody welcome back
Todd thank you and how was your vacation
it was good I did a lot of time spent a
lot of time fishing and kayaking it was
funny I had to outfit my kayak with a
little bit of text so I got like a
bluetooth speaker that was water
resistant so I was cruising with some
jimmy buffett on that and i had a wat i
didn't do like I've looked at waterproof
cases for my iphone but because i have
the 6 plus it's a little big for for
that you know when you add all that bulk
and I've seen the reviews on lifeproof
nuud I know well I've proved new like
doesn't protect this display I don't
know so anyway I went with a bag like
one of those waterproof bags and it so
it was like 10 bucks and it worked
really well because I'm always afraid to
take review units out there oh but it
was a good time is a good time good to
be back well I i leave for my vacation
90 days from today so not that I'm
counting yeah not that bad i'm county
although there will be no kayaking
involved yeah but it's lazy kayaking
yeah well this week now you're here this
week but next week you're gone again yep
gone again on Monday I fly to Berlin for
Aoife which will be fun and busy but I
don't know if it you know it's hard to
tell going into these shows but right
now I'm not so sure it's going to be as
busy as previous years because like
we've said Samsung already had its big
unpacked press conference but they do
have another press conference there so
it's possible we'll learn more right no
burning out of the galaxy the what's the
watch called the gear s2 is going to be
there well so let's just go over them
where the big companies are having press
conferences this year right so I have
one of the big ones in looking at force
lenovo motorola so that's going to be
double up and that's where we might
maybe see like a moto 360 in addition to
i don't think we'll see phones
not motorola phones right because we
already got those but maybe we'll see
tablets and stuff or computers windows
tens out now that's you know just a
guest Huawei has an event where I'm not
sure what to expect with maybe some new
flagships or something like that sony
has an event so maybe we'll see the
Xperia z5 I don't know it might be too
early for that but remember the z4
wasn't that much of a flagship and the
z4 v / verizon is so it's possible to
see that in addition to other sort of
mid-range phones we've seen rumors on
who else do we have on deck obviously
Samsung has its press conference we have
a sous we have a sir so there's a lot
there's a lot going on and that's in
addition to pep calm which is one of the
nights were sort of you you get
accessories like maybe of the phone case
maker has something new or you see like
a new drone or something like that which
is always a fun event at CES and then
obviously some things in between once
you know the show for but Aoife is the I
believe it's the world's oldest radio
show and so it doesn't just include
phones and tablets although that's what
we're there for it also it's a big show
for things like ovens and refrigerators
and all kinds of stuff like that that we
want to receive but right now I the this
is for those that have never gone to Eva
or not heard of Aoife before it is the
european version basically of CES but as
todd said it actually predates CEOs yeah
but yeah it now the one thing I'm not
clear on is I have not been there is
this strictly like press and buyer focus
like CES is or is it open to the public
I believe it opens to the public but
after I leave so I think there's like
there's like these you know the press
and buyer kind of day so it's not like
jam packed with people when i'm there
usually in fact the show floor usually
opens sort of towards the end of our
trip because we have so many press
conferences and things that are ongoing
they don't necessarily use the
conference hall all the time although
i'll be there a lot but the events are
sort of all over the city so lots of
taxis and stuff for this event right now
my of course the big question how much
bratwurst do you concern
yell in Berlin it's like every meal a
lot of it see to me that sounds like you
know a happy place yeah it's great the
food is awesome I thought I am a
bratwurst fan yeah it's up there with
Barcelona which is Mobile World Congress
for food I mean they go back and forth
on which one you like more but I don't
know well at least it's not october so
you won't be in the midst of oktoberfest
that's right although that'd be fun yeah
well we have a couple questions
regarding eva here we have one from
jasper Rex do you think the Nexus funds
will be announced at Aoife also do you
think it will be running Android M well
I think Android M is a given yeah I
think though the announcement window is
really up in the air right now yeah I
think I I don't think it's not typically
like Google to use Aoife for this for
those announcements but I mean you know
you think the rumors are LG and Huawei
and they both should have events rumor
has it LG's event though is more focused
on TVs and stuff I'm not so sure it's
healing LG phone here well I think
Google will probably have its own event
for that may be in New York or something
in the fall if you look to last year
things around October we got the nexus 6
and Android marshmallow six-point oh
yeah I think we'll see that sir yeah and
we have a question from such a ball that
kind of ties into this with Android M
what was each of your predictions is the
name for Android M now called
marshmallow so I'm gonna go off if ever
just saying because I did want to
address this move this episode I hate
the name marshmallow i I've never been a
fan of the word marshmallow to begin
with yeah it's not a word that I like as
for what our personal predictions were I
was I really was believing it was going
to be milkshake see I wasn't as
convinced with milk shake I know a lot
of people were because that guy had i
think it was during google i/o his
android wear a watch face was a
milkshake but then he was like oh no
it's just teasing well i mighta leave
him like way further back later yeah I
know milkshake seemed really possible I
think I was so
live in the marshmallow camp but i don't
know i don't remember i was on vacation
last week when Sean told me about this
and I didn't see his text till two days
later so I was sort of like Oh
marshmallow and then it all kind of made
sense you know it's like you know 2020
when you're looking back I thought a lot
of death or a lot of rumors sort of
saying that was going to be it yeah I
tried to leave I try and leave everybody
alone when they're on vacation but I was
like if Todd does not know the Martian
with me yeah well he needs to know that
yeah and we were all sort of convinced
for a long time about meringue right I
think so I don't know yeah I I don't
know it it's just not a name that throws
me now but back to FIFA so we we've got
a ton of stuff that we are fairly
certain is going to be debuted now you
said you weren't a hundred percent sure
on the z5 is there a reason that you
think we might not see it there no I
mean it's totally plausible and I know a
lot of rumors are pointing to it to me
it just seems like why have a z4 just a
few months ago and it's e5 now for a
company and struggling financially in
the mobile business seems to make no
sense to have done that so yeah I mean
maybe we'll see that in z5 I just don't
think it's a smart move of Sony to be
troubling back on betting that's
expensive to do that to research and
develop and create all these different
phones unless what you have is Izzy five
that's essentially the z4 V and if you
remember the seaport v4 verizon is uh is
basically the c-4 with a quad HD display
so I don't know speaking of all the
items that we may possibly see they're
such a ball ass what do you think will
be announced at E 4 215 moto 360 2015
more upcoming Android wear devices I
think Android wear devices almost have
to be there in some capacity and we've
heard rumors to a couple of them yeah it
sounds like we'll see whatever the new
Moto 360 is in addition to possibly
something from Huawei asuste I mean they
all have their press conferences and now
will be the time to announce the
masseuse unveiled its and watch last
year there so it just sort of makes
sense to do it again this year moto 360
is just going to be interesting because
you would have thought it would have
been at the motorola event New York
couple weeks back but now it's
it's under lenovo right Lenovo's
motorola mobility so motorola I mean
will no bow could be the one that
introduces the Moto 360 which is to
change of pace here but yeah I was
almost going to say gear s2 but then I
remember don't know that's Tyson now
right right yeah uh which actually leads
us into a question from oh I there's no
way I'm going for grants this first name
correctly so I'll just go with Shaw is
it a big deal the gear s2 uses Tizen
rather than Android wear um I I feel
samsung I think every company needs to
not be so reliant on google but going
completely out on your own seems risky
and Tyson I just I don't know hey Todd
what are your thoughts my thoughts are
that Tizen runs really well it's smooth
for you know getting through the various
onboard apps who were created by Samsung
so whether and maybe sports core stuff
like that weird fall short though
continually is on the apps available to
for it so while you might have CNN and
the ones that Samsung's partnered with
and I know it has its it has opened up
its developer program it's going to come
down to like what else can it do because
apps it's always fallen short there even
in comparison Android wear and the Apple
watch so that's what I'm most concerned
about but otherwise Tyson's pretty sweet
especially on a watch like it runs
really well yeah I just don't know I and
once again it's to me every operating
system is about the apps and you know
unfortunately it's going to be hard for
any new operating system to break in at
this point because of that right right
now yeah that's where they all struggle
and why Samsung is you know even months
ago was calling on developers to come
and build apps for this round SmartWatch
that's how he started to learn more
about the gear s2 before it was even
official so maybe it has a bunch you
know of great apps to highlight right
away which would be cool yeah from 94
Keegan Todd why have you returned this
week haha
nothing yet because I didn't really buy
anything yes but you see when you were
talking about the kayak and yeah I
didn't like I have a feeling so that
stuff went back I do most of my stuff
was for that I bought like an anchor and
all yeah not yet returned so uh from yas
heart will Samsung's gear as to have a
physical turning watch face that's been
the rumor that was the rumor but then we
saw the images yeah okay we we've lost
Lud up there you know yep you're back
laughs we had a day yesterday where the
product guy or whatever was wearing it
and it didn't look like it had the
physical of turning dial so we'll have
to find out ok moving on here we have a
lot of beef of questions we're going to
try to get to them all from such an Baja
hey Todd how does Aoife compared to CES
or mobile world congress and which is
your favorite to attend and why um it's
not as hectic well it is very hectic
because I'm going around the city and
efa's the trade show is massive so it's
really hard to kind of get around and
the buildings are all over the place
Mobile World Congress is my favorite I
really like Barcelona you get to the
trade show floor it's got two levels or
three levels and you it's just a
straight row right so you like know
where you're going you get there but
that's the craziest in terms of crowds
and all that and then there see you
guess which I you know it's not the best
not my favorite show well I think perv
CS is Vegas yeah yeah it's just there's
not a whole and nothing against the
people of Vegas it just it just doesn't
hold a whole lot of allure to me but
yeah so I think Mobile World Congress is
probably my favorite and I love
Barcelona subway system so I rely on
that to get to and from the event from
an apartment I stay and so it's very
useful convenient i should say yeah
folks for you we are not in
sponsored in any way shape or form tada
and I a couple two years ago we found
you the apartment on yer ba yeah we we
found an apartment on Airbnb that has
just worked out spectacularly for him in
Barcelona it that was wasn't that also
your first experience using my first and
only time i use airbnb yeah I've never
studied in an Airbnb location but I
helped you book that the first time in
it seems to have gone amazingly well
right yep there's just something about
seeing in other people's places I'm just
like hahaha well the thing is you know
background it's owned by somebody from
airbnb so it's not like it's sort of
just like a hotel room that's an
apartment yeah yeah with a it's a
whatever it is it works great let's see
from brazen Franco interesting question
with the rumors of the z5 how does sony
man she released a new flagship every
six month does its fanbase suffer from
virus roars well I think it runs into
that trouble but I mean I guess these
companies can release phones as often as
they want just you know when you're
acquiring all these components to do it
and you have to acquire say hundreds of
thousands millions if you're selling
millions of phones but I say hundreds of
thousands cuz I don't know how many
xperia z4 say so but say they bought
millions of parts and now how many of
those are they not using like if they're
if they're upgrading the processors and
the snapdragon 810 zar gone and if
they're using 820 now they have millions
of those and it just seems like a waste
of money but usually it seems like I
hear that development times are about a
year for these phones so perhaps it had
been in development and they had these
leftover parts from another phone and
they were like okay let's make a c4 you
know keep our name in the headlines
that's the thing to you want to remain
relevant you know and keep releasing
phones but if you can release a flagship
and you really something and that's what
you get when you have you know for
example on m9 or you have a seat of c-4
where they're just not as flagship as
you know g4 galaxy s6 and stuff
yeah it um I don't know it's odd how
fast they do release phones it's like
they don't allow any of them to really
catch on in the marketplace yeah are
they like okay that Phil let's build
another one and then that's a lot of
money and that's where you have
companies like Sony where their mobile
business is doing so bad there's been
rumors so we're going to exit but I
don't think they are an exit the market
well we're going to move on to some non
Aoife questions although they're no more
than peppered throughout the episode but
we're getting a lot of questions about
other topics and another one from brazen
Franco note 5 S Pen design flaw or user
stupidity personally for me it's a
design flaw they should have made
impossible to insert backwards like on
the previous models Todd and I actually
had a long conversation about this this
morning we did who were both it yeah it
kind of falls on both sides of the
argument yes they should have made it
impossible but secondly how many people
in this world are going to do that i I
don't know it's a tough one yeah it
seems like you know I some journalists
or whoever bought the device it
accidentally did that you know made this
mistake and was like whoa i damaged the
phone and that's where it's a design
problem right like okay you should allow
your users or at least assume they're
gonna make mistakes I mean I've reviewed
all the notes since the first one I
can't I've never tried to insert it with
the the front you know into the device I
always put the tail end in second so
that's to me just seems weird and like
you know kind of I don't want to say
stupidity but just like a user error
right a very big user error then but it
should not break the phone if that user
error happens and then the case I
believe it passes one sort of switch
that damages the phone and then it has a
potential of getting stuck at the top so
yeah it shouldn't have you know it
shouldn't fit directly like that but
again this is you have the benefit of
like having that click mechanism
that people like as opposed to point out
with your fingernail and so I think
there's lots of trade-offs and how did
samsung mess that up i don't know but
you know they did yeah it's it's an odd
situation i have not personally handled
the note 5 so i don't know how what the
likelihood is of you potentially putting
it in backwards I've had previous notes
my mother is a big fan of the note
series I don't you know I've asked her
she said she's never know accidentally
done it backwards so yeah I understand
when Shawn and I were talking this
morning at first when we first saw the
reports were like oh do they mean that
if you insert it sort of upside down
where you still have the tip of the pad
going right now that would have been
crazy yeah never which I would have been
like wow that's crazy but to me if
you're putting the back end in I mean
don't you remember how you took it out
yeah you push the back end it there
wasn't a tip there so uh uh from Titan
Cronus what microphones are you using I
am using a blue microphones yeti with a
shock mount also by blue just a generic
pop filter and all of its mounted on a
road ro de arm and I believe you're
using the snowball yep and I think it's
broken because it's not working properly
at least they might work for audio here
but it's not working properly with my
computer yeah so again not sponsored by
blue we just happen to like their
microphones yeah I think they have a lot
of sales to you so I remember when I was
buying this you were like oh look at
blue because i'm not a big microphone
guy but it seems to have worked well for
me yeah i've been using the Yeti for
years now i think i've had this i think
i've had this Yeti for five years now
Wow for mr. double fist can you share
one plus two invite with me we do not
have a need to just hand out but if you
head over to technobuffalo right now we
are running a giveaway for 50 invites
which ends i believe on friday and then
when plus will be emailing them to the
winter so enter the contest and you
might win one mm-hmm from Jesper
x what do you think of the camera hump
on the new a nexus phone I think it's
horribly ugly yeah it looks really ugly
I was trying to figure that out like I
don't know why it has to be there but uh
you know if it take for me the humps are
always worth it that sounds fun the
third if you're getting great pictures
right like on a Lumia 1020 that thing
had think i have one floating around
here I mean that thing had a huge camera
but I don't I had a huge camera bump but
it took great pictures so I'm willing to
work with these phones you know like if
it takes awesome pictures and it's worth
it like with the iphone 6 plus right
everybody's complaining about the ring
and now it doesnt sit or they did like
that's looks silly to me yeah it's worth
it you know talking about all these
humps is just got black eyed peas now
running through me right these lovely
camper humps yeah but no seriously
because the thing is people say they're
like oh it's got this camera bump and
then they're like you know when it
doesn't have the bump because the
modules thick so when it doesn't have
the bump that's because they made the
phone thicker and then people really go
this phones too thick so it's like you
know you got a give-and-take here until
the technology catches up but for me
it's totally worth it or you know what
get rid of the hump make the phone fat
and give me a big battery of I'm happy
yeah I would much rather have a bigger
battery yeah let's see we've got a lot
of other interesting questions here from
Titan Cronus and I am not positive what
this is about what are your thoughts on
the mezz e99 classics that will be at
Aoife I not sure what that is I don't
know either if you want to submit
another question and give us a clue as
to what that is exactly well be happy i
don't have the question box open so i
don't know if it's messy as in the
socket mmm eazy-e oh I don't know yeah
I'm not sure either uh from such an
Mahal off topic how often do you guys
played video games in which systems do
you guys have I have all the current
systems plus all the last generation
systems and the nintendo super nintendo
mi dreamcast and my gamecube
yeah I have a lot of gaming systems
primarily lately it's mainly been on the
ps4 though because I that's why I got
destiny on a best things about all i've
been playing as of late which systems do
you have again Todd I have xbox one and
ps4 died had the Wii U but I sold it
because I I love I loved it but I didn't
play it as much as the others my wife
was like get rid of one of them did you
sell it yeah I sold it I didn't return
it i sold it okay yeah because it was it
was the Zelda edition version in any
case I play the ps4 mostly because i
bought Elder Scrolls online on that and
it's the same thing like that south park
episodes the one all my friends got all
the staffers are technically but most of
us have PS force some of us have both
ps4 Xbox ones but it's just what i end
up on I don't play all that frequently
though I was on last night for a little
bit I don't know at the end of the day
like you I think I sort of kind just
want to get away from screams from zilch
do you think manufacturers that just
announced their devices motorola samsung
1 plus will make an appearance at e fo
well we know samsung is there for sure
and i believe you said Motorola's there
as well yeah with with Lenovo so right
there and I wouldn't be surprised to see
their phones sort of on display at the
lenovo booth but and samsung of them
will definitely have their phones on
display but it's just that you know i
don't know that there's going to be a
huge phone focus from those companies
it's always possible Aoife very often is
where we go and you know Samsung will
then announce some mid-range phones
there for the global market or you know
they're only going to launch in you know
Korea or something like that and so
they're not you know American focus and
that's why they're announced abroad same
thing with LG same thing with all these
companies so it's possible we'll see
some other phones just not flagships
yeah like iterations yeah I think most
of the flag ships have sailed of course
the the other mainstay of eva is
probably next week we'll get the invites
to the apple event
yeah it it amazes me that people don't
realize what Apple's doing when they do
that mmm I take the focus off everybody
else it a police interrogation during
someone else's event so that they get in
on the news cycle without peg to be at
the event it's kind of brilliant yeah Oh
from Benjamin McDonald what price do you
think the new LG Nexus will land on that
was a really good question yeah I don't
know depending on which specs you
believe for I mean for a little while it
sounded like it was going to be kind of
low end and then now we're back up to
like Snapdragon 808 which is cool like
300 or 400 dollar range i'd like to see
that then we'll see the hallway maybe a
little more expensive but that's purely
a guess who will kind of be the nexus 6
came in a little expensive last year a
lot of people like whoa but Nexus 6 has
some pretty great specs or did still
does okay all right so we got a follow
up al I'll link you because these are
just super sexy looking um so we got
follow-up from Titan Cronus about meza
he says is actually the pronunciation
meza is a Romanian headphone company
that designs excellent wooden headphones
that deliver amazing sound they are
releasing a quote flagship unquote pair
of studio headphones by the name of 99
classics to replace the old 88 classics
which I have we don't typically do
headphones but Dan those are nice okay
oh cool look really awesome you know
I've never tried would headphones I've
heard they're amazing huh so they
actually take advantage of the wood it's
not just sort of yeah they actually take
it from what I understand it's just a
better sound reproduction and the wood
is actually integral to the design huh
nice yeah trying to find these guys I
mean like I said sometimes what happens
is the show floor I I'd have to look at
my calendar but the show floor is on
always open for the first couple days
that were there so you know this this
company might be there but and we're on
the grounds and we're walking around but
you can't actually like go to the boots
they're still often building the show
how're ya about once a year in shows
where yeah yeah but once every Aoife you
end up tweeting me a photo of something
you see off in the distance that your
lab an approach right right it's usually
just construction crews so it's kind of
a weirder show or you know for mobile
world congress and see yes we get there
there's like a day or two for press and
then it's open and this one where I
think maybe it's open the last they were
there so it's very different yeah uh
from Shah which sir if you would send me
a pronunciation of your name on twitter
of your first name i would gladly start
say your first name but i have a feeling
i would absolutely mangle it if I tried
uh what do you guys think the major
difference between the Moto X pure and
play cameras will be i'm not i'm not
sure that there's a huge difference I've
seen the earlier reviews that the play
is really good and that's what Motorola
promise for both if if there's any
difference it might just be in the in
the sensor use of the modules might be a
more expensive one in the Moto X pure
but otherwise I'm not so sure that
that's going to be one of the
differences i think they didn't
sacrifice there because in the past
consumers have sort in reviewers and
sort of said motorola falls a little
short on the camera side and this year
they tried to change that so i think
they caught they put the cost savings in
other components but I could be totally
wrong I don't know the modules
interviews in both phones from Jasper
Rex which phone would you recommend for
a heavy smartphone user when I use my
note 3 I get it down to about ten
percent after four to five hours I've
been looking at the Moto at play x but
I'm not sure you can include rumored
phones well it says to me you just need
something with a gigantic battery yeah I
don't know about that well the Moto X
play could be the the option for you if
you're not even know need the processing
power I think that's where it's going to
save on battery life
to otherwise it I would look at you know
the note 5 is a great phone our review
is going to be going up in the next
couple days you don't have expandable
storage though but I've found so far in
my test battery life is ok I'm getting
through a date depends on how you use it
and again we have the European model so
i don't have LTE running on it which is
also a battery drain g4 is a grey phone
for power users that sort of want the
extra battery I mean you can just
replace it and it has expandable storage
it really depends on what you're looking
for in a phone but I like those 200
completely off topic but I wanted to
bring it up during the show Todd you're
already familiar with this the the
special event that happened this morning
to TechnoBuffalo yeah for those that may
not have seen all of us retweeting it
but David Prowse who is better known as
the man who wore the darth vader costume
he was not the voice of Darth Vader he
wore the darth vader costume in the
original trilogy mr. Prowse has been
following John on Twitter for some time
and then some time this morning which
since he lives in England was sometime
during the day for him let me find the
exact tweet that he sent out and of
course twitter is not cooperating with
me at the moment hold on hold on come on
okay there we go okay so there it is mr.
Prowse said where does darth vader get
his geek / tech news at john for lakers
and at technobuffalo of course hashtag
darth vader hashtag Lord geek pretty
slow you know although it does concern
me does this align us too closely with
the dark side yeah I was wondering the
same thing you know are we cutting out
the rebels from our reader base by
aligning ourselves with the Galactic
Empire yeah the Galactic Empire is a fan
of technical I know and so I guess that
means we also have to root for the first
order and awakens
it but you know when lord Vader himself
you know anoints you his favorite tech
site yeah you gotta you gotta go with
the times uh speaking of Twitter we have
a question coming in over there from k
max 823 Shawn piane what do you think of
the apple ipad pro i am not a fan of the
concept of 12 inch tablets mmm i got it
before i got to see why that screen real
estate is needed i am a fan if it's nice
and thin in light like in using on
external keyboard and actually like i've
said in previous shows if I can do work
on it like actual work which I tried to
do on other tablets and I mean I have
the surface pro 3 I can do work on
Windham willing to put up with a
keyboard but what if I get a real work
on it then I'm all for that larger
screen because you know it's perfect for
throwing in the bag and do it otherwise
yeah but it's going to be expensive too
I mean it's going to be expensive yes
I'll probably pair with a bluetooth
keyboard right here but at that point
why not just carry a macbook air yeah
exactly you know and I'm on a plane you
know I already have enough trouble
finding a good home for a 9.7 inch
screen you know when I'm watching a
movie trying to pop out this 12-inch
yeah thing around I'd I and this we've
heard rumors we had other rumors today
of who was at Amazon and Microsoft both
maybe concerning 12 inch tablets I'm
just not a fan of the concept in general
yeah well I mean Microsoft might do it
right because I think they'll have like
a detachable keyboard and stuff like
that and I know you said it's too big
but for people like me where I need a
little more space to do work and
especially if Apple has a multitasking
that Microsoft does then you know I'm
interested but for me I probably more
excited about the surface pro 4 my only
concern is that they're expensive like
very expensive Dale Sam Pat thank you he
makes a great point didn't Darth Vader
moved to the good side after death he
did you're right he became a force ghost
at the end of Return of the Jedi even
though it was never David Prowse as the
first ghost but Sebastian Stan as the
first ghost and then they replaced him
with Hayden Christensen but you're
correct he went back to the light side
of the force were saved we don't have to
go with the Empire uh yay oh let's see
we've got a lot of other questions here
from brazen Franco with Samsung dropping
the ball on expandable storage and user
replaceable battery on the note 5 are
there any other style of stylist focused
phones icans consider to replace the
note line of devices that's a excellent
question i'm not sure none that I've
used not stylist focus but if you look
at what LG does they have their quick
actions or whatever I forget was called
and then you can use your finger for
cropping or taking notes on the screen
or a third-party stylist and they're
like three bucks on amazon but nothing
sort of as advanced as as what Samsung's
offering in the United States you look
at show me and other companies i believe
they have their own kind of devices not
that i've used so i can't really comment
on them oh ok this is an interesting
question from q guy i want to get a
robot that i can use what should I get
well it depends on what you want the
robot to do I saw yesterday there's a
robot that was purely used for taking
off like noodles into a noodle pan like
yes I I've seen that before yeah it's
like yeah it's being used in ramen shops
in Japan that thing was awesome yeah
that's been that's been around for a
year to now it's kind of looking raising
it seems to work perfectly by me of
course you know there's other robots
that you can go out and buy now I you
know like the roombas the scuba and all
that's the most of the stuff for my
robot right yeah and see that's always
been my problem with the definition of
robot and consumer technology because so
many of them are
mote controlled devices technically
right like we had the digital presence
robot in the office for a while that's
considered a robot but it didn't just
move on its own right you controlled it
right now I robot you know my the room
but I have it goes off on its own does
its own merry little thing which is
always so entertaining to my dogs but
what is this dad why's it doing dust
from Nick ner do you think the iphone
with the force touch display will work
with the supposed pen that should work
with the unannounced iPad pro that's a
whole lot of supposed yeah it's too many
for me yeah look just first off the pin
was a patent so apple patents lots of
things almost every day there seems to
be a new apple patent does not
necessarily mean it's ever going to be
produced the ipad pro is also a huge
rumor all that being said if the pin is
real yes it probably would work with the
force touch iphone yeah but but i don't
think apples get i would say i'm
probably almost positive apples not
going to design the iphones force touch
to specifically work with the pen i
think it's supposed to be forced touches
in your finger as yeah apple watch as it
is on my macbook here that kind of stuff
from such a mahal off topic i don't know
if we even have a topic anymore is it
worth getting an Android wear device or
get a pebble time I already have a nexus
6 and original pebble watch um honestly
the pebble time it would which I am
wearing I like it but I not sure I like
it as much as the original pebble I do
have to charge it more often and the
color screen doesn't make that big of a
difference right if you're happy with
your pebble I would just stick with it
yeah Android wear is a lot different I
like Android wear you know but
if you're using a nexus 6 but uh you're
going to be charging a lot more and I
would obviously wait until the next
bunch of devices are announced probably
next week so yeah I'm still in the Apple
watching I like you a lot from Tyler
Eberhardt how about the rumored
blackberry Venice good idea excited for
the keyboard I think that blackberry
still makes awesome hardware that being
said it's been so long since I've used a
physical keyboard and I'm so used now to
using on-screen keyboard I don't know
how much of a difference that actually
makes to me uh but I'll definitely give
it a try yeah I'm up for giving it a try
I'd love to use a physical keyboard with
with Android again I don't think we've
seen that since like a man I can't
remember the old names oh god I mean
there were a bunch back in a day
sidekick thought oh well yeah eventually
it launched an Android sidekick they had
to click see liq AT&amp;amp;T had that one that
was just a square big yeah I would be
all over that and of course the first
and let us not forget the HTC chacha
yeah that's for like cha-cha-cha in some
markets yes it depend on each I'll die
yeah that's right but yeah I think
blackberry does a good job with that so
I'd like I'm interested uh that that
phone still makes me laugh yeah it's a
facebook phone because we put on a
dedicated facebook button yeah ah that's
so bizarre oh my speaking now let's see
here lounging on down the line from such
an Mahal off topic I don't know why I
keep bothering to say that will we be
seeing more limited edition
technobuffalo t-shirts in the future
also i love the first and only one that
you guys did back at the end of June
early July it's great well yeah we love
that sure it's great shirt um
it if we're doing more limited editions
I know we've discussed it I don't know
where we are in the process but there's
a chance there will be more limited
editions I just don't know when if how
or why and we still have our other store
you can buy the other merchandise yep
yep and then from spreadshirt you can
still get our regular t-shirt so yeah
there are there are still talking about
flow shirts but the limited edition
shirt is done and gone mm-hmm let's see
here I suppose I should address this
question from Rodrigo Gary since he has
the Red Lantern logo which means he
could you know shoot me with his rage at
any time uh geek joke anyway is the uno
plus two as good as the first or this
time it get below the expectations what
is the new one last year I'm assuming oh
there you go I can't see the question
yeah is he gonna put oh there's too many
names out there for me to have gone by
now one place uh so is the one plus two
as goods the first or this time is a
below the expectations I haven't gotten
to use one yet me neither and I'm not
interested in buying one this time so
yeah I'm and that's not a slam on one
plus it's just simply we have too much
to buy yeah I bought the one last year I
feel like there was a lot of hype around
it and I you know I bought into the hype
literally and then this year because I
wasn't a huge fan of if you listen the
show I wasn't a huge fan of the first
one so I'm kind of just like no thanks
but some people love it so if you love
the first one might as well give it try
second well we're going to close out
with one more question then we're gonna
in this week's show quick housekeeping I
not sure if there's going to be a show
next week yet because with Aoife going
on it's going to be crazy and then the
following week if the apple event is
happening as rumored on Wednesday we of
course would not have the show on
wednesday we moved to thursday but just
keep an eye on the site for
announcements of when technobuffalo
shows will be happening from Alex
Padilla 1+2 or Moto X style bad as a
question I've been asking myself and
what is it I toward is because I'm on
tmobile now and if i buy the Moto X I
would not get Wi-Fi calling that being
said I really want a moto x yeah i think
i'm going with moto x style i mean i
love the Moto G yeah and that's like not
even I i think i've done the oneplus
thing and again we're not slamming 1
plus it's just well we did it you know I
don't know if we need to do it again yep
that's how I feel I like the
customization options i love Motorola's
software updates you know barely there
but just sort of adds to android pricing
seems right camera sounds like it's
great so yeah so I don't know we'll see
well that is going to bring this week's
episode to a close as i said i'm not
positive there will be a show next week
it depends on a lot of factors with todd
being out of town and if i can get
someone to sit in form and then the week
after that is possibility the iphone
event so that show may move around or it
may not happen at all we'll just have to
see but hopefully you know we won't go
