technobuffalo here flows you that have
been followed me for a while you may
remember that about a year ago I ready
to some problems with dell's customer
service while trying to return the 24
inch monitor a long story short I
ordered the wrong one in the next day
and tried to return it I ran into a
decent amount of issues with Dell which
I documented in the video that I called
appropriately enough dear dell well that
I think I've got a lot of play and
caught the attention of some del senior
executives of who I spoke to and sort of
recounted my experience I figured that
if it happened to me and I had a voice
like that could speak for you guys
should maybe happen to you as well so
del promised me that they were going to
make changes to customer service and
really the first change that I saw was a
creation of a few Twitter accounts from
dell customer service rep so you can
talk to directly and get your issues
resolved sort of the next phase of that
improvement of customer service adele is
starting something called a consumer
advisory panel it's a day-long event
it's Dells headquarters in Austin where
they sit down with the media bloggers
and consumers and talk about some of the
issues that are facing Dell and i was
invited to attend so actually this
wednesday morning very early Adele was
going to fly me out to Austin for the
consumer advisory panel I'm going to
talk to Ellen sir tell them what
happened and what I think they can do to
improve so like for you guys sort of
give your experiences that you've had a
with Dell and made messages that i can
bring with me to dallas consumer
advisory panels we can make for a much
better consumer experience up for all of
us i'm hoping we might get a chance to
see some of those new product line and
hopefully they'll let me videotape and i
can share with you guys as well i'm
looking forward to sort of being a i
guess a consumer advocate and i've had a
lot of problems but companies the past
I've had no voice and the fact that sort
of you and this media has given me a
voice go to go voice these concerns i
guess is really a blessing and I want to
try and fight for everyone so if you
have problems you have concerns or
anything you want me to address again
leave them down below and
me know what you think and I'll be sure
to do a ton of videos sort of recapping
the experience here whether than I think
it was worth while they're not worth
while you guys know me I will be very
honest both good or bad so I'm really
kind of curious how it's going to go
anyway that's all I wanted to share with
you guys and I will see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
