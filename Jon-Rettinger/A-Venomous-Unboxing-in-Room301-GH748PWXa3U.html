John Richter from TechnoBuffalo here and
this video was supposed to be brought to
you in a Mountain View California but
instead maps look us astray we're in
this I guess appropriately creepy hotel
for what turned out to be a Halloween
video so instead of doing a regular
unboxing I figured I'd take a few
questions and show you what I've got
inside his GoPro case it's a bit of a
spoiler let's go ahead and jump right in
alright so first question comes from at
snape 31 and he wants to know what's
your worst fear snakes I'm sure added
100 times snakes I've been around them
twice in my life once when I was a kid
and I remember my heart feeling like
we're going to jump out of my
chest there's something about them
scares me I've had nightmares about them
as far back I can remember as long as I
never have to unbox a snake pretty good
okay so what I've gotten here is a
collaboration between Google and GoPro
this is these 16 hero4 rockin Odyssey
camera in the Odyssey it's not just for
minivans anymore
