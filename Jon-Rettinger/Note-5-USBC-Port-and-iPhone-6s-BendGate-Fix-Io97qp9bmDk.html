to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the marked in Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup we're talking galaxy note5
Moto X 2015 i phone 6s and dual lens
camera systems coming to your favorite
smartphones this is rumor roundup let's
go ahead and get started it seems that
we can't go more than a day without a
new Moto X sleek the device surfaced on
Tuesday would what look like a
fingerprint scanner in the back but a
fresh set of photos tells a different
story
according to hello moto Hongkong the
Moto X won't sport a fingerprint reader
at all it turns out the leak may have
been an older engineering model
suggesting Motorola considered adding
the feature but decided against it the
same report also reveals an entirely new
smartphone with what looks like Shi
wireless charging built into the back
hello moto hongkong suggests this could
be a new Nexus device though this is the
first time we're hearing that Motorola
might be working with Google on a new
stock Android device this year there's a
lot to process here though we already
had a feeling Motorola was prepping
several new smartphones for later this
year now hopefully it won't be too long
before the company starts rolling out
some of these devices remember Ben gate
Apple ran into some problems last year
thanks to the numerous reports showing
the iPhone 6 plus could Bend under what
some would argue minimal pressure but it
looks like Apple could take extra
efforts to make sure that won't happen
again
Taipei Times reports the catcher which
supplies metal frames for Apple HTC and
others is developing its toughest alloy
yet company chairman Alan horn admitted
the switch could slow down its
production cycle still it may be worth
it if it means Easter to your iPhone
iPhone 6s and 6s plus are expected to
include plenty of upgraded hardware
including new processors additional RAM
sharper displays and a better camera
forced touch may also make the cut now
we can also add a tougher metal casing
to that list of course there's no
guarantee these rumors will come true
still we wouldn't be surprised if Apple
is pushing for a tougher metal alloy
after last year's bendgate Fiasco add
Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 to the list of
rumored devices that may pack a USBC
port a new report out of China claims
the upcoming phablet will adopt a
reversible charging port along with a
few upgraded specs beyond the new USB
connector the galaxy note 5 is expected
to offer an upgraded processor and more
storage
according to Zola comm the device will
pack a new XE no 74
twenty-two chip in a super-fast ufs 2.0
flash developed by Samsung earlier this
year the report also backs up earlier
claims at the node five will feature a
2k 5.8 nine inch display along with a
4100 milliamp battery samsung won't
officially announce the Galaxy Note 5
until later this year but we already
have a pretty good idea what to expect

check out last but not least Apple and
Samsung are reportedly committed to
feature dual rear cameras and future
smartphones a feature we've already seen
on other devices like the One m8 Apple
first sparked rumors that it could pack
an extra camera into its next iPhone
earlier this year when it bought links
the Israeli company to develop a camera
module to feature two and even four
lenses meanwhile samsung's new XE news
processor may apparently support a
similar dual camera setup stashing two
cameras on the back of a device has a
number of potential benefits like the
ability to play with the focus of a
photo in post and also offer improved
color precision and clearer images we're
still not sure whether the new camera
design will make into the iPhone 6s and
galaxy note5 though it sounds like both
companies may be pretty far along and
implementing the new technology anyways
