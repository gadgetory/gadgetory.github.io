technobuffalo here when we lost to go
look at palms app catalog Dupree had
just launched it was still in beta and
was limited to only just about 20
applications a lots changed in a few
months since the pretty launched the
pixies come out and the app catalog now
has many many more applications although
it is still technically in beta as you
can see from the big beta ribbon up at
the top I wanted to show you some of the
new applications that have made its way
into the palms app catalog and to see
what you can expect if you're looking to
pick up a pre or pixi all applications
will work on both devices so first one
of the things that you'll notice and
i'll show you in just a minute you don't
have the ability to buy applications
before it was everything was free there
are now paid application that developers
can create in order to buy them you need
to have a credit card attached to your
palm profile just a bit of a heads up so
when you launch the application this is
what you're going to see you get a list
of featured across the top and there's a
few kind of fun ones here there's a
flight wave a Twitter application a mall
application some flash cards you can
search whatever you'd like now it's
changed a little bit the categories
initially we're showing right below but
now you have to hit explore to see what
the categories are and I'll show you
what some applications they have in here
and what you can expect so the
categories are now broken down into
books business education entertainment
finance food games health and fitness
lifestyle and music navigation news
photography productivity reference
social networking sports travel and
weather a lot more categories because
there are a lot more applications and
when we last take a look at it so let me
show you some of these in show you what
can expect one of the things that I
knocked the pre for was the app calendar
thought it was a great feature and had a
lot of potential but there was nothing
in it let's sort of been remedy there's
a lot more coming at least according to
palm let's take a look here at
entertainment everybody likes to be
entertained and this still makes you
laugh adult entertainment it's not what
you'd expect Oh what was the first thing
I clicked on
so there are no applications found there
but it's funny that they list a category
for that so to go back we'll just swipe
back in this gesture area we'll take a
look at all to be out of entertainment
category so a lot of games board fortune
ball Fandango notice these applications
are free a low some here look like they
are going to cost you a bit of money
they're gonna range anywhere from 99
cents up to 10 or 20 bucks and there are
some that really uh really do cost a few
bucks although what you can get here
that you can't get with say the iphone
for example you can get a full working
version of google voice which is quite
nice what kind of scroll through here so
you can see what the applications are
and of course what App Store app catalog
to be complete without a few fart
applications so there is of course p
fart snow globe and some of these
probably shouldn't cost as much as the
cost and you can see they've been rated
one star or less so we'll go back and
take a look at some of the other
categories we have here let's go to
games i play a lot of games on my phones
nice to have the option on the palm
webos devices as well and this is just
pulling all this in over the e video
network for sprint because the pixi does
not have Wi-Fi the PTL fastest a load
and i've got a pretty defense evide
connection right there i've got four out
of five bars so not too shabby now let
you see this in real time how long it
takes things too to load or or in this
case not seem to load
whoever's here are the games let's take
a look at all of them see that we have
when I first had the pre only game that
was available was a demo of connect four
and i loved i played kinect for all the
time so there is Jesus quiz Christmas
looks like somehow I managed to get into
the religious games um topple ball more
bible trivia pegged zombie invasion
games lights there's the ton more here
i'll let you kind of look at them as i
scroll through then it was there before
so if you're worried about jumping over
to a pre or pixi because of the lack of
apps you need not worry there are a ton
available now they're much more coming
especially as the app catalog it slowly
comes out of beta so guys i want to give
you a demonstration of what the palm app
catalog look like to you can see on your
own if it's something that you're
interested in and there's the icon for
the app catalog to be upper left hand
corner i'm very impressed with that
things work very well you just hit
download downloads and installs just as
you could expect and it does it
relatively quickly hope you enjoy guys
