to you by what's up everyone welcome
back to episode of Retton Jers risks I'm
Yours John renters to show where I rant
and rave and talk about anything that's
in my mind very clear what's been in my
mind this week cloud hacking and dirty
dirty selfie pictures getting leaked on
the Internet's we talk about it what you
can get protect yourself just a little
totalization on what's come out the past
few days this renders rifts start
riffing so unless you've been living in
internet cave and if you're watching
this video
I guess that's impossible they were just
a ton of celebrity nude semi nude fake
nude pictures that leaked out over the
past couple days and they came from
iCloud hacking now you're probably gonna
think to yourself thinking that I
thought was whoa Apple watch so damn
vulnerable it turns out though the
attacks were done essentially using
brute force tactics what that means is
just tons and tons and tons of password
attempts until you get it right without
Apple sort of blocking out that access
so Apple has since fixed that and
removed that ability to keep doing that
at least in theory until I can find
another way to do it but there are a lot
of things you can do to help prevent
that happening to you first and we'll
talk about the not taking pictures of
your junk in a minute
the easiest thing you can do is create a
two-step verification Apple has it
Google has it pretty much everything
that requires a password nowadays has to
severe occasion verification what's that
gonna do so in tries to log in to your
account it sends a code to your mobile
device or another email address do you
have to enter in order to get access
it's super easy it makes things really
really reliable and it makes it harder
to get and share accounts I would
definitely go with that and probably the
biggest one is create a password that's
hard to figure out don't use the same
password for everything don't use one
two three four five only an idiot would
use that on their luggage
make a password that is hard to figure
out and make them different for every
domain you use there are a ton of
applications out of create passwords for
you things like one pass
creative crazy hexadecimal password that
you won't be able to remember but you'd
be able to input easily using their app
or their browser plugins it's probably
the safest thing you can do to help
protect yourself and it's not just Apple
sort of almost all of the cloud services
are vulnerabilities blueforce tags or at
least in theory are so just do the best
you can to brand yourself let me stop
that cloud hacking combo for a quick
second remind you if you want to start a
website that was a really good time to
do it do it today with GoDaddy domain
just are just a dollar ninety-nine cents
just enter promo code $1.99 techno at
checkout but some limitations might
applies to check out the website for
details you creating your own website
back to the video now let's talk about
dem nudie nudie pictures so first
violating anybody's privacy is a big
no-no in my book whether or not you
think these these ladies should have
taken naked pictures of themselves or
had any pictures themselves taken as a
whole other debate but they were taken
and they were theirs and they were taken
right off their phone which is a
obviously a huge huge huge violation of
privacy in violation of self and all
kinds of crazy stuff you look at not
look at them that's more of a personal
thing I'm not here to preach and tell
you one way or another but it is a
grievous violation of privacy the best
way to prevent any of these things ever
coming out is just to never take them
I'm talking to you ladies and gentlemen
in middle school in high school you
think you're gonna be with your
boyfriend/girlfriend forever
no one's ever gonna see that picture
Kyojin get married and have lots of
babies you are not gonna get married
you're probably not gonna have lots of
babies probably not with that person and
they are definitely going to show their
friends consider this a PSA
they're definitely gonna show their
friends those pictures and the friends
are definitely gonna show their friends
and their friends and their friends it's
gonna be embarrassing for everybody
former NBA buss Greg Oden learned the
hard way when he took a picture of his
gentlemen business plenty of celebrities
have gone the same route don't take
pictures of your lady business or your
gentleman business it's the best way for
this to happen otherwise people hack
your account just get pictures like your
dogs
and you you know on a rollercoaster ride
taking selfies just be careful and be
smart cuz then you think are secure are
never that secure that also includes
email just use your mind don't do
anything stupid and just don't send
pictures of your nethers it's just a
good good rule of thumb if you want
something to see your nethers spend with
your house just saying leave the cameras
and cellphones at home so this probably
marks the maybe the only time I've said
that word nethers on camera and probably
the most I've ever said nude or nude
selfie in a video it's always fun here
