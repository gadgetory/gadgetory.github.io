John rhett injure the TechnoBuffalo here
they full review for you of the Motorola
devour this is a new Android smartphone
on Verizon Wireless service currently
only available from Best Buy Mobile for
about a hundred bucks on two-year
contract but it will be able to be
picked up from a Verizon Wireless store
in the near future this is sitting on
top of the older version Android 1.6
with Motorola's own UI scheme called
motoblur which I'll show you in just a
moment and those are you wondering at
home 1.6 is the latest version of
Android that lets you run Google Maps
Navigation so if you have a 1.5 device
you're a dork but 1.6 or newer like this
will let you have free turn-by-turn
directions a pretty nice feature if I
don't say so myself so before we get
into all of these specs and features and
reviews let's talk about the phone
quality because no matter what a food
does it makes crappy phone calls it's
not gonna be as much use to you so my
experience with the Devourer was very
similar to most of the Verizon phones
that I've tested quite good call quality
was crystal-clear I hear no white noise
or distortion on my end caller on the
other end had no distortion or white
noise on their end as well speakerphone
was quite loud there's a very large
grill on the back I was able to even use
it in a car with a phone on my lap and I
could hear the caller just fine and they
could hear me so if you're worried about
this as a phone don't you're going to be
very very happy so let's talk a bit
about the screen since we're gonna be
looking at most of the time it's a 3.1
inch screen with a very very very large
bezel it is a 320 by 480 resolution
16-bit colours have been over 600 or
65,000 the bezel though is a bit weird
this is sort of where the phone gets a
bit quirky it's got a very large front
facade not much of which is taken out by
the screen you've got three capacitive
buttons you're at the LED indicator you
may see blinking blue but that's really
just a bit you've got enough to go
trackpad right here which we'll talk
about in just a minute the phone for as
large as
is has a very small screen it becomes
apparent when you're holding the device
it's got a lot of weight and heft to it
it certainly by no means a thin phone
you flip it on its side
and you'll see that it does have quite a
bit of heft and weight if I go ahead and
bring in something like the Droid which
is a much more powerful the Devourer is
thicker which is a strange choice for
Motorola who make both phones and will
bring the Droid back in just a minute so
navigation why is your most your
navigation on screen or using this
optical trackpad generally I've liked up
to attract pads in the past and the
implementation here works all that well
scrolling on it was not very smooth
oftentimes was an error terribly
responsive I did like that you could use
it in push it and make it a selectable
d-pad but I was not the biggest fan of
this ordinarily when I see a trackball
on something like the Nexus One I don't
always like that as much either but the
trackball is a much better navigation
implementation for Android these in this
case then the trackpad is it's got a
very high quality aluminum feel to it
and you sort of sacrifice weight to have
that high quality this thing feel like
you could throw it off a building and it
would survive it no problem I don't
recommend doing that of course I'm sure
it wouldn't but it's got that feeling of
very you know high-quality materials
made out of pure aluminum or aluminium
depending on where in the world you're
watching this video so it's got a
slide-out keyboard it's got a very nice
sliding mechanism - it's spring-loaded
it shoots right up it's got a much nicer
slide than the Droid does it also has a
very nice keyboard I really like typing
on this it's got a bit of peculiarities
though as well notice that down below
here there are letters as well next to
the space bar so it's a little bit weird
to have to type and hit the space bar
but you get used to it they did that to
accommodate a full number row across the
top typing experience of typing wise the
Devourer was very good and I give it
very high marks for its keyboard the
aluminium ridges on the side and make it
nice to hold and feel and it always
feels very solid in your hand so let's
talk about the UI this is on top of so
Android 1.6 you've seen old hat but this
is running motoblur
which is weird and kind of quirky the
first thing you notice by motoblur are
these new icons across the bottom so
that brings up a new dialer the menu
what's the same as other older Android
devices same with the little slide thing
on top the notification tray and the
contacts look a bit different as well
I'm not gonna show us that personal
contacts in there but you can go ahead
and get some more details about each
person motoblur goes ahead and pulls in
Facebook Twitter sort of integrates all
of your social networking into what they
claim is a unified platform you can get
these notifications that pop up so you
can get email notifications put our
notifications you can send a
notification to see what one person is
doing or all your Twitter followers are
doing right on your home screen if
you're a big social networker you may
like that I use Twitter quite a bit as
some of you may know but I actually
turned off a lot of these motoblur
features I just turn these back on for
demonstration purposes I dragged them
all right in the trash I ended up using
this phone just as I would a stock
Android device and pretty much ignored
motoblur I did like having the contacts
right down below but I could easily get
rid of that and just put a shortcut on
the home screen so if you're looking to
purposes for motoblur and I think it's
gonna be a very cool immersive UI it's
really not I think Android itself is
very usable and and easy to use so
motoblur seems a bit superfluous at
least in this case and in its current
iteration perhaps and future versions
it'll gain a bit more utility right now
I found it's just get in the way not
only that it's also very a processor
memory intensive because it's always
pulling information so it's going to
drain your battery faster you've got all
those widgets open something to keep in
mind I've had some issues in the past
with capacitive buttons like on the
Nexus One these work quite well they
have any issue and I wanted to tap them
menus came up and came up quite nicely
one thing you're gonna notice - there's
different notifications and you get on
the standard Android device these are
the motoblur notifications to go in and
pull out the droid here you can see if
there are a very different array of
buttons on the bottom back button menu
button home button and search you get
your back and search but your menu
button sort of looks like a Foursquare
just a bit different if you're familiar
with other Android devices and you pick
up the Devourer don't want you to look
at this and be like what the heck is
going on so something to keep in mind so
seeing as I just brought the droid in
it's kind of hard to review the Devourer
without thinking about the droid since
they're both on a varieties network and
there's about $100 price difference
between the two in some cases $50
depending where you go but not a
significant amount of money between them
and this is where I think the biggest
problem with the Devourer comes in
you've got a phone that is less powerful
than the droid yet it's larger thicker
in all dimensions and weighs more than
the droid and has a smaller screen which
makes it a very hard value proposition
the droid I found to be very capable
worked really well multi-touch enabled
you could pinch and zoom using the
dolphin browser or soon with a 2.1
update the Devourer is not multi-touch
capable unfortunately so even with the
third-party browser you're going to be
stuck with just a simple pan or zoom
with one finger so I've got a very hard
time recommending a device with
completely inferior specs but a larger
package those inferior specs translate
to the camera on the back without a
flash whereas a drawer you're gonna get
a 5 megapixel camera versus the 3 on the
Devourer and again no LED flash it's
just very hard to recommend it a power
I'm not sure who Motorola and Verizon
are targeting with the Devourer
certainly probably the feature phone
crowd is maybe looking for a texting
device or the fit more capabilities but
still $400 more you're getting so so
much more with the Droid perhaps the
Devourer was $50 or free on a contract
that could really see its niche and see
its value and say you know what this is
a great phone if you're looking to sort
of get into the Android world and get a
bit more powerful device before its
price I had a very hard time
recommending it that being said it is
quite capable I didn't notice a lot of
lagging and speed multitasking was quite
fine on it as I found with most Android
devices and again call quality was quite
good so as a phone itself taking price
out of it
I give it a very solid three out of five
it's lack of multi-touch it's small
screen and it's sort of heft in bulk
took away points however if this thing
did drop down in price to again 5150 to
free rather be a much higher mark and a
really nice phone to a pickup keyboard
easy to type on and things would just be
a little bit rosier for the Devourer
perhaps it could be a device that I may
eat up sorry bad joke
