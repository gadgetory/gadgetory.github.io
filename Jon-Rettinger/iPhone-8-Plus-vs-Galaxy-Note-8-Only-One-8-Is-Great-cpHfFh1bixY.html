got the iPhone 8 plus and the note 8 to
buy he myths going head-to-head for your
phone buying dollar I want to do this
versus with five categories and no
cop-out at the end
whatever is best for you we are going to
declare a winner let's jump right in so
as I run through these categories you'll
notice one category is not going to be
there and that is performance I could
talk about the a11 the Snapdragon 835
and six gigs of ram but they are
different operating systems all kinds of
different experiences so it's not a fair
comparison to go head-to-head on the
performance of both but both are
incredibly fast both can handle games
with Kendall anything you throw at it so
performance for two different operating
systems it's not apples to apples so to
speak so the five categories that we've
chosen for this versus battle are design
screen camera battery and intangibles so
the first category let's start with
design and this one should be as
no-brainer category as we've got and I
think even those diehard Apple fans
would even give the design award to the
Galaxy Note 8 this is a fourth
generation of the same design that we
initially saw with the iPhone 6 plus
it's not ugly it just hasn't modernized
like we've seen on the Samsung side of
things you've got an infinity display
almost edge to edge the phone looks and
feels incredibly premium and if you're
gonna buy a phone based solely on design
I'm going for the one without the
gigantic bezels Galaxy Note 8 easily
takes this category alright so next
let's jump it to high perhaps the most
important category the screen since the
book pretty much all screen and what
you're staring at you might think at
least on paper this is going to be
blowout favorite the Samsung but Apple
has quietly and I think under the radar
refined their screen technology
culminating in the screen on the iPhone
8 plus so a bit of a weird aspect ratio
I think on the note it's 18 and a half
by 9 it works to make a thinner phone
with a larger display I kind of prefer
the 16 by 9 on the iPhone what's new
here on the Apple front is a true tone
display wasn't that high on it in the
review tomorrow I used it I think the
more I started to appreciate what it can
do both
decent viewability outdoors and that's a
big one for me on the note side it's got
an incredible brightness of 1,200 nits
it's like 20% brighter than the galaxy s
8 plus you gotta outer brightness turned
on if you want to see it in direct
sunlight so leaves bear that in mind
despite how bright the screen gets you
turn their brightness all the way up to
see it when you are outdoors I love the
way the screen looks on the Galaxy Note
8 it looks like a sticker to me I'm
looking at pictures looking at movies
watching movies playing games the screen
is absolutely gorgeous and I've in the
past been very mad on Apple's 1080p
screens on their Plus devices this one
looks better it looks almost higher
resolution text looked crisper your
calvess lead can't see any pixelation
and Apple has definitely improved the
display on the A+ I think the plus size
display is something Apple was really
far behind but it's much better here and
much closer when it comes to screen
hundred of hundred times
I'm still picking the Galaxy Note 8 all
right so next let's jump into camera
both these flagship feature dual sensors
on the back and both take incredible
pictures and take very similar
approaches to what they do
both offer portrait modes which will so
reviews technology to blur the
background apples got portrait lighting
in beta that'll sort of simulate
different lighting effects they both
have live photos it'll take sort of bit
of movies beforehand they do a lot of
the same things here but one does it a
bit better the iPhone 8 plus I think
takes better shots in low light I
personally prefer the higher contrast
shots that come out of the note in
direct sunlight
but that's gonna be up to you the
iPhones camera looks a little more true
to color I like sort of the poppy
processing that Samsung does but it's a
lot on the processing side portrait
shots on the note eights look much more
like normal portrait shots and they do
on the A+ A+ sometimes blur the wrong
stuff portrait lighting though is damn
cool even though it's still in beta it
doesn't work all the time but when it
does work you look really well and
presumably it will only get better as
time progresses video looks incredible
coming out of both of these but if I had
to pick one of these to take and use as
my camera going
I'm gonna pick the iPhone eight plus I
think it's a better overall camera in
every environment if I want to get those
low-light shots gonna be great if I want
to get those portrait shots and my kids
are gonna look beautiful I have the
option dad portrait lighting in here
it's an awesome camera on both devices
and it was tight but no cop out of a tie
if I have to pick one I'm going to
camera on the iPhone eight plus all
right so let's talk about battery and
this would have been a blowout win for
Apple if it had been like 2016 or even
2015 but not the case any more symptoms
of an incredible job with software and
battery management on the galaxy note 18
you might think it's not fair we talked
about specs that no day is pushing way
more pixel that's got a brighter screen
it's got a bigger screen in the iPhone
but we're gonna pick up one of these
phones you're gonna want it to last and
I want to give you one gigantic caveat
if you use snapchat that's not even
going to be close snapchat on Android is
there horrible notorious battery drain
so the difference for me with auto
brightness turned on on both devices
throughout a full day's usage was about
7% and 7% better on the iPhone that is
an incredible victory I think for
Samsung despite having a power way
bigger screen way brighter screen and
way more pixels but if you want a phone
it's going to last you longer throughout
the day you're gonna want to go for the
iPhone even with battery saving modes on
both I can still eat out a longer life
on the iPhone then I can on the Samsung
and the fact this is close is an
incredible testament to what sampling
has done maximizing battle aid because
the past years this would have been a
complete blowout when it comes to
battery I'm sticking with Apple so if
you were keeping track at home we are
tied 2-2 heading into the final category
design went to the note screen stayed
with the note camera when the iPhone
battery stuck with Apple our last
category here's intangibles what makes
the phone the phone what separates it
from the pack what makes it not a
rectangle in your pocket what it brings
to the table in the entire package and
Apple has brought a lot to the table
this Jen we now have wireless charge
apples ecosystem is huge for a lot of
people things that live inside of it
like iMessage and FaceTime Apple pay is
almost becoming ubiquitous for mobile
payments you've got water resistance
with ip67 we're getting a nice display
you're getting a good camera and you're
getting quick charging capability now
built into an apple device on the
Samsung side you've got wireless
charging you've got fast charging we've
got a little better water resistant with
ip68 got a headphone jack on board
you've got expandable storage you've got
the s-pen and you've got Samsung pay and
for those reasons be able to use a pen
and being able to expand storage being
able to plug in any headphones you
choose I am giving this category to the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 so I mentioned
expandable storage is a big reason to
get the Galaxy Note 8 if you want to
narrow that gap a little bit you want
have expandable storage with the iPhone
the folks at Kingston have you covered
with the data traveler bolt duo this
plugs right into your lighting port
there's an app that you download and
does one thing and one thing only that
is store your pictures and you can do it
a couple different ways you can take
pictures and video directly to the bulk
duo you can backup certain folders in
your backup your whole library anything
you want to take storage off of your
phone so how to hold off on upgrading
your phone and maybe the only reason you
were gonna upgrade to an iPhone 8 plus
or an iPhone tennis for more storage
size it's an awesome way to hold out
available you the 32 64 128 you can
backup everything you need it's really
thin too so it'll stay flush with the
table whether using it on an iPhone or
an iPad it's not gonna give you a weird
balance it's put it in your pocket kit
in your backpack it's an awesome way to
backup whatever you want to suit your
needs I want to thank our friends at
Kingston for making this video possible
with their data traveler bolt duo if you
want to check it out go into it down
below so this is one of the most
hotly-contested verses we have ever done
and that was not the case in recent
years I was harping on things like Apple
missing wireless charging Apple missing
quick charging those things are here now
the gap has narrowed quite a bit based
on all five of these categories I pick
the new
eight if one of these categories of
what's important to you if it's camera
but screen if it's intangible as a
battery life you know where I stand on
those and perhaps that might sway your
purchase decision but if you want one
based on the breadth of phones that are
all fast they're all going to work well
the Galaxy Note 8 still reign supreme
