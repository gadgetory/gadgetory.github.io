technobuffalo here Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg just left the stage the
Facebook he don't they announced a ton
of new stuff so for the next few minutes
set you a status update to learning
facebook business we got a lot to go
over it's going to get started its
earlier today which is thursday April
fourth Mark Zuckerberg took the stage in
San Francisco and said Facebook is going
to focus moving forward on Android
obviously they're not abandoning iOS
Android gives the ability to customize
things the apple's OS just doesn't so
according to my fellow hoodie wearing
friends the great thing about androids
that so opens up your book said you
could have your apps that could be your
keyboard can be your home screen of your
phone you're going to fork Android to do
this which even know what that means you
don't need to modify the operating
system the home screen is the soul of
your phone and facebook with that
unveiled facebook home which is actually
going to take over the lock screen and
your home screen and provide all sorts
of status updates out otherwise populate
inside of a dedicated facebook app so
zuckerberg guarantee that it's still
easy to access all of your applications
however you can take a photo of your
face at the bottom of the screen and
swipe up to see all of your applications
so that isn't a nutshell facebook home
it's a skin that's going to be able to
be downloaded for your phone and be
available on April twelfth for select
devices first and then you'll be able to
check out all kinds of new facebook
business you can tag people right from
your home screen you can view photos
it's going to update live action to show
you what's going on and presumably will
make its way to more phones as we move
forward the highlighted phones in the
galaxy s3 the HTC One presumably the
galaxy s4 as well a coming very soon
note tablet support yep they did said
they're working on it right now so also
as part of today's Facebook home
announced at Mark Zuckerberg talked
about how messaging would work with
inside the app itself including SMS so
instead of jumping out of the new
facebook experience dr. Burke has
designed something it's calling chat
heads which essentially pops up a
picture of the person you messages you
along with the small preview of that
message give you quick context messages
pop up in the top right-hand corner of
your device these can be moved around
she move the person's head on the screen
showing off your friends picture in a
quick preview of that message so chat
heads overlaid onto the apps you're in
so you never have to leave the site or
the app you're running to read an email
or anything like that so Facebook's Joey
Flynn took the stage to the experience
designed to feel like your friends are
right there with you instead of that
disconnected and disjointed feeling so
instead of going and tapping another app
and closing where you in tapping another
app try to make it all feel nice and
synergy so tapping on a friend's chat
head brings up your conversation and
conversations are easily managed by
tapping on individual faces Facebook
claims this is the most elegant way to
stay connected with friends it
introduces a more immediate and intimate
experience so group chats are also
supported of course and ditching a
conversation as easy as dragging it to
the bottom of your screen essentially
just throw that person away which
particular ticket times so again we get
all the stuff April twelfth for select
devices with updates hitting every
single month such a be kind of cool it
should be continue to be updated as we
move forward it so facebook unveiled a
ton of software stuff we've got the home
we've got chat heads and all kinds of
other Facebook software goodness and
widely expected is also supposed to be a
facebook phone and we sort of got that
so what Facebook is doing essentially
they're issuing a set of protocols that
companies can use in the manufacture
devices to get a true optimized Facebook
experience and the first phone is going
to offer this is not surprisingly made
by HTC and cold the HTC first with the
lower kids f like the Facebook logo so
they unveiled the HTC first at today's
Facebook home announcement the company
says this is the best social experience
you can find the Facebook's new home
experience pre-loaded and optimized on
to the phone right out of the box so I
guess you don't have to just download it
from the Play Store it's clearly aimed
at the younger crowd you don't looking
at hi inspect here but I can also be
used obviously for a Facebook fanatic so
just as we saw elite earlier this week
the device is going to come in a
multiple of colors including red light
blue white and black covering a nice
little spectrum for users who want color
choices so HTC first it going to be
available exclusively as far as we know
from AT&amp;amp;T available for pre-order right
now for 99 bucks and you can go ahead
and pick that up April 12 so final specs
of HTC first haven't yet been released
but we can expect according to the leaks
are you looking at a dual-core
snapdragon chip a 720p screen certainly
mid-level specs but as soon as those
fully do get released the pre-order page
is supposed to go up today but as of
this filming is not yet there I will be
sure to overlay all the specs in this
video to help
make sure you guys know what you are
getting so let me recap there was a lot
of stuff coming right at you so on the
software side you'd be able to download
from android on the 12th for a lot of
options out there for different phones
and certainly more will be added you can
get facebook home now which is getting
give you that new lock screens gonna
give you chat heads a way to interact
with friends and sort of see messages
seamlessly according to facebook and
also you able to get the first kind of
facebook phone the HTC first and
hopefully we'll see more facebook phones
come out we don't have a dedicated
facebook button like we had with the HTC
status or the cha-cha-cha was called
internationally this is just a straight
android phone with the facebook skin
pre-installed right out of the box so
you guys think you want some like this
did not want something like this if you
saw him episode a right and just rants
you know how i feel about it but it's on
the beauties of android you could do
whatever you want with it and if what
you want is facebook when I got that
choice love to hear your thoughts and
comments leave them down below i'm jon
rettinger and i will see you in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
