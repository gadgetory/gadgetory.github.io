LP here from TechnoBuffalo and welcome
back for yet another very exciting game
review this time we're looking at a
sequel to one of my favorite
first-person shooters
Myo shock I went and got the ps3 version
of the game mainly because I got a cheap
deal out of a Gamestop trade offer so
that's what we're gonna be looking at
they tried to sell me the special deluxe
edition of the game with a vinyl of the
first game soundtrack and a bunch of
other crap but I decided that the game
is going to have to stand on its own two
legs before I buy into the merchandise
three years ago in 2007 producer Kevin
Levine and 2k Boston team introduced a
new kind of first-person shooter
in-between the action the game tackled
social and moral issues and put the
players in front of some pretty tricky
choices but the single most interesting
thing about the first game was a world
in which it took place that world lies
leagues below the sea and it's called
rapture rapture is a beautiful art deco
city an underwater utopia created by
Andrew Wright the city was created as an
escape from social political and
religious anxiety of a post-world War
two ridden world as you probably know
not everything went according to plan in
rapture its inhabitants became addicted
to genetic modification turning the
majority of the population into
disfigured shadows of their former
selves ten years have gone by since the
first game and the city has fallen ever
deeper into social and moral decay a new
antagonist dr. Sophie L lamb has risen
from the ashes of Andrew Ryan this time
with an imposing altruistic ideology
with some keen relations to Marxism
turns out the dr. Lam's idea of turning
rapture into an underwater socialist
colony has gone a bit awry and things
are worse than ever as you know the
first game was a great success and
Bioshock 2 has a massive set of shoes to
fill especially because this time around
it's not developed by 2k bossom but a
subsidiary developer called to Cameron
so the game definitely has some Big
Daddy sized shoes to fill so in the
second game you play as a Big Daddy
clad in a deep-sea scuba suit and this
dynamic brings a few changes to the
gameplay first off your right hand is
now equipped with a pretty big drill I'm
not sure what the practical applications
are for a drill of this
sighs but the drill does work pretty
well for making mincemeat of the
inhabitants of rapture and other violent
fell retards the left hand is now free
to use for Adam induced plasmids so now
you can shoot your double-barrel shotgun
and throw lightning bolts with your
lefty the story of Bioshock 2 takes you
on a fairly linear journey towards
discovering the fate of a little sister
who proclaims herself to be the
protagonist daughter
along the way get some help from some
inhabitants of rapture will begin not to
come to the feet of the splicers located
a new train car but the station still
locked down and we're not alone in here
I see a shadow in the security booth
most of the stories unraveled much like
the first game through recorded audio
logs that you will find scattered around
rapture the narrative of the sequel is
quite a bit more straightforward and
tangible compared to the first game
which was more of an unraveling mystery
novel appeal of the city is gone
raptured self is pretty much the same a
little bit more rundown but discovering
the wonders of the city is pretty much
left in curse floor the city is also a
bit more linear and there's not much
exploring you can do a minor complaint
is that there's not much variation than
levels the same shanty and decrepit
scenery repeat itself mostly throughout
the game and setting aside a few scenic
underwater shuffles I would have liked
to see some more variation between
levels and no there is no underwater
gunplay you just basically shuffle from
one place to the next being a big Daddy
brings its own set of responsibilities
and the little sister dynamic and
harvesting Adam has gone through a
significant change after taking down a
Big Daddy you can now adopt a little
sister to harvest Adam for you and
harvesting Adam from dead bodies always
brings about a zone defense against
hordes of splicers who also want a taste
of their drug of choice defending the
little sisters can get a bit repetitive
but the trade-off reward of Adam which
enables new plasmids makes harvesting
dead corpses worthwhile another
variation thrown into the mix are big
sisters and if you thought Big Daddies
were hard to take down Big Sisters are
faster and more agile and a huge pain in
her metal padded ass what the game lacks
is storytelling and environmental
versatility and gains in gameplay
mechanics the new two-handed assault
scheme with weapons in one hand and
plasmids in the other work extremely
well and make the fighting that much
more injury and I can tell you that
about 95% of Bioshock 2 is about
shooting up the neighborhood with
various weapons and plasmids most of the
plasmids are familiar from the first
game but there are some new interesting
ones as well the Scout plasmid allows
you to survey the area as a free roaming
ghost
you can now hypnotize and befriend the
splicers to fight along your side you
can also call in
security bots which are a definite help
in defending little sisters the amount
of enemies you encounter in the game
will overwhelm you at times and it seems
that there's not a moment of peace
you'll be attacked from all three
dimensions and you will not survive if
you don't use your weapons and plasmids
wisely and recruiting help will play a
bigger role in Bioshock 2 when trying to
keep the little sisters safe I played
through the game in hard mode with my
two chambers switched off and I can tell
ya I had my work cut out for me the game
will challenge even the most experienced
FPS fans and you will find yourself
scavenging every corpse that comes along
or corpse that you create and looting is
essential in Bioshock 2 because ammo is
scarce and every coin you find will
count as you are in constant need of
buying health packs and Eva fills while
I'm not that keen on the low ammo
situation in first-person shooters in
general it does serve its desperation
inducing purpose in Bioshock 2 hacking
has also received a nice update in the
sequel and has been simplified to the
point where it's now possible to hack
security BOTS for your aid during an
ongoing gunfight VAD some I heard some
caution here because I also found that
it's still quite easy to fail of hacking
and have the trap spring in your own
face overall the gameplay mechanics have
been refined from the first game and
Bioshock 2 is fun to play
graphics wise Bioshock 2 runs on the
exact same Unreal 3 game engine as the
first game while the game looks good
after three years I really would have
liked to have seen some improvements to
the new underwater adventure it seems
that they've even used the same texture
packs from the first Bioshock some of
which are bit soft and low res and I
think some of the character models could
have also used in tuning up I also have
to bring to light the reflective
surfaces for example the water effects
are questioned to believe low res on the
ps3 version on the PC with DirectX 10
support they look great but on the ps3
not so much the framerate is mostly
stable but it will start to dip towards
the end of the game where the action on
the screen gets increasingly hectic the
game is locked at a maximum of 30 frames
per second but you are given the
possibility of unlocking the framerate
but I cannot recommend it because on the
ps3 it will result in a quite erratic
framerate and some serious screen
tearing
so I recommend leaving the framerate
lock as is loading times on the console
versions of Bioshock can be a bit
lengthy it will take over a minute to
load up a level which I think in today's
centers is a bit long overall from the
standpoint of graphics and performance
I'm a bit disappointed with the ps3
version of Bioshock 2 mainly because
there's very little improvement to be
seen from the first game the PC version
of the game of course runs at a 60 Plus
frame rate but the port worth of the PC
is a bit sloppy the wide screen
resolution is achieved by cropping a
four by three image and the textures of
the game are adequate for council
resolutions but not quite adequate for
high res PC gaming the PC version of
Bioshock 2 is a testament to the fact
that game consoles are currently holding
back the advancements in PC game
graphics
from an artistic visual standpoint the
game excels the Art Deco architecture
and decor of rapture really set the mood
for the underwater utopia or dystopia
depending on the perspective overall the
game is not as impressive visually as
the first game but it's still one of the
best looking Unreal Engine 3 games made
today the atmosphere of the game is
nicely complemented by the music and
sound design which is as good as in the
first game the shrieks and agonizing
wailings of the splicers will send a
chill down your spine and annoy the hell
out of your spouse this is confirmed
Bioshock 2 also comes with a multiplayer
component which is easy to consider as a
bit unnecessary the story-driven first
game really did well without the
multiplayer but I'm guessing that the
turn of games today is that no matter
what the game it needs to have
multiplayer if you play a lot of
hardcore multiplayer games like modern
warfare 2 I'm pretty sure you won't
trade it off to play the multiplayer of
Bioshock 2 the game has all your
standard multiplayer modes with the
rapture and twist I did enjoy the
capture the little sister mode which
really brings the defensive father
dynamics nicely into the mix the game
also has a progression and leveling
system much like that of modern warfare
the trial system lets you level up your
weapons and plasmids by completing tasks
within the game the Big Daddy suit is
also included in the multiplayer modes
and it is fun to play with but a bit
annoying to play against the soo
trillion sets the balance because for
example in deathmatch modes it seems to
be quite random who gets to find a suit
and wielded the plasmids do introduce an
interesting dynamic into the multiplayer
games but they're mainly only supportive
to the primary weapon - come to think of
it the multiplayer in BioShock 2 reminds
me of timesplitters which was a fast
pace and chaotic multiplayer game from
back in the day overall the multiplayer
component of Bioshock 2 is fine but you
probably won't find me playing so how
did this equal to Bioshock stack up
against the expectations overall
Bioshock 2 is a good game but ultimately
like many sequels it gets overshadowed
by its predecessor the world of rapture
is starting to seem a bit stale after
very little of anything significant is
introduced at the environment itself
luckily gameplay wise it's fun as ever
and you will play through the game
solely because of the sheer fun of
playing if you have the option the PC
version is the one that get nothing
beats a mouse and keyboard combo in the
first-person shooter
and the pc version also looks best and
the high frame rate makes it that much
better
a lot was expecting from Bioshock 2 and
for the most part it meets those
expectations but still the game left me
with a feeling that it could have been
more I give Bioshock 2 an 8.8 for being
a solid first person shooter that keeps
the Bioshock franchise running strong
towards most likely yet another sequel
that's about it for my review follow me
