model three that cars been rumored and
tweaked and was the third phase of
Tesla's secret plan that Elon Musk made
not-so-secret a few years ago but now
we've seen the model three and it looks
different I think a lot of people
expected before I get into the looks
what about the car is it a car people
are gonna want to drive well judging by
the pre-orders if you believe the
numbers that are coming out 180,000
pre-orders have been placed which is an
insane number of pre-orders and you
factor that an average cost with about
$42,000 for the car despite its $35,000
starting price you figure out an option
or two I think that's about seven point
five billion dollars everybody put down
$1,000 refundable deposit actually buys
a car so a lot of money people are
potentially going to hand over to Tesla
so the car according to Elon Musk will
have at least a 215 mile EPA range a
little bit higher capacity battery packs
that will go farther 0 to 60 time in the
slowest base model instead of about six
inch second so not going to be a slow
car at all it's going to have a front
trunk and a rear trunk the front truck
didn't be much smaller than the Model S
since a smaller sized sedan they wanted
to be able to see five adults
comfortably but they did was they pushed
the front seats forward usually we're
like an engine would be but these
there's an engine there didn't really
matter so it's got a really sort of
small front end which gives a car kind
of a odd-looking proportion but
supposedly plenty of room for five
adults CD and be able to fit a
seven-foot surfboard in the car it's a
hatchback so it seats down and kind of
going all the way through
the Model X was the little minivan II
but the coolest feature obviously is
Falcon wing doors but the secure doesn't
get talked about too much I think it's
kind of equally cool is the back it's a
single sheet of glass it goes all the
way back create like a really airy
experience in the car they're taking
that feature and putting it on the model
3 so it'll feel really airy in the back
so it's almost like a continuous sunroof
it sounds like Tesla wants to cram just
a ton of stuff to $35,000 cars so I
would imagine that a lot of the stuff
that got shown in the design might not
be what actually ships with the car
there were a lot of surprises with the
model through but the one that I wasn't
really expecting was available to use
Tesla's existing supercharger network I
figured that many cars on the road
there'd be no way to have it be enabled
essentially free charging for your car
that can get your car up to 80 percent
in like 20 minutes that's not a big pack
like in my lesson who knows what's gonna
be on the model 3 but the cool thing for
me was at $35,000 you're gonna guess
Tesla's autopilot which is the closest
thing you can get right now to
autonomous drive and a car of that price
is absolutely incredible what do you
guys think are you putting down a
deposit for a Model 3 one hundred eighty
thousand or so I've already been put
down but I figured I kind of wanted to
be a hundred a thousand and one
I love the companies doing and I believe
in the future of electric cars and I
think the future of Tesla as well
