TechnoBuffalo here with another
smartphone smackdown this time we've got
two 4g super phones going head-to-head
and a carrier matchup in one corner we
have the HTC EVO 4G and in the other we
have the Samsung built Epic 4G we're
gonna compare these two suckers and nine
round tests and see who comes out on top
so there are obviously a myriad of
categories we could have discussed in
different rounds we could have done but
with the interest of this not turning
into the Lord of the Rings type length
video I had to cut them down to nine and
then nine rounds we're going to be
comparing our cult quality signal
strength display specs design text entry
software and UI browser and finally
speed so let's go ahead and jump right
in both of these are phones first and
foremost no matter what else they do in
call quality has to be solid these are
very representative I think of Sprint's
lineup as a whole assuming you have
service where you are and Colcord is
absolutely fantastic on both in the 20
call tests I had no dropped calls very
little white noise in fact it sounded
like I was on the landline pretty much
the entire time on my end in the colors
other end so both of these very strong
really excellent call qualities this
round is going to be a draw now the next
round we're going to talk about signal
strength I don't usually get a chance to
compare these that's not always apples
to apples but because these are both
sprint phones it's sort of a very easy
text now I'm in Orange County California
where we currently do not have 4G so I
can't tell you how these handle WiMAX
but I can't tell you how they handle 3G
I want to drop them at different
locations together and what you're
seeing right now is pre representative
here the Evo is alternating between one
and two bars and the same thing for the
epic depending on where I am they tend
to alternate between two and three bars
each right now it looks like the Evo is
just showing one in the effort showing
two when I go to other places often
times that's just reversed so signal
strength really seems to be very very
close and on part of both these devices
if you are in a strong sprint area or
even a French
like I am right here you're not gonna
have much issue you'd be able to pull in
at least one of the two bars so this
rounds also a draw so I've got two
drawers out of the way let's talk about
the display this is where you're gonna
look at and use mostly interacting with
the phone and from a spec standpoint
these sound very similar the Evo's got a
4.3 inch 800 by 480 resolution display
which as you can tell is quite big I'm
really nice The Epoch has a four inch
frame with the same resolution of 800 by
480
however it's touchscreen technology is
something called Super AMOLED actually
puts the touch and mechanism integrates
into the glass opposed to putting it on
top which is going to give you crisper
colors and sharper contrast level it's
really darker blacks and better
visibility in direct sunlight and I
would happily trade that 0.3 inches of
extra screen real estate for the
beautiful beautiful picture and image
quality and text quality that comes
across on the Epic 4G even if looking at
the screens right now and a little bit
of direct sunlight and the same
brightness you can clearly see a
difference in the screen here the Epic
4G just looks a little bit better I know
that Super AMOLED screens and without
its downside it's gonna give you a
little bit of sort of a grayish bluish
tint but something I could easily live
with so we're talking about the displays
the epic has got to take this round
alright so next let's talk about design
are we talking about these physical
designs of the phone not the software
right now then we will talk about the
software in just a minute so the Evo 4G
is there a typical Android phones got
your array of Android buttons across the
bottom they are capacitive buttons but
they do have sort of physical
representation so that home button is
always there the Menu button is always
there at the back and a search button
they don't go away or disappear you've
got your front facing camera on the
front your rear facing camera in the
back which we'll talk about and you've
got a little bit of a kickstand if you
want to watch videos while traveling or
sitting at your desk whatever it is you
might like it serve a classic sleek
design its elegant and very thin I'm now
talking about the Epic 4G it almost
looks like there aren't buttons at all
you have to touch the screen
and those buttons will show up they are
the same sort of capacitive buttons
array just arranged a little bit
differently and they look a little bit
different customized for the TouchWiz
interface found on the epic so a same
similar slate design camera on the back
there is not a kickstand but you do have
a slide-out QWERTY keyboard we'll talked
about the keyboard in the text entry
round a little bit thicker because of
that keyboard now ordinarily I would
have called this around to draw but the
epic has one feature that I found
extremely annoying and really hinders my
usage and I feel I'll be guess what that
is it comes to these capacitive buttons
across the bottom I can't see where they
are right now if I want to find the home
button I kind of started tapping to
figure out where it is and there's the
home button I don't always know where
that's happened it disappears again it's
often time so it would just take one tap
to hit the home button sometimes takes
two to make it light up and show you
exactly where it is and I found it to be
very very very annoying while using the
phone and that one little detail really
can hinder the user experience now it's
nothing you can't get past certainly but
at least from my standpoint I found it
to be a little bit less than a positive
so from a design round this one's going
to swing back to the Evo hard right next
let's talk about text entry if you're
picking up one of these phones odds are
use internet a lot and maybe a lot of
text messages emails you're gonna want a
phone that's not very good text entry
now both of these are Android devices
the Evo 4G is now an Android 2.2 device
yep it is an Android 2.1 device talk
about what that means a little bit later
but they both have on-screen keyboards
and they both have speech to text mean
you just talk to them and they'll
interpret your text and both work very
well when it comes to text entry the few
things we want to notice so the keyboard
here on the HTC EVO 4G uses HTC's
proprietary keyboard skin and I'll show
you what that looks like it's relatively
good looks pretty nice so we'll go ahead
and type a new message here and you can
see exactly what the keyboard looks like
so here we've got a portrait orientation
flipped over to landscape it worked very
well and it's got androids really great
auto correction feature go ahead and
push this back and of course you can
install other keyboards that just swipe
or if you like deep
privatair an Android keyboard you can
always go back to that there's no
physical according keep we're here
you're limited just to what's on screen
and this is a very capable on-screen
keyboard now take a look at the
on-screen keyboard on something like
let's say the Epic 4G it's gonna be a
bit of a different scenario here so I'm
gonna go ahead open up the keyboard
again and you've got well here we've got
the sort of a stock Android keyboard a
little bit of Samsung flair to it this
does come pre-loaded with swipe which is
a new way to type and the keyboard here
works very well similar to what we see
on the Evo however one of the nice
things about the epic consider the only
galaxy as a variant that offers this
it's got a full slide-out QWERTY
keyboard so whether you want to use or
don't use it you do have an option this
is a pretty solid QWERTY keyboard it's
got a full row for numbers and your
fingers aren't hindered by the top of
the device the sliding mechanism is
quite nice as well it's spring-loaded
and the keyboard is really easy to type
on so you have the option of really
using anything you like the on-screen
keyboard physical QWERTY keyboard if you
don't mind a little extra bulk that the
keyboards gonna give you on your phone
the epic is going to be a great device
so it comes to text entry no surprise
here at the physical QWERTY keyboard is
going to give the epic the edge alright
next let's talk about software and UI is
I just mentioned the Evo 4G is now an
Android 2.2 device may have heard that
mentioned this Froyo whereas the epic is
an injured 2.1 you may have heard that
mentioned as Eclair now one of the nice
things about Android being an open
operating system is that manufacturers
have the ability to put their own custom
skins on top of them so these devices
isn't really what Android looks like in
its raw form HD sees is something called
Sense UI which sort of goes right on top
of Android so these little bars across
the bottom the menu tray the phone and
the plus or any unique descents I can
jump right in and view others any of my
seven screens here by just doing a
pinching motion go ahead and jump right
there and there bit of others are UI
tweaks there's a lot of some widget
support and there's a lot of social
networking support sort of built right
in HTC has done a fantastic job with
their sensor why they've it had it
for many years on the other hand we've
got TouchWiz built into Android 2.1 on
the epic which has some cool features
that well as well it also has seven home
screens there's no real way out of the
box at least to view all seventy gifted
to keep sliding left to right it does
have some nice UI enhancements if you
pull down this tray here you can jump
from Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4G and GPS and it's
got these four icon sort of pin to the
bottom now certainly you can customize
these with applications from the Android
Marketplace we're going to talk about
how they come right out of the box so if
I have to pick one of these I'm gonna go
with the one that has Android 2.2 with
sense and that would of course be the
Evo 4G I think it's a bit more intuitive
a bit more elegant and it has a lot more
widget support so the overall software
and you why not to mention the fact that
is running Android 2.2 which the epic
will eventually get this round is going
to go to the Evo alright so now let's
talk about browser for picking up one of
these devices probably gonna use the
browser quite a bit since they both have
fantastic multi-touch capable browsers
let's go ahead and take a look at the
browser on each of these so I'll go
ahead and jump right into browser here I
will go ahead and launch TechnoBuffalo
I'm will do the same thing here on the
epic and it's going to be pretty similar
looking on both go ahead and launch the
site and this has been loaded on both
devices before in the past so well this
is still pretty much loaded as I clicked
at first let's talk about the browser on
the Evo of course multi-touch very quick
to react working really well in this
since this is an Android 2.2 device it
does have full support for flash 10.1 so
if you visit websites that use a lot of
flash content you're not gonna have any
trouble viewing it on the evo and it has
a power to handle it as well so I'm
thinking to be a little bit choppy and
not as smooth as it would be on your
desktop PC but it's going to work
scrolling as a relatively smooth affair
there isn't any sort of that pixelation
at the bottom you get from fast growing
you can see the content changing here
are utilizing flash whereas right now on
the Evo that little content or
advertising block is actually a blink so
pretty smooth very nice experience and
multi-touch really works
as you'd expect go ahead and zoom in and
zoom out jump on over to the epic you do
not have flash reports since it is not
we had an end or two points to device so
presumably it will get a flash 10.1
support as Samsung has said it will
browsing this pinch and zoom works even
a little bit smoother than perhaps we
see on the Evo and scrolling has a
pretty smooth affair as well it works
pretty well on both devices this is
gonna come down to not surprisingly the
ability to run flash this is sort of a
Android 2.2 which is Android 2.1 type of
debate now this round is gonna have to
go to the ego however once the epoch
does get updated to Android 2.2 this
round would most definitely be a time
but as of this filming which is
September 24 2010 this round has got to
go to the Evo 4G alright let's talk a
little bit about speed how fast are both
these devices there spec sheets are
incredibly similar and actually before
we jump into speed let's talk about the
specs of each device especially to read
very similarly
so the Evo on the left has a 15 hundred
million power battery they claimed to
get about six hours of talktime 4.3 inch
period that same resolution we talked
about earlier 480 by 800 it's got eight
megapixel camera with dual LED flash and
if I was going to go into more depth and
more rounds I'm gonna show you camera
our cameras work pretty well on both of
these it's got a front-facing camera for
video chat Android 2.2 Snapdragon
processor or 1 gigahertz 512 megabytes
of RAM and of course 4G capable the epic
spec sheet sounds almost exactly the
same 1500 million power battery 6.5
hours of talktime 4 inch Super AMOLED
display screen to resolution of 480 by
800 only a 5 megapixel camera and that
those have LED flash that's a
front-facing camera as well Android 2.1
the cortex a8 hummingbird clocking in at
1 gigahertz for a similar architecture
to what we see in the iPhone 4 and Apple
iPad 512 megabytes of RAM and 4G
so while you are going to get on the Evo
a little better camera on the epic I'm
gonna get swear that full slide-out
QWERTY keyboard and the Super AMOLED
display it's looks really gonna be you
know
a dozen six of the other it's almost
exactly the same depending on what you
like so this round is clearly a draw
spec wise these things that really stop
to the gills those aspects that you'd
expect from a super phone all right so
now let's talk about speeders I have
lured to a little bit earlier let's see
how quick both these devices are and
this is gonna be a test of I suppose the
Snapdragon chip verse is the hummingbird
chip and the the egg Galaxy S or the
epic 4G
so go ahead and go to home I'm gonna go
ahead and quit all applications and we
use the same task killer how to kill all
these so we have sort of all our
available memory free kill all selected
apps and I know that both of these skins
sort of use different things in the
backgrounds through aren't killed this
is about as fair as a test we can get
without sir eliminating all the skins
none of these are running white live
wallpapers that's not using any sort of
memory we're gonna go and open up
similar applications so I'm gonna go
ahead and open up to that just
downloaded from the Android Marketplace
these are two free games they got paper
toss and Angry Birds let's go ahead and
open up each and see if you have any
sort of speed difference here go ahead
open up both at the same time which can
be much harder than you'd expect it to
be alright so just a little bit quicker
loaded up here on Evo go ahead and close
out of this and close out of that as
well and I'm gonna leave those open in
the background we're gonna do the same
things to show what the speed
differences are gonna go ahead and jump
back and let's try some angry angry
birds you see if they knew speed
difference here it looks like it was
just a little bit quicker on this time
on the epic so no real conclusion there
let's go ahead and jump back to the
browser and see how quick the browser
speeds are and I will say that right now
this is connected to Wi-Fi imma go and
turn off Wi-Fi so relying only on the 3G
network which now is showing two bars
and two bars sort of reverences back to
my signal strength round a bit earlier
almost exactly the same so we'll go
ahead and go back to TechnoBuffalo by
the TechnoBuffalo here and we'll do with
site refreshes
of each of them and I keep checking
these things every day hoping I'm gonna
see a 4G network turn on they're sort of
testing it in Southern California but
I'm yet to really see it now I should
mention that this is not going to be the
fairest test because there is some Flash
content being loaded here on
TechnoBuffalo
you want to show you what its gonna look
like when you're loading a website then
maybe might have a little bit flash and
I'll tell you what my results have been
while doing speed tests we're gonna go
ahead and do simple refreshes of each go
ahead and open this up open this up
right here TechnoBuffalo queued up gonna
go ahead hit go and hit go right here
and they are both off and they're both
connected to the same 3G network this is
not a Wi-Fi test we're gonna see which
one is quicker so it looks like the epic
should content a little bit earlier you
can see the green progress bar at the
top
but now the Evo sort of passed it and
showing a bit more content and we are
still loading here and it looks like
surprising the Evo finished first and
the epic finished second which is quite
interesting and really actually
representative of the other tests that
I've done so despite having a low Flash
content the Evo was still a little bit
quicker in web browsing and that's
really been a representative of what
I've seen I did a test previous of ten
web pages and the Evo actually loaded
seven of them quicker not noticeably
quicker like we saw here one or two
seconds nothing that's really going to
make or break the device but from a
speed standpoint it definitely was a
little bit different so speed and the
final round is going to go to the Evo 4G
so for those of you keeping track at
home here's how our nine round epic
uh-huh throw down when call quality was
a draw signal strength was a draw
display went to the epic specs were
another draw design went to the Evo text
entry went to the epic software I knew I
went to the Evo browser went to the Evo
and speed went to the Evo meaning the
Evo is our winner will take in four
rounds the epic took two and we had
three draw rounds
both of these are really fantastic
devices
if you prefer a corded keyboard you
can't go wrong with the epic if you're
sure of deciding which one to get and
you're not sure whether or not you care
about the cord keyboard or not I think
the Evo is going to be more solid choice
generally I enjoy using the sensi wide a
bit more than I have on TouchWiz all
that maybe just a personal preference I
like the little spinner despite the fact
that it's a little bit larger than it
fits in the pocket about creating you
know excess sort of bulge uh-huh if you
will either way you can't go wrong
especially if you get 4G service
wherever you are you're going to be able
to pull down some blazing hot speeds
especially with the mobile hotspot
capabilities that both devices have so
you agree disagree with my results love
