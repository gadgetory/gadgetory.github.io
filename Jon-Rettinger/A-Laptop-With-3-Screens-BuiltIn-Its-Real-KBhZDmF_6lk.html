razors booth we're showcasing the new
project Valerie concept laptop which has
three seventeen inch displays running
off of a GTX 1080
like their razor blade pro just like all
Fraser's products this one's geared
towards gaming the idea behind having
three displays it would create a more
immersive game experience for games that
support widescreen gameplay if you've
ever looked at or tried one of LG's
ultra light displays I have to say the
expense is very similar to that that
lends itself well to first-person
shooters or any sort of game in that
genre just because you get such a wide
field of view
spec wise we don't have a lot of
information Razer says they're still
developing it and really want to
showcase this as a concept and kind of
see what the general feedback is so far
it's been overwhelmingly positive it's
probably one of the most popular items
that we've seen on the show floor I have
to admit the idea of using three
displays on laptop sends a little
ridiculous but actually using it it's a
whole different experience but the
chance to sit down and test battlefield
one there's no lag or performance issues
the computer handle that just mine a
little got extremely high and fan speed
did kick up but for a half inch laptop
that is driving three 4k displays did
pretty well
elissa design computers pretty similar
to what you expect from the razor blade
or razor blade pro the laptop was just
on this place so we can get to see how
it actually folds out when you open it
up but it's motorized and the screens
retract inwards it is a little crazy it
does take up a lot of room but then
again it is really cool and I can see
this being really popular in the eSports
crowd and maybe even with DJ's what do
you guys think is one computer screen
not enough think you need a few more
it's still in its concept stages but
pretty cool we'll see some innovation
being done where razor in the gaming
front until next time I'm Andrew from
techno buffalo be sure to give this
video a like and for more CES covers
