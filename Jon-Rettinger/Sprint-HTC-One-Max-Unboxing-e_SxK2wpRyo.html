technobuffalo here at the new boxing of
the HTC one max re taking a look at this
guy but we didn't get a chance to see
what it looked like in his carrier
closed we're gonna head and open this
thing up for spread so here's the box
for the HTC One max you already reviewed
it and really liked a foam we got it
straight from HTC take a chance to see
that look like coming right out of the
box this is the sprint version as i
mentioned lots of good things so like
here including this gorgeous 5.9 inch
1080 screen so that means it is in 1920
x 1080 so i can slide out of its
protective covering right there all done
up in unibody aluminum or aluminium
depending on where part of the world you
live in powered by a 1.7 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 chip 2 gigs of
ram either 16 or 32 gig configurations
but you can up that storage via a
microSD card slot HTC ultrapixel camera
on the back that's a for older pixel
sensor which takes pretty good pictures
and also does 1080p video but though
that is a very awkwardly placed
fingerprint scanner which you sort of
have to swipe your finger over and
directly swipe over the lens so we did
not use that in our review but it does
work very well if you can sort of
targeted directly I did perform as
advertised so you can decide whether or
not you want to use that or not 802 11 a
BGN or AC 3300 milliamp hour battery
weighs 200 17 grams or seven point six
five ounces and we are looking here at
the newest version of sense does come
with Android 4.3 on board in case you
are wondering difference here between
the max and the regular HTC One aside
from the giant size and the drop and
processor this back actually removes you
go ahead and slide that Daniel I think
it's a profile switch but it is not it
will pull off this back plate so lets
you access your SIM card and then micro
SD card if you choose to add one no
access to the battery though here again
just aluminum back just comes right off
and a little bit difficulty will go
right back on in place you get the
option alf removable back but still get
that great HTC build quality I think
that was really good compromise HTC did
everything else here though is the
things we
no in love at the HTC One max this time
though just done up for Sprint's push
off the side for a quick second so else
you're going to have in the box you are
going to get a wall warts you're also
going to get a charge and sync cable
getting started guide and Sprint's
really good about including a bag for
returning or recycling rather old
devices sort of keep keep the world a
little greener and also get some HTC
stickers in there as well then you're
you're a sim card if you choose it's a
micro sim not nano in case you are
wondering and that is it this has been a
really quick unboxing and first look at
the HTC One max you want to see our full
