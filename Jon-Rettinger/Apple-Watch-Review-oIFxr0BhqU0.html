TechnoBuffalo here at the review of this
guy this is the Apple watch as I do with
all my reviews I want to give a
disclaimer I use this for four and a
half days if you couldn't tell
it's the blue sport version in 42
millimeter size we have a full written
review as well as why I hear anything in
more detail a Todd who wrote it actually
has some differing opinions on what I'm
gonna say so if you want to hear another
side of the coin again hit the link down
below and check that and I'll talk about
some of Todd's points as we go through
the review a few things to keep in mind
when we talk about the Apple watch this
is the first totally new product from
Apple in quite a while and the very
first new OS from them since iOS first
debuted in 2007 the format of this is
going to be a lightning review I'm sure
to go through point by point questions I
had in questions you guys had when I
asked on Twitter and in the unboxing
comments first my big one was battery I
was really concerned about it we heard
early reports before was him that now
instead Apple was really struggling with
battery it's small I fix it in their
teardown shadows it'll just a little bit
bigger than 200 million hours it's
actually really good I had about 350 40%
left by the time end of day hitter came
around take it off the charger around 7
a.m. it's always on my wrist until about
11:00 or so p.m. so able to easily get
through a full day if I want to charge
it every day but not an issue at all you
know on the first day when I was really
playing with it using it heavily I was
still able to get to the full day I'd
even go to power reserve mode so don't
worry about that aspect of it you'll be
able to easily breeze through a day all
right so what about the UI when I tested
it apples event a few months back it was
kind of confusing and there was a
definite learning curve and there still
is and actually I got the product on my
wrist
what does tapping do what is pressing do
what is double tapping view what is
force touching do there's a lot to learn
here with the Apple watch is definitely
the least intuitive of all of Apple's
os's you give an iPhone to a toddler
they can figure out how to do things not
so with this guy but it's not to say
it's not very capable the icon screen we
go and navigate to find out your apps is
a huge pain to navigate and find through
there's no real rhyme or reason to how
they're ordered you could rearrange
things yourself but you're oftentimes
scrolling through or using the digital
crown to find stuff or talk a little bit
more than about the
by later but it is capable and it does
have a learning curve this is a question
you guys really want to know on Twitter
about bands it's certainly easily
replaceable you just sort of push a
button on the back slide it out push it
button on the other side slide it out
very easy I've had any stir of
discoloration at all on the support band
looks exactly to do when I first got it
one feature in the watch it probably
seems a lot of battery and works really
well when you raise it up the screen
turns on and you put your wrist down it
turns off and it does it very quickly
and it's almost a hundred in accuracy I
was actually really impressed with how
well it did it and how well it knew that
it was being raised and turned on so no
delay there at all I didn't have to wait
for it to turn on I just worked as you'd
expect a big issue that I've had with
smart watches outdoor visibility this is
really good outdoors no issue at all
again though this is the sport model
does not have the Sapphire screen
supposedly that model is a little harder
to view in direct sunlight so bear that
in mind so what about that taptic engine
Apple has been really talking a lot
about the bumps to me in it feel a
little bit weak and I've got mine turned
all the way up to the top but others
have said that they had turned it all
the way down subtracted out the
preference it feels different than a
vibration like you might be used to it
really feels like someone's kind of
tapping your wrist it's a really neat
touch I can see that getting way more
useful and the upcoming software updates
and certainly as a watch gets more
advanced over different iterations force
touch though is probably the coolest
feature of this watch I think hands down
it's really neat that only that it works
but it can recognize a harder push the
downside though it's really inconsistent
where it gets used and how but I can
really see the utility and what it's
going to be when it makes its way to a
phone I think's gonna be the killer
feature on the success and the 6s plus
somebody say that I wish there was more
consistency and asked with what it could
do if we're touching and the music app
for example pulls up more menu options
before is touching another screens
doesn't do anything fans have to guess
and try it and see if we can do anything
for you glances are kind of like widgets
on the watch and they really come in
handy too pretty customizable via the
companion app I almost used glances
morning use actual apps because it's
just easier to find that having a sort
through apps or ask Siri to do it for me
and speaking of Siri that a keyboard you
rely on Siri for almost everything does
a really nice job filtering out
background noise when you're trying to
dictate a message or reply back to
someone there's a lot of people around
you I will say though Siri was
definitely on the slower side and more I
used it the more it
to realize yet again how far behind Siri
is versus its google counterpart all
right so what about waterproofing it's a
watch it's probably gonna get a little
bit wet Apple does necessary claim
waterproofing but I took a chance and I
just wore mine in the shower and I had
zero issues at all it's still working
like it did from day one there's a ton
of videos out there people taking in the
pool leaving it in water for 30 minutes
and no problems at all so it's not
officially waterproof but if you just
use it the way you would any other watch
maybe don't take it in the ocean
even if you did you probably okay but be
smart about it and I could have any
problems thinking about being smart
let's talk about scratches it's pretty
durable but I didn't take a knife to it
I didn't see if it could withstand
diamonds you know if you think about as
a product you're gonna wear just again
be smart if you bang it against the wall
you might get a scratch on it's made of
aluminum and something on your wrist
it's not gonna be pristine to the entire
life of it and to expect to be pristine
is very very silly but in my 4 and 1/2
days I've had no problems and no sign of
wear or tear yet at all so I promised I
would talk about apps one thing to know
they don't necessarily run on the device
yet they are running through your phone
which means it's gotta communicate with
your phone so that also makes them very
slow take Shazam for example there's a
Shazam companion app for the watch you
can go ahead and open that up and that
would take its listing on your watch in
fact it was listening through your phone
so whether your watch is telling you
anything
got a cell of your phone out of your
pocket to listen that's sort of a lot of
the things that you see with the watch
it couldn't be useful right now realize
on your phone way too much I said what
about messaging being able to send
heartbeats and drawings to friends is
fun but the novelty definitely wore off
kind of quickly dictating messages was
handy and it worked well being of a
sentient boy so worked well being able
to customize emoji was neat but besides
that didn't do anything that was sort of
groundbreaking for me but again that
we're off you all are your friends of
Apple watches maybe your experience will
vary so you can use this to answer phone
calls it actually has a speaker and
microphone built-in the speaker was
pretty loud I was able to hear when
people are around me and also the
microphone does a nice job
about filtering out ambient noise people
can hear you as well when the features
Apple is touting about the watch is
activity monitor they want you to get up
get active I was really surprised how
accurate it was
when it came to tracking my heart rate
and also the steps I really like I
thought it actually helpful remind me to
stand up and move every couple hours it
would tell me like hey lardo stand up
okay I found it but critical because
this thing never moved at all did my
wrist the whole time the Apple watch
like most smartwatches now is just a
notification machine
I really have yet to see a killer
must-have feature on any of them the
Apple watch doesn't do anything that
Android wear even pebble doesn't do now
for the most part I'm pretty ambivalent
towards the watch just like I was
towards Android wear this ambivalence
comes with a really hefty price sort at
the lowest end at 349 and probably at
$399 for the 42 millimeter sport
it gets very expensive it does what I
thought it would do and it does what
does well understand don't necessarily
need what it does but it was a lot of
does in there I think you're a best
serve waiting for Jen to imbue mabye
native app supports going to come
perhaps it'll thin down even better
battery life may be that sapphire screen
filter its way down to the sport model
so what's the score did this one a
little bit differently I want to give
this a seven Todd who did our written
review and also has a sport model wanted
to give it an eight check his opinions
out again down boil so we met in the
middle with a 7.5 go into this knowing
what it does trying to forget if it's
right for you if you want notifications
that's all you're looking forward to
want the best notification system
available on iOS Apple watch is a good
way to go if you want more functionality
you want it to do more things you want
to see what the app can do are you
better off waiting suit developers can
put out see when native apps of course
when it comes to the watch and then make
your decision by that point perhaps Gen
2 already out and you'll get a more
streamlined experience product then what
you have now with Apple watch 1.0 you
guys thank you for watching do you agree
disagree I'd really like to hear your
thoughts on it's a pretty polarizing
product I know he's a video a thumbs up
you always appreciate it until next time
