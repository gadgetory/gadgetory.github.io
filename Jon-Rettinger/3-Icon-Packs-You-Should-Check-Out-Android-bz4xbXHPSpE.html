to you by the all-new g flex to you from
LG life's good hey what's going on guys
I'm Markin sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's video we'll be sharing with
you guys yet another set of icon packs
you can check out if you are running a
custom launcher on your Android device
now we did 5 icon packs to check out not
too long ago which you can check out in
the link down below for more information
now today we have 3 icon packs to show
you in no particular order so let's get
some number 1 on our list is the durgon
I con pack it's the first dark icon pack
I've ever tried and it looks gorgeous
it's simple circular flat but also
features beautiful vivid colors the
durgon icon pack features over 3000
icons and hundreds of alternative icons
to choose from whether it's from google
or third-party apps there's a lot of
icons that are themed and it also
features masking which essentially
overlays a dark icon theme on top of
your unseen icons now there are about 30
or so wallpapers that are cloud based
which means you can save them on your
device or set them right away there's an
included minimalistic analog clock
widget which looks pretty nice and goes
well with a theme the durgon I compact
is currently on sale for 50% off for
$0.99 whereas before it was $1.99 now
the second one on our list is the dip
icon pack with the diff I contact you
get over 1,000 icons which are built in
around four fundamental colors that if I
compact looks particularly good with
lighter themes like a white background
for example or if you prefer a darker
shade of gray it'll still look great now
the app also includes 20 wallpapers to
go along with this icon pack now if some
of your icons aren't supported you can
make your request inside the app now
just as a little tip for you guys if you
want your homescreen to look as
minimalistic as possible disable all
unnecessary parts of your launcher icon
labels the shadows screen indicators AB
drawer tabs look amazing trust me
the defied compact is going for a dollar
in 37 cents and you can get it through
the Google Play Store so the last one on
our list is rotox
now rotox features a circular design to
adopts the same color palette as
Google's material design now what's
interesting about this one is that it
adds a ring around each icon creating a
pretty unique effect that I haven't seen
with other icon packs rotox comes with
over 1600 icons and tons of cloud-based
wallpapers and let's say I'm pretty
impressed the icons themselves sort of
looks like 3d due to the drop shadow
behind each glyph now every icon just
looks gorgeous like Durgan it also comes
with its own analog clock widget that
will play well along with this icon pack
rotox is currently on sale 2 for $0.99
so make sure to check it out anyways
that's it for this video guys I hope you
guys enjoyed these 3 icon packs that we
shared with you guys if you guys have
any suggestions on which icon packs we
should check out just let us know in the
