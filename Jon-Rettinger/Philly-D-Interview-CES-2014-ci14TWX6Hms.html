to you by Toyota what's up everyone John
renter from technobuffalo here and we
are at CES 2014 I've got a very special
guest I am with the one and only mr.
Philip DeFranco Phil how you doing yeah
at least the past i'm good i'm exhausted
and tired so i might be a bit crazy so I
apologize levent tap you on the head and
wake you up just a little like I'm gonna
pee on the nose Boop I was like don't
touch it you doesn't get grease on your
face so we have been surviving CES 2014
Phil to stop by say hello we're gonna
talk a little bit about detectives here
there's a ton of new things to see
there's cars there's electronics and
there's one question everybody wants to
know here at CES you ready to be a dad
yes yes actually it's changed what I
look at the from the first night on I
was like excited about monitors I was
like that's cheap it's easy i can get it
i can look at it on my phone sold where
can i get it and and then little toys
like there was the the ozo bot couldn't
look at it the same because i just
imagined a small child choking on it but
no I'm excited I'm gonna I'm gonna mess
them up i think in all the right ways
that's my goal because you can't you
can't not mess him up i remember baby
for my son was born i got a three month
old I used to travel i did bungee
jumping is i think like a couple once
before like it's gonna kill me what I'm
gonna do like do I want to go on a plane
I'm gonna die like I'm never gonna see
my son again and it's gonna be it's
gonna be over but it changes everything
question I heard this from like two
separate people and I didn't think this
is a thing did your parents or do you
plan on never traveling on the same
plane as your significant like with your
wife so I'm paranoid if in all fairness
I'm Perry but no I'm not that okay I'm
okay I'm not like the president like
that the President the Vice President
other time I've heard that and I was
like who's the kid gonna travel with
like pussy with I'm like I'm crazy in my
head but I never liked choice other than
video I never say it out loud like no no
if we fly to get that we're all gonna
die yeah together
family unit so kid coming i know
everyone technology but keep coming yep
any any advice for for would be would be
parents out there oh god I'm like the
most ill equipped person um no nothing
just roll with it if I feel like if I
was one-hundred-percent terrified that's
not good if I'm one hundred percent
confident that's not good I got to
understand it's a completely new thing
everyone's going to say that I'm
probably doing the wrong thing at least
seventy percent of people and I'm just
gonna try and do a decent job and do the
things that I think worked when I was a
kid and not the other stuff don't listen
to anybody yeah I know so far best
advice I can give mother's mother in law
everybody's got different opinions on
how to do things I was on a vacation
with with with my fiance and i said that
i was drinking and then everyone was
like make sure she doesn't drink like
what would make you think like like the
drinking's gonna cut into her serious
drug use that summarizes the internet
like there's a kernel of goodness yeah
everything that they say but just comes
across as like no stop it let me ask you
about technology so being more of a tech
enthusiast then like you know say attack
like you expert or someone who you know
does it all the time what have you seen
here that's been interesting and what
can you not wait to get home to DeFranco
manner DeFranco manner I uh a lot of
like the bigger tax stuff I'm not super
excited about like I'm interested in
like the steam boxes I'm interested in
the piston I'm interested in that stuff
because I like the idea of portable
gaming where I always have the games i
buy and I never have to go like oh well
all of those things that I spent
hundreds of dollars on they're gone so
I'm interested in that a lot of it's the
toys for me I'm really interested in
having the mini parrot because I'm not
gonna be the only person with one
because although it looks it's awesome
do did you ever get the other drone 2
point 0 I broke the trunk exactly
everyone look like six minutes here
unlike unlike the hobbyist market
there's there's the drone drone to point
oh there's that little one that flips
now which I'm
big fan of theirs the the mini which now
they have the wheels which also serves
as like the weird bumper and then there
was like the twelve hundred dollar one
by jibley gemara I don't know it's like
almost a hobbyist drone yeah and it's
nice but it's still twelve hundred
dollars increase that's a thing a
hobbyist drone do it we're in the
hobbyist drone it's awesome are you
gonna be like I I went out with a
Richard Richard Ryan youtuber rated R
are quick to shoot stuff yes but he also
Harry's picture if I get Arsenal all the
time the first time I found out drones
were like there was a huge hobbyist
community they had they like brought two
guys out they made their own drones and
then he dropped a bomb with it and it
was amazing and I was like that's it's
also the most terrifying thing in the
world to know that hobbyists can do that
successfully Richard rinds Agag I
remember you sent me an email when the
new galaxy s4 came out the day is like
hey can you get me one dot dot dot I
want to shoot it yes all the tech just
shoot it will also add the one thing I
was excited about last time and then is
amazing this time oculus rift that
guiding guys that got from incredible
too ridiculously amazing overnight yeah
won't die motion stuff yeah I mean I
feel like it's what happens when it's
like a really good idea it's a really
good setup in the beginning and then you
get it was at 76 million dollars of
funding and then you see what happens
somebody just got like well let's try
this yeah they came totally grassroots
last year like a you know barely working
rig I mean now to see a transition of a
company and like the power of in social
media help promote them and now what
they can do is ridiculous and I believe
in it I believe in using that with like
a controller what do you think about all
these other companies trying to kind of
jump on the coattails and and flesh out
the VR experience whether it be with
those straps whether it be with like
that running thing every few years you
see like it was like okay lawnmower
man's going to happen right it's going
to have to be just dated ourselves a
little bit but ok it's going to happen
it's gonna be here and then it was like
virtual boy
like yeah I saw pictures from like
old-school CES and I was like oh we're
gonna look that ridiculous it's exactly
one day like the brand new kungfu game
for birdie bending you know jump over
snake and Sony have that new advisor
thing with the new visor thing we could
try that yeah it's a oh no there's
there's a lot of space underneath I
might have maybe not attached it but I
feel like if there's a full blackout
experience it's cool but I'm like I'm
not wearing that outside of my house
would you hook up a ps4 xbox one get
some gaming on that that that seems
maybe in like a hundred and one inch
screen I think I've performed am I mean
so it's ridiculous it's interesting I
just I don't know I'm I'd be much more
interested in playing an immersive thing
with oculus rift that set up I don't
believe the reason I think I don't
believe in the other be our stuff is
it's really expensive on top of
everything you always have to think
about like what Joe Blow in his dorm is
gonna be able to do if he even wants to
get up I mean they even like I was
talking to the guys that I want to say
it's pre OVR and they made a just upper
body version because people are like we
don't want to stand like we don't want
to move but we want to be able to stuff
like this for some reason um I don't
know I always I'm a big believer in the
controller is always going to be a thing
it's an extension of the body right now
I don't need to wave in my TV so
anything else here at the show that you
think is that can't miss for people who
can't you know aren't at the show that
shoot you don't want them to know what
what's the must-have defranco
now that will that has to be the oculist
I'm just trying to think everything else
I forget who said it it's just it's all
evolutionary not revolutionary a lot of
it is and like integration of some
technology and the things that you
wouldn't think I don't know what do you
have ones maybe it'll help me out yeah
the curved is boys are nice but I think
what didn't get any attention at LG's
booth they have mirror displays the
turnoff looks like a mirror and a clear
display looks like a window like any
normal window that's 10-point
multi-touch is I mean that that to me
was I mean incredible it's like living
Minority Report right yeah no no I mean
I'm but even still like I'm very I'm
finding myself very not like i'm
interested in 4k but i don't know if
it's gonna be the standard anytime soon
can you see a difference when you watch
1080p you i mean is it that noticeable
it's hard right because we're here on
the floor with specialized video that
that's meant to look damn right it's
same same guys that back when they're
the work is set players like they made
special music so it sounded great I
don't know it looked like the curved
when i am in that like perfect zone it's
beautiful what that looks like when I'm
watching regular TV or if for some
reason I have something that can play 4k
yeah I mean I'm sure it'll be amazing
but I'm a guy that I watch things at
720p and I'm pretty content yeah it
seemed to try to replicate that like
stand your def to high def like we're
the first time you watching a football
game right I definitely like it was
ridiculous him that's never ever gonna
happen I like that like jaw-dropping
just in there I can see the grass right
well cuz what the next thing was
supposed to be ESPN 3d and then that
channel went by it's funny seeing
quickly 3d went like well I'm glad that
at least this year there are much fewer
glasses list 3d everyone I mean I know I
get it but it's so bad it's like a
headache inducing the effect is minimal
at best yeah and there's no value it's
it's a it's a great concept but I mean
I'm a big fan of the the glasses that
are cheap I think is that that might be
Sony I can't remember yeah I know I
Sony's got some and LG's got the in the
passive technology it's just a surprise
but the same technology where kids at
the baseball cards like as you move a
little bit wings right you just
picturing the right in the sweet spot
you can you can see it a little bit yeah
as long as I can watch how to train your
dragon 3d I'm happy how do you train
your dragon and all the right ways very
carefully I don't know what that means
