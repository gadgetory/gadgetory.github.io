personal information out of this channel
I save it for inside John's mind but
something sort of important came up that
I want to share with you starting
tomorrow which is March seventeenth I am
off to Asia I will be spending 10 days
in Vietnam and Hong Kong six days in
Vietnam in four days in Hong Kong I'm
going because I'm getting my master's
degree in NV 8 be more specific and as
part of that program they sort of send
our entire class on what they call an
international residential we sort of
study international in business and do
some consulting for local businesses
there so I have never been to Vietnam
before I've never been to Hong Kong
before I have them into mainland China
though so I'm really looking forward to
I think it's going to be a lot of fun
but I wanted to share with you guys the
fact that was going to be going because
you may see a bit of a lack of content
between now and we get a half from now I
do have a few videos that have been
queued up to be uploaded between now and
then that you'll see sort of pop up but
my daily content will resume when I
return on just about the 29th or 30th it
is a 17-hour flight from Southern
California I'm going from LAX which is
Los Angeles to Tokyo and then Tokyo into
ho chi minh city i'm going to vietnam
first and it's a 14 hour time difference
from Southern California to Vietnam I
don't know what to expect in Vietnam I
know it's very hot there I don't no idea
what to expect in terms of the economy
the people the culture I'm going in
relatively blind these are going to be a
good thing or a bad thing a Hong Kong
I'm really looking forward to like I
said I spent a little bit of time in
mainland China but never in Hong Kong
i'm looking forward to also the
electronics i will be picking up short
of a ton of cool asian electronics if i
can something we can't get here in the
US and show you guys when i return if
you do and you are curious about what
I'm going to be up to 1 i'm in asia i
will be doing pretty regular updates on
my other channel inside John's mind
put a link to that in the sidebar in
case you guys want to keep up and check
out you know how things are doing it's
gonna be a big adjustment I think going
to a country like Vietnam I expect a
little bit of time in a few other Asian
countries as in China but but never
anywhere near Vietnam you know I don't
know what to expect so we're going to
see some residual from from the war if
it's going to be very cosmopolitan or
metropolitan I don't know so if you guys
ever been to Vietnam are you from
Vietnam I'm going to be mostly in the Ho
Chi Minh City I will have a few days
sort of explore that I'm not there
working I think it should be a lot of
fun so hope you guys sort of enjoy the
content coming up and I hope you will
not forget about me home gone and
there's a lot of exciting stuff when i
come back the ipad is going to come out
and did a lot of cool new things that i
won't be bringing back a ton of sort of
asian exclusive stuff that we can't get
here in the US to share with you so any
guys Feliz for the next ten days i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i am
off to asia i'll see you guys next video
bye bye so if those you guys did stuck
around through the video I want to share
something with you I am going to bring
my macbook with me to sort of document
the travels but of course the power
adapters are different in Asia than they
are in the u.s. so I went to my local
apple store and I picked up a world
travel adapter kit if you guys are
traveled abroad and you want to bring
your math laptop with you something that
you probably going to want to pick up
it's just about forty dollars I'm not
really mature what comes in here
hopefully the tips that I need for my
macbook and it's actually pretty neat
how it works this supports multiple
water all you got to do to pull off this
top part and these pieces in the box
with right in there and make this work
in a myriad of other countries those is
I don't think this unboxing merited its
own video but I thought I could be kind
of cool as as an add-on to the traveling
video let me go ahead and open this up
here things are quite adhered on
that off hopefully there we go let's see
what we get looks like you have adapters
for a ton of countries it's like all
over the world this will be handy for
those you guys that do a lot of
traveling I don't do that much traveling
but when I do it's gonna be nice to be
able to take my computer with me not
worry about blowing it up by using one
of those non-supported converters that
aren't really meant for electronics so
world travel Express adapter kit
probably not gonna look at that so let's
take a look at some of the tips and also
one cool thing that they do do is they
include a USB adapter that you can use
to charge your iPod or your iPhone and
we bring my iphone with me so that's
sort of a handy thing it sort of scales
down the power just slide this thing off
and I'm able to and so I would think
slide this right on although I'm not
sure sure looks like the piece actually
you take the adapter rather and that
slides on like that and turns it into a
little you know whatever port thing you
wanna dance I kind of neat let's take a
look at some of the other adapters that
come in the box I think this is UK not
entirely sure perhaps if you guys are at
the US you'll see your adapter here if
you want to know more information about
this and check out apple website time
different tips for again different
countries you see it all the power
adapters look like in different parts of
the world so here's another us one sort
of three on the box wasn't really in any
particular spot here's out of that one I
don't know if that one's really before
we've got a few more tips that's kind of
interesting and there is the US 10 guys
that's it wanted just two washers with
you hope you enjoy I hope you guys have
a nice week and a half and I will talk
to you when I get back see you guys
later bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
