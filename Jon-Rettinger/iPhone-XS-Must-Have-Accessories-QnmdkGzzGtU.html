sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T so around about your
walk into like your local AT&amp;amp;T store you
walk into an Apple Store Best Buy you're
surrounded by thousands of accessories
some odd that you may never need some
stuff you definitely need to have but
it's hard to pick the best accessories
for your brand spanking new iPhone 10s
or 10s Max and we TechnoBuffalo aim to
make your life just like a a smidgen
easier so you've got the best
accessories through a new iPhone tennis
the first accessory I think on any list
for your new phone is a wireless
charging accessory if you're not coming
from an iPhone 10 or an iPhone 8 what
are this charging is like a brave new
world for iPhone users so that's why I'm
picking the AT&amp;amp;T fast charge wireless
charger for a few reasons
first you're gonna get a quick charge
3.0 powered up in the box so if you're
an Android household we have an Android
phone you can be able to quick charge
that device with quick charge 3.0 the
output here is 10 watts again the
iPhones get a max at 7.5 but you got it
people Android device a lot of them can
do the full 10 watts you're gonna charge
your phone fast if you're just at home
and you throw it on here you'll get a
couple percentages in a few minutes I
like this one for a few reasons first it
feels really substantial feels heavy
like it's not gonna go anywhere it's
also slip resistant which doesn't sound
like a big deal but if you put your
iphone on here and you hit it you knock
it or you knock a table of phones can
fall off of course it's a Qi standard so
it be able to charge pretty much any
phone that supports wireless charging
it's really nice option iPhone a check
out the AT&amp;amp;T fast charge wireless
charging pad will link to it down below
I do want to give a thank you to AT&amp;amp;T
for actually sponsoring this category of
the best iPhone 10s products this is one
that's really good it's one that we
tested and we used one that I can
absolutely recommend to you guys I
suppose next one's kind of a dove but
it's probably my favorite iPhone
accessories its ear pods I thought there
and yet updated so we waited to include
it but they didn't Gen one is sticking
around 160 bucks and if you're upgrading
from an older phone that has a headphone
jack the air pods are gonna be an
awesome way to go about your life has
been stellar sound quality could be
better I wish there was some noise cam
slang that built into it but you just
want something to walk around answer
phone calls with listen to music or
student your desk air polish is still an
awesome way to go I see just got your
new iPhone when maybe you want to do a
little more typing on it then you're
comfortable with with the on-screen
keyboard Logitech keys to go is a pretty
decent option so it's gonna cost you 70
bucks it's got a stands you can drop
your phone right into it it's gonna pair
via bluetooth and you can type typing
experience is okay the keys are close
ish to full size like a single membrane
that sits across it so it does have that
single membrane for typing it does give
it some spill resistance which is nice
and another reason I picked it it's got
function keys dedicated directly to the
iPhone at the top which makes it nice
things that you might want to do you can
do it right here you can do search you
can pull up on just being keyboard
cameras a bunch of other options you can
have it's pretty sweet it's also really
thin and light so I can throw it in your
bag and like taking a class if you for
example and probably the best feature
about it it's got three months of
battery life so you can really charge
this thing four times a year and be good
to go so next up is the bolt duo by
Kingston this little guy think of it as
like a flash drive for your iPhone it's
a landing port on one side and USBA on
the other it's gonna do a lot more than
that you can get at different storage
sizes ranging from 32 all the way up 228
and pricing is gonna be varying in
between from 35 up to 70 bucks it can
extend the storage of your iPhone or
iPad you can also take pictures directly
onto it you can backup particular photo
galleries that you've got directly onto
it if you got a phone with low storage
or maybe opted for the 64 gigs and
worried you're gonna take up all its
base with photos this is a really cool
thing to keep with you I see you just
dropped a ton of dough on your iPhone
you're gonna want to protect it this is
the spec presidio case and I like it for
a few reasons first it's the least like
specky looking of their cases specs
known for providing really good
protection to your phones but usually
generally on the bulkier side this one
is slimmer so it's gonna give you that
same sort of spec protection but not
like in a giant package looks like it
belongs on somebody's building it's
price kind of in line at Apple silicon
case is about 39 bucks coming to
lifetime warranty obviously you got
different colors there's two layers of
protection here they call it and I quote
impact iam to protect you from volumes
boils down to this it's not crazy
expensive it's gonna protect your phone
and it's not gonna look absolutely
horrible or gonna be embarrassed to take
it out so when you're not with wireless
charging at home and you're travelling
and I gotta bring a lightning cable with
you the upper ones least for me of 10 to
fray and break especially at the
lightning connector I've got an option
for you that does double duty it's by
Nomad it's official name is a Nomad
battery lightning cable so it's gonna
cost you about 50 bucks and of course
it's a lightning cable to charge your
phone but it also is a 2800 milli amp
hour battery built into it and also has
pastured charging technology so what
that means is it'll charge your phone
first report' charges the built in
battery in here um I like the ballistic
nylon braiding it's not going to fray at
all it's also pretty long at 1.5 meters
if you're going on like a day trip and
you don't want to carry a wall adapter
this is a really good option you can
refill your iPhone 10s or 10s max
battery almost to a full hundred percent
this is really all you need and it's the
cable best of both worlds so those are
our favourite iPhone 10s and 10's max
accessories and if you're curious about
the phone in general we've got a
seamless transition to check out our
iPhone 10s and 10's the max review will
up here and I'll link to it down below
along with all the products that we
mentioned but if you guys have a killer
product something that you have to have
for your iPhone you need that everybody
needs to know about let us know in the
comments down below and we'll pin it up
if you think it's an awesome one or just
have a discussion about it please give
video a thumbs up we appreciate it so
next time John rende you're protecting
Buffalo
