TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing of the
Apple watch it's the first new product
from Apple really since the iPad at
least a new product line we've got the
Apple watch sport here comes in a long
box if you pick up a regular Apple watch
no idea what the Edition box is gonna
look like it's gonna be a bit more
square more traditional box like we've
got the blue 42 millimeter prices are
gonna range from 349 to 399 depending if
you at the 38 or the 44 so the box is
pretty simple it's long and it's white
and you guys are already making jokes
and it's telling me on the side that
this is indeed a blue one with the 42
millimeter case of course it's got the
glass Retina display series silver
aluminium and composite Mac so great
let's go ahead and bring in a singer
stab you had a chance to be at the
announcement of the Apple watch they had
a chance to try it on take a chance to
really see how useful it was going to be
so I'm very curious or put it through
its paces and to check it out so go
ahead and slice the plastic and I will
just greedily jump right in obviously
what you're gonna need you want to use
this is an iPhone not going to work with
a Android and never will go ahead and
pull us off this isn't doesn't really
feel like cardboard it's more of a
plastic box at least on the top let's do
the presentation is going to look like
and I assume under here is indeed the
Apple watch it looks sort of similar
like a longer version of the iPhone 5c
box pull this off a little bits more
plastic I'm gonna probably slide its box
out a little pull tab to go ahead and
take off the plastic and here is the box
for the Apple watch I'll go ahead and
push that off to the side open this up
real fast and see what also gonna be
inside of there and their lives the
Apple watch I've got sort of a felt like
material up here saying Apple watch
sport so you know what you bought and of
course we've got the blue one push it
off the side for a real quick sec see
also you're going to have inside of the
box designed by Apple in California see
the pudding here supposed as an extra
band perhaps yeah so if you need the
different sizes as a small or medium
and the large one is probably on there
so you can get a band it's gonna fit you
the best fit to adjust telling you how
to do it how to change the band's pretty
simple and some how to do not have been
here though our Apple stickers so sorry
for you we've got just a pretty simple
wall charger with USB on it and then
here is the new charger where they just
ridiculously long cord attached to it it
is magnetic eclipsed at the bottom of
the watch to charge
sort of wirelessly as long as that's
plugged in the first time we've seen any
type of wireless charging from an Apple
product and here is the Apple watch
sport go ahead and pull this out the
band feels like you'd expect to feels
like rubber a little bit more durable
for working out or doing anything that's
gonna cause some sweat on your wrist go
ahead and pull this off temp to and
there is the Apple watch with its force
touchscreen I've got a tactic engine
inside on the back those are all the
sensors of course that's also where the
Chargers going to connect to a
navigation is a bit different on this
you've got a digital crown that can be
turned and also be pushed and you've got
a manual button right there you can push
as well we're going to go ahead and get
this guy all set up and see how it works
and of course we'll be doing way more
