than sixty percent year-to-date of
course we're all focusing on tomorrow's
big event when the technology giant is
expected to unveil the much-anticipated
iphone 5 yeah and that's expected to
bolster Apple stock and sales some even
saying that it could boost gdp I mean
I've seen that estimate out there the
Apple economy I guess it is but now some
are saying though this could signal a
top for Apple mobile slates eric chan is
in that camp but technical buff
technobuffalo jon rettinger says there's
more room to grow John I mean you think
the juggernaut can continue yes
absolutely i can continue you only have
to look outside of us shores to see why
the iphone 5 supposedly going to support
china mobile's proprietary 3g network
with subscriber base of over six hundred
and seventy million have you taken
consideration Apple makes more per phone
than any other device that alone should
be reason enough to be very very excited
about Apple stock in the future so Eric
you're bearish on the stock right in
fact you don't think Apple can keep
growing at this pace you're on the other
side of that tree absolutely not Maria
when you look at the company two-thirds
of revenue is coming from iphone sales
given that several analysts have said
that the smartphone market is already
saturated it's competing with the sea of
Android companies such as Samsung in a
market where you've only seen six
percent growth and smartphone sales this
year well I mean you know it isn't it
true they've got a pipeline of products
I mean whether it be new iPad new
tablets new mobile phones so wanting
that be enough to generate growth I see
it possibly generating some growth but
when a product one product is so
dominant like the iphone for Apple
you've got to be concerned that the
other products have to come up and
really start showing the same type of
growth that the iphone House John do you
think that's valid no I don't the
smartphone market is very much what have
you done for me lately according to
Berens android owners are very fickle
thirty-four percent are undecided
whether or not to buy another and
vice with their next phone and seventeen
percent are saying they're going to look
to buy an iphone with their next device
and if you go outside long enough and
you say it's going to rain eventually
it's going to rain but I would not bring
your umbrella prepared for a time that
comes out yes both of you then John is
their level of which you would sell
apple or do you just keep going and eric
is there a level below that goes down
low enough you'd start to buy it here
John you first sure so certainly apples
had tremendous growth year-over-year I
say ride this train out Apple has a
proven track record of winning devices
they've sold more iphones year after
year every previous iteration now would
not be a time to sell i would look to
see two or three generations down the
road and see what i was doing about two
thousand percent so I'm pretty I'm
pretty cautious because if you look at
the overall market share of what's going
on with the smartphone market Samsung
has definitely been dominant compared to
the rate of growth of but as that level
of which Apple would go down to the
you'd start to buy the stock again I'd
love a stock split but you know I I
think that I think that it will get it
that's I think in it we might we might
get it and we put it in the doubt p
running late gentleman thank you both
thank you very much that'll make you
promise tomorrow of course they get that
mini ipad 2 outs of an inch ipad least
they said they'd never make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
