performance-based I talked about
switching to Windows I'm had a ton of
questions about why I did it
I talked briefly about some of the
problems that I had how I overcame them
but I got a lot of questions asked me to
explain it more so the reason I switched
to Windows is I want to do more reviews
on Windows laptops and desktops and
we've already done some of the past
breakthrough the only way to do that
honestly is to actually use the
operating system not just use it while
testing your computer actually use it in
and out every single day to get to know
all the nuances of it so I switched to
the service book and it's been
interesting it took me about three and a
half to four days to get over some of
the humps trying something new
think you're going to seem weird you get
that you know 24 hours and you're like I
mean mistake I can switch back I've been
using an OS 10 or Mac OS since my very
first youtube video when I box that
MacBook Pro and I've just been find it
to work for me but I need to be educated
on both platforms and I wanted to learn
what's going on with Windows 10 more
than I had already knew sort of
generally how to use it so I push myself
through those issues me about five days
to sort of be comfortable with Windows
and appreciate what it can do but I did
have some problems and here's what I
overcame so a few things that I really
like in Mac OS I like me I'll take
screenshots you know just doing the
command shift for those worked out well
for me you can select what part of the
screen that you want there's anything
equivalent in Windows you can use a
snippet tool or you can print screen but
you can't take a screenshot of something
specific and I do that a lot so I found
a tool called green shot that you can
set any custom shortcut keys you want
take a screenshot and you can export it
to wherever you like so I set that up
and it worked exactly like it did on Mac
OS I linked all these apps if you want
down below they're all free as well so
that was a really good fine for me
another feature that I really liked in
Mac OS they don't hit spacebar and see a
preview of a document now there's an app
that's in beta called sear st ER that
supposedly does the same thing and it
worked for me for like two days and then
just totally stopped working but
hopefully on that app comes out of beta
and maybe let improve it but you can
give it a shot on your own machine and
see if it works for you another thing I
really liked about Mac OS ability to
sign documents in preview I can sort of
use my finger sign one so I can just
input the signature and I'm good to go I
sign a lot of nd
is in contract so there's no risk that
windows didn't have that obviously I can
use the surface pen to sign documents
but at the computer docked most of the
time so actually Adobe Reader I can
download on any OS
you get out of a key signed documents it
makes it really easy it's a little
ticked a few more steps and when I had
on Mac OS but it works just as well but
the biggest issue that I had was finding
a nail app that worked when I reviewed
the original surface book when my issues
with it was the mail app was horrible it
wasn't pulling an address book so if I
wanted to send an email somebody had
already emailed me and I didn't know
their name or email address I couldn't
do it it wouldn't pull it in
it was infuriating he also couldn't drag
and drop files into the mail app
Microsoft has fixed that and the mail
app works really well but admittedly I
didn't just start trying the mail app so
I figured they hadn't fixed with
problems I tried to slew of other mail
apps find ones that worked I didn't find
one that really worked for my workflow I
just started using mail app again and
Microsoft fixed issues that I had before
so I just went back to using that so
it's hats off to Microsoft so the point
being if you're thinking about switching
a lot of folks are thinking about making
a switch the new generation MacBook Pros
you got to stick with it you gotta stick
with it for at least sort of that three
to five days you can over those weird
humps things are strange they're not
where they're used to them being but
Windows has gotten really good instead
of me just saying like hey you know
Windows sucks I use Mac here's some
emojis to say how stupid is I figured I
need to actually use it and learn it so
I always from an educated standpoint say
yeah it sucks or yeah it's really good
it turns out I'm kind of liking what I
see from Windows 10 I don'ts gonna be a
permanent switch but for right now I
have no desire to switch back to Mac OS
but maybe I'll change when the new
MacBook Pros come in we get a good
chance to to test those but for right
now I'm live in that Windows life I'm
not hating it so maybe I persuaded you
to give Windows a shot and perhaps the
way you want to do it is to create your
own website but maybe you don't know how
to code for you I've got a solution the
folks at Squarespace have you covered
the site's look super professional
they're easy to do regardless of skill
level no coding necessary which is
pretty good for me it's really intuitive
and easy to use I also get a free domain
