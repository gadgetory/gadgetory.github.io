technobuffalo and today we're going to
be taking a look at the esso run I stand
six it's a pretty unique all-in-one
kickstand battery case for the iphone 6
that's currently being crowd funded
through indiegogo now we were lucky
enough to receive one early so let's go
ahead and see what the esso run ice and
six has to offer so I've been testing
this out for about a week and a half now
and so far it's been great I haven't
dropped it on concrete yet but I'm sure
it'll be okay and there's actually a
video online showing it falling from
about six feet and it's survived pretty
well so I'm pretty confident than my
iphone with this case on will be okay
now the three thousand five hundred
million battery is great I fully charged
my device twice or maybe around that
number and I actually haven't seen any
other brand sporting a bigger battery
than the ice dance six so I give props
to esso run for the amount of juice they
have on here so bill quality overall the
ice and six isn't too bulky to a point
where it can be irritating and coming
from a six plus the case doesn't feel
all that big in terms of length it's
pretty comfortable in my pocket and in
my hand and since it's not as wide as
the six plus reaching across the screen
is still relatively easy so with this
case on it adds a bit of weight which I
kind of like letting me know that I have
my phone with me all the time so the ice
and six features a one-piece
construction and a matte coating which
makes it look clean and premium this is
the first battery case that have tried
that doesn't come in two pieces which is
nice because you don't need to worry
about losing any of the other pieces you
can simply flip the swiveling stand here
and slide in your iPhone I stand six is
made out of a soft rubbery material that
feels nice to touch and it's comfortable
to hold one handed which is very
important since you're adding extra bowl
but what makes I say and six unique from
other alternatives is this awesome
kickstand charging dock that you can
flip out it's great for facetime calls
or elevating your iphone without the
need for an actual doc now one other
cool thing that I noticed with the ice
dance six is the built-in SIM card box
you'll be able to store an extra sim
while you're traveling internationally
and I know for a fact that it can be a
bit tough putting away the iphones nano
SIM somewhere safe so having this
feature is really helpful the ice dance
6 is also mfi certified which means it's
been certified by the developers to eat
apples performance standard so you don't
need to worry about messages popping up
saying that the accessory you have is
not supported don't sweat it it works
really really well now while my time
with the ice and six is mostly been
positive there are a few things that I
don't like from the aesthetic standpoint
amount of text on the back is just too
much I wish all that would have been
placed inside to make the overall design
look cleaner and more appealing and the
other thing I wish to ice and six had
was just a little switch to turn the
case on or off now to deal breaker for
me but holding the button for a few
seconds to turn on or off the battery
isn't bad but I would rather have a
switch there rather than holding bun for
a few seconds it'll make my life easier
and turning on the battery case much
faster so at the end of the day I
believe the I stand six is by far the
best battery pack I've tried I've used
the mophie for the 5s the boost case
with my six plus and this definitely
seemed like the better fit for me it
works as advertised the built-in
kickstand and dock works really well for
me and the case fits on my iphone 6
really really well now I haven't tried
mo fees iphone 6 battery pack just yet
so I can't really compare the two but if
you're looking for a great alternative
that will fill up your iPhone 6 is
battery I stain sticks is the way to go
