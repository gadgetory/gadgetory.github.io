TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be giving
you guys our first impressions of this
guy this is the HTC re camera so let's
go ahead and see what it's all about
when it was first unveiled at HTC s
double exposure event last month we
didn't really know what to think of it
at first it looked really silly but
after getting our hands on it we
actually liked the unique look and it's
not a bad camera either so talking a bit
about the design it's an odd little
camera and its shape is certainly unique
while it looks awkward it's surprisingly
very comfortable to hold and use and HTC
did a really good job with construction
it feels really sturdy and overall feels
like a premium device for what it is
around the entire device you'll find two
buttons the big silver button is your
shutter button or record button press it
once and take a picture and press and
hold for two seconds we'll start video
recording the button in the front is to
activate slow motion video and if you
press and hold that you'll hear and see
the LED indicator turn blue to let you
know that you enabled slow motion video
the LED indicator will also tell your
battery life when you pick up the Ari
and blink constantly when recording so
when it comes to hardware inspects the
HTC rhe sports a 16 megapixel sensor
that can film in 1080p at 30 frames per
second and slow-motion 720p it also
supports time-lapse video and a future
update will support live YouTube
streaming which were curious a try out
the rear camera also features a 146
degree all true wide-angle lens with an
F 2.8 aperture a microSD slot for up to
hundred twenty eight gigabyte of storage
a built in instant on grip detection
sensor so you can take photos or film
videos much quicker and it's packing a
non-removable
820 milliamp battery the read is
equipped with bluetooth 4.0 for a low
energy consumption and a toe 2.11 a B G
and n Wi-Fi for connecting the read to
your Android or iOS device the recámara
is also waterproof with an ipx7 rating
which means you can submerge it
underwater for up to one meter for 30
minutes
the recámara sports a 16 megapixel
sensor and usually HTC does a pretty
respectable job in a camera quality
department and majority of HTC
smartphones are usually packin peasley
cameras and it doesn't disappoint here
with Ari it actually does a really good
job at capturing still
indoors and outdoors of course you won't
be able to focus on a certain subject
because you have an ultra-wide lens but
the optics HTC use are top-notch so
here's a few examples of some shots I
took today and they're pretty impressive
of course we'll have a full gallery up
on our site at TechnoBuffalo com so make
sure to check out some of the high-res
photos there now talking a little bit
about the video capabilities of this
device the HTC we can film in 1080p at
30 frames per second and slow-motion
720p though the slow-motion clips we got
from the rebirth not very good the
quality is definitely not up to par to
something like the GoPro or even iPhone
6 but nonetheless having slow motion is
still awesome the 1080p video on the
other hand is really good and the audio
we're getting from the resound superb it
uses two mics and I'm really impressed
with it it is a bit disappointing we're
not seeing different frame rates for
1080p videos or even 4k video
capabilities but hopefully in the future
we'll see new options or features added
with a firmware update battery life so
far is decent HTC's claiming somewhere
in a region of 2 hours of total use
which means you should be able to
squeeze about 1200 photos or an hour of
40 minutes of continuous video recording
so far it's held up pretty well though
we'd have to test a really vital
impressions of the battery life but so
far it's not too shabby last but not
least let's talk a bit about the re app
the app is a great companion to your re
camera as it's the only way to view your
photos and videos quickly unless you
hook it up to your computer essentially
the reconnects to the app via Wi-Fi
direct so you can get a somewhat
seamless connection and from there you
can see all your photos and videos
pretty quick and something we thought
was really cool is that you can use the
app as a viewfinder since the redoes n't
have an LCD display allowing you to
frame your shots before taking a picture
or recording a video but other than
those features you can change a few
settings to the app like video
resolution from 1080p to 720p photo
resolution from 1612 and 8.3 megapixels
toggle ultra wide-angle view and the
camera sounds which you can choose from
loud softer off the HTC re is definitely
an interesting take on a portable camera
but so far its functionality isn't up to
par what some other portable cameras are
offering like 4k video recording and
super slow-motion video price is a bit
steep of $200 but hopefully HTC will do
its best to update the read through
firmware updates and include some new
and exciting features like 1080p and
different frame rates 4k video
or even burst photos so far it's just a
really cool looking camera that takes
really great photos and good 1080p
videos which is more than enough for the
average person thank you guys so much
