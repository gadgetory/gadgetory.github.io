TechnoBuffalo here one of the great
things about the Samsung Captivate and
all of the Galaxy S devices is it's
Super AMOLED screen supposedly it's very
bright vibrant offers improved battery
life and great visibility in the Sun so
we're gonna put this thing head-to-head
with the retina display on the iPhone
and see who comes out on top so you may
have heard a lot about the Super AMOLED
technology and essentially what that
means instead of the touch sensitive
mechanism sitting on top of the glass
display it's actually integrated into
the glass itself so what is that going
to mean to you the end-user well it's
going to translate into improved battery
life better visibility in direct
sunlight it supposedly brighter more
vibrant colors we're gonna go ahead and
check this out there's a quick refresher
here the Samsung Captivate for 18 T on
the right has a four inch capacitive
touchscreen at the resolution of 480 by
800 and right next to it here on the
Left we have the iPhone 4th Retina
display and a resolution of 960 by 640
on a 3.5 inch screen so we just do that
math and multiply them together
the captivates going to give us about a
three hundred eighty four thousand as
opposed to the six hundred and fourteen
thousand on the iPhone 4 so you expect
that to translate to an improved display
on the iPhone but we're going to put
that to the test to see if the numbers
actually translate so first let me show
you that the brightness here is set to
the same it's gonna be hard to
necessarily translate what the screens
look like over camera but I do want to
show you there a comparing won't apples
to apples so the brightness would be set
to about halfway for each I'll go ahead
and show you there's the brightness
there and we'll go ahead and jump into
the same thing here on the captivate and
brightness you can see we're just about
halfway there as well so go ahead and
hit home so first let's see how texts
look on each display we're gonna
probably look at a lot of websites maybe
read some books on here as well let's go
ahead and look at a website see how the
text is going to look on each so you got
TechnoBuffalo here queued up but i'll be
doing a full head-to-head comparison to
both these devices going over speed and
all the specs and
of a threat I want to focus just on the
screen so you can see sir right off the
bat the captivate has sort of a grayish
hue to it and that's gonna really come
into play as we look at video quality
now it doesn't ticularly bother me at
all you used to it very quickly but if
you're looking for something that maybe
looks a bit whiter the iPhones gonna be
a better way to go
however the screen on the captivate
definitely looks a lot brighter so
bright is important to you the
captivates gonna be a better way to go
so let's look here at the screen pixels
and sort of what we can see I'm gonna go
and zoom out on each sort of as far as
we can go and there we go we are zoomed
out and just by a pure content
standpoint you can see what's shown on
both screens so the iPhone if you
remember has a resolution of 960 by 640
and the captivate is 480 by 800 so the
horizontal resolution is going to be a
bit higher and you can sort of see that
come into play content that we can see
here that sort of cuts off right at that
Old Spice ad on the iPhone to actually
see almost one and a half more articles
here on the captivates you are actually
going to get more content be visible on
the captivate to go ahead and zoom and
let's see how the text looks I'm going
to zoom as far as we can here on the
iPhone take the first article it's very
crisp we have no pixelation the Retina
display is very good for that I'll do
the same thing here on the captivate and
go to the same spot same article and
again I'll be doing the full browser
comparisons and tests not sort of as far
as we can zoom in here I notice again
that it looks very clear crisp we have
no pixelation very hard to tell the
difference to use two displays again you
can see a bit of a color hue in the
white background on the captivate that
you can't see on the iPhone 4 however
you notice this when they're next to
each other however we have to captivate
on its own it's hardly noticeable at all
very similar if you go look at two TVs
at a big-box store and you see a $5,000
TV stand next to a $2,000 TV right next
to each other I definitely have
difference but when you get sort of
lesser one home you can't notice it and
I'm not saying the captivate is a lesser
phone or lesser display I just from a
color standpoint once it's on its own
you really don't recognize it so this
isn't gonna come down to a personal
preference if you don't mind that color
hue you are gonna get much
our content on the captivate and when
you zoom in you don't get that
pixelating effects so text looks
fantastic on each this one is really
going to be a personal preference let's
go ahead and jump on into video and to
your video it looks on you twos are both
very heavy multimedia devices it's going
to take a look and see how each one
approaches video so we'll go ahead and
use the same YouTube clip on each I was
rendered in full 720p will use a one of
my unboxing videos for this so we'll go
ahead and jump into YouTube here on the
captivate and it's going to queue up
here a droid unboxing video I did and
I'll do the same thing here on the
iPhone 4
it'll go ahead and sort of turn this
volume down a little bit and you can go
ahead and see what the picture looks
like on huge it's going take this down
and now you can sort of see you video
quality and as the video story starts to
play you'll notice that they both look
very good and very clear and crisp
however you still sort of have that
color hue in effect on the captivate
that you don't have here on the iPhone
but it is definitely something to keep
in mind video wise they both look
fantastic
again the captivate looks a little bit
brighter at half brightness than the
iPhone 4 does and something to sort of
keep in mind if I were to turn the
brightness all the way up it wouldn't
really capture it on camera
well the brightness on both are turned
up all the way
the captivate still does look a bit
brighter so you trim to see you hear
what video is gonna look like you can
sort of see the difference as they both
go to play if both played video
fantastically I really nothing to go
wrong with either device it's nice to
see an operating system like Android
really embraced media like if you
captivating galaxy s s here I really
does a fantastic job handling all
different types of video so from a Super
AMOLED versus a Retina display this one
again is a draw because they both look
fantastic if you like the brightness and
you don't mind the color key to the
captivates gonna be great if you're the
color cube bothers you and you want to
turn the brightness up a little beyond
the ionic flume the ionic ones give me a
great way to go because kun sphere
consumer now has choice in sitting to be
in the hands of which
you prefer as a total package let's go
ahead and try some direct sunlight yeah
this looks not going let the video play
I'm actually gonna first try before I
say direct sunlight I'm gonna try direct
light let's say you're in a room with
lights overhead so I'm gonna go ahead
and turn on overhead lights and we'll
see sort of how they look so I now have
lights facing directly over the devices
ordinarily you have it's fun of glare
and in fact you can sort of see the
glare a little bit on the iPhone 4 to go
ahead and bring the lights even closer
hopefully I'm not blinding anybody you
can definitely see that there is a bit
of glare and reflection on the iPhone
before that you're not getting on the
cat abate which is sort of interesting
I sort of waved my hand over you can see
the bit of a reflection there and you
can't see it on the cat abate so you can
sort of see it there see my finger and
you don't necessarily see that on the
captivate something to keep in mind now
if I'm not playing binge looking after
the operating system under this same
sort of direct artificial light let's
see how that looks so I can go back home
the glare here is sort of less visible
but again if I do that sort of finger
tests you can see there's my finger
there and you can see it there as well
if I pull the light directly overhead so
it's facing right down you can sort of
see that lamp on it thinking that right
out of the way you do get a bit of glare
here and a bit of glare here let's go
look at some text and see how text looks
under this artificial light well I can
tell you well go ahead and zoom in a
little bit so text on each is definitely
visible and this is one way written sort
of that Hugh may sort of come in to to
help Lee captivate it actually makes the
text a bit more visible in direct
sunlight now you're looking at it right
here you can start to see the reflection
of the lamp and you can see that cannot
see my finger there really on the iPhone
you can't really see if there either now
if I switch these since the lamp is off
to the left let's see if there's any
straight difference there as well to
keep everything fair so you can see the
reflection now on the iPhone we move the
other way you see the fingers there and
you can't see it here as well so the
super amoled does perform a bit better
indirect artificial light let's go ahead
and see how that's going to perform
in direct sunlight alright so here we
are right in direct summit I've got the
light coming in from the left hand side
we're in the middle of a big heat wave
here in Southern California not a cloud
in the sky so there's no sure to
sunlight unless you have both perform
here they both look very good sail and
direct sunlight you can still see a bit
of reflection if I have my hand over it
with the text on each is definitely
visible much more visible than I've seen
on different devices the iPhone 3GS for
example was not the most visible in
direct sunlight on other Android devices
for instance the Nexus One I had some
trouble with so both these phones look
this sort of addressed that issue
now what if I switch these around since
the Sun is coming in from the left side
both appear to be a bit better don't
really have any view of your viewing
issues which is quite nice so again if
you have to make a conclusion about this
we flip the text we've looked at video
we looked at direct overhead light now
direct sunlight both display seem to be
very very comparable they both look
gorgeous
these are displays you have to really
see to appreciate it's not really given
doing justice on the camera if they both
look really really nice and the moral is
that you're not gonna go wrong either
way it displays your only thing to
choose from you really have your work
cut out where this is going to have to
be a draw both of these just look very
good so when I do my head to head of the
calculate version of the iPhone I will
do a screen round and I'll reference
back to this video and that round is
going to be a dead even heat because
both of these again just look really
nice so hats off the Samsung hats off to
Apple for putting very very good
displays in both of their devices I'm
