consignment from TechnoBuffalo and Apple
on Monday introduced a new version of OS
10 called
El Capitan which introduced a lot of
cool new features that focuses on the
overall user experience and performance
OS 10 El Capitan gives you even simpler
smarter ways to do things you do most
with your Mac improvements under the
hood makes your Mac snappier and more
efficient in all kinds of everyday tasks
from opening PDFs to accessing your
email we've been playing with it for a
few hours now and here are some of the
new stuff we found one of the coolest
and most useful new feature is the
ability to quickly find your mouse
cursor now when you don't know where
your mouse cursor is you can wiggle your
mouse or move your finger across your
trackpad and the cursor will get larger
making it easy to pick out in a sea of
Windows and Tex
number two is enhance spotlight and
in-app searching spotlight is smarter
than ever before delivering results for
weather sports stocks web videos and
transit information you can even search
for files using natural language so when
you're looking for something just type
it the way you'd say it you can also
resize and move spotlight anywhere on
your desktop now which is definitely a
nice addition an app you're looking at a
more intelligent search that responds to
what you type for example you can search
within finder to bring up all the
pictures you shot for a certain product
or all the screenshots you took on your
computer number three are the new Safari
improvements Safari received some pretty
nifty features as well including this
awesome new feature called pin sites if
you have a lot of tabs open in Safari
that you always use like YouTube Twitter
and Facebook you can simply drag the tab
to the left and Safari you will turn
that page into a pin site it doesn't
matter if you close the Safari window on
accident your pin sites will remain
untouched
another great feature for Safari is the
ability to mute the annoying audio that
plays in your tabs for example you start
hearing something play in the background
and you have no clue what's playing
you'll now have a new speaker icon in
the address bar that gives you a quick
way to meet the sound number four is the
new Mission Control and split View mode
Apple's new Mission Control makes it
easier to see and organize everything
you have open on your Mac you can now
drag any application to the top of your
desktop to launch the new Mission
Control and from there you can drag an
app to its own space to have its own
window but you can also drag it to a new
desktop to create a new virtual desktop
there's also a new split View mode for
example we have a Safari on its own
window in full screen we can drag an app
like mail and activate split view
number-5 are the new
features al-kafi tan has tweaked the
full-screen view of mail to giving you
through some handy features for mail
composition for example when you
minimize an email midway through you
won't have to go through your drafts
anymore to get it back it now simply
goes to the bottom of your mail window
letting you continue when you're ready
plus you can now add tabs to your new
message window meaning you can compose
multiple email messages simultaneously
number six is the new Notes app just
like in iOS 9 - new Notes app in El
Capitan is better than before you can
now embed photos and use rich formatting
at checklists and the overall UI just
looks much cleaner than before which
almost makes it like a very simple
version of pages as you're no longer
limited to just typing in text with the
most basic formatting abilities last but
not least are the performance increases
Apple focus on performance without
capitan saying it'll make all sorts of
elements of OS 10 run faster apps will
launch 1.4 times faster while switching
between apps will be two times faster
than before and also be twice as fast to
display the first of your mail messages
while opening PDF files in preview will
be four times faster
additionally Apple is adding metal to OS
10 from Macs metal is a core graphics
technology that gives apps and
developers more direct access to the GPU
now this will allow for faster and more
efficient rendering performance across
the system and that's not just for
mobile games in fact apple claims metal
for OS 10 El Capitan will offer 40%
rendering improvement and a ten times
draw call performance increase which
means we'll see better performance and
better looking games on Macs in the near
future there's a ton more that Apple
didn't get to cover like a redesigned
Disk Utility shared link extensions
suggested events and find my friends
widget this is just the first developer
preview of Mac OS 10 El Capitan so a lot
of what we're showing you today could
potentially change and if there are any
major changes in the future we'll be
sure to keep you guys in the loop
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
