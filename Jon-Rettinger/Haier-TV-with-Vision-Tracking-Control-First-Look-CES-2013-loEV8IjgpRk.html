TechnoBuffalo here and we are from the
CES show floor 2013 at the hire booth
taking a look at some of the coolest
tech I've seen in a long time
this is their revision control
technology so what it does is just like
it sounds you can control the television
with just your eyes now this is meant to
be calibrated to the person but since
there's a lot of people here at CES they
set it up generally they're not saying
how it's gonna be integrated but showing
here on a TV hope it'll make its way to
other higher technologies and maybe even
be licensed other stuff they give you
demonstration this is crazy cool if
you're playing with it earlier I'd
something to sit in front of TV on a
look at this little bar and look at the
TV and it's going to look at my eyes so
I'm tell you what I'm gonna do before
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna look down at
the bottom left I look at the bottom
right then I'll look back up again you
guys can see how it works let's try it
right now see as I move my eyes right
now I'm gonna move down to the woman on
the bottom right I'm gonna move to the
bottom left move up to the upper left
move to the middle we've got the wrath
of the Titans scroll through all those
movie options and if you want to select
something a hard blink usually does it
it's where the calibration come into
play you gotta kind of lick a few times
and then it should open
and there it goes to play it really does
work surprisingly well and the content
here will start playing now there's
something playing here if I want to
change the volume I look to the bottom
left and then move my eyes
and the volume will start to change
depending on where I'm looking
it's a really impressive technology from
hire I love to see this fine-tuned be
calibrated for an individual and see how
this really would work when it was meant
for you
but this legitimately warts and one is
besson limitations of vision control
I've ever seen I'm John rented from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
