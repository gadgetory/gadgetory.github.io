TechnoBuffalo here summer is coming to
an end this on the good news it means
baseball playoff so here on the bad news
it means you've got to get up you're off
your mom's couch and get back to school
we get a ton of questions about laptops
do you need a gaming laptop Zen I can
make do with a Chromebook as a tablet
all you need it's kind of hard to sort
through which is the best computer out
there because you'd go to Best Buy look
at Amazon they're just computers
everywhere Lenovo was doing some really
awesome things so we thought we'd start
with them and sort of run through every
tenth Lenovo's god hopefully you'll find
one that'll suit your needs so I was in
school too and I had a roommate who used
to literally sleep past his 2:00 p.m.
classes and I really could have used the
backlit keyboard on Lenovo y50 it's got
a ton of other awesome features is
probably not like the one that they want
to make sure everybody knows about but I
really could have used it so I used to
use my computer for ton of different
stuff definitely not just we're
processing like I always told my parents
so I used to rock some serious snood you
should look it up you can get it on your
phone now or tablet the original
Warcraft before it became world of and
people dedicated lifes to it and the
very first Starcraft so I just clearly I
didn't get out as much as I thought I
did this thing note is going to press
your parents and give you the
flexibility to just kill some zombies in
your free time so you can get it
optioned up with a fourth generation
intel core i7 processor the latest
Windows 8.1 64-bit either fourteen or
fifteen point six inch anti-glare
display 1920 by 1080 you can up it even
to UHD if you want huge hard drives up
to one terabyte and that's gonna be
plenty enough to store your movies games
whatever else you want to tell your
parents got on your computer option it
up eight gigabytes of RAM and a ton more
some moral being the wife order the
white 50 line ups gonna be the nice
computer it's gonna give you all kind of
the best of both worlds it's got the
duty to do sort of the light we're
processing but also got the horsepower
to play some games on the side so we get
a ton of questions about Chromebooks for
a lot of people I think to the perfect
balance of functionality and price there
are way more apps than ever for Chrome
OS and Google is even gonna be bringing
over Android functionality to so you'll
get everything that you want right on
your Chromebook you won't typically find
low cost Chromebooks with a touchscreen
abaut lenovo has got that base covered
with the end 20p chromebook it's got an
11.6 inch 1366 by 768 pixel display
10-point multi-touch screen two gigs of
RAM 16 GB solid-state storage Bluetooth
4.0 ridiculous 8 hours of battery life
on a single charge and best part at
least for me it's got a full sized
keyboard so there's no compromising
there at all so lenovo likes to do crazy
stuff with their hinges and this there's
no example you can just go ahead and
bend it all the way back the end 20p can
be used like a stand or a kiosk and it's
trigger friends like look what my
Chromebook and you can yours do it
probably not so for a lot of people a
tablet with an external keyboard really
all they need for school we've got the
Lenovo yoga tablet HD Todd fell in love
with this thing at Mobile World Congress
it offers better specs at a budget price
of just $299 it's got a really
nice-looking 10.1 inches boy it's 1920
by 1200 you got Dolby Digital Plus
front-facing stereo speakers micro SD
card slot for boosting storage it's
gonna come with 32 gigs already inside 8
megapixel camera live right there on the
back 1.6 megapixels just got a selfie
camera it's pretty much what it is and
18 hours of battery life plus you're
probably saying John what's up with this
round thing at the top that that's the
technical term it's actually a kickstand
you go ahead and slide that out and then
boom you can just watch your stuff with
that built-in kickstand so you don't
spend a bunch of cash to get a really
solid computer Lenovo flex 215 kind of
has you covered this guy's got some
tricks up its sleeve also the notebooks
people of serving as a standard laptop
display can also flip around as lenovo's
like to do into perfect stand mode if
you guys want to see my perfect stand
mode it's this it's probably saying John
that looks cool but why why would I want
stand mode pretty well on an airplane
train table if you travel a lot and dorm
room desk it's a quick predation in
class just saying just a few things
clear up top of my mind the entry-level
model is gonna ship with a fourth
generation Intel Core i3 processor
clocked at 1.9 gigahertz Windows 8.1 64
inch 1366 by 768 pixel display six hours
of battery life Intel graphics 4400 four
gigabytes of RAM and a beautifully
spacious 500 gigabyte hard drive for
storing I know what you store on your
computer there really aren't a lot of
compromises on this design either lenovo
includes its really awesome
backlit a Khattab keyboard and will
touch trackpad stereo Doby advanced
audio speakers and a ton more so get
your flex on so for this hope you guys
pick what computer you get if you want a
crazy bendy laptop you want a gaming
powerhouse you want a tablet a
Chromebook or an all-in-one they're a
ton of choices and options available out
there we'll keep bringing the questions
other come in on ask the Byfuglien has
any more things that you want to see
anything else from the computer world
we're gonna try and delve into it and
show you guys the best that's out there
