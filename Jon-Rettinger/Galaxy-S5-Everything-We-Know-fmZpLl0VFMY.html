to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup of this week all you Apple fans
might want to go cover your ears is all
about Samsung and all about the galaxy
s5 this week on rumor roundup let's go
ahead and start rounding things up it
comes to rumors who knows what the heck
is real and what is just some photoshop
fanboys fantasy try saying that three
times fast we've been covering the
galaxy s5 rumors for a long long time on
rumor roundup as it gets closer to its
imminent announcement things are
starting to kick up a notch and I a
giant notch the New York Times recently
said it learned from an inside source
that the galaxy s5 will only employ a
1080p display and I say only like that's
not awesome enough but then an alleged
box popped up on Tuesday that clearly
showed a quad HD screen suggesting
something sharper more higher resolution
II might be coming to my hands that need
more pixels so good both actually not
being true on Wednesday a user agent
profile and Samsung's own website shows
the very sexily named sm g900 team model
number that points to a t-mobile launch
and another user agents also showed up
showing a equally sexy named SMG 9dp
model ready for sprints and if history
is going to repeat itself the phone will
also launch on 18 teen verizon so in a
section that discusses the screen size
we see a resolution of 1920 x 1080
basically the same resolution as the
galaxy s4 this raises one major question
will samsung released two versions of
the galaxy s5 one that we saw on the box
the other one that we saw on the user
agent Laurel profiles it seems kind of
plausible we make galaxy s5 in a galaxy
s5 pro made of aluminum or aluminium so
I don't get yelled at who knows it could
be the galaxy s5 note pro zoom camera
coming in the near future the allure of
surprise announcements and excitement of
what's coming soon is
gone in the internet world earlier in
the week our friend Sonny Dickson
released alleged renders of the upcoming
Galaxy s5 we don't really know where you
got it from but they certainly do look
like a Samsung device and it does appear
to have a spot where an IR blaster would
sit in the top of the phone however a
wide area below the camera suggests that
there could be a room for a dual LED
flash getting more analytical it also
looks like there could be a hatch of the
micro USB charging port which ends like
hasn't used on any of its flashier
devices for that reason it looks like it
might be something different my bet and
my money has that being a galaxy s5
active which would certainly have to
have the port cover to keep water out or
at least try to keep the water out my
hope though is that it's the active and
will look different when we finally get
to see the regular galaxy s5 that will
get damaged when you throw it in water
so this is a crazy awesome time for
technology TVs are getting curves and
soon phones will start to have bends and
maybe even fold which really starting a
mere cardboard according to a new report
from the Korea Herald Samsung is playing
to release its first bent smartphone so
before you start drooling like I was
over the idea of a foldable smartphone I
should throw water in your party and
clarify that Samsung's bent smartphone
isn't really what you really think it is
so unlike a regular slate phone the
screen here actually wraps around the
side of the device crashing it gently
creating an extra sliver of display real
estate that can be used to show
notifications or controls so the device
doesn't actually Bend oh it could make
use of the company's flexible OLED
technology the first bed smartphone
reportedly launched as a niche device
similar to what we saw at the galaxy
around with just a few million copy that
market it's funny that a few million is
a niche device the strategy allows
Samsung to test the market that really
making just a gigantic investment to it
I could pave the way for crazy cool
future breakthroughs if it's bent
handset a success though we might even
see a foldable smartphone its stores
sometimes of 2015 Samsung behind closed
doors was showing flexible bendy
displays at CES of this year so who
knows it could all be coming very very
