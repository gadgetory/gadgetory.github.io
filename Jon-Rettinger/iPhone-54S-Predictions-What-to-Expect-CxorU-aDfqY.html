technobuffalo here we now know the when
apple's announcement for their iphone 5
or iphone 4s keynote is coming on
October fourth the big question is what
are they going to announce so stick
around let me give you my predictions so
unlike his last year's keynote when we
knew exactly what the iphone 4 was going
to be we now are back to the old days of
really knowing nothing it's been pretty
commonly thoughts that Apple was going
to announce two phones presumably one
called an iphone 4s which is going to be
an evolutionary design of the iphone 4
aimed at the lower end market and then a
redesigned iphone 5 spect up to the
gills ready to do battle with the
samsung galaxy s 2 s and the droid
bionics of the world i feel a little sad
that i can no longer include webos in
that competitors category but that's
what we thought what is Apple actually
going to announce well the past couple
weeks have gotten really interesting
we've heard rumors of sprint say hey
we're going to cap's our data and then
spritzing no we're not going to catch
our data we've seen Apple logos pom-pom
and Sprint's inventory we've heard
grumblings of t-mobile perhaps carrying
the iphone 5 or iphone 4s certainly
18teen verizon we know are going to have
it it's been tough to filter through all
the rumors to find out what fact or
nugget of fact which is kind of a gross
thing to say might be in there so let me
go ahead and run you through what I
think we're going to see I do think we
are going to see two new phones when the
iphone 4 was announced you might
remember this is now almost a year and a
half ago they would have a 110 a gate
thing if you held the phone with your
left hand you lost all your birds of
service and it was a legitimate issue
they had a whole the whole keynote
talking about it I think animal is
pretty unhappy with the antenna design
of the iphone 4 certainly when that
antennagate thing happens they couldn't
recall all the devices so they gave you
a free bumpers and they sort of said my
bad and they went along the roadway and
the iphone became the iphone 4 rather
became one of the best-selling devices
internally aqua
is known for their design acumen and
design perfection so I think the iphone
4s is going to look very similar to the
iphone 4 with that antenna issue fixed i
think from the specs standpoint we're
still going to have that a4 chip in
there we're going to have the same
amount of ram in there we may have a bit
of a bigger screen up to 4 inches but
mostly i think it's going to look
exactly like the current iphone 4
probably coming in at that ninety nine
dollar price point traditionally with
apples are these new phones their
previous generation device is what
filters into the lower in price point
but there's been an onslaught of android
phones coming out better at varying
price points from the high ends like the
droid bionic tour to the low end like
some of the LG devices that have been
coming out recently there's really a
huge gambit of price and apple they're
going to have one phone as it competes
across the huge huge huge broad spectrum
two phones will give them a bit more
ammunition but the iphone 4s let's say
it's coming what they couldn't come to
ninety nine dollar price point what
about the iphone five are we going to
see an iphone 5 iphone 4s we saw
OtterBox doing some case mock-ups and
some packaging cordless case mock-ups
that said iphone 4s on it but what about
iphone 5 i think we're going to see an
iphone 5 and this is really just
speculation I think Apple needs to make
a splash in the smartphone world some
would argue that they've been passed up
by Android over the past year and a half
since the iphone 4 has been announced
and i would definitely fall in that camp
iphone android specs rather and android
phones come out fast and furious but
there are a select few that completely
bests the iphone it's not only aspect
standpoint but from a software
optimizing that hardware which apple
always had a big advantage of because
they control the whole process it takes
something like the galaxy s2 which is
coming for most major carriers exception
of verizon or of course you can get it
unlocked if you're not on if you don't
want to pick up the carrier version as
an extremely well specs and zippy zippy
phone that does just about anything that
you need and you get that Android
customization so Apple needs to make a
splash in the hardware standpoint those
are gorgeous
looking phones that Samsung is coming
out with Apple ameet to compete I think
we are going to see that teardrop design
that we've heard rumored about in the
iphone 5 I think we're going to have
that almost an edge to edge close to
bezzle list screen think about those
sort of samsung smart tvs to have no
bezel on the side with pretty awesome
probably in the 4 inch variety certainly
we're going to see the a5 processor in
there that's going to give you a
dual-core miss we're going to see an
upgrade and RAM to one gigabyte on the
back we're going to see an upgrading
camera to 8 megapixels I've been rumors
that it's going to be Sony produced
doing this a lot but that's supposedly
going into the specs the highlight of
the show I'm guessing is going to be iOS
5 which I think Apple sells a few tricks
up their sleeve so we've seen Twitter
integration in iOS 5 we've seen
notifications drop down we finally seen
some better notifications on the home
screen but what about some hidden things
what about voice assist we're hearing a
lot of rumors that voice assist is going
to be included in iOS 5 is sort of a
voice assistant so not only can you look
crazy when you have a bluetooth headset
on walking around you can look even
crazier when you were just yelling at
your phone and nobody is on the other
end iphone they'd be dinner reservations
you can point out it in yell at it
presumes we're going to see that as well
we may also get facebook integration
similar to what we have with iOS 5 of
Twitter integration Facebook will be
native there as well so you can go ahead
and upload a picture right from your
photos application you can update your
status and all that kind of goodness we
may also see the launch totally
unrelated i guess of a facebook
application for the ipad at this event
maybe we'll see zuckerberg up there on
stage with Tim Cook don't expect Steve
Jobs to be there as well he is of course
step down so that sort of the recap of
the rumors so what about carriers what
are we going to see you from a carrier
standpoint well this is where things get
a little bit tricky verizon it runs on a
cdma network their LTE network which is
their 4g runs on a different standard
based on gsm AT&amp;amp;T is a gsm standard
their LTE network they're just sort of
rolling out with no phone supported
right now of gannan gsm technology
Sprint is
bc in May and they've got Y next to
their 4g t-mobile has hspa+ which is gsm
very confusing so let me go ahead and
cut one of those off right there i do
not think we're going to have an iphone
5 or iphone 4s for tmobile at launch not
to say we're not going to get one a few
months later but do not expect one at
launch t-mobile is set it's kind of up
to Apple what they want to do we love
take it but a look at our Android phones
don't don't worry about Apple Sprint's
though I think seems a bit more of a
sure thing i do not think we're going to
have any 4g wimax support unfortunately
i think we're going to have their 3g
which is a pretty nice network on there
cdma 3g network same thing unfortunately
with verizon I think we're not gonna
have support for their awesome and
awesomely fast LTE network and 18t
hasn't even launched LTE and 10 cities
yet they don't have any phones that
support it so I would not expect LTE
support on AT&amp;amp;T however I would suspect
the AT&amp;amp;T version and whether or not it's
one phone that could support both cdma
and gsm to what we're hearing i would
expect AT&amp;amp;T phone to have support for
their hspa+ network which is pretty
robust so disappointing i would love
some LTE action on a iphone verizon's
network is credibly fast aight EMTs
network is supposedly going to be
incredibly fast but it's not ready for
primetime yet and I don't think AT&amp;amp;T or
apple want to deal with the jokes about
call dropping so i think we're going to
see an hspa+ variant i will probably
have two iphones that are going to be
launched one that's going to support the
CDMA and GSM networks on verizon and
perhaps another one that's going to
support it on Sprint's this is one thing
where I hope I'm really wrong about and
their get surprised everybody and
announce LTE support and AT&amp;amp;T is going
to say fooled you flip a switch and
suddenly the whole nation is going to
have 18t LTE support probably not so
guys if you agree disagree do you think
that I'm dead on that I miss something I
want to know what you guys have this
hey I'm very curious this announcement
like I lapbook you know it's been
extremely well height and I just want to
know what you guys think we're going to
get to get an ounce here leave your
comments down below and of course stay
tuned to technobuffalo on the fourth at
ten a.m. we will be the live blog in the
entire shebang shabooty keynote so check
that out if you want some updates
