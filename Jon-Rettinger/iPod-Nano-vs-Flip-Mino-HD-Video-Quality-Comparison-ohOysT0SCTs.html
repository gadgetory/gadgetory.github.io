since Apple updated their iPod nano line
to include video camera and video
capture capabilities there's been a lot
of talk about how the miniscule Nano
it's gonna stack up to the king of the
quick video recording he'll the flip
Mino in this case it's the flip Mino HD
so before we get to the comparisons and
put them side-by-side and see how they
look let's go run through the specs very
quickly first we have the iPod Nano
which will run you 149 for an 8 gigabyte
model or 179 for a 16 gigabyte model
it's got a 2.2 inch diagonal display
that can show pictures or videos
whatever you're looking at and a 240 by
376 resolution records video at 640 by
480 and up to 30 frames per second does
not capable of taking still pictures by
the way that's been a point of
contention so in the other corner we got
the flip Mino HD this suckers gonna run
you $1.99 for a four gigabyte model it's
got a 1.5 inch diagonal display which
shows this video at 528 by 1:32 and the
really the most important feature is
that records in HD at 1280 by 720 let's
go ahead and put these two side-by-side
first video you're going to see is the
iPod nail alright so this is the iPod
Nano we're going to use Mercedes again
as our test subject so you can hear the
audio you can see the video quality I'll
give her some pets so she doesn't feel
lonely you can see what it looks like
with the Nano overall quality is
generally pretty impressive especially
for such a small and inexpensive device
so give another couple seconds of video
here guys can see again what the quality
looks like she likes me to scratch your
butt next up let's take a look at how
the flip Mino HD compares to the Nano so
here is the flip Mino HD shot in exactly
the same place at exactly the same time
of day with the same amount of lighting
you can see what the quality of the
video looks like and once again Mercedes
is our test subject so you can
the audio quality you can see what it
looks like I think she's a little bit
shy from being on camera what do you
think she loves scratches so here is
again the flip Mino HD
so as you can see there is a significant
difference in equality between the Nano
and D flip Mino HD and that's to be
expected the minnow HD is a standalone
video recording device who use the only
function is to record HD video and it
does it very well in a very thin package
also has that built-in USB connection
the Nano on the other hand is really a
jack-of-all-trades even coming in at a
lower price point it's video recording
capabilities as you can see are actually
relatively impressive when you take into
consideration the size of the device you
can put them side-by-side I mean there's
really no comparison as to how they
stack up I think that the video
recording on the Nano is certainly not
as good not up to par with the minnow HD
I think that the audio quality on the
Nano though is actually as good if not
better than the minnow HD the Nano is a
lot of things it's an iPod it's a
pedometer it's a voice recorder it's now
a video recorder it's got a lot of
functionality for a very very very slim
price if you're looking for a device
that does a little bit of everything if
you want to make sort of some short
YouTube videos you're not concerned
about HD quality then I think that'd be
well and then it was a great way to go
if you're only looking for device that
records a video and you really want HD
quality well then the minnow is going to
be a good way to go if I have to pick
one I'm gonna go with the one that I can
do everything on and I got it fake
banana so you guys agree or disagree
would you rather have the minnow HD we'd
rather have an iPod and do a little bit
of everything for you leave a comment or
video response if you're curious as to
what you guys think I'll see you guys in
