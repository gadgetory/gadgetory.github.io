from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the Lumia 928 if you've been on
Verizon and even looking longingly at
your AT&amp;amp;T brethren to Lumia 920 you now
have bragging rights because you've got
the flagship Windows Phone on your
carrier let's go ahead unbox this guy
alright so here is the box for the Lumia
928 looking all good in red and on the
cover the box we have a box inside the
box we have a cat physics jokes alright
so let's go ahead and slide off the
Nokia sleeve boom it looks exactly the
same
got little Nokia embossed there and
Verizon at the top we shall pull off the
lid in a dramatic fashion with some
flair and here we have the Lumia 928 I
have not seen this guy yet in person so
I'm kind of excited to take it out
remove tab that is nice push it out to
side for a quick second we'll see what
else we're gonna have in the box run
through the specs and do all the rest of
our unboxing goodness that we love to do
so we've got a start here so that's
where I'll begin product safety and
warranty information we've got a pretty
standard looking wall warts we've got a
micro USB cable those of you hoping for
some awesome headphones or any other
accessories you are going to be sorely
disappointed it makes packaging this guy
up though
very easy alright so here is the Lumia
928 and I will peel off the screen
protector oh that's where the same card
live sneaky so that's where the SIM
cards that wasn't this great protector
appears the screen is unprotected at the
back however is protected so I'll peel
that off telling you guys hates when
there are stickers on there so I'll try
and power this guy on and we can run
through all of the specs all right it's
gonna boot up say hello welcome to
Windows Phone all right so this is very
similar spec wise to the Lumia 920
although noticeably thinner and I think
a little bit lighter as well still the
dimensions it is 5.2 4 inches by 2.7 1
inches by a now thinner point four four
inches and weighs five point seven
ounces it says same resolution as an
i-20 it's a four point five inch screen
with a twelve eighty by seven six
screaming although now it is amoled
whereas on the 9:20 it was an IPS green
something should look just a little bit
better 2000 million power battery is
sealed in there so don't hope it getting
at that sucker same processor as well
it's a Snapdragon s4 plus 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core gig of ram 32 gigs of internal
storage live on this film now the big
story though the Lumia phones is on the
back Carl Zeiss and PureView branded
lens to 8.7 megapixel camera we now have
the xenon flash as opposed to the LED
flash that we had on the 920 it's got a
1.3 megapixel sensor living up there on
the front that could shoot 720p record
we have full support for Verizon's
LTE you can see right up there it's got
bluetooth of course 3.0 and NFC Gorilla
Glass 2 and also support for wireless
charging using the chief standard here
so a little bit more about this camera
in case you forgot it's got the same f
2.0 aperture that we've got on the 920
in the same 26 millimeter focal length
that we have on the 920 big difference
here though between the two the flash
and these screen technologies on both
phones but overall very similar one
feels are really nice to the hand i keep
forgetting how much I liked Windows
Phone to actually go back and try
another Windows Phone so we use this guy
tested on Verizon's network well sees
anything different to show versus what
we saw on the night when tea and of
course we doing a full camera comparison
to see how this works we're really
impressed with the night 20s low-light
capabilities it should hopefully be even
more improved at the issue of a Xeon
flash so there are some other
differences here too the 920 and then I
28 so let me bring in let's bring in the
black 920 and you can see certainly
difference there in the thickness as
well as the material so the black wanted
sort of a matte feel to it
but the other color devices had that
same sort of polycarbonate plastic and
both felt really solid in the hands so
first we've got improved speaker here as
well on the 920 versus the 928 rather
versus 920 speaker grille used to live
on the bottom of the night xx is now on
the back of the 928 obviously a little
bit of a redesign here where the camera
is located I've got a microphone now on
back of the 928 as well look at the top
of the phones you can see the SIM card
slot is in the same spot but it's a
little bit different now and just that
little button you got to push in you can
actually go and looks like with your
nail and actually pull it out headphone
jack has been moved to the side charging
port has also been moved to the top
we've got some noise cancelling mic the
rest of the buttons they'll remain pre
similar as opposed to chrome accents
they are now plastic and nothing on the
left hand side so I'll walk through the
device just real quickly here so we've
got the four required by Microsoft
Windows Phone buttons this is running
Windows Phone 8 will be available on May
16th for about a hundred bucks over time
you watch this video be sure to check
the carrier because prices always vary
so you've got your back button there and
also you're sort of multitasking but
just to sums applications you can launch
to anything else you are in i've got
your home button and you've got your
Bing search button which will do your
searching for you go ahead and allow and
there you go on the right-hand side as I
talked about earlier you've got volume
up and down there there's your power and
lock button I'd hard time getting used
to that located below the volume but
certainly you do the more you use the
phone and I'm really happy to see now
we've got a dedicated camera button
which Microsoft mandates on all their
phones the top as I just mentioned
you've got the micro USB port 3.5
millimeter headset jack and noise
cancelling mic and on the bottom we've
got nothing but some FCC business so
this has been a first look and unboxing
at the Lumia 928 for Verizon Wireless
anything you guys want to see in
particular I'll be sure to let us know
anything notable we will share with you
know of course we will test it put it
through its paces I'll let you know what
we think is video a thumbs up we most
definitely appreciate it I am John Rhett
enger' and I'll see you guys in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
