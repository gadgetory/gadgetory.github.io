sky it's the Holy Grail a
point-and-shoot cameras
stay tuned from my full review
every once in a blue moon a digital
camera saunters across my desk that
makes me change the way i view digital
cameras in general the canon powershot
s100 is one of those cameras by far this
is the best advanced point-and-shoot
digital camera i have ever tested in my
years and years of playing with digital
cameras compared to last year's s95 the
s100 is festooned with upgrades first of
all we'll start with the eos inspired 12
megapixel one over one point seven inch
CMOS sensor yes this sensor actually has
advanced technologies that you could
find in canons EOS DSLR lineup the
sensor is also coupled with canons new
digit 5 processing which makes the
camera faster it can record up to 8
frames per second in burst mode at full
resolution and this camera is better at
noise management we've also got an
increase to 1080p video on this camera
up from 720p last year at 24 frames per
second and 720p video has been upgraded
to 30 frames per second on this camera
Canon also radically designed the lens
we have a 5x optical zoom and 24
millimeter wide angle capability and
that's because Canon added more elements
to the lens and made it a coin-sized
configuration it's some fantastic
engineering and the lens the sensor and
the processor were all developed
in-house so this camera is just built
from the ground up Canon goodness I
forgot to mention the fact that Canon
put GPS on this camera so it can now do
GPS logging and it has a Maps utility
using Google lastly on the design front
you'll notice that this camera is bathed
in a sexy matte black finish and it's
got a grip on the back and a front grip
as well so it was easier to shoot with
so now it's the moment you've all been
waiting for image quality I am not lying
when I tell you this I reviewed several
cameras in my time this is the best
image quality you can ask for on a
point-and-shoot camera Shazaam
I could shoot at high ISO levels 1600
even 3200 and still produce impressive
images the ISO has also been expanded to
6400 natively at full resolution this
camera also retains the F 2.0 lens so
it's nice and bright and it helps it in
low-light the 1080p HD videos were also
fantastic it was the best video quality
I've seen from an advanced
point-and-shoot as well I could shoot
raw and JPEG and I found that raw held
just a slight edge over the JPEG the
JPEG quality was actually that good so
thanks to that iOS DNA and the new digit
5 processor canons retooled lens this
camera is the best
I just I'm having a moment I'm getting
for klimt I also love the design of the
s100 Canon carried over the lens ring
and this is a fantastic tool this is
fully customizable it can control white
balance it can control ISO it can
control aspect ratios you name it
there's also a new ring function button
so like a shortcut button and we also
have the control dial on the back for
manual controls we have a shutter speed
that can dip down to 15 seconds we also
have a built-in neutral density filter
that's for lowering the light so we can
use a longer shutter speed in brighter
situations now it's interesting to note
that anything past 1 second with this
shutter the camera will default to an
ISO 80 and Canon did that deliberately
to reduce noise though this camera is
such a great high ISO performer I found
that I could use a little extra exposure
when I was maxed out at 15 seconds white
balance was fantastic we had a four pane
color grid selector we also had a quick
function warm temp temp slider and
manual focus was great because we have a
3-inch
460 1000 that allowed us to attain sharp
detail edges lines and contrasts
courtesy of the manual focus
magnification box there's an electronic
pop-up flash that seamlessly pops up
when the flash is engaged and it has
advanced controls like flash exposure
compensation shutter sync with first and
second curtain of course we have
creative filters like HDR
accent and toy camera most of them could
be used in video as well the s100 has a
fantastic playback system we can view
RGB histograms we could see GPS
coordinates we get full exif data the
menus are fast and intuitive thanks to
the Speedy Gonzales and Roadrunner
firmware my two minor complaints with
this camera battery life was one it's
got a thin small pack and I shot side by
side with the Powershot SX 4 ths which
outlasted it twofold
the other thing is the shutter button is
kind of small and you have to reach over
the mode dial takes a little acclamation
but that's not a big problem so just get
an extra battery pack and Bob's your
uncle there's no doubt about the fact
that the canon powershot s 100 is the
best advanced point-and-shoot on the
market and I'm talking about it over the
g12 over last year's s 95 over
panasonic's over Sony's I really have
not come across the camera that takes
such fantastic images and videos and
packs in so many manual controls in this
sexy matte black frame for the full
canon powershot s 100 of you go to
TechnoBuffalo comm I've got tons of
image samples most of them converted
from raw so you can see the highest
quality available I also have 1080p
samples and further ISO analysis so you
can see then ISO chart but this is just
I sleep with this at night I love it so
much this has been Mike Pearlman for
TechnoBuffalo this is the omnipotent
Canon Powershot s 100 the best
point-and-shoot advanced point-and-shoot
I have ever encountered
I'm gonna go skip away with glee and
capture some more pictures I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
