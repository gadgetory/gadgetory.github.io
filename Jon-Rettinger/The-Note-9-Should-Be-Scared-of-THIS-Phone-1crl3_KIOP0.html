kitchen sink yeah that applies here it's
very rare to see a new phone release
that checks every box for some reason
manufacturers love to leave out features
that it's somewhat sizable audience
actually wants this year Huawei didn't
do that
I'm a kit solace we're talking about
flow and this is the review of the main
pro okay before we get started I have to
say that while we did invite us out for
the launch of this phone and to test it
out but this is not a sponsored video
and in the 10 days that I've used the
phone I found things that I don't like
and don't worry I'm not going to try to
hide that phones these days tend to
follow a pattern when it comes to build
but the may 20 does a few things
differently there's a metal frame and a
glass back like you might be used to but
this has what while we cause the hyper
optical pattern which is this it's
design that for one gives you a little
bit more grip and also drastically helps
with fingerprints the best way I can
describe this is it's like those
hologram lenticular images from the 90s
where you see one image you turn it
there's another image there and it has
that pattern it's almost exactly like
that I've never seen this on any other
phone I like it a lot especially in this
emerald green color on the back you also
see another unique design cue the camera
I'll cover this camera extensively in a
second but I like the approach while we
took with this arrangement symmetry is
something while we've focused on during
the launch and it shows here that 6.3
inch screen is also solid
it's a 1440 by 3120 OLED panel has
vibrant colors it's sharp and big there
is a bit of a yellow hue off axis but
that's about it it's a great screen and
also it doesn't feel very big in the
hand because of the 19 point 5 by 9
aspect ratio there is more to the screen
though but it's not the actual panel but
what's above and beneath it there's a
notch
yes notches are nothing new but there is
a good reason for it here 3d face
scanning this isn't like what some
manufacturers implement that just kind
of takes a picture of your face and
reads it this is very similar to what
face ID on the iPhone does there's a dot
projector an IR camera and blaster
camera it's real face unlock that
for convenience while still actually
being secured it works really well and
in my testing I could not trick it
it's my default unlock mode on this
phone there is another trick here though
and in screen fingerprint reader so you
get the fingerprint scanner but you
don't have to put it somewhere else on
the phone it works it's decently fast
it's definitely more finicky than a
traditional fingerprint scanner you
sometimes have to try a few times and
it's definitely not as fast but the
option is there it's still fun to use
every single time and that's great to
see the rest of the hardware is just a
slew of top-of-the-line specs here in
988 core processor which isn't the
Snapdragon 845 for once in a phone this
year but I found it to perform very well
never really experienced lag or had to
wait for animations to happen and I
never had any issues running any app I
threw at it
it also has six or eight gigabyte
options for RAM 128 or 256 gigabyte
options for storage dual sim 4.5 gigabit
per second LTE USBC it has expandable
storage through a new nano SD card which
while we created which is interesting
because it's not the standard microSD
that we're used to although while we did
say they are working to make this a
little bit more popular so hopefully we
see in the other phones but overall this
is a powerhouse empowering all that is a
4200 milliamp hour battery which is not
only huge but I have found to be
excellent I can easily get through a day
and a half with normal to heavy use so
watching a few videos looking at email
surfing Twitter and Instagram better
which is overall great that leads to one
of my favorite favorite features of the
phone charging so there are three
different charging methods here first is
the 40 watt super charger included in
the box
yes 40 watts that's almost what you use
to charge a laptop now this means that
you can charge up to 70% in 30 minutes
and for a real-world test when I took
the phone out of the box for the first
time it was at 80% I plugged it in and
watched a single kind of long but not
too long YouTube video and the phone was
fully charged this is a great feature
although there is something to be said
about how long this battery is going to
last getting charged that fast but I'll
take the trade-off you also get fast
tene watt wireless charging this is
about the fastest that you can get right
now but more interestingly you can
reverse wireless charge so basically
your phone turns into a battery bank
it's a very slow charge granted but
charging nonetheless and if you're
someone like me who almost always
carries two phones having this feature
is very nice okay before we get to
camera I want to talk software out of
the box it's running Android Pi which is
great to see but it's a heavily skinned
version called emu i9 I got to be honest
I don't like this it's packed with
features like a one-handed UI digital
balance for time management a magazine
screen lock that changes what appears on
your lock screen and it's a little more
organized than emui 8 but it still feels
too messy and there are just too many
options that mostly get in the way or
get lost like I said up front you are
getting everything but the kitchen sink
here so if you want it's in a phone
you'll probably find it here but it
feels heavy and still unorganized but
luckily even though it is a heavy
skinned performance is great apps open
fast navigation is smooth and fluid and
this goes across the board that Kiran
980 is doing a great job running apps
okay let's talk camera Huawei has pushed
itself to the forefront of mobile
photography and it didn't stop with the
May 20 Pro this is probably the most
full-featured camera system on a phone
right now
when while we invited us out for the
launch we were able to take the phone
around London and try it in the real
world and for these environments it's
pretty great there is a 40 megapixel
main shooter in an 8 megapixel telephoto
camera nothing really new here we've
seen this on the p20 pro before but
instead of a monochrome camera there is
now a 20 megapixel ultra wide camera so
in one phone you have telephoto wide and
ultra wide not too many phones can say
that so how does it perform well in
short the camera is capable of taking
some great photos ones that are sharp
saturated and overall solid it has a
great HDR mode that usually gives you
detail in the shadows while not blowing
out the highlights to my eyes it's not
quite as good as what you get with the
pixel or iPhone 10s but it's much better
not having it at all the processing in
the images also loves that sharpness
slider this really comes down to
personal preference but to my eye I
could use less artificial sharpness and
a tad less saturation but you get an
awesome focal range which you can't
really get in any other phone right now
and the resolution of the main camera
really comes in handy night mode is also
a useful feature letting you get a lot
more detail in very dark situations
so overall the camera is great but I
think there are a few key points that
would make this the absolute best camera
out there luckily that is all mainly
software related so hopefully we see an
update to that the mid-20 pro is the
most well rounded device I have seen to
date is it perfect no there is of course
room to improve the camera is solid but
sometimes the processing can be a bit
much emu i-9 is still a bit heavy and
not as polished as it could be the price
is a bit high and it's not available in
the US which for those of us who live
here is a bummer
the starting price of a thousand euros
is also higher than many other phones on
the market but past that it's hard to
find a phone that packs the same
features that are found here if you're
looking for a phone that packs as much
as possible into a great-looking package
I don't think you can go wrong here
while we kind of hit it out of the park
this time but I want to know what you
have to say let us know in the comments
what do you think of the huawei mate 20
Pro is this a phone you would buy
especially if you're here in the u.s. is
this something that you would import or
use I'm interested to hear that but if
you enjoyed this video and want to see
more like it be sure to hit that
subscribe button and hit that thumbs up
I want to get all so much for watching
I'm Atkins also TechnoBuffalo and see
you next time
