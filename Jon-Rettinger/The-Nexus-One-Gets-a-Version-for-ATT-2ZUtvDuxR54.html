technobuffalo here if you are an Android
fan or a phandroid ever you want to call
it merch has been a very good month you
many handsets have received firmware
updates new hansen's have been released
and Google out of nowhere started
selling an 18 key 3d capable nexus one
which is currently the most powerful
Android handset on the market running to
Qualcomm 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor there are a few from HTC that
are coming out soon and have a bit
faster clock speed the nexus one is
still the current king of the hill this
is actually pretty interesting it's
being sold unlocked on google.com /
phone pick it up for 529 dollars the
same price as a previously only existing
nexus one for tmobile which is what I
have right here now this isn't
officially in 18d handset so you're not
going to get a carrier subsidy you not
going to sign it to your contract and
get the phone for a discounted price
well it will work perfectly on a tMT's
network you don't assign a new contract
but you do have to pay the certain
premium you don't get again the contract
subsidy this is pretty interesting this
is really one of the first times we've
seen in the u.s. Google's start selling
handsets on multiple carriers we all
know the nexus one is coming and coming
soon to verizon and what we assume will
be capable on sprint's network so now
the nexus one is capable of running on
every carrier in the united states which
is pretty exciting even some of the more
regional carriers that are gsm-r even
some of the older CDMA networks the
handset will work which is actually
really cool a big fan of consumer choice
of Consumer Freedom if you don't want to
sign two years away and stuck with the
same handset for a finite period of time
you have a bit of extra cash laying
around you can go pick up a nexus one
and people balk at the high asking price
it certainly five hundred and thirty
dollars a bit expensive but at least
what I used to do is I want the new
handset I would buy it off contract use
it for however long I wanted and sell it
a five hundred thirty dollar handset
right now about
sponsor a year from now will be about a
300 400 all handset so you're only
paying two hundred dollars probably
about what you would have paid for the
subsidized phone anyway definitely
something to keep in mind if you're sort
of looking at what phone to get you want
to maybe see what new iPhone comes out
or you want to see what's coming out on
your carrier it's a nice way to sort of
straddle that line if you need a phone
for a few months you pay the upfront
cost and you sell it a few months later
for pretty close to what you paid for
I'm excited about the nexus one AT&amp;amp;T i
think i will be picking one up and
trying out is my primary phone I've been
a big fan of the current nexus one on
t-mobile and using it on my carrier of
choice will be a much welcomed addition
so what you guys think about the nexus
one certainly hasn't been selling like
gangbusters supposedly only selling
about 150,000 units compared to really
the millions that have been sold droid
in the iphone but maybe it's google's
model they're selling at a relatively
high price unlock them subsidized so are
you getting picking up at AT&amp;amp;T nexus one
you're going to wait for the verizon
version you pick up to mobile version
what are you waiting for word you're not
like android you love android i want to
hear from you so leave comments in the
what have you and i will see you guys in
the next video jon rettinger have a nice
day afternoon evening wherever you are
