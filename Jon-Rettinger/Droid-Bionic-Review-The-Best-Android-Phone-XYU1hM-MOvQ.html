from TechnoBuffalo here with a full
review for you of the first dual core
LTE device on the market this is the
Droid Bionic for Verizon Wireless we
first saw this guy debuted at CES in
early 2011 finally have its release I've
had it in my hot little data loving
hands for the better part of three and a
half weeks so I spent a lot of time with
it let's go ahead dig in and see if it's
been worth the wait alright so before I
jump into all kinds of other goodness
about the phone let's talk about call
quality it's not gonna make good phone
calls for you there's not much of a
point behind having this as with most
Verizon devices I've tested call quality
was outstanding this handled the LTE to
3G transition better than any of the
other 4G LTE devices I've tested
including the charge and the Thunderbolt
so no problems at all when it comes to
voice quality Motorola has really done a
nice job with this phone and by xx call
test I had zero drop calls including
areas where I generally get dropped
called fourth Verizon Wireless so what
maintain a pretty strong 4G signal of
about two bars most places that I went I
did travel out of the 4G area to see how
it worked
I use this phone as my daily driver for
three odd weeks on it really worked well
and I was very happy with the phone's
performance so no worries there
speakerphone is pretty average and loud
enough if your lion speaker phone in
your car though I are definitely going
to want to invest in a Bluetooth headset
or a Bluetooth speaker all right so
enough of that let's go ahead and start
with the hardware there's a lot of stuff
to talk about the hardware pack into
this guy so let's go ahead and get
started with the design and it will run
through all the specs guests are that
familiar shape we've been seeing with a
lot of Motorola's phones the Droid X and
the Droid X 2 so this teardrop fat in
the top skinny down below or reversed
type setup so on the thickest point it's
thirteen point three millimeters on the
thinnest it's eleven point three
millimeters the screen itself is very
similar to the screen that we saw on the
Droid X 2 q HD 4.3 inches that's going
to be a resolution of
540 by 960 and of course that's always
measured diagonal capacitive touchscreen
all the stuff you would expect 4G LTE
speeds a a little bit over a Giga Ram
actually on the back we've got living on
the hump we have 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash that can shoot 1080p video I
will talk about the video quality in
just a moment as well it's got a VGA a
front-facing camera and that dual-core
processor the Texas Instruments built
one with one gigahertz on each core
interestingly Motorola went away from
the Tegra 2 they've used in previous
dual-core devices for a Texas
Instruments processor in this one
alright so let's go ahead and see what
else we're gonna have around the phone
on the left-hand side sphere charging
ports gonna live HDMI out not gonna go
over that it's HDMI out it's a mini HDMI
on top of the device on the left hand
side is where your power and lock button
is going to be I prefer it on the right
but that's just a taste thing 3.5
millimeter jack on the right volume
rocker up and down very well pronounced
easy to use speaker on the top you've
got some indicators here as well for
proximity sensors
there's the VGA camera on the front and
the back is sort of dubbed in the soft
touch finish finish it's got a pretty
good feel in the hand actually
underneath this cover is a monumentally
giant 1700 milliamp hour battery that's
a 10% increase over the charge and a 15%
increase over the funderbolt
one of my big knocks on LTE phones and
battery life has been atrocious
I'm very heavy on my phones when it
comes a male got two accounts that's
searching for messages almost all the
time even when I have pushed services on
here maybe about two hours of phone
calls some YouTube viewing on here and a
lot of web browsing and I was able to
get through a full day of battery life
just barely but I was able to get
through a full day so chances are if
you're less of a power user than me
you're not gonna have any trouble
getting through a full day with the
Droid Bionic so hats off to Motorola for
that one alright so let's go and talk
about performance that was really the
big thing and I wanted to know about
this phone is how is it
sucker going to perform well my quadrant
score was two thousand one hundred and
forty and that's what the stock rom here
so it's a pretty decent performance
overall I think certainly if you decide
you want to get in there and tinker you
could probably eat gout some better
scores but 21:40 was very very nice and
certainly quadrants not the only
benchmarking test you can do but is
constant in all my android tests I
always use quadrants so you can check
out other scores there as well this
phone is blazing fast just very very
very quick I'm not connected to any sort
of Wi-Fi here but it's quick from app
loads its quick for web browsing is
quick for everything pinch-to-zoom no
lag at all even when I'm doing sites
that a flash on I don't notice any
service slow down this thing is
extremely capable and really able to
bring in just some tremendous speeds in
performance even with applications open
it's got plenty of RAM you can use 16
gigs of built-in storage expandable
microSD about half that's gonna be
available for your applications the
other half is you know system stuff that
gets taken up you can see how quick a
simple page load was here just very very
very fast let's go and check out some of
the applications and see how the speed
is on here again even with a lot of apps
open I really had no issue at all
opening things open some stuff I've
never opened before about NSL mobile
something that wasn't running in the
background launched pretty quick will
agree and now we are into NFL mobile I
not once had to manage my memory usage
on this phone at all and that was during
three weeks of testing I didn't have to
closed any applications this thing just
worked smoothly it was nice to not have
to worry about that for a change so if
you forget to close applications
oftentimes some of the bugs that happen
with Android phones in general are due
to quitting applications so things you
might be using by third parties that
close application and sometimes that
close things that are important to the
phone that can cause glitches which are
really no fault of the operating system
or the hardware that actually user based
so no need to worry about that here at
all go ahead and run back and show you
some more speeds here so talking about
some download speeds I'll go ahead and
show you what my speedtest.net speeds
are if I can find it here very fast go
ahead and show you
results I was pulling down about you can
see here if the two most recent ones 4.2
down and 5.5 7 up was the most recent
test generally my speeds were about
three down and about three up so really
quick here most impressive I think is
the up speeds if you need to use your
phone or using mobile hotspot
capabilities to say upload a video there
you be able to do that five megabits per
second up is faster than most average
people's home connections yours might be
crazy faster but for most people it's
not going to be the case so this thing
really is an absolute speed demon all
right let's talk a bit about the
software here you're looking at a
skinned version of gingerbread
it's got motoblur on it kind of but
you're not calling it motoblur anymore
and because you're not calling it
motoblur anymore it's actually a usable
version of motoblur so yay for that
here's some tweaks let's go ahead look
at applications you can see you're right
down below hopefully it's a horizontal
scrolling and it moves as you go a
little bit of a 3d esque effect this is
not a 3d screen just sort of emulates 3d
on here you can see what that kind of
looks like as you go through a lot of
built-in applications here so you'll
need some verizon add-ons VZ Navigator V
CAST videos all that V stuff but some of
the nice things you're gonna get things
like quick office can go ahead and
create and edit all of your word stuff
got to go ahead and register but that's
really a nice addition one of the things
I also like to is this most call to
widget if you go ahead and pull it down
you get a whole bunch of stuff you can
add their different contacts you want to
call it which is a really nice feature
so that I didn't have to add a whole
screen icons people that I call I could
just add this and be able to pull it
down and save a lot of screen real
estate oh this might be a personal thing
but I found myself going like this quite
a bit similar to what you do with HTC
Sense or a touch wiz lets you do that to
go ahead and hit home you can jump
around and see the home screen and see
what stuff look like and go to the one
you want but I can't find myself want to
do that didn't work though so if you're
familiar with HTC devices you don't want
to forget you spend a little bit I wish
that the pull down here also had
notifications across the top and things
that will let me change turn
by off turn four G off and those kind of
toggle switches but alas it does not one
of the nice things about Andrew - if you
don't like the way this looks you can
download a brand new launcher and you
know be off to go you know launch your
pros one of those ones that are really
good and very easy to use let's take
about some of the widgets that's gonna
be available on here as well so I'll go
ahead and open this up take a look at
widgets and some are standard Android
some are motorola going let you see what
it is citrix for some remote office
stuff go through and scroll through all
them and see what they are so there are
little widgets like Wi-Fi toggle that
you can add but I like I got used to
having them up here so in there tweak
stuff you can do to give you those
options as well so let's run through the
hardware again just very quickly it's
pretty nice
thin device able to fit in my pocket
without any sort of worry the screen
here was very decent if I go and take a
look at some colors some wallpapers for
example you can see if the screen looks
like all those stumps always gets lost
in translation a little bit when you are
wallpapers there we go go to wallpapers
when you're filming it I had a little
bit of trouble in direct sunlight
images were tough to see but that's to
be expected text was very crisp images
came across very clear and bright blacks
from very black colors were very
colorful text I'll go ahead and jump
back to the website here we'll load an
article iPhone 5 live blog for example
and this is over just a 4G connection
see there's a ton of stuff floating
there's Flash content pulling in here no
speed decrease at all text was very good
really crisp Biden getting sort of
pixelation on this device so if you're
looking for one of the fastest possibly
one of the most spectro mount there I'd
say this and the galaxy s2 would be the
ones that are definitely top of the list
this is a great phone and this is when
the Android phones that can
wholeheartedly recommend it doesn't make
any compromises you don't sacrifice
battery life to get the faster data
speeds you're on sacrificing performance
to get the size this phone really has
everything and is well worth a dollar
the dollars that it costs and suddenly
sits at least right now at the very top
of Verizon's lineup I give this throne a
very very solid to thumbs up
recommendation five out of five this is
definitely one of the best phones on the
market when I could certainly use as my
daily driver
I mentioned towards the earlier part of
the video to talk about the cameras
camera quality was about average about
you'd expect from a camera phone nothing
to write home about certainly not gonna
become I always make this bad joke in so
atoms with your camera phone but it does
work decently on it will shoot HD video
so if you're out in the valley your
friends are doing something funny this
will work but definitely don't leave
your standard point-and-shoot camera at
home hope you guys enjoyed this full
