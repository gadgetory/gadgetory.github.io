you by check treads Lotus John Q here
from TechnoBuffalo and how you find
folks doing look good swell welcome to
what's the absent in the last episode a
youtuber by the name of not yet named 89
very clever asked me if I can check out
four score for the iPad beautiful
exactly the question that I was looking
for so not yet named and all you find
folks out there this is my review for
four score okay I had no idea what four
score was so I had to look it up when
you mention it turns out it's a score
reading application scores in music
score not sports score
I thought of sports score no it's a
music man BAM
I haven't played music in a long time I
was really into guitar back in the day
but I was on the tablature system
instead of the standard notation system
aka I was on the non so theoretical
self-taught I prefer seeing numbers
versus dots with flags sticking out of
them system but I didn't understand
music theory so yeah four scores
basically you're all in one score
library and reader with built-in tools
like a metronome think of it like a
Kindle but for music when you first open
the application you're prompted by four
score to ask if you want to download
their sample library I'd recommend doing
this as playing around with these sample
scores can help you get used to the
application and you get great pieces by
composers like Beethoven Mozart Bach
like this das Walter Lyon Clavel ear 1-5
Prelude wow there's like 22 of these
guys before we get to the features of
this application let's just see how well
it works let's pretend I'm jamming away
and I rapidly need to change the page a
single swipe or even a gentle tap would
do it I bet this beats having to
scramble through bushels of paper that
alone k plus the fact that you can store
a bunch of scores on your iPad makes
this app worth it already need to jump
around no problem the slider on the
bottom will help you quickly navigate to
whatever page you want look at them
notes with their stems cleft sharps and
flats and time signatures and whatnots
amazing and vividly clear you can also
add text notes highlights and doodles
not to mention rearrange and crop your
scores and much much more let's take a
look at the metronome this thing is
pretty neat you can set it for whatever
speed you need it to be slow it down to
practice the trickier pieces or speed it
up and play the song double-time because
you're a baller the volume isn't bad but
it won't be as loud as your traditional
metronome you can also choose a visual
metronome option and the screen will
flash or if you're fancy you can enable
both auto turn is pretty nifty as it'll
automatically turn the page for you
after set of bars or beats the only
thing is that you have to manually set
the bars or beats in your score sheets
in advanced if you want it to work
properly some counting might be involved
but totally worth it here comes the best
part
loading your own scores for score opens
PDFs and gives you several options it
has a built-in browser which is used to
download the initial fourscore library
unfortunately it doesn't work too well
as you can't or at least I couldn't for
the life of me get the keyboard to pop
up outside of the nav bar which makes
searching and navigation and no go you
can also use Dropbox which is handy and
open and save PDFs from emails which is
what I do or this special darkroom
feature that allows you to use images
from your gallery or take a picture from
your camera great in situations where
you need to take a quick snapshot of
real life sheet music or if you just
want to look at cute pictures of pandas
speaking of pandas I'm gonna take some
time to thank our friends at Jackthreads
only suckers pay full price if you love
alternative apparel brands a kid you're
about Hurley and Stussy and hate wasting
all of your cash listen up okay there's
a new invite only shopping club just for
guys called Jackthreads serving up
Street skate and surf wear brands at
prices that will melt your brain there's
a waitlist but if you head on down to
jack threads.com slash techno that's
jack threads.com slash Tec hno you'll
get instant access to all of the killer
hook-ups go right now dude it's just in
background music and whoo back to
fourscore because this application opens
PDFs if you're a tab person like myself
you will be able to open your tabs with
fourscore I exported this guy from a
computer app called Guitar Pro highly
recommended I've been using it for years
by the way I haven't actually played
guitar in years so I was just kind of
pretending here overall for what it does
for score is pretty amazing and totally
worth the 5 bucks which is why I give it
a four point five out of five the only
thing I think it needs to work on would
be the built in browser I couldn't
get the keyboard to pop up which would
help to search and download scores well
not yet named I hope this helps and if
you want to pick up an iPad just for
fourscore maybe check out Craigslist or
Ebay or something you know pick it pick
it up cheap and for everyone else out
there if you have any application that
you would like me to check out let me
know by commenting thank you very much
for tuning in this was John Q from
TechnoBuffalo I think I did a double
bling just there I don't know why and
I'll see you guys next time
latest and by the way thank you very
much for all of the constructive
criticism from the last episode I myself
I'm not a really heavy Android user so I
don't really fit with all the things and
all that kind of stuff but I'm trying
alright so yeah constructive criticism
always welcome a lot better than saying
you suck in things of that nature about
75 times doesn't really help so yeah
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
