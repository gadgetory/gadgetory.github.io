technobuffalo here I want to give you a
speed test of the verizon mifi 2200
mobile broadband hotspot so if you
missed the unboxing what this does it
sucks in verizon's evdo rev a connection
and spits out Wi-Fi that up to five
people can connect to quite nice and
really handy it fits into a very small
package and also happens to be
relatively quick so let me give you a
speed comparison first we're going to
start with my normal Wi-Fi connection
that I use here in my office relatively
fast wireless n hooked up to an airport
extreme router I'll show you there and
hooked up to my network let's go ahead
and above the speed test we're going to
use speedtest net for this and if you're
seeing those little sort of waves come
out for my mouse it just due to my
screen capture program so we're going to
start the test and let's check out the
speed on a standard Wi-Fi connection and
where and we are done so my download
speed was eleven point five four
megabits per second my upload speed was
2.46 megabits per second not the fastest
in the world but definitely quick enough
and my upload is quite nice can see
right here what my download speed uh
would be for mp3 file that was five
megabytes looking at four seconds a
video clip I'm looking at just about 25
seconds head for full 800 megabyte movie
just about nine minutes so quick enough
and let's see how big work with the mifi
okay so I'm now connected with the Maya
file let me show you up here jr. mobile
hotspot that's what I called my mifi
connection and we're on the same
speedtest.net website let's go ahead and
start the test here and check out how
fast we are okay so it just finished up
and it pulls out my download speed of
point 9 3 megabits per second and my
uploaded point for 3 megabits per second
so certainly it's not nearly as fast as
my own Wi-Fi connection but it is
definitely fast enough I've got a lot of
bandwidth that i use obviously for a lot
of uploading here at home so if I was
just out on the road and i was using
this just to look at website to check
email this would be plenty fast and
actually it's even fast enough download
and upload to use even for some internet
gaming like via xbox live or one of
those you won't get lightning speeds but
it definitely will work so hope this
helped and answer some of your questions
about the speed of the verizon wireless
Wi-Fi let me load a couple websites here
and show you what the speed looks like
as well substandard website so you can
see speed let's say we want to learn CNN
com for example that's my homepage you
can see it came up very quickly you can
look at a pretty intensive site as well
such as espn.com I'll show you what that
looks like you can see that this also
loads very fast so if you're just
looking at standard website this is
going to be plenty quick for you let's
say you want to look at YouTube will
even watch a streaming youtube video
well sort of that it may take a little
bit of your 5 gigabyte cap it's
definitely possible so we'll go to my
youtube channel and we've got a video
here on the ps3 slim start applying
actually very quickly let's adjust in
the standard definition but it's
definitely watchable you really could
watch something quite easily using the
mifi the number is in the uploading the
downlow you know don't mean that much
real time experience I can tell you for
real time experience this is plenty
fast for doing almost everything I do a
little bit of buffering but if you go
ahead and play it back you can give it
maybe 10 or 15 seconds to buffer you're
going to have a very nice viewing
experience the mifi is quite fast
overall I've been very impressed with it
so hope you enjoyed for exclusive
content be sure to check me out on
twitter twitter.com slash job for lakers
any for learn more about TechnoBuffalo
give us a follow right here at
TechnoBuffalo anyway guys I will see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
