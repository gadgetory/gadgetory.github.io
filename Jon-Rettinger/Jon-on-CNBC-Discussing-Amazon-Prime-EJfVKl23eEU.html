major press conference on sep tember
sixth lots of speculation and what it
may be unveiling but no one is saying
for sure we will have more details for
you as the information becomes available
about that event but one thing is for
certain that amazon prime is becoming a
fast favorite among consumers who could
blame them seventy nine dollars a year
sounds like quite the deal for unlimited
videos however prime costs are stacking
at the company since 2005 shipping costs
are up and whopping twenty-five percent
for this company even streaming costs
are on the rise media's exporter bid
says for prime to become profitable
amazon has to raise prices technobuffalo
jon rettinger though couldn't disagree
more he says you can't make the same
mistake netflix did Porter really a
price hike is required here well they've
never made a penny of profit from prime
and it was begun seven years ago as an
inducement to e-commerce customers with
free shipping and lots of other bells
and whistles it's turned into a
full-fledged video and TV screening
project and a major threat to all of the
other guys who are in that space
starting with Netflix so John I mean we
all remember what happened with Netflix
if Amazon hikes rates these this be
could this be a deja vu moment that we
saw Netflix where the stock plummeted
company lost business and you had so
much backlash yeah absolutely could be
catastrophic and once you know all the
facts raising prices on prime makes very
little sense first of all prime is
growing by twenty percent per year and
once a new member joins prime their
average expenditures go from four
hundred dollars to nine hundred dollars
so they may be losing money on prime
itself but they're making five hundred
dollars per customer and they want this
is a numbers game here every 1 million
prime customers increases Netflix is
total revenue by 1.5% there'd be no
reason flem's isolate those users a
simple economic supply and demand as
they raise those prices demands going to
fall with water in the head porter there
are so many different ways that Jeff
Bezos who is as smart a retailer as
there is in this country can handle the
increase in prices he first of all it
can take the annual $79 and make it a
monthly fee it's 650 a month and it's
still a dollar and a half cheaper than
net flow
even if he had a 50 cent or a dollar per
person and gave them a chance to opt out
the way Netflix does they can also
eliminate the free shipping bonus that
the screaming customers get and that
would immediately take the loss factor
away from prime so I mean Bezos talked
about prime during the last quarters
results right Porter he said amazon
prime is now the best bargain in the
history of shopping that's not hyperbole
that what hasn't changed since we
launched Prime nice what he's using
prime that prime is is another one of
the new businesses that Jeff is starting
on Amazon platform he leads the market
in the UK and Europe with love which is
a pure streaming netflix competitor and
he's bashing bskyb and netflix in those
countries he saw he changes his stance
then that's gonna be a problem he just
said you know that he's got to that he
loves prime and it's a great bargain and
there's big points being missed here as
well there are many ways that he can
reconfigure it because he's now got he's
also bringing in very very major talent
he's got deals in Europe and the UK with
all of the major studios and he's
bringing current blockbusters in which
netflix doesn't have John what about
state taxes for online sales at some
point is this going to be common issue
for Amazon and that's an excellent point
amazon is going to have to start
charging state taxes in certain states
but what's going to let them do is
create a local distribution centers so
if quarters saying is correct Amazon's
gonna have to raise prices to increase
in sales tax and then raise prices again
on Prime the consumers will not tolerate
that and also he's making the assumption
that consumers are going to tolerate
perhaps a monthly price or paying for
prime folks are used to system they have
now and I think they're going to be
extremely unhappy all on netflix once
that results a Prime member spend a
hundred and thirty percent more than
regular customers I don't think Jeff
Bezos wants to anger that population
well and your thoughts on what they're
going to announce that that big press
conference they scheduled for
September's exporter I think he's going
to announce blockbuster new content and
and maybe a
a division of prime from the free
shipping or the annual fee all right
we'll leave it there German thank you
very much we watching this we appreciate
your time tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
