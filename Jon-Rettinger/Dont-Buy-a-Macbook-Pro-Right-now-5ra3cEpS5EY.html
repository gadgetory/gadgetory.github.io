technobuffalo here with the holidays in
full swing and rapidly approaching I'm
starting to get a flurry of emails
asking about laptop so which ones people
are looking to buy and if I have any
advice that I can offer well the one
piece of advice that I can't offer if
you're looking to get an apple is don't
buy a macbook pro the macbook line and
the imac line were just updated a few
months ago and it's looking at one of
those fantastic deals to be had out
there but the macbook pro line remains
untouched now the reason i'm saying to
hold off and wait if you can is because
mobile core i5 and mobile core i7 chips
are right around the corner and will be
released widely at CES because a
consumer electronic show held every year
in Las Vegas around the first the second
week of January and of course that is
just a few weeks away Apple didn't
update their macbook pros like I said a
month or so ago and I think that they're
waiting until these core i5 and core i7
chips were available what you certainly
are now so I don't think we're going to
see any sort of radical redesign think
it's going to be exactly like a computer
with a faster chip and the improvements
are massive at least according to some
reports that I've read and the
differences between the standard
core2duo chips and the core i5 and i7
desktop models there's been a
significant increase in performance now
not saying the computers that are out
there right now are bad if you just
picked up according to duo macbook pro
you're getting a fantastic computer and
I try to encourage any sort of
consumerism where you screw out and buy
another one but if you're looking to get
one and you can afford to wait I
definitely think that you should you're
going to get just a definite increase of
performance and you're going to have the
latest hardware these computers are
expected to last as years and years and
if you're looking to buy one you want at
least get the best that you can not
something that you pick up every few
months or every few years so the
recommendation I would be would be to
wait and it lets part of the holidays a
lot of you're probably asking for
macbook pros or maybe you're giving
macbook pros the gifts well you may want
to give an iou
or even look at possibly giving one of
the plastic unibody macbooks those who
just recently updated an offer a really
good deal at 999 almost spec for spec
they're nearly identical to the 13-inch
MacBook Pros the lower end with the
exception obviously of the aluminum
versus the plastic chassis but that is
still a great deal if you're looking to
give a Mac but again I definitely
recommend you hold off on buying a
macbook pro so are these warnings enough
to hold you off from buy a macbook pro
review of no interest in a core i5 or
core i7 mobile chip you just want it now
you know let me know I'm curious to hear
what you guys have to say leave comments
down below or video responses I'll go
ahead and make sure those get posted
anyway i'm jon rettinger happy holidays
and i'll see you in the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
