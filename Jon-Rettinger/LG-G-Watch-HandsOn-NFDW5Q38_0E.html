technobuffalo here we're at Google i/o
2014 taking a look at LG's latest this
is the Android wear power to corporate
lee named g-watch let's go ahead take a
quick first look this guy's available
for pre-order right now on the google
play store and it's a third Android wear
device that we've seen the other thing
by motorola and samsung so here are the
specs on a device it's got a 1.6 7-inch
screen it's an IPS display the 280 x 2
media resolution it's got four gigs of
ram inside a 400 million power battery
is going to get you through a whole day
without any sort of problem at all of
course bluetooth 4.0 and powering it is
a Snapdragon 400 processor the UI is
pretty standard Android wear that we've
seen before but it does look really nice
so here's the basic android wear
overview it's set to demo so i can't
sort of interact as much as I would like
I can show you the overview so you can
interact with it like you can with
Google now essentially on your wrist so
you can see a car that shows up when you
swipe it off it's going to swipe off on
your phone as well of course you can
view whether when you wake up in the
morning swipe over to get a full
forecast if they're going out you don't
want to be bothered and pull this down
it's going to mute at least in theory
there we go it's going to mute it for
you so you can have a private time you
pulled that again andale unruly for you
to give an example of saying okay Google
and that work we're in a really loud
room set reminders for example remind
you call mom you can say ok Google take
a note and I'll take a note for that no
it'll show up in your Notes app kind of
cool with what it can do of course it
also a major steps for you to make sure
it keeps you in shape could probably use
a few pounds it's going to help to do
that going to be available very soon
from the folks at LG in fact you keeping
them out here at i/o so we'll have one
turns give you guys hands on as soon as
we get a chance with it I'm in leave any
questions down below let us know what
you want to see until next time I'm John
