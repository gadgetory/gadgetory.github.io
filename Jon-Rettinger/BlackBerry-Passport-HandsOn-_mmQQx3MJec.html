TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you my first impressions of the
blackberry Passport
using it for the better part of a week
it's a really unique device on the first
in this form factor that I've ever seen
if there's a lot to talk about to go
ahead and get started
so a few things first this is not our
review we use devices for quite a bit
before we do our full reviews just a
first impressions after using this for a
week and I know you guys probably just
saw the unboxing today a few days ago
there was actually 7 days in between
that someone admitted I've been a little
tough on blackberry the past few years
but I think they came back really strong
this device I've been really excited to
try it there's a lot of innovative
features here a lot of things that work
with it well some that don't give you my
general first impressions let's start
with the size and the shape of it it's
weird it's weird to have a phone that's
this wide and the squat it just
something you're unused to because
you're unused to it doesn't mean that
it's bad
so first reading text is great you can
get a huge line of text because the
screen is markedly watered anything else
out there but it also gets a little bit
squashed because it's not as tall as
anything else out there it also means
that the square you'd only need to worry
about rotating it because it's the same
both ways either gonna love it or you're
going to not love it I really liked it
and I got used to it very very quickly
and if I myself to adapting everything I
did to the square spring so I think the
BlackBerry might actually onto something
in fact I'm surprised nobody else has
tried that's designed before they get a
few things interesting here so you've
got a keyboard BlackBerry's been known
for a keyboard I think they've done an
incredible job with this device so the
keys are wider because the device is
actually wider we can notice there's no
fourth row here which I found to be kind
of interesting the fourth row is
actually dynamic and shows up on top and
if you don't sort of just finding what
you need if you're typing an email I'm
gonna show you your period in the comma
and semicolons if you're putting in your
email address I'll show the at comm it's
dynamic and learns what you're doing
which I found to be surprisingly helpful
in fact maybe surprised that no one else
had done that before either a keyboard
also has a few new tricks in it you can
use it almost a trackpad if you're
scrolling through email or website you
can scroll up and down on the keyboard
and it'll scroll up and down and it
works incredibly well and
in response in the spacebar key is kind
of nestled in between the V and the V
which took longer to get used to than
anything else out there it's a small
spacebar can having it inside of the
actual keyboard was a little bit strange
a little bit weird and as I found with
most physical keyboard took me about
three-and-a-half to four days actually
it used to it before I really didn't
notice it I will say though while I
enjoy typing on a physical keyboard more
than soft keyboard I wasn't any faster
now with a physical keyboard but it was
a bit more accurate but of course
there's always spell correct and
autocorrect I was kinda think that
usually make typing a much more accurate
proposal so when the z10 first launched
with blackberry 10 I use it for quite a
bit and I really liked it doesn't that I
haven't tried blackberry 10 and they're
back with ten point three which I think
really should be 11 because there are
crazy new features in here the best one
for me is the Amazon Appstore any app
you can download on your Kindle Fire
device you can get right here and it
works just like any other Android app
you sign in with your Amazon ID and you
are good to go you also get BlackBerry's
own app store and of course you can side
own Android apps on yours you really you
get almost every app from three
relatively strong ecosystem so the app
thing that's saying flappy doesn't have
apps anymore is a totally moot point the
other non comeback weight didn't have
sort of a virtual assistant didn't have
a Syria and have a Google now or Cortana
they do have an assistant here this is
where one something I came up
disappointed with it worked I like you
could type what you wanted to say
instead of speaking to it but I spoke to
something like what's the weather it
took a really long time before were -
telling - well there was quicker just to
type in weather and go ahead and do my
search they also added a bunch of new
features on the home screen as well I
think can sort of tap the icon to see
you've got inside of those notifications
so if you have email Facebook or
LinkedIn you could tap that icon it'll
sort of open up on the side out of
shaving applications you have it's a
really elegant homescreen serve a better
looking what we've seen on active
notifications on Motorola's Moto X if
you like that really going to enjoy this
here blackberry also expect this thing
up to the nines got three gigs of ram
quad core processor hot swappable micro
SD a pretty baller 13 megapixel camera i
mean this thing is Specht up with
anything else out there I never noticed
a single lag things were buttery smooth
apps open quickly everything just worked
really well and as
I haven't a chance to test out the
camera as well as I like will test that
the full review battery life has been
awesome but time I plug in to end of the
day I've usually got it at 50% we're
going to run more battery tests before
we do the full review as well that
something sort of look to improve upon I
really like the curved metal design
around here I didn't like the place for
him to lock at home button though in the
upper right hand corner it's really hard
to reach the square design with this
there's a mute button in between the
volume up and down which I just would
have wished for than just the power and
lock button cell reception was great we
tested with AT&amp;amp;T in Southern California
I've charged pretty fast
I wish there was a removable battery but
there's not all you have as a top part
pops off to get your SIM card and your
micro sd but overall I think
BlackBerry's done an incredible job I
think the passports going to be the
device that gets to now way back into
corporate but also top in mind with
consumers you get those google apps that
you love you can access on the Amazon
App Store get the Android apps you can
side load on here you have BlackBerry's
own but get anything you guys want to
see in the full review let us know we'll
be sure to cover it just sort of a
general thoughts and first impressions
of using the device for a few days and
our guys until next time I'm Chad a
