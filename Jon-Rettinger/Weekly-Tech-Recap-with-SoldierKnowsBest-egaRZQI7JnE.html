soldierknowsbest here and this is your
latest news in tech all right it's going
to get to the main story of the week
action in main story the past two weeks
verizon just announced it's going to be
bringing the iphone to his network so
verizon and apple got together this past
tuesday and held a press conference and
announced on februari 10th you'll be the
pick up the iphone on verizon in
February third on your existing verizon
customers you actually be able to
pre-order on that date but the iPhone
itself is pretty much the saying that
de- some new little marks there on the
antenna on the side there they really
don't mean anything I guess it just kind
of be designed to attend a little bit
but also to that is going to be having
the mobile hotspot feature in this new
verizon iphone which means up to five
different devices would be to connect to
the portable Wi-Fi network that your
iphone greats with verizon's 3g network
which is pretty cool ricin had no word
anything again on a verizon LTE phone or
4g phone that will probably come into
the future will definitely keeping our
fingers crossed for that I in other news
as well Apple released iOS 4.3 beta tall
as developers out there and this beta
brings a lot of cool features a lot of
four and five finger multi-touch
gestures that especially work very well
on the iPad not help you with
multitasking as well and swiping left or
swipe through your open applications
that you have open but also have been
talked about Apple may be routing the
home button from these devices which
doesn't make sense to me I notice multi
finger gestures are pretty cool but I
don't want to get rid of that home
button please don't I also they give you
the option to change whether that switch
on the right hand side of the ipad would
either mute the volume or do orientation
lock you have that option now and also
there's been cold that's been found this
new beta that some shoals a new find my
friends feature was about to be kind of
like google latitude where you can find
your friends you can gps and trying to
hook up with them when i get seen you
directions to where they are and also
there's been in app airplay video
support and applications now meaning
like possibly a net fixed or hulu
application will be able to push those
video content to your HDTV and long as
you have like an apple TV and also the
Wi-Fi hotspot function that's coming in
a bra and I all looks like it's going to
be built into this 4.3 update so AT&amp;amp;T
users
in cross your fingers as well and all
the news is well when google google
updated is a google translate
application but i think it's just really
cool more than anything and you can
actually have a conversation with
somebody else who was in it speaks a
different language and the google
translate application actually translate
for both peoples is going to check it
out soon be hobbin spots on prom we have
black and brown can you give me a
discount if i take both conan see me
einen hobbit then it by the neiman
sponsored portent twenty percent so long
to do that for dear feeling junk alright
the last thing is a very cool
full-featured 88th minute film there's
so many made only using granda all of
four yes i love that game but somebody
spent two years actually making full
feature film that has everything drawn
my action is actually really cool to
watch ad to take a couple of sections to
watch it is pretty long but it's really
cool to check out so the links will be
down below all right here in the video
game you'll be able to go to it or just
google or youtube search grand theft
auto four trash master that's naming the
movie there and you'll be able to find
it but anyway thanks for watching godson
soldierknowsbest protecting a buffalo of

tech recap of the week and thanks for
