be thinking you want to get a gift for
your friend's brother your sister your
former roommate whoever it might be in
cases for their mobile devices are a
great way to go we hear technobuffalo
scoured the internet to find five cases
that maybe wouldn't the thought of but
he should offer something kind of cool
and the first one I'm just gonna throw
it out there's not a case but it's too
cool to not include so i guess i should
say five boat accessories I didn't say
they weren't creepy this is a finger and
it's not like a severed one from from
human being dick used as a stand like
let's say you want to film like beer old
phone you could just stick it on the
back and boom your phone's all propped
up nicely it is not however a smart
finger it's not gonna work with your
phones so I'm sorry there and also if
you got you know you got something that
you want to just get out you can do it
I'll get in a figure dude next I'm gonna
lend you in here you pop it probably an
iphone 5 and you've got just nice little
here you know people think that you have
a giant ear and it also will protect
your phone legitimately because there's
a ton of material on either side novelty
gift but also practical maybe keep your
ear one maybe help you be a better
listener to your girlfriend your wife
because you know you can work on that
banana five banana phone ring ring ring
ring ring ring ring banana phone hear me
correctly this is a banana phone might
be saying to yourself why would I want a
banana phone and to you I say your phone
is more potassium Lana photo is a great
way to do that and you just you just
talk on it even has integrated speaker
grill so you can hear your speaker phone
calls and it looks looks like a banana
hey come on it's a it's a banana phone
next oh yeah this one this one's my
favorite we all need a helping hand from
time to time in this phone case
here to lend you a helping hand
sometimes you want to make a phone call
and feel that soft caress a very real
fake looking rubber you can do that if
you want to mess with your friends and
go up to them I'm not looking just like
gently caress their face with this hand
case I'd wager though some factory
somewhere they had extra plastic cases
and extra fake hands are like I don't so
come together make some money which for
us we bought it and last but definitely
not least the most practical most lavish
of the phone options let's jump one seat
over from our friends at grey
international what we have here is there
a roar edition advent bumper case and
this case is made of titanium which
about two and a half times stronger then
stainless steel and it looks pretty
badass it's only gonna be 500 of these
guys made so that a question you're
gonna say is hey what is that UK it's
gonna cost me to you I say gonna cost
you seven bills and buy builds I mean
hundred hundred dollar bills seven
hundred bucks so we ran the gambit of
cases from a titanium seven hundred
dollar case to one that is going to
probably give you nightmares you look
like thing from The Addams Family as it
goes ahead and ride some check your
phone a lot of options some silly some
not but all are going to make unique
gifts for the holidays so to you dear
viewer I say pick one of these up have
some fun you know the typical cases are
so pass√© get some new get something fun
get something's gonna take up a lot of
room in your pants till next time I'm
