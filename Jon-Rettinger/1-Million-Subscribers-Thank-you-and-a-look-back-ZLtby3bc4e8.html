recent Mac switcher actually as of today
jinsuk we have here my brand-new 15.4
inch macbook pro hey guys just got back
from dinner its John here and I saw that
I had a request from one of my
subscribers right you guessed it the
apple iphone so i picked up a sony DSC
t200 hey guys john here um this isn't a
review or an unboxing or anything it's
more of a thank you to to you guys the
YouTube viewing community um it's really
hard to believe that since I think June
seventh when I signed up for a youtube
account you know I've got over a
thousand subscribers right now I can't
believe that in just about seven months
you know we picked over 2,000
subscribers here and you know went out
to dinner and I just came back and saw
that I past 5,000 subscribers I had some
thank yous from some subscribers on my
comment board not another thing I've
accomplished could be done without you
guys and I will never ever ever forget
that thank you I past twenty thousand
subscribers and that's a real big
milestone to me this number I always had
in my head I thought if I can ever get
to that point you a yesterday I hit
50,000 subscribers which to me is a huge
milestone I want to thank you guys for
helping us get to 500,000 subscribers 1
million subscribers is a staggering
amount of people I've said it through
the years and I feel like I can never
say it enough I am so grateful to have
this opportunity to really live my dream
not many people get that chance and I'm
very cognizant every day that I have a
really unique opportunity that you guys
have really given me to to live out
really is just a childhood fantasy i
play with technology for a living even a
bad day it's still a really good day in
in the grand scheme of things
and as I look back and reflect on what
we've done to get to a million where I'm
hoping we're going to go it's very
humbling and I've never lost sight never
will lose sight that it's a privilege to
have an audience of this size we don't
always do things the right way we've
made mistakes and we've stumbled now but
we have always tried to learn from them
and I just want to say thank you again I
didn't want to do a giveaway for million
subscribers we've done a ton of
giveaways you continue to attend a
giveaway for giving away three phones
right now it just felt a little weird to
give away celebrate a milestone we're
going to give aways anyway because we'd
like to do that I just wanted to say
thank you and again you guys let me live
my dream and beyond that you let me help
other people live their dreams the folks
at work for four technobuffalo live
their dream that's always been something
that I've wanted to do with your other
people the opportunity you guys had
given me and I'm so thankful and
grateful for that and the million
subscribers is a huge number i know a
lot of other people that have more sort
of joining the ranks with some very
elite and incredible youtubers in the
tech space guys like mkbhd unboxtherapy
austin evans linus tech tips and ton
more and i'm sure hopefully more going
to join those ranks it's an incredible
elite fraternity and I am just I feel
humbled to have that I still can't
believe that a million people hit that
subscribe button not even just to think
about a million people is is incredible
and from the bottom of my heart I want
to say thank you you guys literally and
figuratively put food on my table you
put diapers on my baby because you give
me these chances to live my dreams we're
going to continue to grow we're going to
continue to try new things we're going
to bring on some new faces you guys are
going to see coming up and i love the
direction we're heading and i love that
we're doing it on our own and marching
to serve our own drum technobuffalo is
very unique in the tech space you had a
huge video audience and also a huge
website and for an independent
publication that is something that not
many keep up and able to do we were in
the right place the right time we
started and
I i I'm serve I'm all set a loss for
words it doesn't happen to me very often
you guys watch my videos you know I can
just ramble but from the bottom of my
heart I just wanna say thank you thank
you for taking with us through the good
through the bad for for the comments
both good and bad for watching the
videos for rini articles on the site and
for keeping me in line and for keeping
the staff in line and just thank you I
can't think of a more eloquent way to
say it then thank you while a million is
a milestone we're not happy with that
number we're gonna try and push to 1.5 2
million and and beyond and just from the
bottom of my heart the motto my family's
heartened from everybody on behalf of
technol Buffalo just thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
