to you by carbonite what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of rumor
roundup I am your host John Ranger this
is quite obviously the show we take a
little Tech over from here
a little Tech rumor from there and we
smash them into one tech rumor show of
awesome so you don't have to keep track
on everything that's happened in the
week of this week iPad Mini 2 rumors
Xperia z2 Galaxy Notes 12.2 and Google
is looking to kill cookies not the kind
of thinking of this is rumor roundup
let's start rounding them up
look too early to start with Apple
rumors right I mean the iPhone just came
out it seems like we should just chill
for a while but no the rumor mill will
never ever stop turning out this
delicious blocks of rumors so story goes
like this
the iPad Mini 2 is gonna be out in space
gray makes total sense right
that casings have sort of been unveiled
and leaves whatever you want to call it
nothing official from Apple but you can
see what its gonna look like not
surprisingly it follows the same color
scheme as the iPhone 5s you can expect a
Retina display a 7 chip and we're also
hearing rumors that we might see these
guys at an October 15th event which by
my calculation is coming up relatively
soon whether or not we'll see it in gold
has yet to be seen but we have seen SIM
trays that are showing up in Gold's hood
not as for an iPad Mini 2 or for the
next generation iPad 5 who knows but say
goodbye to black and say hello to space
grey say goodbye to white and say hello
to silver and just say hello to
champagne gold I understand that the
Xperia z1 really isn't even out on
shelves yet just got an available a a
few weeks ago but hey that doesn't stop
us from talking about the Xperia z2 and
doesn't stop Sony from planning the
sequel and it looks like it might be
coming sooner rather than later
according to a new report from our
friends at Android sauce the Xperia z2
will come equipped with a 5.5 inch on a
gigs o IGZO display at 1080p and 540 PPI
the same Snapdragon 800 processor was
already pretty beastly tuned to Z 1 and
a 20 point 7 megapixel camera with xenon
flash and upgraded RAM to 3 gigs and a
awesomely sized thirty-five hundred
million power battery in the best part
Android 4.4 deliciously named KitKat
however all is not set in stone an
earlier spec sheet published on the
asado forums time the advice would
actually support a 5.2 inch display
1080p display at 500 PPI and a 32
hundred million power battery at that
point earning over what's better like
cupcakes or cake
they're both deliciously awesome and you
can't go wrong no matter what you choose
looks like the z2 is gonna be priests we
see one already seems kind of awesome so
I would necessarily wait around for the
z2 if the z1 is what you want
go buy it and rumors be damned bones are
getting bigger and bigger
well I can't tablets do the same it
looks like the folks that started the
gigantic phone craze are gonna steer us
into the gigantic ginormous tablet craze
galaxy notes getting big 12.2 supposedly
I was spotted in Bluetooth certification
so story goes like this
Galaxy Note twelve point two is gonna
support Bluetooth 4.0
I also expect it to offer pretty similar
specs that just refreshed galaxy note
10.1 it's a little bigger screen which
means three gigs of ram 1.9 gigahertz
octo-core processor crazy a screen
resolution of 2560 by 1600 and the
redesigned s-pen of course we don't
really know anything for sure until
Samsung makes it official which could
come very soon although we did see this
guy sort of get leaked by our good
friends at least it's not Eevee Lee so
pronounce it correctly it's F leaks so
it looks like it's pretty legit he's got
an incredible track record so I don't
expect to see a ginormous tablet make
its way sometime soon so it's time to
say goodbye to cookies when Google isn't
busy creating wearable technology
leading the world and browsing
developing internet-capable balloons and
whatever the heck else they're up to and
their skunk wars lab might be trying to
get rid of the dreaded cookie I'm not
talking about the delicious chocolate
chip guy and I'd like to enjoy with
nobody's looking at me Google might be
developing its own alternative to HTTP
cookies an effort to improve online
advertising of course neither how to
make money somehow in there according to
a report from the US eight today they
are citing an anonymous source because
the best sources are always anonymous
the new service is apparently called add
ID when gathered data the company would
share with advertisers and ad sales
companies after agreeing to the search
giant's guideline but of course no one's
gonna reads can be a giant thing you hit
that box but suddenly they know more
about you then probably your own mother
does if these rumors are true though ad
ID would offer you the specific controls
even letting you blocks mythic
organizations from tracking your
internet activity through updated
browser setting they also say that
incognito mode is still going to be
available so it looks like the lesser of
two evils you can choose what people are
following you on and what they're not
following on and like most of us you
probably forget about it and just let
them follow you anyway so expect way
more targeted ads so if you think about
buying shoes expect shoe advertising
this to show up just right
your own page without even typing shoes
I don't know it's a good thing or a bad
thing if something that exists already
I'd rather have more control over a bad
thing than have no control with
already-existing bad things so I guess
sort of a unenthusiastic thumbs up me
make a family I'm like that but I would
love to hear your thoughts see them in
the comments my pants region you take a
