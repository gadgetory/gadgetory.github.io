from technobuffalo here and i want to
give you a tour of the operating system
on the HTC droid incredible you guys
have probably seen android 2.1 its stock
form on the nexus one or the acer liquid
or a few other devices but HTC has their
own custom skin on top of this called
sense which integrates itself really
nicely with android so you take androids
great features and senses pretty kick
butt features and you get a really
really nice package here let's go ahead
and start the tour and some of these may
be android that you've seen some of them
might be pretty new let's start with the
lockscreen a first you get a different
lock screens on the slides unlock you've
seen before you actually can push this
whole window down I've got a bit more
utility here you can see I've got to
miss khalaf ID on this text I have to do
it show up there as well I called myself
you have your notifications across the
top as well that you can see so of a
text message waiting for me and in this
column got that LED indicator light
blinking letting me know that something
is going on so let's unlock the device
like sliding this down in a greedy with
a very different looking screen and
maybe you see in the past if used
windows mobile phones with touchflo or
touchflo 3d or another sense enabled
device this may look a bit familiar
you've everything here is completely
customizable the first thing you're
going to notice that when you try on
your screen is how they set it up and
you've got this huge clock with the
weather widget integrated right on top
of it androids all about widgets and HTC
suitor take that to the next level so
you can see the time i'm in irvine
california at sunny 59 degrees if i tap
the sun i'll get a bit more information
i can set different cities here i can
scroll through and see where things are
and sometimes you get actually sort of
these cool graphics that pop up right
there so it's raining in Rome for
example if it was running here in
California actually to be water drops I
would show up across the screen every
now and then when it's sunny you'll see
through rays of Sun come in through the
corner pretty neat also since I've got a
missed tech message you get the
notification right on your messaging
icon to show you that you've missed one
and since we're talking about messaging
let to jump right into there because
there are a few differences here with
sense that you don't get with the stock
Android build so here the messaging
semi self at a blank text message I got
sura this array of icons em blow to
manage your message the messages so you
can see all your message right there
your email is text mms as well just your
SMS or mms where you can move over and
check out your voicemail this does have
a visual voicemail as well so let's go
over to let's say SMS mms control start
a new message and actually what you see
here is a new keyboard HTC put their own
keyboard a different than what you see
again on stock android it's a little bit
bigger the keys are a little bit larger
and for me personally it's much easier
to type on android has a fantastic
autocorrect capabilities HTC actually
built on top of that making it even
better for auto correct you still get
the same features that you get android
2.1 like text to speech and of course
this sucker go into landscape for all of
your typing needs so a little bit
different so if you get one of these
devices that's running sense make sure
that you expect that will go and keep
moving probably one of the coolest
features of sense is first that it gives
you seven home treat just kind of neat
um scroll through all of them a couple
blank ones or you can see this little
bar at the bottom moving to show you
where I'm at but navigating through
seven home screens can be a bit sort of
annoying so HTC built something very new
called leap and what league does is it
lets you leap appropriately enough to
any home screen you want it's activate
it do it in one to two ways take two
fingers and do a little pinch to zoom
action and you can jump around to any
home screen only of three with widgets
on it's only three are showing up but I
can jump to some of the blank ones and
go right there I want to jump back to
the home screen I can jump back right
there you can also activate that just at
any time by hitting the home button I
should also mention too that these
capacitive buttons on the bottom similar
to the buttons that are found on the
nexus one which are also capacitive I
don't have the same sort of wonky issues
the very response is going to work just
about as well as a physical button so if
you're concerned about the problems that
the next one may have had don't be
concerned about the droid incredible
works quite well so these just kind of a
neat feature it's sort of a 3d visual
effect so as you get a bit of the
processing power of the Snapdragon but
just a nice feature
have let's go ahead and keep moving
along is there a ton of other stuff to
talk about let's talk about widgets you
can see one of them here HTC added a ton
of widgets and here's where you can
serve set up almost like bookmarks all
of your favorites you can do set up as
many as you can fit on here and just
have them to call but there are a lot of
other widgets HTC has added some give
you a sort of a tour of something most
popular one so access them same way
you'd expect hold down the screen go to
widgets here are the HTC widgets here
and there are quite a bit of them so
analog clock you can have bookmarks
calendar i'll show you in just a minute
the stock calendar widget that you get
with Android you can see right below it
whether their Android or HTC widgets so
for calendar right there this is HTC and
below that other calendar says android
I've got full Facebook integration as
well I'm sort of pull in all of your
Facebook contents and as I'll show you
in a minute it's got something called
french stream oh it should actually
aggregate all of your social networks so
Facebook Twitter and arrest a very
similar to a motoblur so guess you could
call us HTC is answered a motoblur clock
footprints which HTC is putting on all
their phone I don't see much of a need
for it essentially just geo tags all
your pictures Frenchmen we just
mentioned mail which was shown each TCS
own mail widgets music music people
photo booth pictures and i'll show you
how those handles pictures in a little
bit a search settings there's a very new
stocks widget built in twitter widget
for HTC weather and youtube and time
permitting i really can't show you every
widget here but there are some that are
very cool let me show you stocks for
example is one that i actually use quite
a bit you get a very nice stock budget
here and you can select a wooded style
so there's 105 I would sort of do a
scrolling ticker sort of
three-dimensional holographic there I
prefer to see all of my stocks will go
ahead and select that and it uses yahoo
finance oh it's playing them all down I
don't have any stocks selected but it'll
show up on the next home screen go back
to take a look at some of the other
widgets because there are quite a few so
photo frame we're photo albums kind of a
cool way to view photos we'll go ahead
and pick say HTC's photo frame
essentially frames and pictures in your
album you can pick the one you
want will select that one you can always
have sort of pictures that are available
not many that have taken here yet so
we'll pick one of this lady she looks
friendly move it around fate seems to be
the highlight of that picture so we'll
save it and now I've got sort of a
picture frame of her that I can go ahead
and tap and check out all my images can
see us they'll do the pictures role as
well we'll talk about that in a minute
so those are the widgets there are a
time to choose from a lot of different
choices let's show you some of the other
options one of the other cool things
about android 2.1 you can probably see
in the background are live wallpapers
don't tell her mom but i'm going to
delete her from my phone good see that's
kind of swirling in the background I'm a
big fan of live wallpapers I like them
on the nexus one I like them on the
droid and when it got 2.1 updates let me
show you the live wallpaper options are
here so actually to access humor on on
sense you don't just hold down the home
button as you would on regular Android
you actually have to go back and hit the
menu button then you can go right into
wallpaper HTC wallpapers or live
wallpapers then go ahead and pick the
option chain here the stock ones you're
missing sort of the nexus one lines to
scroll through each other that I kind of
liked but you have a few other ones here
about galaxy selected HTC zone sensed a
multicolored it's are like hypercolor
type thing buller clock spectrum view
meter water and a few others kind of
neat so let me show you some other neat
features that sense is done the HTC is
put into their phones let's check out
the calendar it's completely reskinned
calendar you can go ahead and you can
view by different days or weeks or
scroll through just a nicer way to view
thing if you want to add an appointment
you get sort of a new look and a way to
do that don't go back to the calendar
sort of view all your whole agenda here
if you'd like you want the agenda view
or right back to the calendar it's just
a nothing terribly fancy but it's really
nice touch that I really liked that HTC
did let's take a look next at the camera
because HTC put into their own few
cameras weeks take advantage of this
pretty nice 8 megapixel sensor with LED
flash on the back so we can't really
take a picture of anna here because
going to show you on the black but i
will show you some of the options that
they've added and some of these are
android options as well but the
integrated
nicely so for photos go ahead and adjust
your brightness contrast saturation and
sharpness if you want an effect there
are decent mounted effects and if you
want some white balance and if we're
talking I can show you a little bit of
what those are hopefully you can put
something here's a there's a pen I'll
give you a quick example of what those
look like so do mess around with
brightness see it's we're changing a
little bit not much protection effects
here's all the different choices so
we'll aqua it up and see what else we
have think that'll work if you want to
focus it's sort of a tap to focusing it
actually does focus very nice laces out
of focus camera the flash options are
right there and if you want to take a
picture you actually use that optical
trackpad you push it in through the
flashlight up and you get a picture
here's some other options you get with
HTC it's going to take you to your
pictures this is if you want to share it
which that just went away take
medication share it delete it or go
write your photos and since we're
talking about photos to jump right in
photo is one of the things that HTC and
and a Google particular really improved
with android 2.1 let me show you what
the photos look like Karen will walk
through this whole menu here in just a
moment because there are a lot of things
here to see all of the photos icon
sometimes can be a bit hidden so we'll
get to it right from the camera will
jump back there and we'll hop into
pictures so a picture viewing here is
sort of familiar and other HTC devices
this is one of the sort of few ways
where I think that you actually miss out
on some features that you're not getting
with stock Android device i really like
a three-dimensional sort of picture of
you are here you just get sort of flick
scroll through somebody else make sure
some guy another review Rose had this
phone before me but now he's on camera
it's very smooth very quick you can
pitch to zoom and view in but one of the
ways that i don't like sense that's
really one of the few let's jump into
the menu items HTC actually bundles a
lot of cool applications with their
sense
devices so you got a calculator the
calendar called history camcorder camera
which we showed a car panel actually
takes you to all sort of the car
features which are kind of handy so
Google Maps Navigation activates
footprints you want to view a map make a
call from right here and which I don't
know why you wouldn't just dialer or
search but this is where you find the
Google Maps Navigation jump back into
the menu city ID I'll help you to figure
things out city or state look up and
it's like a 411 really for anywhere you
want to find oops a few other cool
features to get the clock you had a desk
clock Facebook this does have built-in
FM radio which is kind of neat
footprints the french stream we talked
about earlier both in gmail internet
Maps you guys can see the rest peep is
sort of the built-in Twitter client they
give you you can download whatever your
bike from android marketplace there's
photos what's hiding from me a quick
office it's sort of a with you can view
and even edit Word PowerPoint and Excel
documents search people quite obviously
way to search people set up there is
stocks that we talked about earlier
Google Talk you get sort of a cool
Teeter game or use accelerometer it's
like a labyrinth game weather and
YouTube YouTube is actually quite nice
you get voice dialer and voice recording
and of course voice search for android
so there are a lot of really cool
features about android 2.1 and they're
made sort of even better and augment it
a little bit with HTC sense i think this
is really the perfect package of Android
utility you get the openness of Android
really put to a nice use for
customization by HTC so anything you
don't like you can change or customize
or even make it look essentially like a
stock Android device a low much or why
you would sense just adds a lot of
features so what do you guys think about
HTC Sense do you like it not like it
have you play around with it are you
excited about it on the incredible or
another Android device coming out or one
