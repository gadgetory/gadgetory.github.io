sang it from TechnoBuffalo and today
we're gonna be reviewing the Dell Venue
8 7000 series I've been using this
tablet for about two weeks now and I
think it's time to give you guys our
full review and see whether or not it's
worth that hefty $399 price tag so we're
gonna split this review up into two
different categories what I like and
what I don't like so let's go ahead and
start with what I like about the tablet
first is the screen the 8.4 inch 2560 by
1600 pixel resolution screen on the Dell
Venue 8 7000 is gorgeous it's OLED so
you can expect the colors to look great
blacks or black the colors are saturated
and it also offers wide viewing angles
which is great I also like the display
is almost bezel is except for that huge
chin at the bottom where the camera and
stereo speakers sit it is weird holding
the tablet in portrait and landscape
mode since the body is a bit uneven I
really can't get enough of the super
thin bezels it makes reading and
watching movies even better since
there's just so much screen to look at
comparing it to the shield tablet or the
Nexus 9 you can see right away how thin
the bezels are onto Dell Venue 8 7000
also the colors look so much richer
compared to the other 2 thanks to that
OLED panel another thing that I really
like about the Dell Venue 8 7000 is the
build quality this tablet is the world's
thinnest tablet coming in at just 6
millimeters thick and every bit of it
just feels like a premium tablet
comparing it again to the Nexus 9 and
shield tablet you can see just how thin
Dells device really is it's got an
aluminum body along with a glass panel
on the back which we'll talk about later
in a video and overall it's just a
well-made tablet the buttons on the
sides are very clicky there's a micro
USB port on the bottom for charging and
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack next to
it and storage is also expandable at 228
gigabyte via a micro sd card I also like
this comes with an almost stock Android
experience out of the box it's not
heavily skinned just a few software
tweaks and apps from Dell and Intel
like my Dell which is those own
information app about the tablet where
you can check for the warranty get
online support and more there's also
Dells own camera app in gallery app but
otherwise everything is mostly stock
Android unfortunately there's no Android
5.0 lollipop available just yet but Dell
said they're working on it so we should
that's you hit the tablet in the near
future now in terms of performance
inside the Dell Venue 8 is a quad-core
Intel Atom processor clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz with 2 gigabytes of RAM now
playing games on this is great I was
playing asphalt 8 Real Racing 3 Angry
Birds go and all performed really well
no these aren't intense games whatsoever
but I was able to play games at a very
suitable framerate now I did notice some
occasional drop frames going in and out
of apps or swiping through the home
screen but nothing too serious it's not
lag it's definitely dropped frames and
hopefully when the device receives
Android lollipop this little problem
should be fixed battery life is also a
plus I get about 12 or so hours of usage
thanks to its huge 5900 milliamp battery
maybe a bit more it really depends on
how you intend to use the tablet I read
a few books watch youtube videos watch
suits Netflix and played some games and
came away really impressed with the
battery life now let's talk about what I
didn't like about the tablet and it
pretty much revolves around the cameras
and the funky economics while it feels
premium and I liked aluminum build but
the design is just weird because of that
huge chin at the bottom it does take
some time getting used to there's also
no palm rejection technology like the
iPad so you'd really have to be careful
where you put your other hand when using
tablet in landscape mode or even
portrait mode another thing I'm not a
big fan of are the cameras it's a tablet
so I'm not really expecting the image
quality to be good I think it's silly to
take pictures with your tablet but let's
talk about the front-facing cameras
first now since the camera on the front
is placed at the bottom of the tablet
it's really weird to take pictures
holding the tablet like how it's meant
to be held in this case you have to turn
the tablet upside down and use it this
way in order to get a decent shot moving
on to the back cameras there's an 8
megapixel shooter in the back alongside
two other cameras to capture depth
information it's using intel's realsense
technology to create a high definition
map that allow you to measure and
refocus images with just a tap of a
button but the results I got were pretty
unnatural now with all that being said
I'm giving the Dell Venue 8 7000 a
TechnoBuffalo score of 8 out of 10
well mostly every part of this review is
positive would it be my first choice as
a tablet probably not I had the chance
to play around with the Nexus 9 for a
bit which John absolutely loves and he
reviewed the Nvidia shield tablet which
I was really impressed with I thought it
the best tablet i've used at the time
but if the Dell Venue 8 7000 was only
$100 cheaper maybe even $50 cheaper I'd
seriously consider it the thinner
profile great looking screen and longer
battery life are definitely appealing
and if you can get past the funky organ
aam excite think you'd be pretty happy
using Dells mid-size high-end device
