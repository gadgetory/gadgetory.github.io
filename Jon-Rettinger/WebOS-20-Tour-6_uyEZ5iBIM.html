TechnoBuffalo here with an overview of
Web OS 2.0 HP Paul has said that this is
going to be coming to all of their webOS
devices so whether you own a pre a pre
plus Pixy your pixie Plus this is what
you can expect when the update hits your
phone we're going to demonstrate these
features on a palm pre 2 let's go ahead
and get started so as I just mentioned
we are showing this on a palm pre to not
to spend that much time on the hardware
here of the pre 2 as there really isn't
that much to talk about over the
previous generation pre we've got a 1
gigahertz processor now an updated 5
megapixel camera we've got sort of a
soft touch bezel on the side you can see
that right there we've got an updated
micro USB charging port which loses that
quite annoying sort of flap door that
we've seen on the previous generation
pre pluses alright so let's go ahead and
talk about the first I consider major
feature of webOS 2.0 and that is stacks
one thing webOS did fantastically
probably better than any operating
system was handle multitasking and palm
has made that just a little bit easier
so I've got a few cards open if you
remember from webOS all the
gratifications are managing this sort of
card format you could tap on something
to open it if you want to go back to
your main menu and you want to close an
application you just flick it off the
screen so I've got a few cards open here
I've got a web browser window I've got
my calendar and I've got a notes
application let's say I want to keep my
notes and my web browser together
because as I'm moving a web page I'm
typing some notes in there to remember
what I read or something to come back
and check out later so I'll go ahead and
tap and hold this down and go ahead and
move it over and there is that web
browser talking about so I just dragged
the notes right on top of it and now
I've got what's called a stack you can
see these two right next to each other
and the main home screen views much in
the same way I can go ahead and jump
into that application I can go back and
view other applications inside of the
stack and go right back to it one of the
cool things if stats does if you open up
a link or open up another application
wall inside of
stack it's going to open up that new
application as a new card in that same
stack kinda neat it's a very nice
feature it makes navigating multiple
applications and multiple windows that
much easier than webOS which already I
think was a great way to manage open
applications so that is stacks there's
also a new universal search which is now
called just type you can sort of see it
briefly and a little bit fade in the
background up top let me go ahead and
give you a demonstration of what just
type looks like so you cannot add a ton
of different search functionality that
was not here before but again the
keyboard is exactly the same let's go
ahead and type techno like I want to
search for TechnoBuffalo and see it
starts pulling up different names and
different numbers so here they just type
techno I can go ahead and go right into
Google Maps Wikipedia Twitter I can
search the palm app catalog I can add
this into calorie vent search SMS or new
email I can go ahead and open up more
what this is going to do it's going to
open the application actually search
within sub within it for what I'm
looking for
let's go ahead and look at preferences
here as well because there's a ton of
other ones that you can add so here's
some bookmarks and email Google map
Wikipedia Twitter and a ton of other
things here as well one of the really
cool things about the just type is that
it is now an open interface so you a lot
of other websites you visit you'll get a
pop up asking if you want to add it to
the just type universal search so for
example you might get ESPN for example
you can add YouTube so you go ahead and
search all these different sites from
really one central area it really makes
it is very nice and welcomed feature the
next sort of thing that I think is very
important it's not really much point in
demonstrating it is there's now a
favorites in the dialer go ahead and hit
that star button right there it looks
just like an iPhone or Android go ahead
and put your favorites right in there
alright so going back to the home screen
here we do have an updated launcher so
right now these are broken up into pages
so at the top we have one called system
you go ahead and scroll over you get one
called extras and one called
applications you can rename these
anything you like you could go ahead and
tap the top at least try and tap the top
it'll open up a window to rename them
you can see one of the problems here is
a touch screen sensitivity on the pre 2
does not want to be renamed go ahead and
hold it down there it goes now I can
rename it and I can also add new
launcher pages if I like a rename
launcher pages or reorder to launch of
pages so there's a new one and go ahead
and tell it whatever I want to go ahead
and close it and if you want to move
applications between pages you can do
that as well if you hold it down go
ahead and move things anywhere you like
we'll keep this back on the application
screen all right so the next kind of
cool feature that's here it's something
called text is this one of the things I
lamented that webOS initially didn't
have was any sort of auto correction we
now do have auto correction on here let
me go ahead and show you will jump into
system let's go ahead and find it Texas
is here there it is so what this is
going to let you do is teach it what
words you type and don't type and it
will automatically correct them so I can
go ahead and edit user dictionary if I
put words in there to learn what I've
typed there also is something new here
called shortcuts which is going to let
you pick sort of shortcuts that you want
to type long letters so if you type
TechnoBuffalo a lot you just hit TC and
symbol and automatically type
TechnoBuffalo for you so let me give you
a demonstration of what this looks like
or at least say i would love to give you
a demonstration let's go ahead and
launch memos and I'll go ahead and
Universal Search here or just type to
open up my memos application and there
is a memo let me go ahead and type
testing and I will type our testing this
device I'll type testing wrong and all
its space bar to go to the next word
however I can't do that because the
space bar on this Palm Pre 2 is broken
so as much as I keep hitting it it's not
going to be working if this was a
functioning phone you hear a little bit
of a ding and it would autocorrect the
word and I could just tap it and see
what the changes were made whether or
not I wanted to accept them
unfortunately this Palm Pre 2 that came
from HP as a production unit is broken
and this is not a review unit is
something that we actually bought and it
will be going back to HP
something to keep in mind some other
sort of features that are here smaller
ones that we didn't have before
things like VPN are now here so you can
find that there's VPN you can connect to
a few different options in case you need
to be Piett into something so there is a
VPN there's also a new synergy services
so that synergy bezel essentially pulls
in information and syncs it with all the
rest of your device so you can now
select whether or not you want to sync
not just Facebook what not you want to
say Facebook calendar would not you want
to say Facebook context so you're not
left with just a huge dump of stuff you
can pick what you want and lastly when
the features that I really didn't want
to show is flash webOS 2.0 supports
Flash content so regarding TechnoBuffalo
when you have Flash content visible it's
not going to automatically load on the
page didn't give you a little bit of a
play button right there let you know
that it's there so your pages will load
pretty quickly as if there wasn't flash
to go ahead and hit play but this is
just an advertisement they can see what
looks like it starts to move a little
bit move around if you go ahead and
rotate the device it sort of zooms in on
the Flash content so you can now view
slash web pages and even play up flash
games on here and it does work actually
pretty well something to sort of bear in
mind any guys I am John rhett endure
from TechnoBuffalo with a overview for
you of webOS 2.0 on the Palm Pre - are
you excited about these updates and
something that you really think webOS
1.0 should add is this enough to merit a
2.0 update for you for me this is more
of a 1.5 type update there's nothing
revolutionary or new here and I think
Palm had a lot of ground to make up in
the OS source to catch up with Android
and iOS and I don't think webOS 2.0
unfortunately really does it despite its
really fantastic multitasking
capabilities so I want to hear from you
leave your comments down below
