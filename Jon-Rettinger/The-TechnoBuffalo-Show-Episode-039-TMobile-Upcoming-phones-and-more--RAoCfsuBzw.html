TechnoBuffalo show I'm of your to host
for this week Shaun ani editor and chief
of the site and I am joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
what was with those eyes todd i was just
making faces oh ok so a bit quieter this
week than it has been although there was
still news mm-hmm timo for those of you
wondering why were on Thursday instead
of wednesday john leisure did not call
us before he scheduled his tmobile event
yo see if it conflicted with the
TechnoBuffalo show we forgive him but
you know so t-mobile had another one of
its uncarrier events and wow who didn't
almost go to sleep yeah I know when what
when we got there and they were like
well I've been writing this to actually
in the posts they said we're gonna
rework the industry or something so the
word work was like okay it's probably
business-related and then it was for the
most part um and it was a little kind of
sleepy for a bit I mean look business is
important especially for wireless
carriers when you get a big client on
board and stuff like that but I don't
think it's necessary to have a consumer
press conference and invite the consumer
press I mean I don't write about small
businesses for the most part right no
ice event I at having been a small
business owner what he announced what
was exciting to that portion of me but
as working for a company that's
consumer-focused it was Kyle right and
for the people that missed the event is
basically the uncarrier move was
extended to business plans so you can
pay it sounded like affordable prices I
don't even know what business prices are
like but sounded like affordable prices
for unlimited text minutes and starting
at a gig of data that you can add more
and then you can also bring in your
family so like if I have a technobuffalo
tmobile account I could then like add my
wife like non-existent kids I thought
that was really interesting the fact
they were willing to count the business
phone as the first phone cutting out the
fifty dollar
phone requirement right I thought that
was nice too and they said you could
save up to like fifty percent yeah
you're doing it through your business
account well she's neat no I did have
some caveats I was thinking about this
and I've actually written about it a
little bit it's not that I'm against
t-mobile in any way but I think if I was
a business owner we talked a bit about
this yesterday and I had a fleet of
trucks or something you know I have
employees out in the field I want them
on the best network possible and look
t-mobile's networks fine in some areas
especially metropolitan areas but it
does drop off to edge still and they're
working on that but if I have a business
i'm willing to pay i think to make sure
that everybody's connected all the time
and that i know where everybody is
otherwise like what good is or my
employees on the road if I can't reach
them so that's to me I'm not sure that
price is good enough but t-mobile's
getting there and they made promises
that all of these deals they have
there's like no such thing as promotions
almost any more like they're all
permanent and they're not going to
change unlimited for at least two years
so that stuff was really good yeah
another there was some good stuff there
there was some good stuff I I'd the idea
you know what I would love to see and I
know no one's ever going to do this I
I've had my own personal server for
years for my personal website and you
know I constantly get these emails from
my house about yo for new customers
seventy percent out for month I've been
with you guys for like four years right
like me nothing yeah they should do that
though exactly and you know saw it like
I look at you know the same situation
with phone companies they don't ever you
know like go hey you've been a loyal
customer here's a special deal for you
right hey al should be like that but you
know they're always trying to get their
new customers on board well I've turned
you into a loyalty point order yeah
that's right myself especially on Delta
exactly you know so here's a situation
where we're earning all these loyalty
points and as you've already seen it
does pay off when you you start save
them up you know maybe do
loyalty points system do something you
know just don't sign us up and then go
haha you're here for life ah although I
guess in the carrier sense you know the
the older plan sort of had the unlimited
data you know the grandfather plans and
that was nice of t-mobile to at least
confirm that they're not going anywhere
for two years which goes by quickly it
seems like I mean that's one phone cycle
if you think about it but for most
people yeah I'm fast it's like six phone
so go to school i I don't know I just
did it steams unfair to me but but the
idea of the promotions the promotional
price locking enough that I think is
cool yeah it is cool so like I guess
what they did was they gave the one
gigabyte plan users 2.5 gigabytes what
about that that was gonna go away at the
end of the year now it's permanent which
is pretty yo I thought that was a nice
move right well so I don't know it was
interesting but as uncarrier
announcements go it was okay right yeah
it wasn't as exciting I mean he was
certainly energetic in hand as wild as
ever but uh yeah I think the news wasn't
as you know uncarrier as some of the
other ones where you're like whoa that
seems very cool oh no it definitely was
not as uncarrier as some previous ones
but anyway moving along so we are
entering a it's great that all these
phones have been announced now if
someone could just tell us when we can
buy them no it's really funny we have I
mean at least three big ones right on
the horizon here the m9 galaxy s6 and
galaxy s6 edge now yesterday the m9 we
got an idea I was a tmobile most today
so i don't think i saw the specifics but
president jason mackenzie gave an idea
of when that shipping but we still have
no idea aside from rumors that samsung's
devices are hitting on like april 10th
or 11th depending on where in the world
you are which is kind of weird usually I
mean let's see when the m8 was announced
that I'm almost certain they gave a
launch date almost immediately and you
more and more at these events they're
like okay coming like t-mobile eighteen
t Verizon you know starting on like
April nineteenth but now Bruce like when
illness is coming what's going on but
the canadian press it seems has the
units so that means it's coming soon
yeah I I don't know it just it seems odd
I mean if you've got the built-up
momentum although I mean it could and
this is off the top of my head this
could potentially be a how can we hit
the most news cycles so we announce it
we go quiet for a little bit that may
announce the date get that bump we go
quiet the phone actually launches quiet
dick yeah our launch is exactly so it
may be an attempt to get more press
cycles right yeah that doesn't make
sense to me i don't know i think it's
it's also did this is a really big year
for samsung I think you know they
started from New and so I think a lot of
people are excited to see what these are
like you know I steely drivers yeah yeah
exactly I don't know it just it seems
odd and yeah now you kinda have to
wonder this was something I was thinking
about and just so everyone knows Todd
and I actually did not get a chance to
discuss topics very much before the show
so I'm flying over we're all over but I
was just thinking about this okay so we
have three flagships coming right now
mm-hmm we've got the Xperia z4 coming
sometime in the year you traditionally
have the iphones in the fall you know
i'm wondering is it better for the phone
companies to spread it out and try to
get away from each other or is it better
to clump together so there is
competition again a new that's a really
good point because if you look at Mobile
World Congress and stuff too it's like
it almost seems like well you're a
nobody if he didn't make any news right
like oh what's going on you know but so
when you look at we had HTC and Samsung
let's say right
9 s6 s6 edge and then we're like well
we're is lg's you know g4 where's the
Xperia z4 were all these other phones
and you start to think like are they not
ready or are they what you're saying
strategically pushing it so that they're
not launching at the same time as these
devices which makes sense in other words
when they hit the market consumers are
going to be like wow there's three new
phones to pick from and they might pick
you know one of them but when they go
shopping say let's say two months from
now the g4 is the newest phone and it's
the only new phone well then maybe that
has a better chance and that's that
seems to make sense but from a press
perspective it also looks like well gee
you know why are they so quiet is
something going on and especially in
sony's case because we know something's
been an issue in their mobile business
despite making great smartphones and now
it sounds like that's going to be pushed
maybe as far as September which is a
year after the this e3 during Aoife so
that'll be interesting to see but
they're going to a six-month Eichel yeah
well then now it sounds like they're
going back to the annual one yeah which
is very different because if they were
on six month that's March you know
they'd have to oh I don't know I just it
crossed my mind I wonder you know
because yet for the consumer it's better
to have them all at once and then you
can make a more informed choice right
yeah you're like sweet i get to pick up
exactly but if it's spread out it's
better for those companies because then
well even if it's a week two weeks they
have the carrier stores to themselves
right exactly thinking they can be the
flagship you know the what do they call
it the carriers like flagship product
mm-hmm gonzalo wouldn't do space okay
whatever the early windows phones or the
HTC was it in the United States the
cha-cha-cha one of the first facebook
foods I try to forget the cha-cha-cha
happened or the or the kindle fire fire
phone anyway so moving on to some of the
questions we have coming in we have
several about the Apple watch so let's
jump in
those real quick from Shaun the man 34
we have will you be going to on April
10th to the apple store to see the Apple
watch I don't know we haven't discussed
that actually yet because John has seen
the Apple watch in person extensively
the rest of us have them and for me
going to an apple store means of three
hour drive so I probably won't be going
to an apple store right I don't think
I'm gonna go out of the way either I
mean it'sit's there's a couple here in
Manhattan but I'm not gonna not gonna
kinda fight the crowds or whatever yeah
exactly eventually I walk by and be like
oh yeah Todd you can make an appointment
yeah and that's the thing to let me be
honest I'm afraid I'm gonna walk out
with one so I can't just walk in there
and see it I mean when I hope Sean knows
we're about to get a puppy and we were
looking at dogs and I swear I almost
picked up the first time oh yeah well
and and the other thing is that Todd
would buy an Apple watch then returned
it yet then buy it and return it or
ticket then buy it I've never use it
that's the story of my life had meaning
everybody yeah yeah it's a story that
we're never gonna let Todd live down
yeah I think I would imagine by now best
buy has you on like some bulletin board
in the back if you see this man don't
let him return anything like it it's
true and I bought a new monitor this
weekend it's actually a TV because
they're they're a lot cheaper but
they're not as sharp um and I bought it
and brought it home and I put it on my
desk and I was like this is cool Louis
720p because I saved 10 bucks but
honestly but for 10 bucks i could have
1080p yeah so i returned it and got the
tinny you didn't tell me that part oh
yeah i did so cocksure of returnees and
decision making nah good good car
shopping with you must be a wide
thankfully I haven't had to do that well
I agree with you televisions aren't as
sharp but I mean sometimes I I cast over
to a television during like Apple event
days I'd so I just like put the traffic
monitoring over there which doesn't need
to be right super sharp but yes TVs do
make wonderful monitors um the price and
here's another question for Sean the man
34 about the Apple watch do you think we
will need to pre-order the Apple watch
on April 10th morning and if we don't
they will be backordered for months
that's a good question well it's a
really good question it's really
interesting because if you pre-order and
you get it that's great you know awesome
but then you have to wonder well is it
not that successful but if cuz rumors
say Apple has well like three million
watches on order or something like that
no it is the number yeah so three
million if they sell out of those that's
by far the most successful Apple watch
because you're looking at what all
android wear combine the last we heard
they'd sold like seven hundred sixty
thousand units when pebble just hit a
million after however many years on the
market so for Apple to sell three
million in the first whatever week if
you're pre-ordering what is it April
10th to the 24th right so two weeks that
would be insane and good for Apple you
know good for the bills but I think you
should be all right just based on you
know industry trends what people have
bought in the past from 94 Keegan who is
one of the people who helps out with the
TechnoBuffalo minecraft server which if
you may not be aware we do have a
minecraft server which you can just
enter the eye and the IP minecraft
TechnoBuffalo calm to get there anyway
Keegan asks I've been looking into
getting an Apple watch sport space gray
and I saw that it comes with two bands
do I get to choose the colors or do I
only get to only get two black ones I'm
not a hundred percent clear on that it's
uh it's the same color they're just
different sizes inside the box God sure
I mean I went through the the sizing
Apple's sizing guys and that's what it
said on that so another bummer okay oh
fun with Apple watches I know see that's
the thing though I I think it looks
awesome I'm excited for it I just can't
the rubber is what really bothers me
like I don't want to spend three hundred
fifty dollars for rubber like I get
there's a computer on my wrist but like
spend the X with the other twenty
dollars in for a you know something
metal no it's not i but of course if you
actually want metal what's the starting
price they're like 600 I think she felt
like that it's ridiculous I just I I'm
not even considering one yeah speaking
of tag heuer this morning announced well
it was afternoon in Switzerland where
they announced it but they announced the
Android wear powered tag heuer is coming
they worked with google and intel on
that which is interesting yeah very
interesting from Sasha Mahal and this is
a broad question what do you think
Google has planned for i/o 2015 I think
they have things planned lots of things
I don't know today on the site i don't
know if it's on the site yet but
Lenovo's CEO accidentally leaked the new
Moto 360 or at least it looks like it I
think it's going up here in just a
minute or two it seems pretty plausible
so I wouldn't be surprised to see at
least new Android wear hopefully an
update on the platform but you know it's
been a year since android wear was
announced there so hopefully more on
that front I like to see an update on
Android auto with what's going on with
that and I think maybe we'll see you
know a new Nexus or something but it
might be a little soon I don't know who
wasn't there a pioneer that released the
Android auto yeah but it doesn't have
like the software yet and kristen i
think this entry price was like eight
hundred dollars hi we'd like you to
spend some money on something that
doesn't work yet yeah so why are you and
I wonder if chrome OS will be discussed
to you because we just got the new
chrome books um we're just announced the
new pixel or whatever which is crazy
expensive still
so you kind of hope that like Google's
going to explain why anybody would want
to put that money but I get it's not for
consumers yeah still just a very
expensive laptop but that'd be cool to
see an update on that front like where
we are in terms of getting more android
apps running there which is what they
want to do and bringing the
functionality from your phone over to
this system you know my mom speaking of
Chromebooks my mom has fallen in love
with Chromebooks really oh she thinks
it's just because she's not a power user
she's checking email she's reading news
stories whatever and she likes you know
the battery life she likes how light it
is she likes that just works mmhmm yeah
she's a big fan of them and I have to
admit I mean if I'm just you know if I
just need to do one thing real quick at
home I just I grab a Chromebook and done
shut down i'm off right see I have the
windowed microsoft's version of a
Chromebook which is like their windows
8.1 with ding which is really just the
nose 8.1 it's fine um but I recently
have it's starting to tell me that I'm
running out of available memory which is
crazy I mean it's got what a gig or
something on it but that's kind of
frustrating because I'm just surfing the
web with Spotify open who knows uh from
Sean the man 34 I'll try not to laugh as
i read the first portion of this
question will we see a second generation
fire fund hahaha and we'll ever thought
make a SmartWatch I think we'll see a
second generation fire phone because
amazon has said look like we'll learn
from our mistakes for me one of the
biggest well there were two huge
mistakes we know the pricing was off
didn't make any sense um the other huge
mistake is sort of the operating system
you're really limited without Google
Play services I think Amazon is and and
I don't know how they're gonna solve
that I mean it's fine on a tablet boat
at your phone you're kind of relying on
maps and stuff which Amazon's you know
it's not as great as google maps so I
don't know a funny story about fire
phone and again related to my family so
I amazon how to sail on fire phones i
picked blowing up for ninety nine
dollars yeah
than a whole year prime two and all that
I was like a dream ok so I get in my
father goes why'd you buy it another
phone she already have to I was like
well this is a backup in case you know I
need one because oh how long's that good
for arms like for ever and he goes oh
how much is it costing a month I was
like nothing I've finally dawned on me
he thought every phone immediately was
contracted like a bill oh and so he
thought i was paying a monthly fee on
that phone have it there I'd so I had to
like explain the concept of a sim card
dome and I was like oh trouble is every
phone had a contract yeah uh time I've
got let's see I've got a samsung mega
6.3 sitting at home right now which is
not running it's just sitting there
turned off I've got a blu studio 6 you
have not do anything the fire phone 1
plus 1 this is 1 plus 1 I actually carry
around right right oh yeah yeah always
including them all together yeah which
actually will play in 200 amazon
SmartWatch yeah i don't know if i see it
mmm I mean it seems like a good way to
like buy stuff right especially if it's
powered by the same voice engine or
something that the echo has rebe like
Amazon I meet diapers or something
either but i think it's already
available on a droid where I think that
was one of the use cases they're using
with the Apple watch I don't know that
they need to make their own right like
you can just see them seem argument I
have for why they don't need to make a
phone yeah I know uh I don't know it
just although this just crossed my ok so
let's say they did make a SmartWatch
they put a low-power camera in it then
you could walk around stay your house
because they've got that that one thing
now where you can order things by
scanning UPC codes yeah yeah yeah well I
mean you could do with your phone
they call it Firefly thinking right but
every app has it for music and so
instead of having to pull out your phone
though you just hit a button on your
watch go like that and you can order now
or you're in a story scan a UPC code
check the price I mean it'd be cool it's
a stretch but it'd be cool it's still
one make it worth my yeah well I mean it
depends on how well it's executed too
but if you look at the fire phone it
like it seems to make sense because
you're thinking hey it's another portal
for people to order from amazon this is
great except for it wasn't really well
done and so nobody want to use the phone
so it's not a porter order from amazon
then they were sitting on you know some
odd million units that weren't sold yeah
exactly and that's what they probably
want to avoid here whereas tablets are
totally different use case scenario and
i think they work really well on amazon
makes good tablets just i don't think a
phone is needed no the fire tablets were
nice I don't have any complaints at the
fire tablets its outs and of course the
candles are great right but outside of
that it's just kind of like Amazon maybe
just don't get involved with hardware
yet yeah but the fire TV is kinda the
witch surprising to me I thought that
would be better I've never used one I
thought it would be better to I wouldn't
I've not been impressed with it I fired
up like once a month see if things have
changed i'm just kind of like mmm yeah
and the nexus player is a complete joke
right now but which is crazy too because
when i saw that at google had a press
him at new york city and i was like oh
this is really neat but i guess you know
what we see at these events and that's
why we always you know gotta wait for
the review is not what actually always
ends up shipping oh yeah i mean there's
been many times where you know like we
see something at CS wow that's awesome
and then it shows up at the office were
like oh whoa what is this not my son
this wasn't quite as exciting as we
thought it once upon a time we used to
meet with blackberry CEOs when i worked
at lap laptop magazine and they would
come in and show us their products
usually ahead of time
because we had a long lead so we'd have
to you know take pictures and all that
kind of stuff we're writing like the
June magazine like in March so long time
so they come in and show us the first
touch screen BlackBerry's like the torch
and stuff or no was it the torch that
was the slider on any case and we were
like this is amazing but you know we
know it's not final and will it'll be
awesome when it launches and then it
launched and it was literally like the
same thing we saw that wasn't finished
like once months prior I was like so
nothing was fixed yeah when I worked in
print I had a six to seven week lead
time which always killed me yeah I was
just like by the time this gets
published nobody cares yeah it's like
imagine going TechnoBuffalo and reading
the stories today but then buying the
magazine in two months put the same
stories it's really difficult yeah uh
let's see here there was one question
that we kind of just touched on there it
is from sahaja what is your daily driver
for your SmartWatch phone and tablets
hmm but what are your current daily
drivers right now I'm using the iphone 6
plus in the nexus 6 and 4 SmartWatch I
actually don't usually wear a SmartWatch
I regular watch but if I'm wearing on
moto 360 and tablet right now I've been
if I'm using a tablet it's the Nvidia
shield tablet I still really like that
thing i'm currently using just a regular
pebble an iphone 6 plus an one plus one
for phones &amp;amp; ipad air 2 for tablet
earned i'm sorry/not ipad or two I don't
know why I said that ipad air first one
we have over the time the pimple time as
well yeah no yeah I can't wait to try it
the pebble time yeah from Shaun the man
34 house Apple pay months later are you
still using it I don't use it as much as
I would like to simply because where I
live there's like a walgreens that
accepts it yeah I hardly ever go to
walgreens but whenever I've had a chance
to use it
use it I think it's great I have to be
honest I get nervous now because I had
that one instance where like it wasn't
registering my fingerprint there was a
line behind me I'm like and here's my
card but I always and you know if you
read this I listen to the podcast I've
always said like I really really want
you and I was always looking forward to
using my phone for payments it's just I
don't know i canna like ah except for
its Starbucks you know I don't use Apple
pay but I use like a little scan code
because it's flawless I I used whenever
I'm at out in irvine you know for the
weekend tibor whatever I that's the only
way i buy things at starbucks it's great
that thing is so freaking easy you use
mmm yeah I open the skin I mean it's so
easy that they like don't even scan it
anymore they just leave the scanner
they're back to pick yeah well quite
often they'll like you know say go ahead
and they turn around it you know because
I am the most boring starbucks customer
ever I just get a KOA right place yeah I
snow Ruth cream I drink my coffee black
I don't do anything fancy to it I just
drink black coffee right and they just
turn right I you know poop they turn
hand me my cup and that's it I'm done
I'm out yes but as for Apple pay i use
it when I can which is all that all I
should use it more maybe I'll you know
get some cojones yeah going back to the
apple watch for a moment how many apple
what from Sean the man 34 how many apple
watches do you think will be sold in the
first year i'm hearing estimates from
analysts from three million to 21
million any guesses yeah i mean the
ranges we've heard are insane yeah i
think people are like well it's gonna
sell a little bit or people are like
super bullish because they're like this
is the next iPhone this is the next iPad
it's gonna go nuts so I have no idea
honestly we were saying if you look at
the competitors there's not a whole lot
of attraction so let's see what happens
i I'm I'm gonna be bold I'm gonna say
under 5 million
okay probably around 4.5 hmm interesting
I mean we do have to consider it's a
huge global launch two it's not
everywhere immediately but its its large
global launch which is I think going to
get products and people's hands quicker
than else I mean other devices so anyone
that wants to write that down and remind
me at the end of the year show because i
know i won't remember i said it and
we'll see if i am correct also from sean
the man 34 in this funk just because the
email Johnson out yesterday did you guys
have a march madness bracket if so who
is your final four actually jon
rettinger just emailed the entire
company yesterday and he had set up a
online place first and set up brackets
and I know absolutely nothing about
college best I remember we put in the
final four at Arizona villa nova going
against it in arizona which is probably
not going to happen because i went to
lehigh in Pennsylvania watched and play
Villanova recently is closed key okay I
don't think you'll know is gonna go that
far but you know kind of rooting for my
Pennsylvania team and then I grew up in
Arizona to so depth of uh sure sure what
Todd said no don't listen to me that's
why you terrible bracket you never every
year there's upsets it's fun all i knows
manchester city's out of the Champions
League yeah I actually saw for that game
yesterday right against Barcelona yeah I
saw that yeah Barcelona noctuidae even
though i have no dog in this fight
anytime city loses I'm happy let's see
here what else have we got here from and
since Todd you have touched this phone
from Eamon dude I'm not even gonna try
I'm sorry I there's too many little
symbols in there um what do you think
about the samsung galaxy s6 design I
like it a lot um I think Samsung will be
met with Samsung and they said look it
really was called like projects
arrow inside and they gave the designers
like free rein they said little phone
you know out of the materials you want
let's see what happens and they built
this phone out of aluminum I think it
looks you know very much like an iPhone
in in terms of like the actual metal
borders for better or worse I think it's
fine and then i liked i really like the
glass on both sides i think it's really
nice about the only thing that bothers
me night old samsung this too is it gets
finger prints like crazy especially on
the back panel yeah i think too many
phones have that problem but yeah thing
is though note note for was a great step
forward with the sort of metal edges and
then this is just like boom like all
right you got it like no more plastic I
think you know I know consumers are a
little upset about the replaceable
battery micro SD card and obviously
micro SD is still possible HTC does it
and it's only phones but you know I
think this is a step in the right
direction for samsung I'm excited to try
it I you know I'm excited to try every
fun that comes out uh from Robbie kya I
believe thoughts on Asus Transformer
book t100 cheek and it replaced my
laptop and iPad all together I have not
had a chance to try this right I saw it
briefly um I think it's neat we're gonna
I think we actually I don't know if we
have it in the office yet or if I'm
allowed to say we'll have coverage of it
um I don't I think it depends what you
use is for a laptop if you're replacing
like netbook like I used yeah I think so
its uses done really good job of that
with their transformers in the past
keyboards are usually pretty good love
that it provides you know additional
battery life to the display it does work
pretty well to replace them both but it
depends what kind of computer you're
coming from I mean you can't go from
like you know I wouldn't even go from a
macbook air and that and say that it's
completely replacing it because you're
still going to miss stuff but yeah good
job from Shaun the man i'm 34 with apple
coming out with the music subscription
service do you think we will see a movie
/ TV show subscription later almost like
a netflix hulu well that's the
her but it sounds like it's going to be
more like sling TV than on-demand
streaming right will they go that route
that is a wrap that's a lot more
complicated than a lot of people realize
you know each month we run an article
about what movies are coming and going
from netflix and that is all because
when netflix agrees to carry a movie
they agree to it for its set period of
time and a certain right so you have to
keeping to renegotiate because I mean
sometimes you'll see a movie drop off
and then come back like two months later
right it's just it's all matter
negotiate negotiate negotiate Apple
could probably do it do they want to do
it I don't know you could buy sling too
well if sling is actually dish oh yeah
that's right you're right yeah so I
don't see a well man that's a round
apple doesn't want to go right right now
it doesn't go down that route no unless
Silas dish sells it I don't think you
will I I don't know what Apple's endgame
is here it's I don't know it's going to
be interesting to watch see my
knowledgeable especially I mean they did
it with Beats or you're doing it again
with beats all i knows there better be
an updated Apple TV at some point brief
from Sasha Baja what do you think of the
oneplus teaser hashtag one game changer
is at a1 plus gaming device it's a
controller yeah let's say controller
maybe like a Bluetooth controller I
don't know it's going to be this crazy I
mean one plus is like a bootstrapped
company that's making nothing off of his
phones barely anything I don't think
it's going to be aggressive in and put
money into developing a new product
certainly not a new device I don't think
like that yeah I'm I bet it's like a
like a white Bluetooth controller I
don't like something simple I don't know
the odd odd teaser I mean for a company
like you said that's bootstrapped and
all that it doesn't seem like a market
that they need to be jumping into yeah
and and we know it's a careful company
yeah i mean like it didn't release the
back covers because it ended up being a
little more expensive or whatever I mean
not widely released so I don't think
it's gonna take like this huge jump into
like it gave me difference that could be
wrong doesn't seem like a good business
move I agree I don't very odd uh firm
Sasha Mahal is well have any of you guys
tried the windows 10 preview I have not
yeah I have it running right actually
right in front of this computer that
goes on my desktop it's good i didn't
install the new one yet the update that
came out yesterday that's like not
different lockscreen things Cortana four
different languages they said they
polished the start menu so I didn't
really jump on it but uh the the windows
10 / use been great for me the only
problem I've had a couple times it's
like in chrome especially the browser
just doesn't load anything so it could
be anything it might be windows MIT my
computer or nothing else oh that's deep
I look forward to trying Windows 10 at
some point I just I I my computers are
too precious to me to run unstable
software I just don't have the time
unfortunately yeah for me I don't know
ever since like maybe it was windows at
me maybe before that which is stupid I
just installed all the early previous so
Windows ME Wow Lenny medician mm-hmm I
had one computer with it yes I remember
it it was kind of like the oh darn it
windows XP psyche to log to bake let's
brush something out the door yeah yeah
exactly hahaha good cream el que me mad
that thing was horrible uh do you think
Samsung is going to update the gear live
or make another Android wear SmartWatch
well let's give questions both I think
the demand do something with Tizen
because they've already sort of
invested millions and lots of time into
Tizen they finally launched a smart
watch it they brought their other
devices onto tising after the matter but
I think they'll probably do android wear
too i don't think they're gonna rule it
out forever I don't know I I think they
know we didn't see the SmartWatch
immoral Congress and that suggests that
they're doing something different yeah
now i agree they've invested with
mention Tizen to not continue with it
yeah you know I really liked the what
was it LG's new SmartWatch all these
devices have so many names I can't keep
urbane the urbane LTE as webos power
which is very much like the Audi watch
that LG added CES now that's cool so I'd
like to see Samsung get into that kind
of market from Dennis Lang stand
anything new on the LG G note yeah
nothing yet we just saw rumors though I
think the latest one was 15.6 inch
display something like that and that you
know they trademarked the name maybe
we'll see it later this year the summer
but the rumor is that they're gonna have
the g forth and follow that with
something to compete against Samsung's
nuit family so I don't I I still think
it's uh odd that they went with the note
name but yeah how do they all get away
with this like show me had one to the me
note for because if you think you can't
trademark the word note really yeah
there are certain words that can't be
trademarked yo you can trade market in
conjunction with another word right like
G note or galaxy note right exactly but
the word note you can't do anything with
Wow yeah you cannot trademark common
words hmm which is what made the whole
candy crush saga think so bizarre oh
yeah yeah yeah that for those that don't
remember when they got the King got the
trademark on candy crush saga they went
after any game that had the word saga
and its name including like the banner
saga saga right which was completely
unrelated yeah but they said there could
be confusion in the marketplace
man they finally drop that trademark
claim that that was so stupid oh my
goodness uh from Pierre bullier uh what
would you like to see on the 1+2 I
honestly you know we've been asked this
before and I keep thinking about it I
really really still like the one plus
one I don't know what I would change
really see I wasn't maybe my unit was
like not as great i gave it to my
brother I don't know it's like the
display to me wasn't very good it's like
it's way too bright you know the
backlight and stuff and it like not too
bright is in a sense like the colors but
like the balance like it doesn't have
real dark blacks like an oled display
I'd like to see that on it resolutions
on I mean let's go up to quad HD if they
can but I think the price is more
important that's what makes it so
exciting I I will say this for whatever
reason I have a horrible tendency to
accidentally turn on the flashlight I'll
just be like if I huh yeah I'm like why
its my battery Drake of flashlights been
on for probably an hour my battery life
wasn't very good on my unit so I I've
been lucky I guess yeah yeah well but i
would need a better screen hmm yeah but
I wasn't crazy about the camera but see
I'm not a big picture taker with phone
so I mean I like oh I'll tweet something
snap that's the extent of my break like
oh okay yep I that's I'm done a
flourless charging would be neat yeah I
must be so Mike I'm just thinking of fun
things again oh no no no I totally agree
uh wireless charging still worries me I
mean until we get I think yu Qi is gonna
win or however you jakey Qi everyone
says um I think it's going to end up
winning but I just want to be sure it's
gonna win before older cars now that's
like the there yeah well I they're both
in the
the galaxy s6 and s6 edge which is neat
so but yeah you need a device its
supports both right yep uh and we'll
take one more question then we'll be
done for this week by the way we will be
back on Thursday again next week due to
a scheduling issues but we will be
around next week on Thursday final
question comes from ravi chi hai I think
what kind of feature do you think should
be added to future SmartWatch to make
more customers start considering to
purchase one except battery life that is
yeah battery life is the thing I think
that's a lot of it I mean if the Apple
watch you know if Tim Cook could come
out on stage and said you know I'm
giving you this great color screen and
all these features and the battery lasts
say even four days mm-hmm I be going ooh
I'm intrigued and the fact that I've got
yet a the thing yes we charge all our
phones every night but the thing is I
don't want to charge you another device
every night and devices not as essential
as a phone mm-hmm I mean it's true I not
only do I not want to I don't and then I
don't wear it and so that's one of the
big barriers they that all of these
companies have to get over except for
maybe bubble is that I mean I know
you're saying except battery life but I
really think that's the huge barrier and
ain't no maybe price yeah like they have
to they have to have you know if you go
to if you go to a Macy's or whatever you
go to a department store you want to buy
and you watch there's a lot of
nice-looking watches you can choose from
you know from like 50 box up like you
look like I wear it you know where ever
I don't think that's the same case with
wearables they sort of started a hundred
bucks and most of them look like
something you wear to the gym so I think
that's a barrier to yeah maybe Apple
fixes that a little bit maybe motorola
fixes that a little bit with the
high-end moto 360 s and stuff but that's
still what the Moto 360 with the metal
band is you know 300 bucks so that's a
barrier for a lot of people that don't
see any need for these things nope I
totally agree
