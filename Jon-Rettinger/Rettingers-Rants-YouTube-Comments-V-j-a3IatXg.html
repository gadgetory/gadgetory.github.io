to you by crashplan welcome back to
other episode of rettinger ansys the
show where I raped and rave on
everything from the world of technology
and sometimes outside a little
technology up this week I want to rant
about you the YouTube commenter let's go
and get started YouTube comments it is a
necessary evil love and Haley ship I've
got with the audience I love the
audience interaction I love the fact i
can answer question people can answer
there can be dialogues that can go on
with mutual respect for the content
producer and the commenter and make you
respect you can comment during commenter
but we don't live in an ideal world I'm
convinced that about sixty to seventy
percent of my audience the ones that
watch the video absolutely hate me the
comments get meaner and meaner year
after year after year but I have thick
skin I could handle it I've gotten used
to it I didn't always at first there
were many times when the commenters
would really start to get to me actually
there a few times or the first couple
years and I started that I really just
felt like quitting I couldn't handle it
anymore I didn't know how to deal with
it but I persevered I got through it and
now I just know that look at commenters
are gonna be 17 they're gonna say go
kill yourself it's a 3 megapixel camera
not a 5 megapixel camera you call
yourself a tech reviewer I don't want to
ran to talk about me I want to talk
about the new youtuber someone who's
just starting right now maybe it on the
tech world maybe on another topic comedy
someone who's just getting their foot in
the door with the world of YouTube maybe
soda could be the next great talent the
next you know Philip DeFranco
raywilliamjohnson whoever else you look
up to on youtube but commenters get him
down you can be really tough starting
right now you're not used to that level
of scrutiny and a crazy anger video
after video comment after comment the
anonymity of the Internet has really
made it is a safe haven for a lot of
hatred I don't live in a rainbow unicorn
farting world where I think everybody's
gonna be friendly and get along and it
Mitchell respects and we could go skip
through the meadow I don't expect that
at all but you expect we would see
somebody on YouTube we would say to
somebody if you saw them face to face
and that's generally been my rule that I
follow
so if you're looking at one of my videos
and you disagree to what I'm saying
let's say it you know you've got your
right to your opinion you've got it
right to say what you want but do it
like you would if you were talking to
somebody take the anonymity out of it I
think you can have a bit more discussion
I can help discourage or not discourage
rather some younger generation from not
making their videos it can be really
really difficult to go online and put
yourself out there you're putting your
face out there you're everything out
there not everybody's perfect i'm far
from it I thought God has it on my face
my eyebrows are specially bushy my hair
looks messy that day if I'm tired knife
back under my eyes all that stuff is
totally being scrutinized you are
putting everything out there that you
have your entire self when you make a
youtube video and you're putting
yourself out there to be judged and it
certainly comes the territory of making
YouTube videos I accepted it I know
that's what happens and I'm used to it
but other folks out there might not be
I've had years and years and years to
develop a very thick skin so my advice
for those aspiring youtubers out there
those aspiring folks want to get into
tech world and just make videos you're
really have to fight through it you
really really really have to fight
through it if something gets especially
hateful or spiteful make use the block
button block those suckers report them
and the start to get less and less
they're never gonna go away never ever
ever in a million years gonna go away
but you have to fight through it
eventually you will get used to it
toughing to say get used to like you
should have that you should not get used
to being bullied but it's just a world
we live in certainly I don't expect
things to change overnight but if one
person changes are commenting if one
person says something a little bit nicer
if one person thinks before they type
then we'll have improve the community
just a little bit the other YouTube
commenters out there I know I'm in the
minority but I love you guys at Yale
first in fact I usually typed my phone
first messages on YouTube I don't know
why I find it funny to you that ask why
it's so low quality because the video
just got uploaded seriously dude wait a
minute doesn't go 1080p originally that
one annoys me I don't know why I know
not
everybody knows that that happens if the
new do you do some reason that just
annoys me personally advice out there
fight through it be strong persevere and
if it's important to you and if YouTube
something you want to do it as a hobby
or maybe even as a career you're going
to have to get over it if you can come
out on the other end you'll be better
with your own personal life I talk to
people who maybe don't like you face to
face if you're able to brush it off your
shoulders like it's no big deal keep
dealing with it all your YouTube life
I've seen a lot of people get bullied
online that I've banned in the YouTube
accounts makes me really sad some great
talents people much more talented than I
am have stopped doing YouTube videos
well these are younger kids where it's
prevalent the bullying sort of goes past
you know what you see on youtube to real
life and they know the person and it's
really unfortunate so I want to talk
about YouTube commenters be just a
little bit nicer be a little more civil
and let's make the world suck just a
little bit less want to take a minute to
