start to change falls upon us kids go
back to school heck it's my birthday
it's also traditionally been when we see
new iPhones and it looks like this sep
tember will be no different with the
iphone 7 iphone 7 plus and possibly even
an iphone 7 pro let me show you what I
think the iphone 7 plus is going to look
like so last week our friend Lou from
unbox therapy took a look at a prototype
phone that we think might be the iphone
7 plus his version is a little bit
different than what we have here I has
featured a 3-pin connector on the back
tool into the smart connector we see on
the iPad pro if that does make it to an
apple phone presumably that will be for
a third brand new line of iPhones called
the pro check out Lou's video that will
link to it down below put me at the
prototype that we have in front of us
sent to us from the folks at be sound
there's a lot different here what you
see with the current iphone 6s plus so
first that giant camera hump with two
sensors nestled inside two sensors
presumably gonna give you improved
optics you've also seen two sensors used
for things like stereoscopic 3d like the
evo 3d a few years back but I would not
bet that the direction Apple is going to
go here you can probably say will have
higher megapixel accounts built into
those sensors probably better low-light
and higher resolution pictures overall
but with that bigger camera hump you're
gonna have bigger camera hump things
like a way bigger wiggle this thing's
gonna not wiggle when it walks but
wiggle when it is on a table the
thickness of the phone versus the
outgoing model is almost identical and
in fact the prototype that we have or
the dummy show that we have whatever you
want to call it has almost exactly the
same weight to it as the outgoing phone
a few weeks ago we took a look at an
iphone 7 shell similar things look
pretty familiar here as well the antenna
fans used to flank the top and bottom of
the phone have now been moved to the
seems kind of making them hidden when
you look straight down we look at it
from the size you can certainly see it
as well probably the biggest change to
the phones whether we have one two or
three versions it's gonna be the lack of
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack and that
has been polarizing to say the least but
love it hate it or just ambivalent to it
it is here as well with the iphone 7
plus sample that we have i'm not
necessarily sure why the headphone jack
would be removed
the phone's not going to be any thinner
but that's an apple decided and that is
what we have fear like you guys decide
if that's a pro or con for you other
things to note on the back of this phone
and different from lose video the fonts
it's this iphone is a bit different also
the font that we have is in white the
apple logo is also in white not sort of
shiny metallic like we have with the
outgoing phones one of the more recent
iphone rumors been getting a lot of
steam the past few days regard to that
touch ID home button then in fact it's
not going to be depressive a button on
our sample it still is like previous
touch ID buttons we see it in the past
going to be place with a hurt a haptic
feedback some what we've got with a
magic trackpad and a force touch
trackpad in the macbook pro so you'll
tap it get a little bit of a bump and
you can go you pressed it that lends
itself to potentially software updates
things like long pressing of the home
button and sort of quick tap so you can
do that maybe could do different things
with software with iOS 10 or next
iterations of iOS other than that though
this looks like the very similar design
language we've seen for the past few
generations of phones save for antenna
bands being moved in the camera sensor
now doubling in size to having to rest
of placements are pretty similar you've
got sensors in the same spot and got the
flash in the same spot look at these
phones from the front you really can't
tell difference between the seven plus
and the 6s plus so if this is what Apple
bestows upon us in a few short weeks
isn't enough for you guys to upgrade
you're gonna make you want to run into
the warm embrace of Android or other
operating system we want to see us do a
comparison with their iphone 7 sample
give the video a thumbs up to let us
know the next time from John render from
TechnoBuffalo after you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
