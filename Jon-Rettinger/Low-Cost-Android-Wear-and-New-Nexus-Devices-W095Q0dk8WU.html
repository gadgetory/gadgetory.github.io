to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone walk back there episode of
rumor roundup I am John Ranchers to show
her I take all the tech rumors from the
week I sort through them I put them in
columns cross things out to pick three
to five to I think are the most
interesting sexy rumors these rumors are
all dolled up for you they got lipstick
in high heels let's go ahead and get
started so it looks like the rumors of
the Nexxus death have been greatly
exaggerated
according to Android head of engineering
David Burke and this would be the guy
that would know an interview was a read
ripe this week Burke at Google i/o said
there's no reason to worry the Nexus
program is on its last legs
so don't worry he added that the company
still plans to release a new Nexus
device later this year with the launch
of Android L we don't know if that's
gonna be the smartphone or a live-time
them much either tablet that is unclear
ello Google fans already clamoring for
both and so does this guy just get right
here Burke was on to say you can't build
a platform in the abstract you have to
build a device or devices he said so I
don't think that we can or will ever go
away and then I think Nexus is also
interesting and that is a way of
explaining how we think Android should
run it's a statement almost statement of
purity in some respects I don't see why
we would ever turn away from that it
wouldn't make sense end quotes which is
an awesome quote to have for Nexus fans
berkel also seemingly confirmed the
existence though of we thought was going
to take its place
Android silver but he wouldn't comment
on the program beyond just gently
hinting that's likely to launch early
next year recent rumors have suggested
that Android silver will essentially be
a list of specs for high-end smartphones
the advice would then be sold by
individual carriers so Google is just
like make a phone with this and the
cares you're like all right here you go
with Android silver Nexus and the newly
announced Android 1 program Google may
soon offer three separate programs to
target the low-end mid-range and high
ends which that's all the ranges there
could be after letting individual
hardware makers dictate the most the
Android Market for way too many years
Google family's ready to take back
control which is great news for everyone
who sticker fragmentation at least it
won't be a
as fragment II it'll be less less
fragment key which is better all right
now let's talk about some iPhone
sickness rumor roundup and the story
just won't die until September we've
already seen plenty of iPhone 6 dummy
units even a few photos of what might
actually be the phone itself but a new
video from Mac o Takara offers our first
up-close look at the actual device
another report also suggests Apple will
mix up its storage offerings for the
first time in years the iPhone 6 this
fall so the video that we post on
TechnoBuffalo comm shows the alleged
iPhone 6 rear shelf next to a pair of
dummy units and the real iPhone 5s least
we know 5s is real does you might have
it in your pocket the hardware design on
the mock-ups in the leak unit matches up
perfectly suggesting if the rounded
shape probably gonna be legitimate the
inside the back panel doesn't really
reveal much but it really looks like the
real deal cuz it's got groovy things
where components are probably just gonna
be screwed into meanwhile although a new
report from Chinese blog Fang suggests
Apple may offer a 128 gigabyte I phone 6
bring it this year although only for the
5.5 inch model so if you have a lot of
songs of videos and want the big phone
the claim follows another rumor that
said earlier in the week Apple would dip
to sixteen gigabyte option entirely for
the new one which is going to be a 32
gigabyte at the low end of this iPhone 6
range which is awesome 32 gigs is the
perfect number there's no word on how it
might affect pricing but hopefully Apple
will keep offering a $200 on contract
option Rosel starting your rumors that
Apple could announce the iPhone 6 at an
event on September 19th below don't book
your flight just yet no hard proof that
Apple has plans to do really anything
yet either way though we're not
expecting the company to be able to take
smartphone so sometime this fall until
then though you want to check out the
video we've gotta take the buffalo calm
or look at the pictures here but that's
part with the iPhone 6 then it look like
either a little bigger a little smaller
we stop the rumors for what sec to ask
your question you look at this face what
do you see you're probably saying dude
you're super pale get some Sun we'd also
be saying John you look a little tired
got infant at home little sucker than
sick as well as I like you're also
saying you probably need to shave and I
do buts because buying razors just sucks
you gotta trudge the store gave you up
that 17 year old to try and get a key
the plastic things I think you're gonna
steal their razors then you got a
shout-out 20-something bucks for some
stupid shape tech you don't need
like a Dyson vacuum type ball head on
your razor I just don't need that stuff
fortunately no there's a company it's
doing away with all that silliness it is
called the Dollar Shave Club may made
its stupid symbol which is good for me
for a few bucks a month Dollar Shave
Club ships amazing razors and other
bathroom sundries just write your doors
so I have to go is just do your door I'm
going to put pants on if you want the
blades are just as good as a blades from
the bigger companies just a fraction of
the price they got other stuff too they
got dr. Carver's easy shea butter to
make a shave even more buttery smooth
shave time shave money shave yourself

TechnoBuffalo next let's jump into
Android wear I just got back from Google
i/o and this thing was everywhere gotta
be funny though if they did did Android
underwear and then when you got a tech
message eatery I could keep it vibrate
but I pitched that to Google and they
just looked at me like this alright so
back to the story we know a sous working
on Android wear device of its own and
but at Google i/o the device was nowhere
to be seen those things apparently gonna
cost between 99 149 bucks it is way less
than LG's you watch or Samsung's gear
live which cost 220 on the 200 bucks the
source adds issues opted to hold off on
announcing the device rather than rush
to release in time for Google
input/output you didn't know that's what
IO stands for we still don't know
anything else about the east of
smartwatches 149 bucks or less we're
guessing won't come with many extra
features it's the price that was a major
factor though it's probably worth
holding out into this low-cost Android
wear hits the markets but if you just
can't wait you can get the G watch to
the gear ly of their shipping early next
month that are available to order today
on Google Play for me I see we flip moto
360 things look freaking hot but it guys
think you excited for anything that he
just mentioned noon XII phone 6 the
Android wear device I want to give your
thoughts leave it in this this this
region until next time I'm John written
