episode of ask the Buffaloes to show you
could ask this guy jon rettinger any
question you might have from the wide
world technology we had a very busy week
Microsoft took the wraps off the
next-generation Xbox the xbox one were
to talk a lot about that we're gonna
talk about some own news may be thrown
in there some personal stuff and wrap it
all up with a nice tech bow this is
asked a buffalo let's get asked the
buffalo e isis first question comes from
our friend Josh it's asked hey John what
is the future of gamestop and other
retailers at sell used games but
Microsoft is said about the price to buy
a used game on top of the game price
well gamestop and others start to fade
away after the last generation games
fade away to give a little bit of
reference so what was initially said
when the xbox one was announced was done
an interview between kotaku which is a
gaming site and microsoft corporate vice
president Phil Harrison essentially what
they said was the fee for buying used
games or borrowing one from a friend is
gonna be the full cost of the game so if
it's 60 bucks for retail you'll have to
pay 60 bucks and activated it's on top
of whatever you paid the seller the game
initially so a lot of money Microsoft Oh
appears to be issuing conflicting
statements so they backtracked on that a
little bit the new word though is that
what they explained with just a
potential scenario here's a quote
directly from Microsoft so while Phil
discussed many potential scenarios
around games on xbox one today we've
only confirmed that we designed Xbox one
to enable our customers to trade in and
resell games at retail so it looks like
they did a oak wrap are bad people
pissed let's backtrack a little bit
which is great so what's gonna happen
though we really don't know it looks
like though there's going to be some
sort of fee to trade in games or to play
a game at a friends house hopefully
let's often be the case it looks like we
are heading that direction so thumbs
down Microsoft this question comes from
rut route 29 who asked hey Jonathan
still worth buying xbox 360 what's the
future for this console and what game
still be developed for it anymore so
microsoft said the b xbox 360
announcements at e3 but i wouldn't run
out to buy an xbox 360 right now even if
they dropped a dirt cheap there probably
will be new games that come out for over
the next six months maybe
even a year or I can see the xbox one
presumably until the holidays but if
you've waited this long to buy a
next-gen console wait to the xbox one or
wait a little bit after the xbox one a
me build buy a used xbox one but
definitely I would not recommend buying
an xbox 360 right now it doesn't make
sense hopefully help answer your
question next one comes from twitter
user add one more tech asks hi john for
lakers what phone does your wife used
well that's an easy one to answer she
uses a white iphone 4s with the pink
bumper no she's pushing me for an
upgrade to the five so probably get that
one soon next question comes from our
sheets art wall who asked John what are
your weekend like sometimes we get
personal questions on here so i'll share
it they're very very boring usually I'll
try and sleep as late as possible which
recently is like 10-1030 make some
coffee I'll sit with my wife on the
couch and watch some TV for probably
more than we should go out and run some
errands maybe go catch a movie see some
friends then come home maybe take Lucy
for a walk and go to bed it's a pretty
boring life I'm in there I'll probably
play some new phones I'll play a game on
the computer you something on a tablet
and that's really it I'm kind of boring
I wish I get more exciting stuff I
should make up stories like I go rock
climbing and then I go parasailing and
then I go BASE jumping off bridges
that's just how I roll but honestly
reality is I just like to sleep as much
as humanly possible I like to try and
sleep I've talked a lot about actually
trying to deal with insomnia over the
years and I think that I might actually
have my insomnia kicked I've been able
to sleep through the night for the past
like months which for me is absolutely
unheard of enough it's like I'm every
night that I wake up and have slept is a
freaking blessing so hopefully that
continues hope you guys enjoyed that
