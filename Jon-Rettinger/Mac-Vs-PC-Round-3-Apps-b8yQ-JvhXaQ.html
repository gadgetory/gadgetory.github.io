round of the OS Wars today we're going
to be discussing included software
programs or applications however you
want to word it of course both operating
systems since their earliest
incarnations have come with basic things
such as a calculator games a paint
program but as time has gone on those
included programs have become more and
more complex in numerous what we're
going to focus on for today's battle are
the consumer level apps things such as
photo management and media control of
note I'm going to include the windows
live essentials out louds as part of
this battle even though they don't come
bundled with windows anymore in previous
versions of the OS they did and it's a
free download for all windows users so
if many of you have probably surmised a
lot of this fight is going to be I life
versus windows live but there's also
some other aspects to it as well that
will get into so let's get started first
up photo management so what does that
mean iphoto vs windows photo gallery now
something you won't hear when the Apple
fanboys rave about how great I photo is
is that a lot of the same features are
in photo gallery for example facial
recognition integration in social media
basic editing and geotagging ultimately
though I photo is going to win out
because of the implementation of those
features apple takes the extra step to
make them just a little nicer for
example the interface it's a lot slicker
a lot easier to use and things such as
geo-tagging it doesn't just launched
into the Bing Maps it actually has a
built-in map system things such as
Facebook it doesn't just allow you to
upload photos but in fact to manage your
albums and your profile pictures so it's
those little extra tweaks that put OS 10
out on top in this particular app next
we're going to talk about something I
know is dear to a lot of you youtubers
out there and that is video editing
software this is another case where a
lot of people instantly feel that Apple
dominates but that's not really the case
movie maker has a lot of the same
features as I movie in fact I edited the
previous portion this video using
Windows Movie Maker however like iphoto
ultimately I movie wins out because of
those little extra features apple
includes you see the effects before
they're applied you can precisely
manipulate the audio the movie trailers
feature and almost pro like features
such as reducing rolling shutter I
decided not to compare writer versus
iWeb because really they're trying to do
different things one's a blocking engine
and one is that what you see is what you
get web page editor and there's some
other incidental apps not just an ilife
in Windows Live but just in general in
the OS is that I'm not going to compare
you know things like the text editor but
there are a couple more I want to talk
about and this is where Windows is going
to start to fight back and that really
happens when we talk about multimedia
viewing and management in other words
windows media center versus front row
what's interesting about these is that
it's almost the exact opposite of the
situation with ilife versus live
essentials and that it seems Apple
really didn't go all out with this front
row is really just a pretty skin
overlaid onto iTunes windows media
center on the other hand is
full-featured you can watch recorded
media live TVs movies from your hard
drive live radio it's really fully
integrated so much so that some
manufacturers are actually putting it on
different set-top devices and embedding
it into TVs one last program I want to
talk about you guys knew this was coming
saved it for last that is garage band is
actually the most asked for piece of
software that is OSN exclusive to be
brought over to windows in fact check
out the top two recommended results when
you type GarageBand into Google since
there's no windows equivalent I won't
get into it suffice it to say it's an
amazing piece of software and is really
great if you're into music creation with
that we're going to go ahead and call
this one and os
10 victory over windows just to wrap it
up this harkens back to the whole
philosophical difference between the
os's OS 10 being a complete package
ready to work out of the box and windows
being much more a blank slate that you
can kind of mold to your needs which is
better who knows we'll continue the
battle let me know in the comments if
you thought I did a bad job with this
video and should have done different
apps let me know if you agree with it
and i'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
