this video a few days ago when I did the
why didn't I answer your emails one but
I held on to it so I wanted that one to
get some traction so people would read
it so as I explained later on what this
is is another PlayStation 3 unboxing my
ps3 actually broke it stopped reading
blu-ray discs which kind of sucked but I
had a similar problem happened to a a
buddy of mine so he advised me when I
bought mine to get the extended warranty
for I think 30 or 40 bucks so I bought
it took it back to Best Buy and they
tested it and gave me a brand new one
which is nice didn't come with the
DualShock 3 or anything so it came to
the sixaxis but hey it's still a new
console so I couldn't unbox anything
without showing it to you guys so in
case you're interested I'm sure some of
you are baby or not here's another
unboxing of the PlayStation 3 enjoy
guests like hey guys I know you've seen
this before but I've got a PlayStation 3
unboxing for you mine
stop playing blu-rays it was one of the
few things that actually I bought the
extended warranty for so I took it back
to Best Buy for those of you out of the
us is the big box electronics retailer I
may just replace it for me so I don't
you guys are interested in saying
another unboxing a Playstation this one
doesn't have spider-man in it but I felt
weird opening something up not sharing
with you guys so here's another unboxing
of the PlayStation 3 enjoy
alright so let's open this up obligatory
knife this is the 40 gig system I think
it's the only one out now it's not
backwards compatible it's PlayStation 2
but I don't want to play section 2 so
not a big deal for me sorry for you guys
a little trick here so I can get this
right I'll tell you myself
and keep your applause yourself okay so
let's put that side
let's open us up see what we got let's
move this down so you guys can see
probably gonna look exactly the same
with the other one play beyond welcome
to PlayStation 3 I will probably never
open that book playground again look
it's got some games highlighted in there
something I'll probably also never look
at again there we have the console see
what else we have this came with the
sixaxis the Dual Shock won't be bundled
that gets until June so see what the
store
you guys are familiar with but um it
looks like yeah same thing Twyla's plugs
in it's got the gyroscopic sensors cool
controller good looking for cables again
million times
power cable I'm gonna need actually
doesn't have a power brick which is
really nice it's just cable plugs into
the back charger for the controller and
video cables I have HDMI so I'm gonna
stick with that and look there are some
books in there to guide to video game
ratings I was really excited I bought
Rambo and I was gonna pop it in and
watch a movie and then they wouldn't
play so this is one of the few things
I'm glad I bought the warranty for
okay so here's the PlayStation trick you
guys have seen it at least see me unbox
it before but like I said I'll show you
guys again it is nice to see one without
any fingerprints or cat hair on it nice
and shiny and black but there it is
PlayStation 3 as you guys can see and
for those of you who didn't see the
other unboxing it's the first one I'll
show you guys real quick overview of it
playstation leave its slot loading disk
it's got touch sentence of buttons right
there for eject and for power and it has
two USB ports right there
no US card slot though there's some fans
there is on the back get that in frame
for you guys AV cables optical audio
HDMI Ethernet power switch and where you
plug in the power cable on the other
side
that's your hard drive bay the hard
drive in here is totally user
replaceable which is really nice anyway
guys just another quick unboxing of the
PlayStation 3 yet again you know dr.
guys soon hope you enjoyed and catch you
later bye John for makers John for
makers John for Lakers dad Oh
