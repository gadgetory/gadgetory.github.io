line the very first surface Pro I saw
the potential but the product wasn't
complete every surface Pro since then I
have happily recommended I even loved
the second gen surface book a little bit
wishy-washy when it came to the surface
laptop but now we've got the latest in
the surface line the teeny-tiny $399
surface go I don't like it and beyond
that I cannot recommend it here's why so
before I jump into to this thing and why
you shouldn't buy it
Church the subscribe button and hit that
Bell to think you get notified when new
videos are coming we got a ton more
awesome stuff coming your way so the
failure with the surface go isn't
necessarily with the surface hardware
itself a lot of responsibility lies with
Windows 10 it's not a very good tablet
because Windows 10 isn't the best in
tablet form it's not the best laptop
comebacker top had to cut a lot of
corners to get it to that 399 price
point it's just not good and generally
anything when you look at what this is
gonna cost this set up that I have right
here with the Alcantara keyboard gonna
cost another 130 bucks you can get a
cheaper one for $100 so the least
expensive way you can surface go with
the keyboard is $500 when you're looking
to spend 500 bucks you're looking at
like a discount Lenovo yoga category
you're looking at Chromebooks you're
looking at a lot of options in a really
crowded space and I can't see why
anybody would buy the surface go so not
recommending the surface code doesn't
mean there aren't things here to like
first the 10-inch pixel send screen is
really good electro visibility is
surprisingly solid viewing angles are
great colors looks vibrant blacks look
black things are a little bit smaller
because the size but it's a really good
screen and hidden in that awesome screen
is actually the Windows hello which I
absolutely love that is one of the best
features for me of Windows 10 it's
unlocked into thing with my face and
also surprisingly not crappy the
speaker's I would didn't have high
expectations here but they're pretty
decent I like the addition of USB type-c
on here you can charge it via USB type-c
or you can use the surface connector
which I believe is just USB see like
stretched out but you have
options I like to make ourselves give
you the ability to have both of those
ports battery life here is also
incredible Microsoft says to get about
nine ish hours but very rarely to
actually hit that mark I easily got six
to seven hours of battery life on my
usage you can easily extend that farther
turn the brightness down and you turn
Wi-Fi off if you want to watch movies on
an airplane you'll be fine for an easy
cross-country flight if you do up to
spend money for the keyboard it's also
pretty nice too Microsoft does an
incredible job there attachable
keyboards the trackpad is glass it's got
the precision drivers in it it works
really well
it is shrunken down so the tractor like
I said is easy to use the keyboard took
awhile for me to get used to because the
keys are way smaller but there's decent
key throw and they feel if you'll click
E and clacking it's also gonna work with
the surface pen I'm not a big pen user
but I get tested it works like any other
service device the last thing that's
really good about the surface go that's
good with all surface tablets is the
hinge is awesome Microsoft coined the
incredibly stupid term lap ability but
it is an actual thing that works you can
put on your lap the hinge goes to ten
different directions it can stop
anywhere you want have to wait since
certain stop points it's really good I
guess their credit - you also have
expandable storage via microSD so you
can always up that emmc storage if you
want to alright so that's pretty much
all the good things with the surface go
here's why you should not buy it so
let's start with s mode Microsoft is
shipping the surface go with s mode you
can call it Windows RT whatever you want
they've tried this in the past
essentially what it means you can only
use apps you can download from the
Windows Store which in theory should be
pretty good in practical use they're not
that many apps it's also gonna mean
you're gonna be stuck using Windows edge
if you want to use Chrome you are out of
luck now Microsoft credit though you can
get it out of s smooth doing it for free
for the early days of a surface go or
hopefully look send that to longer don't
have to reboot to get out of best mode
but once you are out of SM you start to
see the real limitations of that Pentium
Gold processor I'm a big chrome user I
don't want to be stuck using edge this
thing got bogged down with three tabs
open up just normal websites if you rely
on Chrome really heavily this is not the
computer for you you better I spend that
money towards
Chromebook 40 and because it's a
full-fledged computer you get out of s
mode you might want to do normal
computer things aside from just browsing
the web usually when you've got these
hybrid computers you're generally being
powered by core i5 used to be the sweet
spot for what manufacturer putting their
computers this is using a lower end
Pentium Gold processor and it's not as
horrible as it expect obviously it's not
gonna be great for gaming we knew that
going in but we wanted to see if it
could handle some games even on like
crazy low settings couldn't run pub G it
couldn't run fortnight's out of luck
they're just for fun we tried to run
Premiere Pro no surprise it couldn't run
that it did work a Photoshop though but
it was a little on the slow side so you
can sort of do computing but not
computing that well that's again my
issue with it at this price point you
can get an i-5 that can play like games
that can also do some like video editing
that can also do Photoshop you have to
make a lot of compromises to get into
this surface go so the model we're
testing is the entry-level 399 bucks
complete with 64 gigs of emmc storage
not even full SSD stores you can spec it
up then becomes even more ridiculous of
a buy we're gonna spend more money you
can get in last gen surface pro you can
buy a ton of lenovo's Dell you can get a
real computer that's good at actual
computer things and mix servers go even
more ridiculous the more money you
decide to spend on the surface go is
like a jack-of-all-trades but a master
of none probably its primary competition
I would imagine are gonna be Chromebooks
and iPads the new nine point seven inch
iPad starts at 329 if you want to go to
hunt rent gigs of storage that's for
twenty nine you are still less than you
are at the surface go with the keyboard
and even then you get the same level of
productivity pretty close that you'd get
with something like this I don't know
who would buy this I don't know why you
would buy this get a surface pro instead
if you want the form factor it's not a
very good tablet and it's not a very
good computer I cannot recommend the
surface go to anybody so I know it was a
little harsh on the surface ago I
recommend a lot of products I think are
good products and I would put my own
money behind and I bought this myself
Microsoft didn't send this one to check
out I was really optimistic like I said
I love the surface line of products
no I just I cannot recommend to you most
excites for and I review a product I
tend to think of this is demographic
that would like this this isn't really
good for anybody but what do you guys
think do you disagree with me did you
buy a surface go and you're like John
you are so off-base if you are gonna
argue make a point what is this good for
how are you using it and why did you
believe the money you spent was well
spent for a surface go I generally want
to know cuz I don't see it with this
thing I know I hope you guys enjoyed
until next time I'm John Brennan you're
from TechnoBuffalo probably gonna back
this thing up and send it back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
