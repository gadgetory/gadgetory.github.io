technobuffalo here every now and then
there is a piece of technology that
crosses my path that really amazes me
and today was one of those days and I
thought that I just had to share it with
you it's application i'm going to show
you on the iphone called word lens it's
an augmented reality application that
takes what you see in the real world and
augments it with an extra layer of
information that will show you on your
device's screen so let me go ahead and
give you a demonstration it's a word
lens is a translating application so if
you hold your phone up to something in a
foreign language they'll translate into
your native language or vice versa it's
free to download but if you want to have
actually translating from languages each
language pack one way so English to
Spanish he's gonna cost you 4 99 Spanish
to English for example I'm going to cost
you another 499 so I've got some text
here just that I printed out this is a
test hello my name is John Jesus old and
moldy I won't eat it anyway Wendy the
Pooh sounds gross and I saw a baby
wearing a t-shirt that said daddy drinks
because I cry he was with his dad that's
actually true so let me go ahead and
open the application and see if we can
demonstrate how this is going to work
gonna be a bit tricky to capture on
camera but we've shown some worst stuff
in the past and hopefully we can manage
it so I just went ahead and opened up
word lens here princy it selected
English to Spanish I'll go ahead and get
that right in the camera where it says
this is a test you'll see it actually
changing right on camera go ahead and
move it over a little bit and the text
is actually changing right on the screen
which is really incredible I'm going to
go ahead and you can see it doing that
let's go ahead and move down to the next
one hello my name is John you can see
that that just changes let's go ahead
and continue to move down the cheese is
old and mold and you can see that as I
move they move the camera lens on the
phone actually continues to translate
yeah it's not entirely accurate and
there's this uh mostly a cool and wow
factor this it I can't believe is
actually working and translating I've
tried doing with print it doesn't work
it has to be just text we'll see how
well it works here we need to poo sounds
gross
Winnie l pou kind of fine if you folks
big Spanish you can see how well or not
well this is doing it sir it keeps
changing the words quite a bit but you
can imagine the applications if you're
in a foreign country and you'll want to
see what's on a menu just hold up your
phone to the menu and see what's in
there and see if it's what you want to
eat or don't want to eat and lastly
let's look at the final line here see
how it does in the translating
department see that it just continues to
translate as I move right across the
paper which is really kind of impressive
so the application let me show you what
it looks like if you jump into it
english to spanish you can go ahead and
download other language packs presumably
there will be more available so right
now which English to Spanish your
Spanish to English each way again is
going to be 4 99 you can do a demo of
your race words or reverse words will
just mess up the letters or erase them
on the text i'll show you a
demonstration here of your race words
for example so we'll go ahead and hit
done and now instead of translating it's
going to quite obviously erase the words
so go ahead it done we've got some words
on a page here and it's just getting rid
of the words you can see them all
disappear which is kind of neat pen with
paper towels you can see that it just
erases words no rope optical application
there but it does erase the words so
this is a lot of sort of promising uses
for this augmented reality certainly
it's not that accurate right now but
again it really just has a WOW factor to
me that I just wanted to share with you
guys anyway it's available now in the
App Store I'd love to know what you guys
think jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
