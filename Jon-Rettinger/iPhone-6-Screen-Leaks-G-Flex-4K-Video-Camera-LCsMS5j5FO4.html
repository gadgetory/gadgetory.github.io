to you by Linda Bonjour everyone welcome
back the episode of rumor roundup i'm
your host jon rettinger we are filming
on location in geneva up this week the
LG G flex might be able to shoot 4k when
it gets android 4.4 the Oppo find 7
might be bringing some mega pixel
monster in the form of a 50 megapixel
shooter and the iphone 6 might finally
go edge to edge this is rumor roundup
let's start rounding things up
I do like things with curves so let's
start there with the LG G flex
supposedly when the phone gets android
4.4 hopefully in the next few weeks
it'll get another four in the form of
this many k's shooting video so the
story goes according to our friends at
phone Arena they're able to uncover an
LG user agent profile which shared video
at 2160p which is 4k unfortunately
though the same tipster said there will
not be slow mo 120 frames per second so
that kind of stinks but 4k and I found
that's already out would be really
welcome surprised and certainly would
help boost your sales of the g flex
aren't that many phones out to the chief
4k really the highlight one is the note
3 so if this would bring that to LG's
flagship phone it could be pretty sweet
and also it's been deep for those you
that have been following the Oppo find 7
you know it's going to be unveiled later
this month and according to of the
Chinese social network site Weibo Apple
has been treating the viewers to slow
teasers kind of day by day week by week
so the latest image that was teased on
Weibo by the Oppo folks of this pretty
baller old-school forward it looks like
a pretty decent picture but to go
through and check out what the
resolution it is it is 81 60 by 60 120
meeting this could be packing a 50
megapixel shooter so it's going to brush
to the side the Lumia 1020 when it comes
to the megapixel Wars it looks like we
could be getting some crazy awesome
specs as well in the Oppo find 7 so
expecting the Oppo find 7 to be packed
to the gills with awesomeness including
an edge-to-edge 5-inch screen which
might have two options of either 2k
should really one of the first times
we've seen 2k on a phone or 1080p you'll
know everything though come March 19th
what do you think Oppo find 7 might be
given the company second look me from
the market for an unlocked smartphone
could be got kind of a cool way to go
especially with the latest specs love to
hear your thoughts leave in the comments
and last but not least what would rumor
roundup be without an iphone 6 rumors so
earlier this week we saw what could be a
leaked screen for the upcoming Apple
device so a few things that are
interesting first it looks like the
iphone 6 can retain a pretty similar
footprint to the iphone 5 5 s a little
bit taller but it's going to give it
that little bit of a larger screen
allegedly 4.7 inches it's going to go
almost totally edge to edge which
sounds kind of cool but not you're gonna
hold up you late it but hopefully Apple
will have thought of something when it
comes to that there's been some
speculation about the pictures we saw
were fake as the home button cutout was
a little bit off-center but then that
was also countered by perhaps we've just
used a prototype to identify the parts
and where they came from so take it with
a gigantic probably fist-sized grain of
salt but edge to edge is remember we've
been hearing for quite a while so we're
hoping that that might come true rumor
also has been white see two sides of the
phone a 4.7 even as big as a 5.5
hopefully with a pretty baller almost
indestructible sapphire screen we take a
