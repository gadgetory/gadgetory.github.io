TechnoBuffalo I recently went to New
York City for the YouTube partner summit
they invited about 150 of the YouTube
partners from around the New York City
area to YouTube headquarters in New York
City to talk about ways to make the
partners more successful so we heard
from people that work at YouTube we
heard from Michael Buckley from what the
buck on how he does it he's got about
800,000 subscribers and I want to bring
back some information and share it with
you in this video so let's get to it
okay so I've got a list here of about 15
things that you can do to help to
increase the visibility of your videos
in your channel to get more subscribers
and hopefully become a partner and if
you're already a partner to increase
your revenue by getting more views and
more quality people on your channel
looking at your videos and some of the
stuff John Breton sure has talked about
in his advice videos but I think a lot
of it is new and coming from the source
YouTube I think it has a lot of
authority so let's get started first I'm
going to talk about things that anyone
can do and then I'm going to break it
down I'm going to talk about people that
are just starting off maybe don't have
partner status yet 50 100 200
subscribers so let's get started the
first thing that I want to emphasize
that X they actually emphasized a lot is
make your descriptions as long and
detailed and keyword rich as possible
you see it all the time people spend you
know two three four hours making an
awesome video but they spend 2-3 minutes
working on their title description and
tags really make your description as
full of content as possible you can do
6,000 characters they're really go to
the very end of that if possible
describe the content of your video in
detail and the reason for this is
because the YouTube algorithm which
determines how a video ranks and the
youtube search cannot watch your video
it just reads your description it reads
the title it considers a lot of other
mysterious things such as videos linking
in how many people are embedding but the
biggest thing that you can control apart
from the video itself is the distri
in the title and the tag so really work
on those make them as as detailed as
possible
number two thing that I learned is at
the end of every video that you do there
should be an annotation linked to
another video people get to the end of
the end of your videos and if they liked
it
they stay to the end they probably would
benefit from seeing more of your stuff
so put a link to a related video and you
could keep people longer on your channel
increase the chances that they're going
to subscribe and see more of your videos
another thing that I heard a lot is that
in every video make a call to action
make your videos interactive you'll see
that the best channels out there have
interaction between the person behind
the camera and all of the viewers so ask
for comments ask for a thumbs up ask for
them to subscribe ask for a video
response ask for something from your
audience so that you have that
interaction going on and also it's not
enough to just ask for it you have to
respond to it so in another video F
after you asked for video responses
maybe feature or one of those video
responses or feature a comment or two or
three that you found particularly
interesting another thing that they
talked a lot about the YouTube team in
this situation is YouTube insight you
can actually see a lot about your videos
who's watching it how old people are
where they're coming from how they got
to your videos really spend some time
looking at the statistics and the data
behind your videos to better tailor your
content to who is watching your stuff
also if you see that a particular blog
is linking to your videos a lot reach
out to that blog say thanks estimate
there's any way you can collaborate just
try to be creative with YouTube's
insight another thing that they talked a
lot about is using the playlist feature
you can actually link together a variety
of your videos so that if somebody's
watching a video that you made in the
sidebar they will see all of the other
videos in the playlist it makes it very
easy for someone to say okay I want to
know everything there is to know about
the new MacBook Pro it looks like this
person has four videos I see it in the
playlist I'm going to watch them all so
really take advantage of playlists you
can even include them on your channel
page and have them featured in a certain
order another thing that they talk a lot
about doing is make
your trap your channel look professional
customize it if you're a partner you
have a lot of choices and how to
customize it
YouTube is always adding new graphic
formats that you can add to your channel
to make it look more professional so go
into your branding options if you're a
partner really change the graphics and
try to make it look nice if you're not a
partner you can still do a lot in terms
of customizing the color and the overall
look and feel the placement of the
different modules there are even ways to
add modules you can have links to your
Twitter links to other channels and by
the way if you link to other channels
message them and say hey I'm linking to
your channel
why don't you link to mine we can kind
of feed off of each other's audiences
and trade viewers one tip I heard in
particular from Mike Michael Buckley
from what the buck is that see what is
sticking on YouTube search around find
the channels with the most views the
most subscribers find the videos with
the most thumbs up the most comments
trying to figure out what about this
video is so big what is making people
staying to watch this video what is
making people really like watching this
person and try to understand that and
apply that to your own channel and now
I've got a bunch of things for people
that are just starting off like I said
maybe a 50 100 150 subscribers you want
to get that YouTube Partner status so
that you can earn a little bit of money
off of the work you do and maybe have
the chance of making a lot of money if
you have you know 100 200 500 thousand
subscribers in the future a few tips for
you
number one is length keep your videos
short in the beginning first impressions
are very important if you're in a video
and it rambles on for 20 minutes people
aren't going to watch it unless of
course it's extremely interesting but
chances are if you're starting off your
new edit try to stay concise under 5
minutes is the recommendation that I
heard from some of the the bigger
YouTube users and and I certainly agree
with that once you get a little bit
bigger and your audience gets to know
you a little bit then you can go a
little bit longer become a little bit
more detailed once you start to
understand them another thing that I
would recommend for new youtubers is to
do collaboration find someone that has
similar channel to you and say hey why
don't we feature my video on your
channel in your video on my channel and
that way we can sort of trade traffic
that's a big way to get subscribers and
to build your user base another thing
that is highly recommended is to take
time to respond to the comments that
people leave under your videos obviously
if you have 10,000 comments it's going
to be very difficult to do that but if
you've got 10 15 20 comments why not
take the time see what your viewers are
saying and genuinely participate in the
discussion it really helps a lot to help
people feel connected with you and
something you should do another thing
that you can do to grow subscribers is a
subscriber drive you can have some sort
of contest where you're giving away
maybe a new iPod or something like that
in an effort to get people to your
channel to get involved and to get them
to subscribe to the work that you do and
finally a tip across the board whether
you are new at this or you've been doing
it for a while stay consistent if you do
a video every day stay with doing a
video every day if it's every other day
just stick with it don't leave your
channel for two months and come back and
expect for it to grow because it really
takes a lot of nurturing a ton of hard
work these YouTube partners that had
800,000 a million subscribers in the
panel worked so hard for so long to get
where they are and they can't stop
working because it just takes a
tremendous amount of effort to keep the
momentum in their channel so hard work
will really pay off and really help you
a lot I hope this video was very helpful
if you want to check out some of my
videos I'll put a link up to the pocket
now video YouTube channel right here and
that's it for now if you have any
specific questions please leave a
comment I'll try to answer as many as I
possibly can that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
