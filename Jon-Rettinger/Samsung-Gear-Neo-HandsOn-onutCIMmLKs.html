technobuffalo I'm here in Barcelona
Spain checking out the galaxy gear new
or just the gear neo looking around it's
really similar to the original Galaxy
gear but thinner a lot lighter it's
really like plastic feeling and if you
see that glowing light on the back
that's actually a heart rate monitor
that's built into it so it's sort of
like a fitness device in addition to a
SmartWatch and sort of the focus with
this one is delivering the same kind of
features that you had on the Galaxy gear
and in addition to the galaxy gear to go
without the camera so while that looks
like a camera up top it is not we'll go
through some of the settings should show
you wallpapers so Samsung is putting a
big focus on the customization and
design of this one so you can really
swap out the band's it's just a 22
millimeter band you can pop it off
pretty simply on the back there and then
suited to home background set and suit
to fit your taste so there we have that
need one and of course I'm tapping this
home button here it's a pushy button
another one of the big features that
Samsung did this time around to is try
to expand the battery life so it should
be like two to three days but they say
up to five if you're using it lightly
otherwise you have the pedometer built
in and there's also four gigs of storage
so if you want to install music you're
rather load music and work out you can
do that as well using a Bluetooth
headset so let's see if we can find that
so you have the full media controller
right there so you can go through your
music I don't think there's nothing
loaded on here but we'll see
when doesn't appear to be loaded really
let's go through some of the other
options here abbs so there's more than
100 apps that are going to happen pardon
the lab guys there's more than 100 apps
that are launching with the device it
doesn't look like there's much on here
right now aside from the default ones
that you see there so you can get a
gallery look through the wallpapers so
without the camera you're not going to
be shooting your own any case quick look
at the galaxy neo or the gear neo rather
