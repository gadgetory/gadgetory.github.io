forget the pro market behind me we are
seeing that in fact they are trying to
live up to that promise this is the new
space gray I'm Mac Pro and you know it's
Pro because it's a all new color I will
say it looks really good this thing
packed in insane amount of power and
that familiar all-in-one form factor it
looks exactly the same as the old iMac I
said from the power that been it so
there's a lot of power you can get in
this thing we don't know the full price
thing it's going to start at about 5,000
bucks it's available in December it'll
shift it's a base version with the eight
core xenon processor it will be a 10
core even an 18 core available GPU has
always been area or apples maybe a
little bit behind they're hoping to
change that here the Radeon Vega
graphics are going to be available up to
16 gigs of DRAM 211 teraflops into a
precision 22 teraflops of hash precision
up to 128 gigabytes ECC memory which is
crazy
even crazier is for scary bytes of SSD
storage kind of pork tear as well as for
Thunderbolt 3 ports there's first time
they've ever shipped 10 bit gigabit
ethernet the FaceTime cameras also
improve now is 1080p new accessories are
also along for the ride here you've got
a space grey keyboard it's now Wireless
we got a number pad there Apple figured
out how to do that there's also a new
Magic Mouse to go along with it you
don't know that much else about it right
now other than its going to come
sometime in December and going to start
for just under $5,000 but give Apple
credit for showing something that's
coming soon they show this addition to
the home pod as sort of new product
lines that are coming so all of that of
course coupled with the 5k display on
the iMac you've got them two makings of
a pretty powerful computer whether it's
going to be for for gaming of course now
you can attach external GPUs when high
sierra hits or for video editing like
where you probably going to use it for
there's a lot of power in that familiar
form factor and it's got a new color but
is it enough to win you back from your
video editors to come back from the PC
and Premiere Pro to get back into the
Final Cut frame we're going to use this
with the Premiere Pro or another editing
software it's cool you can use for
gaming if you load up some boot camp and
get some games on one of your thoughts
on it
leave it down below fikriye color does
look really good in person so next time
