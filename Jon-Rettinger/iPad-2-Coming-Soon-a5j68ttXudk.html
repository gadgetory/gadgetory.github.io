technobuffalo here and it's time to talk
about updates to the tablet that started
the craze the iPad let's go ahead and
get started generally Apple products
particularly the mobile products are on
a year refresh cycle we see update to
the iphone every year the ipod line
every year i would assume that the ipad
will be no exception however being a
first generation device we don't really
have any data to pull from we know it
launched in april so we expect something
to become out before april however
rumors are starting to get louder and
louder a lotta that we may see the first
refresh to the ipad somewhere around
january-february of 2011 usually
predicting updates Apple products would
be quite difficult however predicting
what we're going to see an ipad 2 is
actually going to be quite easy here's
what I think we're going to be seeing
for the update to the ipad 2 which i do
think we will have out right after the
holiday season probably around january
first cameras we're going to have a
front facing camera for video chat and a
back facing camera for video and
pictures capable of recording 720p video
and a VGA resolution camera on the front
similar what we see on the ipod touch
and the iphone 4 that is a no brainer
the tablet is a natural extension for
the facetime video chat application i
think it's going to be a really useful
feature actually would add some business
use as well you know from conference
room to conference room or office to
office if you have located across the
country going across the world people
are starting to use their ipads for
business it would be really nice to be
able to talk interact with people and
even from a non business standpoint to
talk to interact with friends a very
large scale retina display the display
on the iphone 4 and the ipod touch or
extremely high-resolution i think good
only stands to reason that we were going
to see that same display transplanted to
a larger scale on the ipad i think we
didn't see it launched from a price
standpoint it would have been too
expensive to put in a new product
however we've had a year to server see
the prices come down and hopefully
economies of scale play in and
we'll see a reduced price for those
displays which will translate to much
higher resolution iPad displays awesome
I don't think we're going to see any
sort of gigabyte bump think we're going
to see the same 16 32 and 64
configuration I think the prices are
going to stay the same the big question
is whether or not we're going to see an
ipad on verizon and i don't think that
there's that much of an interest or
really that big a desire to have an ipad
on another network it's not using it for
voice calls so now for about drop calls
or anything like that AT&amp;amp;T is evdo to 18
tease rather hsdpa network is relatively
quick and robust and actually in speed
test is generally the fastest mobile
network around when it comes to sheer
data so while we may see a verizon ipad
and it could be more a harbinger of a
verizon iphone coming so i don't expect
that we're going to see any sort of
cross carrier I padding to my stick with
18 t so for all you big red fans out
there hoping for a verizon iPad your
hopes are probably going to be dashed
will we see a change in the design and
the look of the iPad I don't think we
will the ipad really falls in life what
we've seen with apples design standards
looks very similar to the iphone 4
however different to the new generation
ipod touch which i'm sort of a shinier
back think on a display this big having
a shiny wrap and make you even more of a
fingerprint magnet than it already is so
I think these updates the ipad are going
to be very minor we may see a improved
new and updated a4 chip the a4 chip
first debuted in the first generation
ipad so you've had a year now maybe
we'll see a 1.4 or 1.2 gigahertz a4 chip
which may also be a sign of what we can
expect in the next generation iphone
iphone 5 and perhaps a next generation
ipod touch as well i'll probably see a
bit of a ram boost as well so just a
general speed increase some cameras and
better display some more of an
evolutionary than a revolutionary update
but certainly a welcome one on the west
so what do you guys think do you agree
disagree do you expect to see a new iPad
before April I certainly do am I missing
a future
wish the ipad would have I would love to
hear from you've already seen the
offering system it's probably going to
launch with iOS 4.2 although we maybe
we'll see a sneak preview of some sort
of weird iOS 5 or iPad specific iOS who
knows I don't think that we will
personally anyway guys I am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo I want to
hear your thoughts and i'll see you in
the next video bye bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
