technobuffalo here in III began with a
bang this afternoon with Microsoft
taking the stage and giving their
keynote so easy they don't know what III
is and CU latronic entertainment expo
which is really just the biggest video
game conference of the year where the
major manufacturers game makers show off
their newest stuff let me go ahead and
get started you see we look down because
I got some notes in front of me I'm not
sure to go in reverse order to all the
big stuff came at the end and the
biggest news at microsoft announced was
a new xbox 360 it's not Xbox 460 or
whatever it is is on a new Xbox that's a
new design for the xbox I think of it
similar to what Sony did it to
playstation 2 the place you can swim so
what you're going to get here is a
pretty new sweet looking package a slim
down smaller quieter you're going to get
a 250 gigabyte hard drive and finally
going to get Wi-Fi build date in the
form of 802 11 n which is always nice
it's going to be actually shipping today
it'll be available in retailers probably
starting tomorrow and the price is
saying exactly the same at 299 which is
really nice and it's kind of cool and
with shipping today Microsoft actually
gave out a new xbox console to everybody
in attendance which is you know always
quite nice let's go ahead and now work
backwards from the big announcement of a
new Xbox this thing does look very slick
and of course it's going to become fully
compatible with project natal which has
been renamed to Microsoft Connect which
will certainly talked plenty about over
the next few minutes so let's get
started the conference began with a call
of duty black ops preview which is going
to be coming on the 9th of November the
game looks awesome the graphics look
sick people crawling through the ground
doing some black ops toughie can't get
my hands on it the game just looks
really great they also announced it
doesn't even a new multi-year agreement
with Xbox so all Call of Duty add-ons
and downloadable content will be on the
Xbox first so if you're a PlayStation
owner I'm gonna have to wait a little
while to get your hands and all
lets up it's going to be coming first
and sometimes exclusively just to the
xbox so as you mentioned earlier connect
project and tall which is the controller
lists motion sensor so really your hands
are like controlling your bodies of
controller has been renamed to connect
with AK and they'll be available this
holiday season we'll talk about that a
little bit later so the next thing that
they've brought up they brought out
Hideo Kojima who is the head of the
metal gear solid team and they showed
sort of them trailer and talked about
some new Metal Gear games particularly
metal gear solid rising which looked
awesome the next guys are brought out
were the folks that were behind gears of
war and they show it a trailer and
actually live gameplay from gears of war
3 they actually played the game live on
its agent does look awesome the graphics
look unbelievable the next folks that
came out were the guys from fable three
if you guys played the first favorite or
second Babel you know what it isn't sort
of like a almost like a Zelda adventure
type game it'll be shipping on October
26 and it takes place five decades after
the events of fable 2 so if you played
it you'll know right where to come in
the next day and they show there was a
golden age kingdom these are all
exclusive games by the way to to the
Xbox on the next day and they show which
everybody is super excited about is halo
reach the X tripping September other
graphics did not look actually very
impressive for halo reach but the
gameplay looked fantastic so if you've
been looking to sort of get your hands
on your halo game september's going to
be your day I'm very excited I'm a big
halo fan uh so they can they get over
some xbox live stuff they share a 25
million members expecting to to be much
much much more and now they started
talking about how connect is going to
work with Xbox Live this is actually
really cool so connect is sort of just
like a camera attachment that will be
compatible with any Xbox weather was the
first xbox came out on launch day or
these new fangled designed Xbox it'll
work with it not a problem it's a camera
has a motion-sensing built-in so
actually you can now interact with xbox
live without ever having to use a
controller so if you want to watch a
movie pretty much just say Xbox movie
and as soon as you take xbox will know
that you're using to connect software
and I pull ups or this connect hub
interact using your hands and use all
the panels
what you want click it sort of like
minority report style feel very weird
they were looking like waving their
hands around and point to get stuff but
I think about if you're watching a movie
you're downloading something and you
want to just play it yellow you say is
xbox play xbox stop so you actually have
to start through the ground to remote or
controller and forgetting which bud stop
or play it is now completely done
without wires and without any physical
hardware other than the kinect box which
is really kind of neat i couldn't help
but think it looked a little gimmicky
but i'm going to hold judgement to
actually get a chance to see it xbox
live is also going to be part of Windows
Phone 7 but we pretty much knew that as
well and they brought out sir six new
Kinect experience games that call them
think of it as sort of the the we
equivalent for Kinect so what they are
first one is well connected which is
sort of a way to play with animals and
serve you could pet them you can move
them around you can tell him to dance
some girl came out and playing with the
tiger named skittles you know sort of
stuff we animals type game the next one
was Kinect Sports sort of again go right
back to the wee it's sort of their wii
sports version there was basketball and
you can play boxing or you can fight
somebody in boxing rather ping pong
tenants that kind of stuff the next is
connected joyride essentially is a kart
racing game with your you know go like
this to like you're looking at how it
looks like on video I actually kind like
you're holding extry will and you can
drive race and do flip stuff the next
thing was that kinect adventures which
is sort of like a Indiana Jones esque
style game where you sort of go through
and do certain adventures and when the
cool features they had in that was
actually takes pictures of a while
you're playing I so you can email them
to your friend uploading to facebook can
you see how stupid you look when you're
plenty of game with no controllers I
like you recommended for playing any of
these kinect games close the blinds
because the neighbors gonna be looking
at you funny so the next game they
announced was something called a your
shape from Ubisoft sort of a get in
shape tight game scanned your whole body
knows where you are you can sort of work
out with friends or work out on your own
in the privacy of your living room and
the last one was dance central from
harmonix and there's a dance game which
is sort of weird
controllers your buttons but they give
you moves on the screen you got to mimic
those moves and put them all together to
advance I'm not even going to try and
show you how that works because I cannot
dance something to keep in mind okay so
the next thing they announced it and I'm
really excited better the sports guy
obviously my youtube name is John for
lakers is ESPN on 360 I now be able to
watch over 3500 live games in the first
year which is awesome I can actually
pick who you're rooting for the game is
going on and give you served exclusive
content for that team so if you're
watching the lakers celtics i can just
say Xbox root for the lakers i'll start
getting all this lakers content i can
actually access espn.com and get all the
information while I'm watching the game
and get video highlights will serve do a
split screen deal it spin neat i'll give
you live polls that go on during the
game you can vote you can sort of keep
the fans interacted this is going to
come at no additional cost if you have
an xbox live gold membership you're
going to be good to go so the next sort
of thing to talk about is going to be
well what is connect watching it's going
to be launching November forth in North
America it's going to have about 15
launch titles I didn't give a price but
it's expected to be about one hundred
and fifty dollars something to be a
little bit expensive a next thing they
show the sort of thing everybody's been
waiting for it was a star wars game from
lucasarts worth didn't say when it's
coming other than 2011 but you actually
you don't come hold your hands like this
and you wield a lightsaber I got the
pictures I'll show you and it just
looked awesome then they went on to
announce a new xbox console which will
be shipping tomorrow very very cool one
something I'm really excited about so I
don't know what you guys think very
excited about any of the stuff to
microsoft announced the new xbox be
connect I can't shake but the thought I
think I'm gonna look so silly dance
around my living room playing games all
the kinect titles that showed sort of
look almost like kid games you know and
it showed call of duty or halo reach
here using actual controller I couldn't
imagine you know looking like I'm a
James Bond making my gun out of my hands
to shoot and you know got my grenade
launcher and stuff and shooting it but
I'm sure we'll see that sub come
eventually but for right now it looks
like the kinect tells are more fringe
almost party oriented or kid-oriented
titles but again I'm going to reserve
judgment so I get a chance to see it so
what do you guys think about getting
sit very curious to hear anyway i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i'll
see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
