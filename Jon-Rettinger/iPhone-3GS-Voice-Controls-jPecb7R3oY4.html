injure here and I want to give you a
demonstration of voice control for the
iPhone 3GS Apple putting this in the 3GS
I see is more of a necessity and less of
a luxury the iPhone 3G and the phone
that preceded it the original iPhone
lacked voice controls so when you are
dialing a phone phone number when you're
in the car you got an unlock your device
go to your phone look in your contacts
or go to your favorites it was a quite a
few step to get to your phone although
while you're taking your attention away
from the road regardless of whether
you're using a Bluetooth headset or
speaker stopple putting voice control
into this was absolutely fantastic and
one of the cool things about voice
control is that you can access it when
the phone is locked so let me give you a
demonstration here let's say the phone
is locked in my pocket or in my hand I
can hold this down if I've looked his
headset on it'll work as well hold down
the home button and there it goes and
activates you can see all the commands
you can say is scrolling across you can
see it's a shuffle call next track dial
what group is this song by play album
I'll give you a demonstration of some of
these features but I wanted to show you
what the interface looked like so they
go and hit cancel and I will make a
phone call call my house so we'll hold
down the button call home and you get
that little electronic woman's voice
saying call home and there it goes it
starts calling the house so let me hang
that up no need to call my house and
let's go back to a voice command so
let's say that you've got a whole bunch
of playlists on your iphone they're
using as an iPod and you want to pick a
song or a band from there I'm a big
Green Day fan so let's say I want to
play some Green Day so I've got a Green
Day play lesson here that's I'll hold
down the home button play Green Day
and there goes it starts playing Green
Day hit the iPod you can see it's now
playing I'll pause it playing 21st
Century Breakdown let's say I don't want
to hear the song know your enemy I want
to go to the next song in my playlist
hold down the home button next song yes
yes how do you get closer to it so I had
turned off these let me hold this down
again next song and you'll notice that
while I was in closet that when I held
down the button it actually reduced the
volume of the music let me access voice
control which is actually very neat let
me show you some other features so we
have play again shuffle and it'll start
now shuffling every song we're just kind
of neat let me show you something else
let's say you hear a song and you wonder
who it's by
who is this song by pretty cool huh and
there are really just a ton really are a
ton of features that you can access and
you can use the built-in headphones that
come with the iPod or the iPhone rather
to use all these features it really is
very mean very handy and Apple took you
one step further from just simple
dialing I can say let's say I want to
shut down the iPod air and I want to
make a phone call to a number not in my
phone book so hold this down dial five
five five five five five five
and it's actually really accurate the
woman's voice that comes over it comes
through the speaker is a little bit low
but it's amazingly accurate how good
this is
so it's quite impressive I think overall
Apple did a really nice job
this technology is though nothing new
it's been around for quite a while it's
been in Windows mobile phones for years
blackbirds for years it was nice to see
Apple finally catch up with some
features that should have been included
with the initial iPhone so if you enjoy
this is just a short demonstration of
the voice control for the iPhone 3GS
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
sure to follow me on twitter twitter.com
slash jon for Lakers I'll see you the
next video
