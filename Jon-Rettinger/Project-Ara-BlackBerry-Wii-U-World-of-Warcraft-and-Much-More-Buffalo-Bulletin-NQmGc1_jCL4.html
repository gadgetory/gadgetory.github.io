dev conference BlackBerry's 2014 plans a
wii u milestone in japan Blizzard
explains the price for level boosting
and Disney movies anywhere launches for
iOS buffalo bulls in time hello internet
and welcome to the buffalo bullet and if
you're interested in reading more about
any story on the show check the
description below for links or click on
the graphics if you have annotations
available and toggled on I'm ashley
Esqueda here your top stories we already
know that are the motorola project
featuring modular smartphone builds will
continue to be a Google property after
the motorola sale to lenovo now the head
of ara paul eremenko posted on google+
that the very first ara developer
conference will be held this april the
entire event will be streamed online so
you don't have to book a plane ticket or
a hotel and some of the live stream will
include an interactive QA for developers
and other folks interested in RS future
this could be the next big smartphone
innovation so we definitely suggest
checking it out blackberry also in the
news this week with CEO john chen laying
out some of the company's plans for 2014
they already announced the
budget-friendly BlackBerry's III and the
q 20 but chen also noted blackberry
plans to release a flagship device
sometime this year he also mentioned a
desire to lock down BlackBerry's most
faithful customers and then get major
carriers to offer the Q 20 he also
mentioned blackberry failed to educate
customers on what bb10 could offer them
and hope to rectify that this year as
well as give all blackberry owners a
better out-of-the-box experience over in
gaming a ray of hope for the beleaguered
Wii U at least in Japan this week the
wii u finally topped the xbox 360's
lifetime sales in the country over 1.6
million we use have been sold which is
an okay number but then you compare it
to the PlayStation 3 at almost 10
million units sold the Vita with around
two and a half million units sold and
even the PlayStation 4's recent launch
weekend barely beating the wii u's
opening weekend by about 15,000 units
and you realize nintendo still got a
long way to go then again antenna is
still royalty in japan crossing 15
million 3ds units this month so i guess
they're doing
a but not great in console also in
gaming world of warcraft recently
announced a plan to offer instant level
boost to 90 at a cost of 60 bucks a
character if you buy the new expansion
warlords of draenor you get one insta
boost to 94 one character and blizzards
lead and counter designer explained that
they chose to offer additional boost to
90 so that people wouldn't have to
purchase the expansion over and over
again for those additional boosts the
price tag is a little bit steep
obviously but he also explained they
didn't want to devalue the process of
leveling which makes a little bit more
sense and our wild card story for today
comes from Disney who recently launched
Disney movies anywhere for iOS the app
and integration with iTunes looks to
solve problems like missing out on bonus
features when you buy films from digital
storefronts and not picking up disney
movie rewards points for digital
purchases the app links directly to your
iTunes account so if you buy a disney
pixar or marvel film it will appear in
both your itunes and disney movies
libraries i'm sure we'll see Lucasfilm
included in that project and in that app
in the future but it's definitely worth
checking out now if you're on iOS that's
a buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show a thumbs up would be
super awesome of you and if you want
