world galaxy note 7 just do not many
surprises there we pretty much knew
everything about the phone our hands on
video went up and there's been a ton of
questions in the comments in fact there
were nine questions that I saw more than
any other thought I'd answer each one
for you so this is kind of things you
want to know about the galaxy note 7 the
first question was surprising is there a
fingerprint reader yes absolutely
there's a fingerprint sensor just like
the last generation note just like the
galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge it's there
you can use it use it and couldn't jump
kid with the iris scanner or you can
choose to not used at all but it's there
and it works just like previous
generation fingerprint sensors have on
samsung devices does the iris scanner
work with glasses samsung claims yes and
demonstrations that we saw hands on the
answer is also yes other things to know
it will work in low light if you guys
ever used windows hello it works very
much the same way as long as I can see
your eyes you are good and should also
work with contacts next one was how fast
is the unlock process using the iris
scanner in our hands on it was crazy
fast in fact we had almost not look at
the top of the device to see what's on
our lock screen because it unlocked so
fast so really quick hey John don't you
mean galaxy note 6 no they skipped 6 and
went right to galaxy note 7 samsung
claims because this device is very
similar to the galaxy s7 line of devices
they want to the numbers to be the same
I guess that makes sense be kind of
weird to have the galaxy note 6 and then
the galaxy s7 but they've had that in
previous generation phone so I guess
they decided enough is enough numbers
are gonna match up now where the key
differences between the galaxy note 7
and the galaxy s7 edge the galaxy note 7
actually has a smaller battery yes it is
smaller at 35 hundred million Bowers
instead of 30 600 million powers in the
galaxy s7 edge but the notes that are
obviously getting the s pen and the base
model is going to start at 64 gigs as
opposed to 32 and the galaxy s7 edge but
there's the same four gigs of RAM there
which you hope is going to be in
up to keep things humming along with
Samsung's sometimes less than optimal
memory management yeah what about the
cameras the camera the same as a galaxy
s7 the Galaxy s7 edge the answer there
is kind of yes and no the hardware is
the same we're getting the same 12
megapixel camera on the back and a
pretty nice 5 megapixel selfie camera up
front the software you I though it's a
bit different you can swap between them
the quick swipe at the screen or access
other options that have just just polka
net icons with your finger Silas I liked
it better in the brief hands-on that we
had with the galaxy note 7 so Europe
didn't get the galaxy note 5 least
initially until Samsung did a whole 180
s you're up going to get the galaxy note
7 yes Samsung quit early made a mistake
there cuz the galaxy note 7 have an IR
blaster yes but not in the way you're
thinking can't use it to control your TV
or anything actually the iris scanner
has infrared built-in but only for your
eyes so if you're thinking about using
your note 7 to control stuff fortunately
that are the IR blaster built-in it's
not gonna do that for you there's a
galaxy s7 have removable battery nope so
those are the nine things that I saw
more than anything in the comments of
our note 7 hands on video but is
anything else that you want to know
leave it the comments here and if you
like the style of video we kind of
answer what you guys are asking if the
video a thumbs up to let us know we'll
do more of these in the future see as
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
