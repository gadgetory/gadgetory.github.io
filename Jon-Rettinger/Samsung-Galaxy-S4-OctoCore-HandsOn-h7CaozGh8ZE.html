technobuffalo here and today we've got a
very special guest this is the octa-core
version the samsung galaxy s4 we've had
the carrier version in for a little
while but we didn't get through an
unboxing because it didn't come in a box
so this is the samsung galaxy s4 it's
the GTI 9500 in case you are keeping
track at home a lot of good stuff here
inside of this sort of fake wood looking
box let's go ahead and open it up the
first let me thank our friends at negri
electronics preakness up with this guy
they've got all the samsung galaxy s4
variants whether or not you want
unlocked quad core carrier versions
whatever it is they've got you covered
for the galaxy s4 and really every
unlock device a link down below to go
check them out alright so let's take a
look around the box looks like wood kind
of feels like wood but it's just paper
around here on the back is kind of
interesting until looks to be in French
when mentions processor there are two
quad-core processors here at different
clock speeds so one is a 1.6 agree hurts
quad-core one is a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core so combine those together you
get all 8 cores of kind of interesting a
no support though for Elfi on this guy
abid you have hspa+ so go ahead and cut
the little paper seal here and open it
up here is the samsung galaxy s4 looking
very similar to sprint version we took a
look at earlier pushed off the side for
just a quick moment see what else we're
gonna have in the box we've got a
handbook in the box we've got your
charging and sync cable got your wall
work which is a little bit on a larger
side we've got the battery which is the
same size the carrier version it's 2600
milliamp hours then we've got a pair of
headphones with mic built into them
let's go ahead and peel off the plastic
that's always some of the most
satisfying whooshing noise that we get a
new phone so the battery is fully
removable pull off the back there we go
more stickers it's that same plastic
back that we saw on the carrier galaxy
s4 very similar to the galaxy s3 so go
and pop in the
battery go to Settings show you that it
is indeed running Android 4.2 this is a
new set up here it's got connections my
device account and more android 4.2
point2 on there so I give Samsung credit
for getting that guy shipping so from
dimension standpoint same as the carrier
version 5.3 8 inches x 2.75 by a very
thin at point three one and weighs 4.5
nine ounces the big story here though is
the screen it's a full 5-inch 1080p
display with a 441 ppi and two super
amoled plus 13 megapixel camera on the
back chew on the front and again that's
the same from the carrier version there
are some sort of metal esque accents
here on the s4 that word on the esterday
that make it feel very good to have now
they're still plastic we're definitely
makes the phone feel a little bit better
in the hand alright so we've got the
octa-core awesomeness in my right hand
we got the carrier quad-core version of
my left I'm curious what the quadrant
scores are gonna be on each haven't
tested full quadrant score yet either
these side I've got no idea what it's
going to be but let's have some fun and
see what the scores come back end I know
quadrants not the most clinical accurate
way to test performance but what I use
in all of my benchmarks LASIK it is a
pretty interesting score so let these
guys run and just see what happens and
again you can see differencing both
phones really not much on the carrier
version you've got some galaxy s4
branding down below you don't have any
sort of branding here on the octave or
version kind of interesting we did a
reset on each and i will say that the
octa-core version booted up much quicker
than the quad core version but again
this didn't have to go through the
Sprint splash screen we got again octa
core quad core again this might have
just used one of the quad core chips we
got a score of 12,000 858 we've got a
score of 12 thousand six hundred and
seven so not make a difference as I
thought I would both these guys so yes
bear that in mind again we'll do full
comparisons of each of these and put
them head-to-head against some of the
big phones out now the iphone 5c know
everything holds up for now i am john
registry technobuffalo please give this
video a thumbs up we most definitely
appreciate it checks I'm technobuffalo
calm for all the galaxy s4 news I'll see
you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
