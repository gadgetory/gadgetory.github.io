you're here and I've got a fun unboxing
for you as you can see it's the irobot
roomba 560 and this little disc is
actually a vacuum cleaning robot I'm not
gonna lie I don't back it off then it's
not that I'm lazy generally just that I
forget to vacuum the day gets busy you
know I clean my kitchen I'm generally a
pretty clean guy but I do forget to
vacuum and I have a cattle introduce you
guys to at the end of this video and she
sheds like nobody's business
so the cat hair tends to stack up until
I look around and realize I need to
remember to vacuum so as iRobot Roomba
I'm hoping will be a really nice
solution for that
you little said it's automatically
vacuum at any time you want
it'll vacuum carpet and hard floors and
it can do up to four rooms on one single
charge and then it'll roll its little
way back to the charger and charge
itself so I'm really excited to see if
this thing works as advertised and
hopefully have the cleanest carpet and
floors and also all my complex so let's
go ahead and get to the unboxing here
let's see what we got first thing it
says iRobot Roomba on the front vacuum
cleaning robot 5th generation I had a I
think a first generation Roomba a while
back and I'm hoping that the technology
has improved since then this is a 560
and overrun you 380 bucks from iRobot
comm I'll put a link in the sidebar
because you want to learn more about the
iRobot Roomba 560 so it'll clean four
rooms on a single charge got a
scheduling system so you can set it to
clean when it's most convenient so you
can set it to clean while you're at work
and I just let it do its thing
the cool thing it's about a self
charging home bit so it'll just come
right back and charge itself and it
comes with two virtual wolves which will
confine it from the finds our guys it
from room to room so if you want to keep
it in a certain area or send it up to
another room it will do that for you so
we've got a picture of it on the front
on the side just says vacuum cleaning
robot picture of the Roomba and looks
like it's the same thing
the other side so let's go ahead and dig
it out this is a new unit or a refurb
but let's check it out
either way I just hope that it works and
works as advertised so I'll use the
obligatory big ol knife to open this
thing up and I know if you guys can see
but peeking in here to see what's going
to be cleaning up her fur is my cat who
just ran off I'll show you her just a
second so let's go ahead and finish
opening this thing up there alright so
open the back side let's say this thing
is packed very tightly we'll open the
other side up there we go
thank you
here we go alright so we're going to cut
the tape there we go a little bit of
that tearing required to open one of
these big boxes so there is a massive
amount of styrofoam go ahead and slide
it out
a little harder to get out than it looks
it's more complicated than a phone
number thing I'll say that much there we
go all right so we got it out of the box
some cardboard
we've got some instructions or if you're
not a big structures guy but I probably
will take a look at these pull off the
styrofoam it doesn't look like this is a
brand new unit so that is nice let's see
what we have we've got the Roomba or
right here I'll take a look at that in
just a moment
here's that we have a filter as well
which is nice we have a red piece
another reason I applied look at the
directions got these two virtual walls
which are kind of neat and this must be
the power trick and the home charging
base so I will like I said I will use
this for a little while and do it for
you I'm really excited I might even do a
video showing you guys what if this
looks like an action piece might not be
familiar with it so let's take a look at
some other things that it says on the
box here scheduled a vacuum it's most
convenient whether you're at home or on
the go awesome
virtual wall lighthouses keep Roomba
cleaning in one room they've got it 10x
automatically returns to home base these
like Queens hard-to-reach places under
beds and around furniture side brushes
reach into corners along edges to remove
dust dirt and debris self-adjust from
carpets to hardwood floors
automatically I don't have hardwood
floors but I may someday now I got a
little robot to vacuum kind of neat just
as a tech guy I'm really excited to see
how this little robot works
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers and
stay tuned for more iRobot Roomba news
see you guys the next video bye bye okay
so this is Mercedes sheep along to my
old roommate about five years ago I
never had a cat before in my life and he
moved to Boston and told me they didn't
allow cats in Boston anywhere in the
city evidently and he asked if I would
watch her that was five years ago I
never had a cat before but my girl
friend and friends that come over are
allergic so I needed a vacuum that can
get all the hair up all the time and I
brush her three times a week and if you
look so that hair you probably hope you
can see that but still hair just comes
off or all the time so having a Roomba
that I can set to vacuum on a daily
basis while I'm I'm out is uh will be
quite a nice thing to have so this is
Mercedes say hello which is the reason
that I need a Roomba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
