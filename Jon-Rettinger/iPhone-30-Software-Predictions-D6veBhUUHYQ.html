mark 17 apples going to be unveiling
their iphone software version 3.2 stick
around then give you my prediction to
what you should be expecting so today's
a big day for Apple fans and iPhone
fanatics see what Apple has in store for
the third version of the iphone software
for it gets the software won't talk
about hard work for a moment let's do
the math software version 1 point 0 came
with the first generation iphone
software generation 2 point 0 came with
the second generation iphone the iphone
3g software generation three-point oh
i'll expect that to one becomes
available to be on new hardware which I
assume will come in June or July on
Tuesday Apple is just going to be
showing off what the software can do I
would expect that to show it on any new
version the iphone but does something to
keep in mind also i expect all iphone
3gs to be fully upgradeable to the new
software first-generation iPhones i
would expect apple to offer so let me
tell you what i'm expecting with this
new software so the first thing i would
expect is finally mms the ability to
send picture messages we always wait for
word for quite a while i personally have
to send picture messages via email it's
quite annoying i review a lot of cell
phones and a lot of phones come through
here the iphone is still my daily driver
so i'm looking forward to a lot of these
updates so mms one hundred percent i
would say for sure it's xuan the next
thing and the biggest knock on the
iphone from other operating systems has
been copy and paste the iphone does not
have any way to copy a pace and might
think it's not a big deal but as you use
the phone regularly use with more
professional reasons you need that you
need the ability to take text from one
area and bring it to another whether
it's copying a URL or copying a section
of a word document you need that ability
i expect apple to finally answer the
cries and put that into version 3.0 the
next thing the ability to tether so what
tether means is you share your internet
connection from your iPhone to your
computer so if you're traveling and
you're on your laptop you don't have any
internet but your iphone 3g is full bars
of 3g you can browse the web using your
iphone but don't expect that to come for
free i'll expect 18t to be charging a
premium for that and probably putting a
cap on data those you that of jailbroken
your iPhone's you're probably enjoying
tether make that any restrictions and
flows you that have next share which was
a tethering application that Apple
allowed in the app store probably 30
secs where they pulled it down you guys
don't have to worry something to keep in
mind the next thing I would expect is
much much much better file an app
management what apple released the first
generation iphone with the new user
interface or with the current user
interface rather i think they were
dissipating an app store and they're
anticipating just using web apps and
people downloading dozens on dozens of
apps like me for example scrolling from
page to page to page to page not the
most eloquent way of doing it and it
becomes very uh Napa like so I click
them to be a new sort of file management
and with that I expect some sort of
gooey which sends for graphical user
interface enhancements as well possibly
improved home screens when you have your
phone on the lock screen perhaps showing
some more information I'll expect that
to become as well so it makes plain what
I mean by that take out my iphone here
when the phone is locked all you see is
just the date and time that's it a lot
of empty space in middle better I put
the Apple to take advantage of that it
almost as a default home screen showing
an upcoming appointment possibly one or
two lines of text and email i only make
logical sense the next thing i'll expect
is easily to run background applications
that's something that people been
promising an apple has been promising
for a while a lot of other operating
systems have it so what that means let's
say you're using a i am application and
you want to go check your email we have
to close out a an application and open
up safari but this allow you to do is
actually just minimize AI n application
and they'll still look like it's closed
on your phone but i'll still be running
so you can still get i am
else you were doing while you're doing
other things it's a little
processor-intensive and certainly memory
intensive but the iphone has a
horsepower to handle things like that
that's something that really would make
it a more robust workhorse for the
business or the personal user so i would
i'm not expecting that but i was going
to be hopeful that it will be in there
now one other thing I'm expecting is a
new addition to the app store so I think
this would be able to premium
application so not the 99 three dollar
applications I'm talking 10 20 30 dollar
applications in a special section the
store just meant for that so thank more
premium games think better graphics
better quality developers are making
more money off of these are going to put
more time into him so that would be what
I would just expect to happen so guys
these are just my anticipations I don't
have any inside information
unfortunately but I have been following
trends with the iphone from day one so i
think i have a nice perspective to offer
my opinion so what are you vexing
anything else that you're expecting with
the iphone I don't expect anything of
hardware but maybe you guys are so leave
your comments down below and for
exclusive content be sure to follow me
on twitter twitter complex john for
lakers sure you stay tuned on tuesday
i'll be doing a recap video of what
Apple shows off see you guys next video
