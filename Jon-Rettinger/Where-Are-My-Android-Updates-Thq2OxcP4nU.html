to you by netflix what's going on
everyone welcome back to their episode
of renter's rinse the show where I rant
and rave and sometimes give advice on
anything in the world of technology
occasionally just a wee bit outside up
this week android 4.4 kitkat is coming
and your phone's probably not gonna get
it stop complaining going get started by
the time you watch this video android
4.4 kitkat might already be out and you
might look at your phone run into
settings scroll down to the bottom go to
a bal fall and be like oh only of
android 4.2 what's up Sam somehow give
me my update or HTC One agree my update
on my three year old phone I want the
latest and greatest on my old phone I
know that there can be a ton of people
complaining i think i should make the
game of thrones mean that says prepare
yourself android complaining coming you
are not going to get the update right
away let me just put that in giant neon
letters unless and there's a big unless
you have a Nexus device in which case
start downloading cuz you probably
already have it waiting for you have
when the google play editions the s4 HTC
one but if you have a skinned version of
android a sense or a TouchWiz or phone
that's more than a year olds don't hold
your breath cuz you're probably not
going to get it right away the best
advice I can give anyone when you buy an
android phone that's not a Nexus device
by one that you're happy with the way it
comes and assume nothing's gonna change
for two years otherwise you're gonna get
super mad and cranky and scream at
Samsung HTC LG however it might be that
why didn't my phone get the update
stupid Samsung I hate you i'm never
buying either samsung phone i didn't get
android 4.2 point2 like I promised
forever and it seems silly you're not
gonna get the software updates it just
not gonna happen i'm not saying it's
right i'm not saying it's wrong but it
ain't gonna happen for a software update
to get to a carrier phone so AT&amp;amp;T
verizon sprint to t-mobile not only does
google out to release the code but then
the manufacturer has to check the code
tweet the code customize a code to match
their skin and then the carrier has to
approve that code decide was not they
want to push it out and suck up their
own bandwidth and then push it out to
the devices that whole process takes out
really really long time HTC one's for
example just got android 4.3 like this
week so i would not expect 4.4 to
communist it's almost the same a couple
new features and it's not going to
happen it is just straight-up not gonna
happen I'm disappointed too it annoys me
that my phones don't get android 4.4
right away but again if you want the
latest and greatest just buy a nexus
phone the nexus 5 with friggin awesome
nexus 4 is pretty badass get the s4 get
the HTC One Google ditions you don't
don't worry about any of this anymore at
all that's my advice when you buy a
phone pick one that you're gonna like be
half wait for two years and don't
complain that your two-year-old or
through your old phone didn't get the
latest update right away cuz that's just
super unreasonable and if you live your
life being unreasonable you're just
gonna be sad panda all the time nobody
likes a sad panda let me take a minute
