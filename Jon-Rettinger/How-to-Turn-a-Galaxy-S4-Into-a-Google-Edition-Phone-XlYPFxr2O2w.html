TechnoBuffalo and today I'm going to
show you all how to root and install 4.3
Google Play edition on your Samsung
Galaxy s4 just so everybody knows this
is a rooting video so in case you have
any files that you want to have saved
make sure you save everything on your
desktop before you do this tutorial
because everything on your phone will
get erased this is also a very generic
version of how to root and install roms
on your device so you can do this on
other devices just try to follow along
with the tutorial and use different
files for your specific device this
tutorial however is going to be on the
i-95 0 5 model of the Samsung Galaxy s4
just so all of you know before you start
this is going to be a more generic
routing video as well as installing rom
so i'm going to be using the samsung
galaxy s4 I nine 5:05 model and when
you're using the Google Play 4.3 edition
of a ROM just to show everybody what it
looks like to install it on a device so
if you want to follow along into this
exact tutorial just make sure you have
these devices the i-95 0 5 model I'll
show you right now in the settings but
you can do this with other devices as
well you just have to find the right
files for your specific device so if I
scroll down here right there GTI 9 5 0 5
and I'm running for point two point two
this is the most updated version of the
Samsung Galaxy s4 so forgiver to the
computer now I have the links on the
Tecna Buffalo post that'll be on their
website just scroll down here you want
to download odin plus your custom root
file which is right here I believe it's
right here so if you have a different
device you don't have the Samsung Galaxy
S 4 if you have any other device that
you want to be able to route Odin is the
probably the best way to do it I just
like doing it this way because it makes
sense and it works very well so you want
to search for your your model number of
your phone plus odin and then route at
the end and you'll find the files that
you need but for this one you want to
download this and then go back over to
here you also want to get your custom
TWRP file which is a custom recovery
file and then you also want to download
your rom that you want to install so
after you download these three files and
these are their other areas to get it so
here's the TWRP file it's
two point six point zero point zero just
to make sure you guys have this and the
dot ta are you want to make sure it's
that and then over here is the Google
Play edition this is the ROM that you
can download this to the four point
three this version is the final version
2.2 I'm sure it's going to get updated
in the future just in case anybody is
trying to download this at a later date
now if you have a different phone and
you want down in a different ROM all you
have to do is search for your phone
model and ROM at the end of it and then
you can find 4.3 Edition or Google Play
edition or any other type of ROM they
want to download and once you get that
download it'll look just like this so
it'll be in this zip file right here
again this is just a very generic
version of a rooting video so this is
what it will look like for the ROM and
this is your Auto root folder and then
this is the TWRP file so once you get
all those downloaded all you have to do
is unzip this the auto route click on
extract to or extract here and then I'll
make a little folder right here open
this up and you want to right click on
add ndx II and click on run as
administrator' you just want to make
sure that a yellow box is showing up you
do want to have your device plugged in
as I do right here through USB if you
have a USB 3.0 try plugging it into USB
2.0 if it doesn't work right away
because sometimes the 3.0 slots don't
work and again if it doesn't download
all the drivers also just try a
different USB slot or a different USB
cable because USB sometimes as a pain in
the butt to get drivers installed so
once you see the yellow box that means
you're good to go you just want to go
back to your desktop click on my
computer make sure your phone shows up
right here double click on this and now
what I like to do is after you go into
the storage folder right here I click
here I make a new folder and call this
roms this way you can put all of your
roms all your data files into one folder
you can find later that I'll show you in
the video so I'm going to open up my
folder that I have all my other files in
right here and if you watched my
previous Galaxy Note 2 video this is
basically exactly the same tutorial I
just wanted to change a few files so
that you could see how to do it on like
other devices besides the note 2 or the
s4 here so right here is my is Maya ROM
I want to drag and drop this into my
roms folder on my phone and then just
let this transfer really quick and now
this will be you you'll be able to find
this later in the tutorials that you can
install
once you get rooted and once you get
twerp installed which stands for team
wind recovery project you can also
install a clockwork recovery I believe
it's called and you can use that as well
but I'd like using twerp just because it
looks better and you can do more things
with it so once you get that transferred
over that's basically all you need to do
with transferring files you can exit out
of your phone on my computer now you
want to go back into the folder right
here that you had the CF autoroute right
click on oh dang that exe again and
click on run as administrator and just
make sure that's still there then you
want to go over to your phone and put it
into download mode now the way they put
it into download mode is you restart the
phone you just hold in your power button
click restart and this will this might
be different on other phones but this is
for the galaxy s4 click OK and now as it
restarts I'm going to hold in the volume
down button the home button and then I'm
just going to power it on and you'll
hear a little noise right there and then
once it starts booting up like that
you'll see this screen and you can
there's no count on timer on this all
you have to do is hit volume up and this
will put it right in the download mode
right there all right now the next thing
you need to do is get your device rooted
so we're going to right click on add any
XE and click on run as administrator' in
just in case there was another yellow
bar another little box here you want to
exit out of that and just reopen it just
to make sure there's only one we're
gonna click on PDA and then you want to
go find the auto root folder that or the
auto root file that you had before the
download it's right here is the CF
autoroute whatever your device is this
is the folder click on this and then you
also want to make sure it is a dot md5
file that way you can that way it'll be
able to route using Odin so click on
this click on open and then once I hit
start you're going to see a blue bar
start to go across the screen and then
also in the messages file down here
you'll see a bunch of text and I'm just
going to hit start and you'll see it
right here and then let this completely
finish after this you'll probably see a
little red android guy
it'll just flash a bunch of files up the
screen just to show that it is being
rooted and then once this finishes if
you get a green pass right here that
means you're good to go right here you
can see there's a blue booting recovery
thing right up there let this boot into
it you see your little red android
pirate guy and he's a flash in the files
right now to make sure it's rooted and
once this finishes you want to also put
it right back into download mode so I'll
show you
how to do that right after this is done
okay so that finished and now once this
starts booting up you want to make sure
that it goes into download mode I'm just
going to grab the phone again put it in
click the volume down button and the
power button and the home button alright
so here we go I just turned the phone
off I'm going to power back on to put it
into download mode right here there we
go and we can hit volume up to put it
into download mode there you go
and now you want to flash it with TWRP
which will install the custom recovery
so I'm going to exit out of Odin once
again open it up just to make sure
everything is reset I'm going to click
after you get the yellow box there I'm
going to click on PDA go find the custom
torque file which is still in the same
folder right here open recovery TWRP 2.6
click on that and click on open and then
click on start and now once this
finishes you will actually have a custom
recovery on here as well as you'll be
routing this is really quick as well and
then once it starts rebooting you want
to actually boot into TWRP and the way
you do that is turn this off once again
so I'm going to holding the power button
just make sure it boots all the way off
this is a very quick version of it you
could boot into the home screen and do
all that stuff but this is a lot faster
so once this boots off I'm going to hold
in the volume up button and the home
button to boot into twerp's now I'm
going to turn this on and you should see
at the very top here a blue booting
recovery right up there at the very top
and just keep holding the home button
and the volume up button until it boots
fully into TWRP there you go you asleep
team win right there and it will boot
into torp and this is where you can see
the eight buttons right there so now to
get rid of the old files you want to go
into wipe and then go to advanced wipe
and click on dalvik cache system and
cache now this will erase all files on
your phone so make sure you guys have
backed up your phone at the very
beginning I said this in the video so
just make sure everything's backed up
all your apps all your data anything you
want saved make sure it's all backed up
so after you do dalvik cache system and
cache you want to slide to wipe it do
that and that will just erase all the
files all the junk files on your phone
just to make sure everything is good to
go
click on
back hit back again and one more time
click on install and now you want to go
down to find that roms folder that you
created earlier it's right there but
just in case you're not in the correct
spot if you're all the way back at root
right here if you have that little slash
right there you want to scroll down to
where you can see sdcard which is right
there click on SD card and then scroll
down to where you can see roms
click on that or whatever you named your
folder click on roms and you should see
the ROM folder that you're the rom file
that you saw or that you add it to the
phone earlier I'm just going to click on
this and then all you have to do is
slide to custom flash so I'm just going
to slide that over and just let this
install and then once this installs you
have the ROM installed it and everything
will probably work fine but just in case
everything doesn't I'm going to go back
to the very beginning where you can see
wipe again and then do a factory reset
and now the factory reset will do is
that will erase all the files it had on
it before but it will still keep the
custom ROM so you'll still have 4.3
Google Play edition ROM installed on
your s4 or whatever ROM you're
installing on other phones but this will
just make sure it's a completely brand
new ROM that you have on your device so
once this finishes I'll show you exactly
how to do that alright so there you go
that finished they don't want to click
on reboot system just yet you want to
click on back and one more time then go
up to wipe again but don't do anything
else right here you see slide to factory
reset just do that really quick should
be a pretty quick process as well there
you go once I finish this now you're
good to go to reboot just going to hit
back then click on reboot and click on
system and once you hit system it's
going to reboot into the custom ROM file
that you installed before so right here
it says fix permissions if it does show
up is this don't worry all you have to
do is slide to fix the permissions for
the root and it'll just automatically
reboot and then once this reboots you'll
see the if you're using the Google Play
edition you will see the Google Play
additions animation for the boot logo
once this boots up and this might take a
little while the very first time you're
doing this just because it is installing
all the new firmware that you just put
on the phone so right here you can see
the Google Play edition custom files and
once this fully boots I'll show you all
what it looks like on the s4 in this
case anybody's wondering you can install
CyanogenMod on this as well sign
mine actually supports a lot of
different phones so go to their website
check out which phones are supported
which nightly builds versus custom
builds and all that kind of stuff are on
there and you can actually do the exact
same thing that I just showed you but
instead of putting the Google Play
edition zip file in there all you have
to do is put the CyanogenMod zip file in
there and it'll just follow the exact
same process and it'll do a different
rom and so in case you guys were
wondering you can do it that way as well
so here you go this is the boot screen
I'm just going to go through all this
and if you want to do a different
language you can obviously select
different ones here I'm going to just do
English okay so here's the home screen
I'm just going to click OK on this and
just to show you all that this is stock
Google Play edition you see right here
these are all the apps you have
installed over there you see supersu
that means you are rooted obviously this
wouldn't work if you weren't rooted just
go back to here show you that this says
all the files are all the same settings
that a Google Play edition phone would
have that's basically it everything is
working I don't think the hover touch
settings are working on this ROM
specifically but everything else does
work you can check out the forum posts
for that to see what works and what
doesn't work but from what I've been
able to test data works fine
texting works fine and calling as well
so everything that you need to have a
basic phone for does work perfectly fine
so in case you want to any other realms
just go check out the forums and see if
you can have any other runs that you
want to install on your phone so let me
know if you have any questions in the
comments down below I'll be responding
as robo 13 as my account so just make
sure you look out for that account just
in case and if run into any issues just
let me know in the comments and I'll try
to help you out just to show you guys
that this is 4.3 I'm going to go down to
settings let's go down to about phone
and right there Android version 4.3 this
4.3 is actually available for the s4
currently right now but this is just to
show you all how to install Google Play
