to you by netflix welcome back to an
episode of renter's rinses to show our
ranked andrean talk about anything the
world of technology some weeks when it
comes to riches rants I really got to
think about a good top if you share with
you guys this week though it was a no
frickin brainer let's talk ps4 in Sony's
three hour press conference we've been
hearing rumors the ps4 pretty much ever
since the ps3 initially launched and
obviously they get crazy when our geek
imaginations run wild they run crazy
wild we're in things ranging it
initially from Holograms to using some
crazy multi-core unique processor just
for Sony and we finally got the press
conference invites the ps4 we were
jazzed we knew it was gonna be a long
when we were expecting two or three
hours of product demonstrations spec
talk and everything the ps4 was going to
be able to do what we ended up getting
was about 15 minutes of information and
about two hours and 30 minutes of just
stupid game demos not even real game
demos hypothetical fake demos that were
clearly running off of a pc not even in
game playing just stock footage what the
ps4 was hypothetically capable of it was
probably the worst run press currents I
have ever seen so why in the world would
Sony hold a press conference not an
ounce price not show the console not
talk about 4k when they're one of the
huge pioneers trying to push for K all
they said was it's a ps4 it's going to
be coming come the holidays and we no
longer have a custom chip set for we're
now using x86 architecture which okay I
get it it's making it's much easier for
PC developer support their games to the
ps4 or we saw blizzard up on stage
talking about Diablo totally understand
that but now what's different versus the
ps4 vs just getting a regular PC and
plugging it in I found it shocking that
Sony very rarely talked about new
features in the ps4 they mentioned
things like being able to play download
games immediately I've being able to
webcast and let friends take over the
console but really nothing else outside
of that and it was absolutely
mind-boggling so why the heck would they
have this conference well I think they
wanted to get developer consoles in the
hands of more developers as quickly as
possible and they were probably worried
about leaks we had seen the controller
leak before the DualShock 4 with a
little touch pad in there but what it
seems right now is that Microsoft at
least hypothetically poised to control
the mind share for the next generation
of games so imagine this if you will
regardless of whether or not you're an
Xbox fan a you know a Playstation fan a
Nintendo fan or just a fan of gaming
imagine this looking to get a gaming
consoles holiday season not sure if you
want whatever the expansion xbox is
going to be or a ps4 you saw so Nico up
on stage and not really show very much
and then you see Microsoft come III time
or a little bit before reveal all the
specs their console talked about what it
can do talk about connect to show the
console show pricing you're gonna have a
bit more confidence in what Micah top is
going to be able to do microsoft has
long taken that sort of PC approach and
use PC architecture and pc chips with
their consoles and now Sony is following
suits what Microsoft has done Microsoft
is totally poised to dominate this next
generation of consoles if they can just
do it right they hold their conference
and they show the features if they come
out with a fair price they put in
blu-ray support with next-generation
downloadable abilities I think they can
absolutely crush Sony well we might be
looking at unfortunate to ps4 might be
the last PlayStation we ever see Sony as
a company has really been hurting the
past few years not just a gaming
division or Sony Entertainment switch
they're sort of separated different
companies but all of Sony as a whole has
really been hurting their estimating
they're putting in too close to a
billion dollars of RND into the ps4 if
they end up writing a big portion in
that off and they're not reimbursed for
the cost of it they're not making it
back of the course of a console I
wouldn't be surprised if we don't see a
PS five so obviously Sony's gonna
announce more as we get to eat three
they'll show new features they'll show
what the ps4 can do I love playing games
I don't get a chance to play as much as
I like I've always thought the
PlayStation was a better value for the
gaming money he always had the next
generation blu-ray player that was
always going to be supported with new
firmware updates you got a ton of stream
and just was a better value that being
said I always game on an xbox music
because I prefer the controller I'm not
so sure that's going to change all that
much this next generation of consoles so
do you guys think do you agree and my
way off base ah does sony have a bright
bright bright future were you super
excited with what they show at the press
conference or you find that actually is
boring as we did and we were there at
the press comments are gaming editor joy
Davidson was sitting there and the
overall feeling around there was the
heck is Sony doing and my way off base I
want to hear your comments and tell me
what you think let me step aside from my
gaming rants for just a minute thank our
