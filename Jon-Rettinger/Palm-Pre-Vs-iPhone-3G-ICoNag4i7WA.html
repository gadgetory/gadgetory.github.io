give you a comparison of the Palm Pre
what I consider to be its biggest
competitor the iPhone 3G so let's get
started and let's begin with unlocking
the device to unlock the Palm Pre you
push the power button on the top right
corner and you're greeted with a little
yellow lock icon you put your finger on
and you drag right out to unlock the
iPhone 3G key that push the power button
on the top or the Menu button in the
middle and you simply slide to unlock it
should be mostly familiar for a lot of
people so the first thing I want to
compare is the launcher how do you
launch applications from the pre and the
iPhone 3G well the pre does it pretty
interestingly and let me show you you
can use these four icons across the
bottom the first one will launch you're
dialing menu which I'll show you in a
moment
second one launch it calendar third is
mail fourth is calendar and the last one
is diva launcher so these are heart set
you can't change them but if you want to
get to more menu items you push that
last menu which opens up the launcher
and you can scroll back and forth and
these can all be selected and rearranged
anywhere that you like but if you are
already in an application you want to
select a quick launcher each you take
advantage of this gesture area at the
bottom which I'll show you again slide
your finger up and you get this little
wave we can get access to those four
launcher buttons or the five launcher
buttons that we talked about just a
minute ago select one and you are off so
I selected contacts right here so
getting throw that away and I'll show
you what I did there in just a minute to
select icons on the iPhone 3G it's
relatively similar except you are stuck
with a static array you can arrange
these icons any way you want by
selecting and moving them around you
have the ability to customize what comes
up in that bottom you can show up to
four icons and that's relatively if
there is not a gesture area on the
bottom the navigation is done really
through these four icons on the bottom
and the icon array above so next thing
is let's talk about multitasking and
multitasking on the iPhone is relatively
non-existent if I am say in my browser
and I want
you view my contacts I have to hit the
menu button eggs it out and then hit my
contacts and I can go ahead and scroll
through if for instance let's say I'm in
the browser on the pre and I'm looking
at a website and I suddenly want to view
a contact you can do it one of two ways
you can pull up that launcher go to
contact and you can view your contacts I
don't have any in here quite yet or
let's go back let's get rid of that and
let's say I'm in my browser again and I
want to open up contacts I can push this
menu button in the middle and that opens
up what's called a card view this is how
it handles a multitasking I can go ahead
and open contacts and it opens the
contacts menu up now what I just showed
you is what pom is calling cards and
slightly hands-on multitask and actually
is very impressive so let me show you
again what that is hit the menu button
and you get this card array and you can
open up really pump says 12 is the max I
can handle but I've actually gone a
little bit further so let's open
calendar well hit done ask me if I want
to import a calendar from Google
Facebook or exchange and now I've got
calendars open let's say I want to open
up email I've been set up any email
accounts on here yet but here I am an
email and I can flip right back nice and
easy
beguin all these cards and the cards can
be rearranged if you select them you can
move them anywhere that you like and
when you want to get rid of one go back
to car view and you swipe it off the
screen and that actually closes the
application it's very elegant you have a
little animation noise and I know this
sounds silly but it is kind of fun to do
so that is how the Palm Pre handles
multitasking the next thing I want to
show you is scrolling both phones boasts
multi-touch which means you can use two
fingers to manipulate the screen image
or otherwise let me show you what
scrolling looks like on here and I will
do that using the browser so I'll launch
the browser again well just pick a
random website will go to palms website
and on the iPhone will launch i've got
pocket now up here so scrolling is very
smooth and it's flick scrolling so as I
go it keeps growing it uses a physics
engine determine how fast or how slow
I'm flicking scrolling now the pre is
relatively similar all this pages
optimized for this particular screen
size you can see scrolling is very
smooth and it uses a very similar
physics engine to see when I get to the
top and bottom I'm just going slowly it
balances slowly if I go fast it goes
fast as well I'd say it's about a draw
here on the scrolling have you ever used
an iPhone you know how smooth it is and
take my word for it is just as smooth as
the Palm Pre and equally as impressive
actually so next thing I want to talk
about is keyboards and before I get into
keyboards let me preface this by saying
I am running beta software 3.0 on the
iPhone so I do have a landscape keyboard
which I will show you what that looks
like and also show you the portrait
keyboard to get a really fair comparison
so let's go into messaging we'll close
out of that and go to your messaging
application hit the launcher and you hit
messaging I wanted to say I want to
create a new text and your message here
and the pre uses an actual tactile
QWERTY keyboard you can see what that
looks like it is a sort of cramped
keyboard it's got a sticky feel to it
there's a decent amount of push on the
keyboard so you know you're pushing a
button the buttons are relatively small
and there's not that much depth to them
if you can see so I'm gonna type a
sample message here using the full
QWERTY keyboard well it's like hi my
name is John and I should say that the
pre just came out today so I'm in no way
use the keyboard so this take this as a
relatively good comparison
how you'll do when you first get your
prey and I have pretty normal to big
size hands so I will type that out again
that was actually typed it out with a
decent amount of accuracy actually
complete accurate hi my name is John
with no errors so that was actually
relatively nice let's try it the same
thing on the iPhone we'll go to text
messages again I'm gonna pull us off so
all my contacts and their recent texts
don't show up and we'll open up a new
message and I will type hi my name is
John using the landscape or the portrait
keyboard on the iPhone
so actually I had a couple areas now you
can went through and corrected one it's
hi my babies John you can see it this
does have autocorrect but since I am
reading the version 3.0 I have a
landscape keyboard which is certainly
fair to compare since most future
iPhones coming out will take advantage
of those landscape keyboard so let's go
ahead and try that again and you can see
I typed that with much more accuracy and
completely correct as well landscape is
certainly much easier to type with the
final verdict is the priests keyboard is
a little bit cramped but you certainly
get used to it very quickly as you can
see right here typing a simple sentence
I can see myself over the coming days
and weeks really enjoying the keyboard
on the pray I do like having a physical
keyboard over a non physical on-screen
keyboard like the iPhone so I think if
you have to compare keyboards the Prix
definitely wins for having a full QWERTY
board so the next thing I want to show
you is screen rotation both devices have
a built-in accelerometer so we will use
the web browser for that we'll go back
swipe that away go to launcher open up
the web browser probably shoulda just
kept it open so we will launch ESPN see
if it pulls up a mobile version ESPN
wish it will I'll close this up so let's
check screen rotation you can see it's
actually very quick
and let's try the same thing on the
iPhone 3G go to the browser you can see
that is pretty quick but not as fast as
a pre let's try them both together and
get my hands around the camera so put
this one up put them both up I'll try
turning them at the same time you can
see the pre definitely goes a little bit
faster now this should also be prefaced
with the pre is brand new hardware and
the iPhone 3G has been out for almost a
year so you would expect the pre to be a
little bit faster in that regard so the
next thing that I want to show you is
the browser and I did a full video
detailing the browser differences in
speeds but I do want to give you just a
little bit an overview of the browser
wall this is open this does take
advantage of multi-touch although this
patience is optimized for mobile does
not have the animations and pictures
that you'll see on other sites but you
can see that I can pinch them zoom using
two fingers it's very nice and I can
also zoom in or zoom out using a
DoubleTap method and of course the
iPhone 3G was really one of the first
mobile devices to bring multi-touch to
the masses and of course does it
extremely well and I would probably call
this a draw the palm implements
multi-touch as well as Apple which is
extremely impressive so let's go back to
the home and let's talk about navigation
navigation is relatively similar on each
sip booth use capacitive touchscreens
and realize mostly on your fingers so
navigation like I said you use using the
launcher can move around to launch your
applications oh I do wish there was a
customization option I just launched a
calendar right there customization for
these five menu items across the bottom
the iPhone is the same four on the
bottom you can customize really whatever
you want navigation is really easy on
both devices
let's talk about physical specs how do
they look well during the unboxing I
gave you guys a size comparison let's go
ahead and do that again well stack them
on top you can see the pre is it
significant ly smaller in that aspect
but it is thicker due to the slide-out
QWERTY keyboard but not by much the pre
really does feel nice and small on the
hand really is impressive let's do a
comparison next to a standard size
credit card for both devices here's my
Costco card and you really can see and
appreciate how small the pre actually is
it's not much bigger than a standard
credit card and thickness wise it's
really not that thick either if you
compare it to a device like the
blackberry curve 8900 considering has a
slide-out keyboard actually is very thin
it's certainly pocketable as possible I
would say as the iPhone so guys just
wanted to give you a real quick overview
and comparison of the Palm Pre and the
iPhone 3G stick around to the channel
we're gonna have a ton more videos
coming up about the Palm Pre really
detailing everything and for exclusive
content or to ask questions about the
pre be sure to follow me on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers I'll
put a link in the sidebar
hope you enjoyed and I'll see you guys
in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
