John Retton jerking TechnoBuffalo here
with an unboxing for you that I am very
excited about this is the new Xbox 360
that was announced just a few days ago
at e3 bigger hard drive new design uses
less power quieter and it's got Wi-Fi a
few other cool things in there let me go
ahead and dig in and show you what this
looks like
the pricing scheme stays the same as the
outgoing elite model at $2.99 so here is
the box you've got a picture of the new
console on the front sort of a shiny
blaster your fingerprint magnet what's
inside sleek new design Kinect ready
when that comes out Xbox 360 Twitter 50
gigs you've got now the zoom Facebook
Netflix Twitter last fm let you know a
kind of other cool features a bit of
more stuff on the box showing some xbox
live and people rocking out to connect
supposed to be the box it's going to be
sticking around for probably a while
since the next not coming out to the
fall and that looks like that is about
it let's go ahead and dig in opens up
the same way as the outgoing model
there's a sticker right here we'll pull
it off just wings up and if the last
Xbox in the indication they pack these
things tight so start here set up it's
pretty self-explanatory this does have
Wi-Fi built in 802 11 N so if you've got
an inner outer to be getting very fast
internet service
and pretty quick data transfer rates
sort of sitting here on these foam rails
pull the rails off and push the console
off the side for just one second I'll
make a quick though and we'll see what
else we get in the box and definitely
stick around to TechnoBuffalo and the
YouTube channel John for Lakers I'll be
doing a comparison to the console
against the outgoing Xbox 360 model so
here is the power brick which looks to
be a little bit smaller play will see
the Xbox 350 power brick the outgoing
model and the Alcantara was huge
this one is now just giant
not huge vagina it's got a new way to
connect to the power in the back so
nothing terribly exciting to see their
keep digging to get in the box course we
have a headset same types that we've
seen sort of in the past it's got the
little microphones built in and just the
boom type headset you know if the mic
that comes out to the side we've got a
controller which is the same as all the
other Xbox controllers but I believe is
a black and a wireless so there that is
although the new button looks a little
bit more crummy than the older ones and
it comes with two Duracell it looks like
double-a batteries very nice
we'll keep digging in so you don't
forget cable ones then we'll get to the
console soon I promise the rest of the
power cord you've got some information
and lastly we have a very odd like a
serial connector going to kick this your
TV via old-school of course HDMI is the
way that you're going to be going so
enough of that
Tom Florida take a look at the console
itself it's very light I'm actually
surprised at how light it really is but
pull all this up off I probably enjoy
this too one time we're going to see it
without fingerprints all over it so here
is the new Xbox 360 I got to tell you
that does look pretty nice a very slick
looking certainly shiny fingerprint
magnet this is a touch button house with
nothing to push in
you've got your two sort of recessed USB
ports right there as we saw on the
previous model I think the hard drive is
in here somewhere I'm not sure how that
comes out the hard drive is still
removable but it's not sort of the big
proprietary s hard drive we say in the
past I believe it's not a standard hard
drive format right so ahead on to the
back there is the new sort of power port
that we've seen we've got an optical
audio that odd AV cable HDMI there is I
believe the new Kinect port right on top
and there is your Ethernet and three USB
ports which now going to be taken up we
buy one of the
you Wi-Fi dongles on the other side this
is where the hard drive goes you've got
some more grills a lot of grills a lot
of vents on it on the top you can see
there is a huge fan but you can see that
right in there
they look gigantic hopefully this thing
runs much quieter and it does not have
red LEDs in here so even if it breaks
you'll not be getting a red ring of
death you'll probably die just get a
green ring of death so this is just a
quick unboxing of the new Xbox 360 it is
very slim very light I'm looking forward
to getting my hands on it and using it
and you guys leave your questions down
below anything you want to see I'll be
sure to show you and as I mentioned I'll
be doing a full comparison with the
outgoing model as well anyway John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see
you in the next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
