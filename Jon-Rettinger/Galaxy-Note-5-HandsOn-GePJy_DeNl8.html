Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo checking out
the brand new Galaxy Note 5 the phone
we've been waiting for for a long time
you can see it's got the similar
industrial design that we first saw on
the galaxy s6 s6 edge earlier this year
so you get the awesome metal borders
ring around it you also get the glass
front panel and the glass back panel
which just using it here I've got some
fingerprints on it's kind of hard to get
rid of I just tried to swipe boy in any
case you're looking at a really
brilliant 5.7 inch quad HD display you
have 4 gigs of RAM under the hood 32 and
64 gigabyte options this time around so
128 is out at launch and no word on
whether that's gonna come at all but
otherwise you have the new XE no 7 quad
core processor actually it's an
octa-core processor you have a two-point
gigahertz quad core chip in there in
addition to a 1.5 gigahertz quad core
chip under the hood a 3000 milliamp hour
battery so I talked to some people here
and they say we should expect a day of
use at least out of it
so unlike the 2550 I believe milliamp
hour battery in the galaxy s6 you should
get more time with this one up top you
can see you have the little SIM card
tray slot moving around to volume
buttons there on the bottom of the
device of micro USB charging port the
speaker a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and of course the new S Pen and this is
really cool let me just turn the phone I
can push it in just like that
and pop out the s-pen
a power button up on the right of the
phone there upfront you have a 5
megapixel camera I believe that's up
from a three point X will say megapixel
camera on the Galaxy Note 4
you also have bluetooth 4.2 Low Energy
on here USB 2.0 NFC and GPS GLONASS that
kind of stuff but let's go through and I
want to show you real quick some of the
features you can expect from the s-pen
so I'm gonna take it out real quick okay
so when you pop the S Pen out you now
have the menu pop up automatically so
you have action memo smart select screen
right stuff we've seen before you can
also now add shortcuts to your favorite
apps to say you want a Facebook there
and maybe Krum because we're always
surfing the web go back and now when it
comes up you can see I've got Facebook
and Chrome one of the really cool
features is that you can pop the pen out
and start writing with the screen off so
I've just pushed it in a little bit pop
it out and it's ready to go so you can
write quick reminders and get going and
save it it saves right into your
notebook through s-pen so a quick look
here at the Galaxy Note 5 from Samsung
other features include the PMA and Qi
wireless charging you get quick charge
on the bottom we're told that it'll
charge just as quick as the galaxy s6 to
full despite the larger battery which is
really awesome and then you've got this
amazing display so it really just want
to show a quick demo of what it looks
like here it's 513 PPI by the way these
speakers get nice and loud
and on the back of the phone you have a
16 megapixel camera I believe it's the
same one that we saw on the galaxy s6
also have the LED flash there and the
other components just below it alright
so that's a quick look at the new galaxy
note 5 it's launching globally on August
21st and you'll see it on all the major
US carriers so that's 18 t Verizon
Sprint t-mobile and US Cellular sustad
