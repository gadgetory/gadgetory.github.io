from TechnoBuffalo here at Lee for view
of the giant Samsung Galaxy Note let's
go see if this phone is as big in
performance as it is in size and whether
or not it deserves a giant place in your
pockets it's going to get started
alright so let me go ahead and run
through the specs of the samsung galaxy
note because as of right now and that's
pre CES it is probably the best SPECT
phone on the planet so it is running
Android 2.3 there's no Ice Cream
Sandwich action here although Samsung
has said it will be coming sometime in
the next few months for my dimension
standpoint it is five point seven eight
inches by three point two seven inches
by a very thin point three eight inches
so large screen that screen is 5.3
inches and it weighs six point two eight
ounces all right so that 5.3 inch screen
that I just talked about is WXGA it's an
HD resolution it's significantly
actually HD with a resolution of 800 by
1280 and it's a super a moto abdun HD
Super AMOLED display so there's a lot of
words that go in to describe to sing it
is a pentile display they don't talk
about that a little bit powering this
guy is a 2500 milliamp hour battery it's
going to give you 13 hours of talktime
and 570 hours of standby time
it's a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core cortex a9
that's the heavily regarded Exynos
chipset Giga Ram can get it in either 16
or 32 gig configurations and it's got
microSD on the back of it 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash makes your 1080p
video on the front we've got a 2
megapixel sensor right there no network
has officially picked this device up
today a little unlocked and compatible
with AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ network although if you
believe the rumor mill then you can
think that it's perhaps coming to AT&amp;amp;T
and Sprint sometime in the next few
months
right so we talked about the specs let
me go ahead and jump in just very
quickly about call quality call quality
was great actually I didn't have one
drop call on up is using this phone as
my daily driver for actually a week
exactly today I haven't had a single
drop call on it so you know yay for that
speaker is a little bit on the tinny
side but it works well for phone this
big
you probably think there could be a
little bit more room for a speaker than
just a little grill right there but its
averaging on par with the rest of
smartphones out there so if you rely on
speaker phone you'll be fine if you need
it for business you'll be fine too but
you're not going to get booming sound
out of it all right so let's just go and
talk about the big monkey in the room
first the size of this guy now on video
you might not be able to appreciate the
size of it so let me go ahead and bring
in a 3.5 inch iPhone which you can see
what the size of that is let me bring in
an even larger HTC Titan with the you
know for about four and a half inch
screen and which previously felt giant
to me and looking at this the Titan
somehow looks diminutive so one more
time there it is with the iPhone 4s and
for further comparison let's bring in a
Galaxy Nexus so you can see our size
comparisons so yeah it's a huge huge
huge screen and with a huge screen comes
huge screen questions you probably the
same questions I did first of all how
silly you're going to look talking on
this phone putting it up your head it's
going to look like you got a Galaxy Tab
up to your head away making a phone call
you know was the first question second
is how is it going to fit in your pocket
the answer is it looks a little bit
silly up to your head if I've tested
pretty much every phone that's come out
over the past few years I've never had
people stop me more than with the Galaxy
Note and want to say what the heck is
that is it a phone is it a tablet people
haven't heard the Galaxy Note because it
hasn't been released here in the US but
it works very well if you can get over
that little bit of awkward feeling now
it feels pretty normal to me now those
two other people seeing it they sort of
stop and turn as far as the pocket test
goes it's extremely pocketable with
normal do jeans I'm able to fit it in my
pocket that any difficulty even while
sitting down if your jeans are on the
skinnier side if your
woman maybe wears tighter pants you
might have a bit of trouble but just for
a normal dude surprisingly worked well
alright so we've got the bad potentially
bad stuff the screen says out of the way
let's talk about the good stuff shall we
and there is a lot of good stuff here on
the first one because the screen so big
and because our resolution is so high at
800 by 1280 you can see a lot of content
on the screen and because the screen is
bigger and the resolution so high the
pixels actually don't look that small so
you can view things actually pretty
easily so if you zoom in on text I've
never once there's any sort of
pixelation on here so it is pentile but
I haven't noticed any sort of issue at
all hasn't been any green color tints
got pretty good visibility from all
angles hopefully you can see that looks
like it's my dog Lucy by the way she's a
French Bulldog you know what you guys
have been asking about her if you follow
me on Twitter at John 4 Lakers so the
pentile display definitely that's
because the resolution are the screen
size is so big it's tough to get a
AMOLED plus display affordable in a 5.3
inch variety something to keep in mind
some of the great things though that
you're going to get with this when
you're reading a book or weather and you
know you're doing anything sort of
reading intensive so go ahead and take a
look the Kindle app here it's great
taking this phone to the gym and go
ahead and hit well that sync up to my
current location I sitting at the gym
and riding a bike and being able to read
this thing is incredible much easier to
read than any other phone I've ever used
just due to sheer size so that's
definitely one of the positives you've
been sort of lugging around the tablet
and lugging around a phone this is
really going to be a wonderful choice
for you as a personal story I did have
someone stopped me outside of a
restaurant who pulled out one of the
original Galaxy Tabs and said he carries
it around with him he's looking for
something in between so I have to carry
a phone and a tablet so for people like
that this is probably going to be an
ideal choice something to show you some
of the images in here as well we'll go
ahead and jump into gallery let me show
you some of the stuff that comes
standard on here so we'll jump in to
actually show you what the pictures that
I've taken which is kind of fun we'll
talk about the camera a little bit later
but you can see what the
all it looks like most of the subjects
appeared to be my dog Lucy let's go
ahead and go to a recent one here is you
see enjoying a stick pretty decent
visibility here the camera quality was
pretty nice it's a little bit bad in low
light but on a screen this beautiful
when you're looking at it not on a
computer monitor things absolutely look
great
and pop and really no problem at all so
if you wanted a beautiful screen to look
at pictures or movies this is just an
awesome phone to do that on alright so
let's go ahead and talk next about the
speed and the speeds a lot of things a
lot of topic of discussion let's just
say so if those you that are wondering
get it out of the way quadrant score
3410 and then two to six thousand three
hundred and seventy eight the phone was
extremely fast opening applications I
never had any slowdowns I will say
though that I did have two pretty
actively managed my applications here
soft times would go into RAM and all
sort of clear stuff so you can see how
much free you have out of that one gig
or one megabyte one gigabyte rather so
have to go ahead and clear that but as I
managed it hasn't been that big of an
issue the speed has always been very
fast opening applications and such has
never been a problem matter how many
I've had open this phone is an absolute
screamer and really just hulls no matter
what you're doing whether or not you
want to play Angry Birds which is
awesome on a screen this big or they
want to go back and open a ton of
applications you're not gonna have any
trouble at all it's probably one of the
fastest phones that I've used and you
really see the speed and from the specs
come into play here on the galaxy note
so very fast also one in surprising
things that's been very fast about it
has been HSPA+ I go ahead and turn off
Wi-Fi you guys have seen me do a lot of
HSPA+ be test and I never get anything
screeching fast highest I usually get
some time I'll get three or four on a
really good day well see if it'll do it
for us here but speed test I've been
getting into sixes and sevens on this
device this is not LTE this is just
HSPA+ let's go ahead and see what it
will what it'll give us here live on
camera very rarely good things behaved
on camera but we'll give it a shot and
see
and again it's going to vary depending
where you are I'm in Southern California
so your HSPA+ beads may vary but this is
definitely the fastest HSPA+ device I've
tested on a TN t--'s network and it is
behaving for the first time something on
camera actually worked why hope to - we
got almost 5 megabits per second down
which would even be considered on the
slow side of LTE but certainly
acceptable the upload speeds certainly
you can see a slowdown but the download
has been great this phone has been
surprisingly impressive so we'll go
ahead and exit out of that it is running
Gingerbread so you've got Gingerbread
button so we can see them light up there
in the background but there are two
capacitive buttons here on the bottom
might not be able to see it with the on
the light so I've got a back button and
a menu button you've got a giant home
button so I like having the physical
buttons people may vary one of the other
things that this phone offers is on the
back its s-pen technology go and pull
out out 22 have a phone with the stylus
again this uses Wacom technology to use
some pressure-sensitive scribing so imma
go and show you some of the stuff first
you can go ahead and go through your
phone and use this to point and zoo and
whatever you want if you want to take a
screenshot for example actually go ahead
and do that right now you can use a pen
there's a little button on it right
there if you hold down the button and
you tap the screen it's going to go and
take a screenshot and now you can edit
screenshot and you can see some of the
applications that you can use so let me
go ahead and show you a few things here
and all sort of hall through this very
quickly go ahead and open up this area
right there which will give me the specs
to change color when I'm writing on and
the pen size sub got as big as it'll go
then go ahead and move it down to you
know a reasonable size and we'll go to
pen you can choose the pen and the color
and all that kind of stuff
we'll use red and let's go back home so
I'm going to go ahead and try and trace
the time gauge so it's 223 I'm going to
use the pen and I'm going to zoom in as
far as I can a little still shake show
clear so you can see where the pen is I
want to show you the accuracy of
the spen technology so I'm going to go
ahead and put the top of it right in the
middle of that - I'm going to try and
trace it as close as I can
stays inside pretty well now it tracks a
little bit behind but I'm definitely
able to get inside of there so it's more
accurate to any other capacity I'll
start seeing isn't actually a capacitive
stylus but the concept is very similar
as I touch and type you can see it drags
a little bit behind as I go it catches
up but it's not bad I do wish there was
some sort of handwriting recognition on
here that I could sort of type and it
would transcribe it there is some
capabilities but it hasn't been as
useful as I would have liked sort of
wanted that to be a little bit more
useful this is going to be handy if you
want to take notes or scribble I found
it to be a bit more of a novelty and
since I first unboxed the phone and
tried the s-pen I have yet to take it
out of the box to use it or take it out
of the bottom to use it for anything
else so what's the time it's probably
going to live down there and is not
going to be overly useful when I saw
this one get announced at IFA Samsung
actually had a caricature artist that
was using the S Pen and was drying
people's pictures and emailing it off to
him kind of fun and a random side story
so we talked to a bit about the camera
it's fine it's the standard camera if
you ever use the Galaxy S 2 you'll know
exactly what you're in for it's good
it's not great
take decent pictures video looks fine
I'm not much for camera guy if I can see
a picture that's generally good for me I
didn't have any pixelation or blurry
miss on it alright so next let's talk
about battery which is one things I was
really worried about this phone it's got
a big ol display and it's got a big old
battery to go with it 21 500 milliamp
hours if I did this review the first two
days I had the phone I would have said
the battery life stunk come for five
o'clock I was down to 10 20 percent and
I thought that it was because I was
using the phone as much as any other
phone I got you know to email
applications pulling down emails all the
time using it a lot for phone calls
Bluetooth connected your usual phone
stuff but as the days went on and
started using it for three four and five
days I started using it more as I'd used
an average phone as much like he's an
average phone I really forgot way better
so you can see now it's 2:23 in the
afternoon I still have 77 percent of the
battery now when I go to bed around 10
or 11 o'clock I'd really have
45% of juice left here on the phone so
battery life is surprisingly good I
think I was just really excited to have
a phone this big I was playing with it
quite a bit and I was killing the
battery but using it normally your life
has been pretty outstanding so something
to keep in mind you're not gonna have to
worry much if you're a frequent road
warrior let's say you're going to the
Consumer Electronics Show you may want
to pick up an extra battery for it so
let's talk a little bit about TouchWiz
TouchWiz is a dog it is what Samsung
puts on top of their Android devices
it's what makes these icons look
different it's what gives you I'm going
to pull that down this stuff here at the
top which is nice and there are some
nice tweaks here that touch was has done
but it's pretty heavy on the memory you
should standpoint so I would have
preferred a stock Android experience and
you know something I'm never going to
get generally with the stock and Samsung
device unless it's a Galaxy series or
you choose to root and put on a custom
ROM this phone is dying for Ice Cream
Sandwich dying dying dying fresh Cream
Sandwich as I go through and close
applications and go to ram and hit clear
I keep thinking how nice would be just
to go ahead and hit my multitasking
button and swipe away all the
applications that I'm using had I never
used Galaxy Nexus I never experience Ice
Cream Sandwich I'd say this is
hands-down the best Android phone I have
ever used or would ever want to use but
not running the most recent build of ice
cream sandwich is a little bit sad
you've got just incredible parts here to
put together for an awesome phone one
that's just not a hundred percent there
yet however there is hope Ice Cream
Sandwich is coming and coming very soon
samsung says and the very capable
cyanogen team has released an alpha
built of a completely blank slate Ice
Cream Sandwich for the Galaxy Note will
have a release candidate hopefully soon
and I think that once those two things
are one of those two things finally come
you are looking at the best Android
phone currently available from a screen
size to a processor to user experience
this has just been incredible to use
and that user experience is something
that is very important and you can have
great specs but if it's not going to
work well it's not going to be of much
use to you this has been a really
enjoyable user experience on the samsung
galaxy note I like having a phone this
big I like that I have to carry my iPad
when I'm sitting downstairs and want to
check my fantasy team I can do it right
from here and I can pinch and zoom and
everything just works well not to
mention it does have you know abilities
to play Flash content which a pant use
that much but for some people that's
important
this phone definitely would get a 99.9%
score get that extra 100 as soon as it
gets Ice Cream Sandwich so if it does
come to ett if it does come to sprint
definitely going to be a phone that
you're going to want to seriously
consider if you're looking for an
Android device or really looking for any
type of phone Galaxy Note really gets
two thumbs up so for all your tech news
