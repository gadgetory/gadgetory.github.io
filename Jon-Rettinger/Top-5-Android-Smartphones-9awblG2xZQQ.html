from technobuffalo and today we're going
to give you guys our top 5 android
smartphones for October 2014 and numero
uno the Galaxy Note 4 is avery o beauty
we're working on our full review right
now but is a little teaser so fantastic
and well-built Android device it's like
a blown-up version of the galaxy alpha
with beefy respects it's equipped with a
quad HD Super AMOLED display which looks
absolutely gorgeous and inside you'll
find some of the finest hardware like
the Snapdragon 805 processor with 3
gigabytes of ram expandable storage a 16
megapixel camera with OIS and so much
more design is the best we've ever seen
from a note product and I can't stop
raving about how great it is in a hand
number two the LG g3 is another quad HD
smartphone that continues to impress us
from this lengthy battery life to its
solid camera the g3 is a phone were
proud to carry in our pockets day in and
day out LG is opted in for a metallic
design that actually employs plastic
instead of metal and we'd love that the
screens bezel is so thin compared to
other flagship Android devices out in
the market now inside it's packing a
Snapdragon 801 processor with 3
gigabytes of ram expandable storage and
a 13 megapixel camera with OIS and laser
autofocus and the g3 is both thin and
light despite to 5.5 inch display and we
can't wait to see what LG has for us in
a near future number 3 the new Moto X is
a really good follow-up to last year's
Moto X a device to ultimately want to
technobuffalo phone of the Year award it
offers a more premium design with metal
edges and an improved yet still not so
great camera it also includes a sharper
1080p display and an amazing custom
software feature created by Motorola and
we love that the customization is also
still intact allowing its users to
choose from different back panels
including leather and unique accent
colors though the bare-bones Android
experience is appreciated and if last
year's any indication Moto X 2014 owners
should be one of the first few to
receive Android lollipop number 4 we
really love the HTC Desire I HTC's new
smartphone but since it's not out yet
we're left with HTC One m8 which has
continued to deliver frequent software
updates and the phone still deserves a
spot on our top 5 list it is starting to
show its age so you won't find a qHD
display on here like the
owed for or the g3 but the design is
still one of the best of all time HTC
has continued to boost the value of the
One m8 would fuking up these to the dot
view cover and promise an update for
android lollipop which is always great
to have number five we're torn between
including the Xperia z3 and the Xperia
z3 compact here but ultimately decided
with a smaller form factor to switch
things up a bit on this list Sony is one
of the few or only Android manufacturers
that releases not only a large flagship
device but a smaller one for those who
don't want a bigger screen we love that
it provides choice and think it's worth
rewarding with a spot on our top 5
xperia z3 compact also features unique
options like the ability to enable
playstation 4 remote play which i think
is one of the best features here destiny
anyone destiny No ok the z3 is also
water resistant not waterproof but water
resistant and that 20.7 megapixel camera
is an awesome addition to the already
great device anyways that's about it for
our list of top 5 android smartphones
