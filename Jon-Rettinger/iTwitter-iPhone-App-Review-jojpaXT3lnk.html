from technobuffalo calm and i want to
give you a demonstration of I Twitter
any Twitter client for the iphone this
is going to run you 399 in the App Store
which is a little bit of a steep price
to pay considering the free alternatives
but this is the first application or the
first Twitter application that promises
push notifications all that does come a
little bit of a caveat the person
sending you the app reply or the direct
message has to be logged in and sending
the message to you via I Twitter not so
bad throws you that don't know what push
notifications are actually it's a
message that gets well pushed to your
phone that will pop up on your screen
regardless of whether or not you have
the application open or not let's go
ahead and get started and launch it up
now the first thing I want to say is the
reason that i bought this and downloaded
it was to show you push notifications
and unfortunately I could not get them
to work I had people log in using I
Twitter and send me tweets and it would
not function might be because the
application is new and their servers are
overloaded or maybe that just not
functioning properly right now but just
know that if you're going to buy the
application that it might be a little
bit squirrely if it works at all you
guys might know that I'm not the biggest
fan of having application that don't
function as advertised like you saw in
my camera zoom video but I'm willing to
make a massive exception for I Twitter
because it's so good and this is
probably going to be my de facto Twitter
client from now on I'm going to overlook
what I thought would be the biggest
selling point of push notifications
let's go ahead and get sorry let me show
you what this looks like so you log in
for the first time you sort of have a
home screen of icons you've got home
mentions direct messages favorites
nearby tweets updates search following
and followers that you log into home you
get sort of a conversation looking
message here it should be relative for
both so we're familiar and nothing that
revolutionary let's say you want to look
at a tweet so let's say here's one from
Brandon minimun if you just tap it you
get a reply or retweet or the option to
favorite it which is really nice I like
having a retweet button so if I hit that
for example it automatically populates
it
I've got the ability to insert a picture
which is always a welcome addition to a
Twitter application I can even go
through and access my phonebook if I'd
like if I have someone's twitter name
saved in there and go ahead and insert
it it certainly tells you how many
characters you have left as well so
we'll go ahead and cancel this and if
you keep scrolling through here you can
see conversations which is very neat so
here's a message from TechnoBuffalo
recent here comes the Buffalo and I sent
a reply and you can see that it sort of
shows up in one clump which is quite
nice you can see you're almost like
threaded tweets which you can find on
the text message client on the iphone
and a myriad of others so it is really
cool to see so the interest of brevity
I'm going to move on to the next feature
at the next menu item here are mentioned
so these are essentially just your @
replies now you can go through and see
what they are and you have the same
reply button you can see that it says
add reply here this is one sent from the
John for lakers if I hit that I get my
information the number of followers and
it's just a kind of a nice grid to see
what that person particularly has next
direct messages quite obviously shows
your direct messages favorites you have
the option to favorite tweets if you
want to come back to amor some of that
some particularly funny gave you a good
blonde joke whatever it might be you can
come back and take a look at it nearby
tweets so take advantage of your GPS and
tell you who's an area sending tweets
which I find a little bit creepy but
maybe you guys might like updates which
I'll show you and these are all the
messages that I've sent out from my John
for lakers account search pretty obvious
what search does let you just do a
search here's a list of the people that
I'm following now take a second to load
up since this is being open for the
first time I hadn't opened this prior
but it will queue up much faster and the
people that are followers and that may
take a little bit of while to load and
we guys want to give you a real short
quick overview of I Twitter I'm really
enjoying it despite again in fact
that push notifications were not
functioning if you're willing to
overlook that I think it's certainly
worth the 399 price point for just great
Twitter management I assume at some
point push notifications will come
through although it does have yet to be
seen if getting push notifications will
be really annoying on the iPhone or not
and I'll show you real quickly that push
notifications are turned on in case you
were wondering a little bit of settings
notifications and you can see there is I
Twitter and everything is turned on hope
you enjoyed for exclusive content be
sure to follow me at twitter twitter.com
/ John for lakers and if you're looking
for exclusive technobuffalo news and to
learn what TechnoBuffalo is be sure to
follow TechnoBuffalo at quite obviously
twitter.com / TechnoBuffalo i will see
you guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
