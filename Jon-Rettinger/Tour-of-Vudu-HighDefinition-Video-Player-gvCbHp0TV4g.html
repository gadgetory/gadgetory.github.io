editor for John for lakers calm and this
is a continuation of the video series on
the Voodoo set-top box now in this video
we're going to talk about the setup of
the device and then we're going to
actually go over the remote because this
is one of the strangest smallest
weirdest-looking remotes that they make
for any set-top box we're going to talk
about whether it's actually a usable
remote and then we're going to go
through the whole menu system of the
voodoo box and I'll show you what it's
like to to pick a movie to download a
movie and then to watch a movie and all
the other stuff that goes along with
that so I'll see you in a sec alright
guys so here we are down on my set up
here and as you can see the voodoo box
is a nice looking attractive device it
doesn't take up much room so it's about
two or three inches high here it matches
nicely if you have black components or
silver components like I do and let me
turn it around but first I want to you
don't want to point out two things to
these lights on the side the one on the
left is a standby light it turns kind of
orange when it's not on and then the
green light is your network light so
when you have a network connection going
it will stay green it'll turn red if
your network goes offline or something
like that so let's turn it around
alright so let me get a little bit
closer here okay so here we are a little
bit closer now this is the antenna and
what's great about the the remote is
that it doesn't use IR it uses radio
frequency so you can be behind the couch
or you know on the stairs or kind of far
away from your voodoo box and still have
it worked quite well so that's really
great here's how I have it connected I
have it with my optical audio cable
going to my receiver down here and then
I've got the hdmi going to the TV up
there and the ethernet cable of course
and to the right of that is the power
cable so really not that many connectors
that's involved here as you would expect
with a set-top box okay so i will talk
about the remote right now now the
remote only has five buttons so we have
a power button back button play/pause
button a voodoo button which goes to the
home screen and a more button so you're
probably wondering and of course it's a
scroll wheel you're probably wondering
how can you operate a set-top box how
can you search for movies with just five
buttons like this well I'll tell you
what it's very easy
the scroll wheel really comes in handy
when you're flipping through letters are
trying to find various titles in their
catalog and what's great about the
remote is it's completely economic so
you kind of hold the remote like this
you put your thumb on the scroll wheel
and your hand just wraps gently around
it and it's perfect for right or left
handers one of the problems with the
remote is that it's dark so if the
lights are off you're not going to see
the buttons too well and they're not
backlit so you can't tell what button
you're hitting so that's say you'll
probably have to memorize where the
buttons are and it's not that big of a
deal considering that there are only
five buttons and a scroll wheel alright
guys so here we are on the Voodoo main
menu and you get this when you turn on
your device when you turn on the box and
also when you press the voodoo button on
the remote control now there are so many
ins and outs of this and it would
probably take me an hour to show you
everything but I really want to give you
an idea for the experience that you can
expect to have with the voodoo player
how how long it takes to get from screen
to screen what it's like to buy a movie
and there are two kind of components of
the voodoo box that i'm going to show
you one is movies how to download a
movie and watch a movie and the other
one is the Voodoo labs section which
lets you go to YouTube Flickr Picasa
it's kind of a new experimental project
that really brings a ton of content to
the Voodoo box I think it's one of the
ways that the voodoo box stands above
other set-top boxes out there so anyway
this is your main screen you can flip
through the featured titles here quite
easily with the scroll wheel but I want
to go to explore catalog because I want
to download a movie right now I'm going
to go to search by title over here and
i'm going to type hulk for the
incredible hook and what it does is it
searches as you type and wow it came up
pretty fast actually on the left there
you'll see the list of matches and right
at the top is the incredible hulk so i'm
going to click on that one and it will
be take me to the information screen and
this is what you get on the right in the
upper right you get a synopsis below
that you get information playtime rating
year that sort of thing genre below that
it tells you the format's that it's
available in now this is kind of
important especially if you if you have
a high-definition box you have standard
definition which is kind of crappy you
have HD which is probably around 1080i
maybe 720p then you have the HDX which
is the top of the top 1080p can
pletely uncompressed so the audio is
fantastic very discreet channels that
the picture is incredible it's not quite
blu-ray but it's almost blu-ray so let's
say I want to do the HDX so I'm going to
do over here on the left you see where
the selection boxes I'm gonna do rent
from 399 it's going to show me the three
different prices depending on what I
want the HDX is 599 for 24-hour rental
period this is kind of in the higher end
of the price usually they're about 499
but the incredible hulk is just out so
that it's priced higher so if I click on
it it says rent for 599 and it will be
available in two hours I know what
you're thinking two hours are you
kidding me i don't want to wait two
hours well here's the thing the HD
xvideos are so big that even over a
high-speed line it takes a long time to
download that said if you want to get
the HD version it will start immediately
and and simultaneously if you want to
have the HDX version download you can go
to any other movie in their catalog and
start watching it immediately let me
demonstrate that so let's go to the
grinch horton hears a who let's start
watching it in you can't rent this one
it looks like snot out let's do this
movie and rent and I am going to choose
HD ready to watch and watch how fast
this is it's going to come up on the
screen probably in about 10 seconds even
though i'm downloading a BD x title at
the same time so watch now
and here we are the movies already
starting while i'm downloading a pdx
title so it's really amazing how fast
the how fast this all works and how easy
and intuitive it is so if we go back to
the main screen and we go to my voodoo
we can kind of see our rentals right now
and what's being downloaded so I'm going
to go to my rentals and it shows me
these are all the movies that I've been
watching lately we have the incredible
hulk right here and it's in download
queue there's another movie that's in
the download queue and when it's done
the hook will start downloading ok so
that was movies on the Voodoo player
movie the movie experience on the Voodoo
player is fantastic it's one of the best
that I've ever seen on any set-top box
the movies are quickly available to
download the selection is pretty darn
good it's not perfect I have run into
some movies that aren't available to
download yet but voodoo is a startup
company they're starting to bring on
more and more titles all the time ok so
let's go into the next section of this
voodoo labs this is a new thing this
kind of brings a whole new realm of
content to your voodoo box and I think
it's really important ok and we can do a
few things here hopefully you can see
this we can do YouTube we can do on
demand TV look at g4tv NBC MSNBC CNN a
lot of that kind of stuff TV channels
that you watch on your on your regular
channel then we have picasa let's do
picasa because what you can do is
actually log into your account if you
have picasa online and you can flick
through all your pictures so this is a
demo and it kind of shows you movie
quotes while you're waiting so you don't
get bored but Wow looking at pictures on
a on an LCD television is amazing
they're coming up right now and this is
kind of the demo that comes on the on
the Voodoo box and so so imagine you've
just uploaded some pictures to picasa
and you're doing a slideshow for your
family or friends pretty cool stuff
alright let's go back
and let's go to youtube you can watch
every YouTube video that is on youtube
com so I am going to go to I'm going to
search for John for lakers bring up the
john for lakers channel for John for
lakers and hopefully get one of John's
videos on the screen John for and that
should be enough done up there's one
right here John for lakers and let's go
more from the author so we can get the
John for lakers youtube channel right on
the screen here all John's videos so
here is the man himself and we can play
it full screen it's loading it takes
just a second
and of course the sound us off right now
and what's really great is that I can
leave John on the right side of my
screen while eyebrows as other videos or
even go through the rest of YouTube so a
really great interface for YouTube from
voodoo labs so let's move on from here
okay so let's go to on demand TV there's
a lot of different content here so we
can go to science and technology we've
got David Pogue from the new york times
we've got Walt Mossberg from The Wall
Street Journal we've got some NASA
things National Geographic and it's all
really good quality some of its HD some
of its SD but it all works really well
and you know 10 seconds or less to to
watch it on the screen and here it is so
you can spend a really long time if you
never download any movies at all just in
the voodoo lab section of the of voodoo
and there's also some games on here
which is kind of funny you can play
freecell there's one called Cooper which
allows you to shoot down asteroids and
that sort of thing so guys I know it was
a long video but I hope I gave you a
really good feel for how the Voodoo
player works with you and kind of the
experience that it will bring you in the
next video we're going to cover kind of
the pros and the cons wrap it all up and
i'll tell you if this is something that
you should buy and kind of give you an
overall opinion on it so that's it for
now see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
