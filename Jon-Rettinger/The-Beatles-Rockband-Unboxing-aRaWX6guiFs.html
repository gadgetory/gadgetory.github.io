unboxing for you of the beatles rock
band for the Xbox 360 I've got the
special value Edition which is going to
run you 140 bucks it comes in a few
other flavors you can get a limited
edition version which includes a
McCartney looking bass some improved
drums and some pedals and some extras
that could include either a t-shirt or
some postcards depending on where you
are and that will be 249 or you just get
the shrink game for 60 bucks all three
obviously include the same version of
the game let's go ahead and get started
I'm a big Beatles fan so I'm excited to
get my John Paul George and I even Ringo
on so the funny thing is you note is a
sit right here apple core it was us
started by the Beatles and there was
sort of a lawsuit between apple core the
Apple computers at the time so wonder if
that's a reason why we don't see any
Beatles stuff on iTunes maybe there's
some residual hard feelings so let's go
ahead and open it up this includes the
drums the guitar and mic
the special edition one does also
include a a mic stand I should I should
mention so here is the back of the box
burger where you can see most of of the
action so I'm you featuring The Beatles
original master recordings which is
great
ton of good songs on there start a band
Rock the world's kind of the rock band
slogan some pictures looks like we get
the guitar we get the bass microphone no
stand and the game including this box
we'll go ahead and see that is and it's
rated T for all you parents that are
watching it's okay for your kids you're
not going to see The Beatles any
questionable poses with groupies so
we'll go ahead to open this up of course
using the obligatory big ol knife again
triangle conservatism
stabbing myself now I love it there's a
big sticker on here that says if you
encounter a problem with the rock band
do not return this to the store and
seriously if I open this up and
something's broken I'm going back to
Best Buy I'm not sending this
- rock banks they sent the busted unit
you know most stores are going to have a
30-day return policy so for the most
part ignore that sticker so go ahead and
break the literal seal oh right I think
this is the same drums and guitar that
included with rock fans a - there's a
game Beatles rock band sort of the same
image jets on the back of the box is on
the back of the game nothing really
exciting there other than the game stop
please don't return this - I don't know
it seems kind of a crappy thing to say
don't repair this the store if we sang
you a broken one instead send it back
wait a month product instead of sent
back to you seems a little bit silly to
me so this is quite tightly packed as
you can see let's see what we have
so clearly Rock Band drum set labeled
Rock Band drum set I had the original
rock band for a little while and I
enjoyed it and if you guys are on Xbox
Live my name is John for Lakers so if
you see me on there give me an ad and
kehna you can rock out together xbox360
software not included obviously moving
along in the box but there's something
in there like little tips probably for
for drumsticks out soon throw that off
the side your tips over there here we've
got a microphone
it says rock band USB microphone it's
not Wireless um no big deal I'm an awful
thing or not even going to try to sing
the Beatles song for you and we've got
the rock band wireless guitar which is
uh which is pretty nice let's go ahead
and sort of dig into these boxes a
little bit further and you can see what
comes in there if all you want to see
was what was in the box go ahead and
stop watching if you want to see really
what comes inside keep sticking through
them so play that goes with our rock
band
blah blah blah
the rock band guitar that you can buy
from the store and just threw in the box
so let's go ahead and open this thing up
it's like one of those Russian dolls
with the doll inside the doll inside the
doll lots of stuff to open up here so go
ahead and pull this back inside we've
got I assume the guitar without the head
on literally the head is probably not
the proper terminology obviously I'm no
musician that's why I'm sticking to
playing music on a game I was not
blessed with any sort of musical ability
here so let's see what we have we've got
the guitar itself the act like a buttons
strap awesome here is the top part it
snaps in and we've got a some batteries
hood on there as well look what they're
just sort of generic OAM batteries throw
that off to the side and take a look at
the drums I think the drums are probably
going to be a little more complicated so
open this up a few of those tabs usually
can't look like just the drums that you
buy for the xbox360 if you want to play
rock band that don't come in the bundle
like there's some another flaps on the
side here is quite a elaborate packaging
that Harmonix put together all right
finally got that open let's take a look
at what's inside there's a lot of
business in there what you see here a
lot of business we've got the drums
themselves is probably seen these a
million times but there they are
red yellow blue and green that color is
called push it off to the side here is a
pedal I hope people had a lot of issues
with the pedal and the initial rock
bands hopefully this new one is
improving drum six cooled sticks of wood
metal pole soon they go together built
and here's the other part of the base of
the drums got some more metal poles with
an adjustable deal you can change the
height of drums and breathe in there's
always a question mark area here you got
a boomerang also known as the other side
of the stand and there is your pedal so
all this business that I got going on
down here
will eventually turn into a rock band
game I'm going to build it and stay
tuned maybe we'll get some in-game
action and you can see what the game
looks like and what all the stuff will
look like when it's put together anyway
guys I'm a John render from
TechnoBuffalo for exclusive content you
can check me out on Twitter twitter.com
slash John for Lakers or TechnoBuffalo
