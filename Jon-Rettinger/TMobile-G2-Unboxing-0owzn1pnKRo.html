TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing of
the new t-mobile flagship handset of
course this is the g2 the follow-up to
the Android phone that really started
the Android craze obviously that is the
g1 let's go ahead and dig in and see
where this guy improves alright so on
the front of the Box you've got a
picture of the g2 letting you know
what's a with a Google Experience which
means you're gonna get a relatively
unskilled Android operating system in
this case it's going to be 2.2 Froyo
picture the device on the front with
Google on the back nothing really on the
side other than some company branding on
the back you're gonna get a few specs
here and we'll go through all the specs
a little bit more as we go five
megapixel camera with LED flash
out-of-focus
in 720p video capture that's all fine
and good let's go ahead and open the
buck and see what we're gonna get here
we have your t-mobile g2 push it off to
the side for just one second I won't
keep digging in the box to see what
we're gonna get top HTC is hitting some
it's like some reading material in here
probably getting started and QuickStart
guide which is indeed a Quick Start
Guide terms and conditions and then a
handset recycling program flyer from
t-mobile your typical array of
accessories in the box nothing really a
day ordinary you've got your a wall
charger two USB stereo headphones with
microphone and a micro USB cable chances
are you guys may have a few of these
already laying around alright but let's
look at why we are all here this is the
t-mobile g2 and let me quickly run
through the specs of this guy
it has a 3.7 inch capacitive touch
screen resolution of 480 by 800 it is
running Android 2.2 you might have heard
that referred to by the delicious
tasting Froyo it's got an 800 megahertz
Qualcomm processor and don't let the
megahertz fool you in to keep hearing
about one gigahertz and that type this
is a very quick phone the 800 megahertz
processor really got let's
come along nice and smooth it's got 512
megabytes of RAM on the back it has a
five megapixel camera with autofocus and
flash and we mentioned the video capture
which is 1280 by 720 which you may
probably have heard advertises just 720p
video deep inside here we have a 1300
milliamp hour battery which is gonna get
you just about 6.6 hours of talktime and
this does have t-mobile's HSDPA plus
support meeting you're going to get 4G
like speeds so if you see a little H on
the top your phone and this is
notification you're probably getting
super fast internet alright so let's go
ahead and take a look at the device
you've got your typical capacitive
Android buttons across the bottom you've
got your home your menu at your back in
search gone and the g1 is the sort of
dirt gathering trackball we now have an
optical trackpad which is nice to have
the option to navigate whether or not
you want to use your finger or you
before a more traditional scrolling I
sort of get that choice and it is of
course you can push it in and sort of
get your 5-way navigation that way on
the left hand side of the phone volume
up and down micro USB charger on the
right hand side we've got your screen
lock access battery release button
Robbie go ahead and pull that out and
that is where the battery goes for
interesting all right I would assume
that was a screen lock but actually
opens up the battery door II saw it sort
of come flying out and here we have the
13 hundred million power battery I was
talking about earlier
pull that out push your batter in and
we'll do a first boot up here in a
minute
I know SIM card installed them and try
and push that back on that really came
flying out there that was quite
interesting let's see if we can get it
to launch launch off again know you can
get the same force that's how the bad
guy is going to be removed this does
have a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard
sort of interesting slide mechanism
checked it out sort of in slow motion to
the screen sort of rests on top of the
keyboard you can see it underneath there
I'd serve a new way for HTC who made
this phone I can make a slide-out
keyboard now while this phone is not
been unboxed before I have actually used
eg2 in the past and I'm a huge fan of
the
keep where I'm sometimes tough on QWERTY
keyboards for poor designs this one is
actually designed really nicely the keys
have a bit of a rubbery feel to them so
there's this amount of separation a true
and sort of typical slider format you
don't get a lot of key throw they have
to sort of rest flat in order for the
screen serve rest on top of it but there
is a okay amount of click eNOS and
tactile feedback feedback especially for
a slider phone I generally the slider
phones you have a hard time throw back
missing this top row of buttons because
the screen comes down and hits it
because this unique design is actually
at least amount of space from the screen
to that first row so you're not gonna
have that problem while typing well I do
wish it was a dedicated row for numbers
I can definitely live with this keyboard
it's very very nice easy to type on I
like the big space bar and if you're a
fan of physical QWERTY keywords you're
really gonna like I think what the g2
has to offer go ahead and slide that
back on the top 3.5 milimeter headset
jack and there is your screen lock and
power button conveniently located right
where your finger might be let's go
ahead and power this guy on the SIM card
in there let's see what we're going to
get see if the battery even has any
charging so letting you know this is
built by HTC they are the makers of some
of the the better handsets on the market
really he gets from an industrial feel
to it the g2 is a little bit on the
heavier side i'll but not so heavy it's
gonna be sort of cumbersome to carry
around it's heavy enough to let you know
you've got sort of a quality device
build quality it looks to be very
impressive here at the g2 all right so
we've got your sort of standard stuff
here we'll go ahead and just hit next
we'll skip the setup process here allow
Google to check things out it's not
gonna have a nice to our network
connection now we've got your very
typical sort of Android look there's no
HTC Sense on here much more is there any
of that you've got sort of Froyo in all
of its Froyo Ness you can see all of you
are at touch screen options here a lot
of pre installed applications though a
lot of pre-installed Google application
so goggle is already on here shopper
latitude Google Street View listen go
ahead and see what also gonna come on
here and see it's a sort of
again menu you don't see this very often
on a lot of phones go ahead and move
that off and I'll zoom in just a little
bit so you guys can see what I'm talking
about take a look at all the
applications that are gonna be installed
on here and there is quite a bit so I'll
go ahead and use this phone for a little
while and give you guys a full review
whether you thought the processor lives
up to the hype whether or not the phone
is a worthy to carry that G name to it
the g1 was certainly a very popular
device let's see if the g2 can carry a
flame and you guys leave your questions
down below or anything you want to see
on the t-mobile g2 I'm John retina from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
