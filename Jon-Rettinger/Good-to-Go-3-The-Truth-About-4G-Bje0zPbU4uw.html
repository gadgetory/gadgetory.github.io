good to go I'm Noah crowd so I'm going
to take a break from watching March
Madness on my mobile device here hi and
I'm James Kendrick and I'm gonna keep
watching it while we're recording
because that's just the way I roll if
you're a better multitasker than I am I
have no doubts about that anyway but now
we all know how you doing today what's
going on in Houston besides out you know
the road to the Final Four well that's
the big news here it's coming up as we
know and I guess the other thing is the
the big onslaught of 4G which keeps
coming and hitting us right and left
from all these companies although most
of them were just calling it 4g quite
frankly yeah yeah no I know the the
ability of the American Marketing
machine you know to do things to change
that the international standards for
what's called 4g just amazing I mean it
is timely joking aside and I know we're
both basketball fans and psyched to
watch the the March Madness it is sort
of timely though because because we were
talking before the show and you were
mentioning how Turner who's got the
contract starting this year from March
Madness did a really nice job with their
iOS apps that I you know I i'm watching
i think you might be watching in the
background there as well and you know
stuff like that streaming video is where
the whole 3g versus 4g thing and all the
stuff that goes along with it starts to
really come into play it does and in
fact it's the streaming video that it
does so well which is going to really
come into play with all these data caps
from all these plans because as we know
streaming videos is is the bad things
you can do and eat up all your your your
data cap and then get into overage fees
then so my god this is so expensive what
do i do i know i know i'm a la before i
mentioned my latest experience before g
i will point out james did it last week
i'll do it this week
if you're interested in sponsoring the
show your logo here and yeah you know if
you can hook James up with final four
tickets since it's in his hometown it's
in houston now I'm while I'm waiting
with no tickets you know what to do just
I'm all dressed up and no place to go
drop us a line and you could sponsor the
podcast um so I got this yesterday it
goes on sale today it's verizon's first
4g phone the HTC Thunderbolt verizon
turned on their LTE network up here in
the in San Francisco Bay Area a while
back and I've been playing around with
the pantech modem the USB LTE modem the
speeds have been phenomenal I was
getting you know regularly 15 to 20 to
22 Meg's down and I you know regularly
10 in excess of 10 up and I know you had
a chance to mess around with verizon's
LTE I think even before it officially
rolled out yeah yeah just before rolled
out in Houston they hooked me up and I
got on it and it's just it's a game
changer it was regularly as fast or
faster than my home internet
connectivity which is fast yeah I love
binds about that and I think it is the
4g technology to be quite not my
experience I would agree i would say up
until this point i actually was most
impressed with with t-mobile's hspa+
where they had it turned on you know
sprint was kind of first out of the gate
in the US metropcs first out of the gate
with an LTE phone to imam before verizon
AT&amp;amp;T now you know it's almost like just
to kind of throw their hat in the
marketing ring they've got the they're
callin 4g i did a write up yesterday the
Thunderbolt versus the htc inspire 4G
phone for AT&amp;amp;T no contest I did some
testing in integra mode because the
speed test app doesn't work on
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt too fast for it
and at least where i was testing you
know exact same location both phones
tethering the same way this
computer you know whole thing Verizon
was you know four to five six times
faster than AT&amp;amp;T in some cases but the
thing that you know you kind of alluded
to when we first started talking data
caps similar to you verizon's LTE just
as fast for all intents and purposes is
my home cable modem connection I would
switch in a second except data caps and
for the amount of data that you use with
video and especially you know I we use
streaming netflix all the time now on
our home TV the living room TV set and
that's all data and what the cable modem
doesn't matter you pay flat fee but with
a 4g modem you've got caps there you
know this Thunderbolt for verizon 30
bucks a month standard smartphone plan
unlimited LTE on the phone extra 20 a
month you get two gigs of mobile hotspot
service and probably that unlimited part
in the phone is going to change you know
before Val September yeah well they've
also they're going to metered plans with
LTE speeds for sure so James in your
estimation take it all that into account
and your experiences with the different
providers you've used what would you say
to somebody you know let's say you had a
got an average consumer and then also
somebody more of a business person you
travel a lot or just somebody who use
the device more than average you know on
the go would you recommend stepping up
to a 4G service now and if so or if not
you know why I think if somebody's
already a 3g customer and and that's
working well I don't see running out and
upgrading right away I mean for regular
people wrote eventually yeah you're
probably going to want to because I
think in my experience the the real
upside to the verizon 4g was the
consistency of the connectivity as
opposed to the i'm also sprint 4g wimax
streamer and it works well you know when
you've got coverage but the LTE network
is just consistent it's just never it
never fails and another thing along
those lines because of the differences
in technology of the LTE versus the
others the verizon LTE suffers no signal
degradation indoors right but the group
pointing where they all all the others
do in my experience no great website
your bars drop and that means your speed
drops LTE does not I was it's ironic for
being somebody who's covered you know
mobile for a while that the office i
work at is in a known sort of sketchy
cell phone reception area and when i
first got a wimax device i was finding
that literally moving it from my desk
two feet to holding it slightly out the
window next to my desk could make all
the difference in the world that that's
the line site stuff the business of that
building penetration rather it's it's
for real and i've had the same thing
with LTE not not really a factor for me
anyway so far yeah why max is
particularly subject to the day
interference problem i mean i routinely
go outside and have super fast speeds
and just walk through a door inside and
see my speed drop by half rather write
another in quite frankly it it's usually
still fast enough but right but it does
it's noticeable yeah i talked your over
the past several days about sprint
looking into a move to LTE you know at
some point down the road I mean it
really seems like you know all roads are
kind of moving in that direction
t-mobile kind of as a their longer-term
plan to just keep bumping up the hspa+
capacity faster and faster but you know
you think eventually it's all going LTE
well that seems to be the technology to
be I mean it's it's rolling out now it's
solid so
it's certainly a big convening factor
for these others I don't know what they
will do but I suspect yeah a lot of them
are going to go LTE yet it's
particularly important too because it's
going to have as we saw in the zoom
although it wasn't activated and
probably on your Thunderbolt there I
mean they use a sim card yep for the LTE
service so that that opens up a lot
right right right yep oh and you
mentioned the data caption on the data
caps are interesting because they're a
big deal but for most kind of mobile use
through the things are used to doing you
know the web email instant messaging of
various sorts even you know uploading
and downloading work documents unless
you're getting into lots of multimedia
use lots of streaming video uploading
video you know let like folks like us
have to do for our work you're probably
not going to hit those data caps in a
lot of places but so but but it's kind
of like a I mean it's like a drug once
you start using it you realize you can
do it and you realize you know like in
my case the netflix coming through what
have you you can hit those caps fast
without realizing it and then you're in
for all sorts of hurt when you get your
overcharges yeah video is is the big
culprit with that I i've been using
mobile broadband for years and I I do
not exceed my my monthly limits even
though i use it heavily doing regular
stuff but videos a different man all
right well we promised each other silent
promised to the audience to keep this
one under wraps timewise this week so we
should wrap it up james if people want
more of you where can they find you
what's going on on on your blog right
now i'm at the mobile news blog on ZDNet
and right now the hot topic is typically
tablets because the ipad to launch it's
on everybody's mind it should i get this
or is this one a good competitor I mean
yep I mean that's where all of the
action is right now that's where the
action is and what will go where the
action takes us and find time to talk
about the other relevant things as we
see them all right well until next time
from Oakland California San go hoyas I'm
Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo com
March Madness I'm James Kendrick James
always a pleasure enjoy the madness
we'll see if we can scrounge up some
tickets to the Final Four and let's do
it again next week all right let's do it
alright see ya see ya
