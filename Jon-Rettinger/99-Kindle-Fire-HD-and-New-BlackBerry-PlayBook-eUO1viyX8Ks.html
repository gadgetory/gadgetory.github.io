to you by carbonite welcome back to
other episode of rumor roundup is the
show we take a little rumor from here a
DAB a rumor from their mix it up in a
giant rumor bowl and serve you a
beautifully cooked rumor cake telling
you all the new stuff that might or
might not be coming down the tech pike
over the next few months up this week we
got Galaxy Note 3 point 0 might be
getting a giant earth screen going six
point three inches we might have a
bargain-basement $99 kindle fire HD
coming a new BlackBerry PlayBook is
allegedly in the works or not and a
samsung Smart Watch might be on the way
this is rumor roundup i'm your host jon
rettinger let's get rounding up and we
all know the galaxy note 3 screen is
probably going to be massive the jump
from her generation the second
generation if it told us anything it
means we could expect something big but
just how big of an increase can we
expect could it just be a modest bump
from 5.5 25.8 or maybe even a little bit
bigger 6 no that wouldn't be fun at
least not according to a rumor from late
last year and especially now according
to Samsung's gaming pad accessory that
was revealed in New York we're at the
galaxy s4 launch event the parameters
for the company's gamepad do go from
four inches to six point three inches
and that is freaking John Norma's for a
phone well this is obviously no way
confirmation that the note 3 is going to
get ginormous style they probably have
to make it completely bezel list cuz
could barely fit 5.5 inch note 2 in my
pocket I'm just need bigger pants maybe
Hammer pants will come back in style
Amazon's Kindle Fire family currently
consists of the kindle fire at 159 clams
the kindle fire HD at 199 and two larger
8.9 inch tablets that cost to 699
respectively but the company might be
trying to introduce an even more
affordable tablet with in HD display
which be pretty awesome TechCrunch said
its source of have we
yield that the online retailer has a $99
7-inch kindle fire the work to sport to
1280 x 800 resolution display Amazon's
already admitted that it breaks he gonna
end of every kindle fire they sell so it
would come down to component costs
company currently makes money from the
tablet after used to begin buying stuff
inside of the Amazon ecosystem Thank You
Jessica component cause down perhaps we
might see a pretty awesome $99 kindle
fire HD and they put some ads on like
they tend to do ninety-nine bucks to
certainly at that impulse button I think
would only help the tablet market
penetration blackberry CEO thorsten
heins recently told Australia's Herald
Sun that tablets are a very difficult
business I could have told him that we
went on to suggest that the company
won't be releasing any new tablets
unless I could find an itch that needs
to be filled it seems however though
that someone forgot to send up that memo
to the rest of the company Mike al
muffler director of product management
at blackberry confirmed the Emirates
twenty-four/seven over the weekend the
blackberry's user forum in Dubai that
six new black breaking devices were
introduced in addition to a new version
of the playbook so did one of those
wires get crossed and one of them speak
out of turn I don't know I certainly
love to see a new tab would come there's
a new SmartWatch on the waist and some
execs are confirming samsung recently
introduced a galaxy s4 with the ton of
accessories pudding a smart wristband
that can keep track of calories burned
distance traveled and a ton more this is
an entirely new product screenshots from
Samsung's alleged SmartWatch leaked in
mid-february ish turn off what appeared
to be a version of Android altius
moniker shot suggests the users will not
only be able to check the time Rosso
chick Maps control music Mandarin box
and hopefully a ton more office
obviously it's been rumored here that
Apple 2 is allegedly working on i watch
and we imagine there's going to be a
race to the market in some form or
another samsung and apple also bow thing
to learn from sony's field SmartWatch
pocket shouldn't really let you do
anything besides see your messages and
control basic functions on your phone
what kind of features do you want to see
in a SmartWatch I like to see it as an
extension of the phone that I maybe I
take it out of your pocket so much you
can do all your smartphone stuff I want
it like Dick Tracy's I'll to fruit and
face hang on the watch would be awesome
it's like boom give me another way to
ignore people when I mountain crowds
so let me step aside from the rumors for
a minute to think our friends our
sponsors the lovely beautiful people at
