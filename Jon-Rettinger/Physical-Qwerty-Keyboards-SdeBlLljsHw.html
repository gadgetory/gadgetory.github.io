to you by jack threats what's up
everyone welcome back to their pisode of
renter's rants of this week not so
ranting more of a commentary on the
mobile industry i want to talk about
this guy not the 9900 but what sits
below that screen a keyboard it is an
aging dinosaur of the tech world I want
to talk about my opinions on the
physical keyboards and how things have
just totally changed over the past few
years in mobile world
this is retina trance it's going to get
started let's play a game
ask yourself what was important to you
on a smartphone six years ago chinses
our physical keyboard was high on that
list you should be the only thing that I
wanted to smartphone I remember going to
blackberries BlackBerry products had a
physical keyboard I use old windows
mobile devices because it had that
keyboard I had to have it
on-screen keyboards were awful affair
you had to use a stylus and tap away the
iPhone came and the on-screen keyboards
were ushered out the physical keyboard
yelled suppression the old song video
killed the radio star on-screen
keyboards guilt is a good keyboard and
it was a sad day there's still a lot of
people that really love it but going
through and reading the reviews on
device like blackberry q10 people that
use physical keyboards are being totally
ostracized that's sort of a niche
audience it's just been very interesting
to see how things have changed over the
past six years so for me I still like a
physical keyboard a lot of what I do is
sitting there pecking my emails
on-screen now certainly their other
option to come up things like swipe
which I'm finally learning how to use
but I still have a nostalgic place in my
heart for something like this physical
keyboard to feel the buttons below they
got more in control of what I'm doing on
a phone makes me think what a things
gonna be seven years from now or even
gonna have keyboards on phones they're
gonna put it down you're gonna get a
holographic display you really type on
your desk I want to make some
predictions let's see where Tech is
going to be in seven years so first I
think 1080p is probably as high
resolution we're gonna be able to see
with our eyes but only it's gonna stop
phone manufacturers from making things
higher at high resolution just cuz you
know you're freaking can things will
look clearer the crisper but first thing
individual pixels it's not gonna matter
processors are gonna get faster and
faster and faster I think we're gonna
get 32 core processors I think what we
can do right now on your computer is
what your phones be able to do
seven years we're gonna have a merging
to of mobile device versus home
computers I think eventually all your
home computers gonna be as a monitoring
plug your mobile device in the back that
becomes your home computer
maybe they operate system changes and
more I thought about the back break you
ten and I slipped in my drawer I found
this old 9900 just got me reminisce it
and serve a nostalgic about the physical
keyboard so what did your opinion is if
this go keyboard so important to you
guys is that so matter to you something
that you still need to have on a phone I
still just have a very soft spot in my
heart remember the physical keyboard and
I miss it so I'm excited for the q10 I'm
excited to try it to use it 3 if you
