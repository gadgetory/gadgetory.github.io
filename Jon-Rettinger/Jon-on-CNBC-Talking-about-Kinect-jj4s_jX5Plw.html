holiday season to get that stock going
so far this year microsoft shares are
down more than ten percent apples are up
more than fifty percent or just about
this thursday microsoft will unveil the
highly anticipated connect gaming system
buzz in the gaming world as many
predicting connect could be the hot
holiday item will connect be enough to
move the needle for microsoft shares and
turn around the reputation of Mister
Softee joining us technobuffalo editor
jon rettinger and Walter Pritchard city
software analyst you have both played
the game and I saw Steve Ballmer play
the game with Tom Friedman it's a long
story but it was sort of amazing to
watch it so let me ask you jon rettinger
what is your take is this really going
to amaze and put people leave people in
awe you know when you first look at it
and you see someone play and you see
them moving their hands around it looks
a little gimmicky having seen connect
and played with kinect it actually is as
advertised it tracks your skeletal
movement and it works amazingly well and
i think it's a new paradigm shift for
how we interact nachos with game
consoles bauer eventually can interact
with our televisions and computers
alright what's your take Walter as a
tech analyst do you think it's it's
pretty neat yeah I think I mean I've
played it the probably not as long as
he's played with it I think it's I think
it's pretty neat i think it's you know
it sort of gives second life to to a
game platform the xbox 360 is done
pretty well over the last few years so i
think from a from an investor
perspective naked you know keeps the
company relevant in a market that you
know arguably will be much more
important in the future of something
connected to the TV where they don't
have a position today and we're watching
it right now John you know you see the
guy were now the woman and she's moving
and then the character behind her moves
and it really does literally pick up if
you stop or you're bored or anything it
picks it picks all of that up in your
opinion John how does this compare to
the wii and the wii fit completely blows
it away and this extends far past just
gaming certainly moving the controller
round at their hands is really kind of
interesting but also controls how you
interact with the xbox so you can play
your video content by saying Xbox play
so there's a lot more that it goes
beyond just a movement
it really is a lot of fun people are
going to have to go out there and really
try it and it is just an add-on for the
existing xbox 360 if anybody who has one
will be able to get kinect it's not a
completely new console all right so
Walter will this move the needle for
Microsoft I mean we know we're looking
at maybe two and a half to three million
of these sold certainly that's a way
more than say PlayStation would get I
mean is this going to be the thing that
actually juices microsoft shares now I
think if you're looking at it from a
numbers perspective there's there's
really very little impact I mean it's
this division control contributes say
eight million eight billion in revenue
over the course of the year here I think
though from a longer-term perspective I
think this is a company who's been
pegged with a reputation for not being
able to innovate and I think you know if
this product is indeed successful and
and and and sells well in the market I
think I think they can help somewhat
shed that reputation so I think it's all
sort of a longer-term intangible
positive in that respect and and John
you're the kind of guy who's going to
set that reputation people like you out
blogging who are always blogging about
sexy products like iPhones and not about
Microsoft do you think that this will
change that absolutely i think it's
going to do wonders to changes
perception about Microsoft and people go
out there and actually see it and they
see this in their friends house and they
see the news media actually playing its
give me one of those things that you
really have to experience and go out
there and try for yourself and there's a
lot of synergy between the xbox platform
and the Windows operating system so
there's sort of a lot of interest for
how this is going to affect the next
generation with those operating system
as well I think Microsoft definitely has
a winner on their hand all right Walter
you got the vote of the guys who are
gonna make the call on that do you think
it's going to end up being worth it from
Microsoft to spend what we've seen is
potentially five hundred million dollars
in marketing by Christmas yeah I think I
mean I think they sunk a lot of costs
into Xbox those are those are years
behind them at this point now they're
generating profits I think I think
anything incremental like this is
definitely worth it and you know the
returns are at this point positive okay
well gentlemen thanks very much we
appreciate it you I'm where jon
rettinger Steve Ballmer is giving you a
big pat in the back but just made that
guy's day all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
