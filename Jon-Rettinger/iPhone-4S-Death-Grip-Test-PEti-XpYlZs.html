from TechnoBuffalo here one of the
problems that plagued the original gsm
iphone 4 was the death grip Apple had to
hold a special keynote eventually give
out free bumpers what happened is when
you held the phone with your left hand
you bridged a connection right here
between the antennas and you lost signal
or resulted in severe signal degradation
well have they fixed that on the iPhone
4s
let's death grip it and take a look
all right so first I want to illustrate
the death grip so I've got a iPhone four
here on AT&amp;amp;T this is uh the original
iPhone 4 you can see the signal strength
right there is about three bars so I
will go ahead and hold it as tight as I
can in my left hand and we'll watch
those signal bars right there and see
what happens now give it a few seconds
there we go one bar drop down so we can
get it to go down one more and this is
oftentimes how people hold the phone
when they make a phone call hold it in
their left hand the palm of their hand
bridges that gap and then they're all
kinds of trouble so you drop down one
bar it looks like we're gonna stay with
only up drop down one more you can see
see what's happening here the bars and
the signal keep dropping eventually it
could say no signal or if you're on a
call I would drop so here it is
illustrate on the iPhone 4 nothing great
here is the iPhone 4s let's go ahead and
see if we have the same issue so we've
got full bars of service so that's an
interesting thing right there you can
see same same location but better
service so there's that little gap I'm
gonna go ahead and hold the phone
exactly the same way and let's see what
happens so I'll give it this about the
same amount of time and see if we have
any sort of signal delegation here in
case you're wondering that little icon
right there means call forwarding send
out the commenters are probably gonna
ask about that so so far so good we
haven't seen anything drop down well it
keep going keep holding here and see if
this situation has been fixed and my
hand is bridging the entire thing I just
as it was on the iPhone 4 and we haven't
even had one bar drop down so it appears
the death grip is a thing of the past no
more special keynotes no more free
bumpers has been fixed on the iPhone 4s
this is the AT&amp;amp;T variant but of course
it's the same variant now for all
carriers where the GSM or CDMA so we can
put this debate to rest
