to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys
Markham's hangin here from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be taking a look at
three paid games we're playing right now
on android now last week we showed you
guys some free games we were playing and
just like last week's video today we're
going to be using the LG G flex 2 which
is running the latest Snapdragon 800
series processor from Qualcomm so these
games that we're about to play should
run pretty smoothly let's kick things
off with x-men days of future past which
is going for three dollars and
ninety-nine cents now even though the
movie has been out for quite some time
now this is the first time we're seeing
it on Android the game itself is a
side-scroller and it actually reminds me
a lot of the old super nintendo x-men
game I used to play when I was a kid so
if you know what I'm talking about you
get some pretty cool brownie points from
me now you'll be playing as Wolverine
storm Cyclops Shadowcat just to name a
few characters and talking about the
game itself it actually revolves around
the same storyline as the movie you're
playing against a bunch of enemies in
two separate timelines the past and the
future and the controls aren't bad for a
mobile game since it's a side-scroller
there's only a few buttons on here the
left and right button on the left hand
side of advice and jump and attack
swipes on the right hand side of the
device now the game itself isn't super
challenging but just like when I first
played Angry Birds I wanted to get three
stars in every stage and that's how i
feel about this game so there's a little
bit of replayability if you are a
perfectionist overall this is a really
fun x-men game you can unlock new
characters costumes upgrade your skills
and of course try to get three stars in
every stage a highly recommended if you
are in x-men the next one on our list is
monument valley which is going for three
dollars and ninety-nine cents now in
Monument Valley you play as the silent
princess Ida and you have to navigate
through ten different levels seems
pretty easy right not really so this is
where your patience your mind and your
eyes really need to work together the
game consists entirely of traversal
puzzles and you need to figure out a way
for princess Ida to reach the top of the
towers so each part of the tower can be
twisted extended moved or rotated around
and everything about Monument Valley is
soothing almost hypnotic it's a really
pretty game layered with warm colors and
simple shapes now I thought the game was
pretty easy
in the earlier levels but once you get
to the last couple of stages it gets
pretty challenging it can be a pretty
addicting game even if you're not into
puzzle games like myself the graphics
the music the gameplay it all works
really well now even though Monument
Valley only has 10 stages the gameplay
is definitely worth the top dollar
there's an expansion available for a
dollar in 99 cents as an in-app purchase
and you'll get eight additional stages
on top of the original ten stages so the
last one on our list is counterspy which
is going for four dollars and
ninety-nine cents counterspy is a pretty
awesome to the 3d side-scrolling game
you're a covert agent trying to avert a
nuclear disaster by infiltrating Soviet
bases stealing missile launch plans and
eliminating enemies gameplay is pretty
straightforward as well you have your
basic tutorials in the beginning
teaching you how to move how to shoot
hide from enemies though the swipe
gesture controls can be pretty weird at
times it'll definitely take some time
getting used to so the main objective of
the game is to essentially locate five
computers and destroy them all while
evading or killing the guards that get
in your way now there are two ways to
kill an enemy in this game you can
either go in stealth and knock them down
or go loud and shoot everything in front
of you additional objectives include
unlocking save swear you'll find
blueprints to unlock new weapons and
abilities for future missions now mostly
every part of this game is played from a
2d perspective hiding behind a cover
will change the perspective to 3d giving
you an ideal outlook of what's in front
of you but for the most part you're
relying on the 2d aspect of the game all
in all it's a pretty fun game and does a
good job of keeping players engaged
