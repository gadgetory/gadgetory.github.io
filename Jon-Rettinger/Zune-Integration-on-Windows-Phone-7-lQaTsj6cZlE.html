zune integration on windows phone 7 it's
going get started all right let's do it
so will toggle a on here to the music
hub music and video have
and for all you that are familiar with
zune out there the zune HD this looks
very familiar this is a bit basically
where you access all your media library
where there's music video podcasts all
the phones will have an FM radio just
like a zune HD but you can also access
the marketplace here to purchase music
and video through the service but it's a
click into the music music catalog here
and just similar to zune HD if you want
to jump to a to a specific artist we get
the same familiar kind of interface
there so I jump right down to the peas I
can just click the play button and we'll
just start playing very similar to what
you what you get on the zune HD as well
all the music that you're going to play
in your phone this music doesn't have to
be purchased in this inservice it could
be mp3's that you purchase through some
other servers like Amazon or
non-protected tracksuit Porsche to my
kids or just DVDs or CDs that you've
ripped or sell all that will be managed
to the zune software on your PC which is
the way that you get media onto your
phone but as long as it's not protected
we take all that all those file formats
in and then we put it on your under your
phone so you can toggle over here and
sort by album's songs
playlist and pump back out here this is
going to show your history very similar
to how the zune HD works today and this
is really cool if you wanted to pick
back up off where you left so let's say
you took the bus to get off the bus had
to go to work you want to pick off where
you pick up where you left off on the
bus when you go home you can jump right
back into it and that's true for a song
video or a podcast backpack out here
click here and this will show you your
history this is one of my favorite
features because as as if a subscriber
and I'll show you new to their similar
this is impasse subscriber you know
you're probably downloading lots of
stuff listing lots of music so before I
jump on the bus you know I'm gonna go
download five new albums but if you have
a big collection on your phone you might
not remember exactly what you download
it so this is a great way to see like
hey this is the stuff that most recently
got added to my phone and if you're a
podcast listener it's really cool
because every time there's a new episode
of your favorite podcast it will show up
here and just let you know hey go check
it out we can toggle back over here and
this will be where other applicant other
music and video applications or service
as well so if you download let's say
iheartradio from Clear Channel or
last.fm or something like that those are
actually listed here I within the music
video hub and that's the same way for
games too if your the download other
games the idea is that everything music
and video should be in the music and
video hub and so we're trying to
organize information and applications
that are similar into one logical place
developers have access to these guys
this will be this familiar
correct yeah I mean you're the developer
tools are really rich so that people can
take care take advantage of this kind of
pivot interface that that we have here
in the hub as well and then they also
have the appropriate protocols to be
able to make sure that their application
shows up on this in this kind of apps
view as well what determines the
background the background is your last
track play so it'll and all that all
that metadata is brought in as you
download music and it's very small to
impress but and that's what major you
know zune really really nice too so
let's go you can see the little Ken
Burns effect that happens to the tile
which is really cool at all about those
live tiles on the Start screen you see
that motion is a big part of the way
this phone works if we pop back into
their again for all those that are you
know zoom fans out there this will be
familiar let's do the video Carol
Anderson Cooper action
music
akon you see here they'll show you your
albums songs from Akon as well and then
you can access his bio album information
all this stuff is cached when you
download this music you're also able to
pop down here and I'll show you other
tracks from a condor in our marketplace
that aren't on your phone yeah so get if
your zune pass subscriber you just press
play and start restreaming that over the
network or download it and add it to
your collection on the hub so that's
quick tour of the zune and music video
hub on biggest ones thank you very much
brighter pre-k don't worry
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
