am Robert Rosenfeld and this is the show
that breaks down the top stories the
Czech world and gives you the info that
you really need to know about and if you
haven't been so much a fan of all the
rumors we've been doing a novel products
then you're gonna be very happy today
because today's episode is absent of
anything iPhone or Apple related at all
I've got more news on the enormous Lea
leaked pixel three in three Excel also
Google may be launching their own smart
display with Google assistant built-in
and the LG the forty looks to be a five
camera smartphone let me break down all
these stories and give you everything
you need to know here's the lowdown
we have covered the many leaks of the
pixel three and three XL extensively on
the lowdown and check out our deep dive
video if you haven't seen it already not
much has changed since we last rounded
up all the rumors but as we get closer
and closer to this google event the
leaks just seem to keep coming we're now
seeing alleged press renders of the new
pixel 3 and 3 XL and both phones look
identical to the images and even the
video we've already showed you here
before both phones are in Google's own
fabric cases which launched back with
the pixel two last year and show pretty
much everything we are expecting to see
when these phones finally launch in just
a matter of weeks we're gonna see a
notch on the larger pixel three XL no
notch on the smaller pixel 3 a single
camera set up on the back of both of
these phones along with a finger reader
that looks to be sticking around on
these new generation of pixel phones
we're also expecting to see a glass back
for wireless charging a new and improved
camera system with super selfies and
both phones will be running Android 9 pi
out of the box we're still missing some
details on pricing and availability and
maybe even the introduction of a face
unlock feature on these pixel phones but
all will be revealed as soon enough when
Google finally takes the wraps off of
these new pixel phones and a new york
city event on October 9th and the pixel
3 &amp;amp; 3 XL are not the only devices
leaking from Google today we're also
seeing new leaked images showcasing what
appears to be Google's own smart display
alleged photos of the Google home smart
hub surface this morning showcasing
Google assistants running on a
seven-inch screen along with what
appears to be a speaker on the back of
the base that holds the display and
Google has been working with
manufacturers like Lenovo and LG for a
while to put Google assistant onto home
devices with attached speakers and
screens so the idea of the company
building their own seems kind of like a
no-brainer and this device looks very
nice there isn't a whole lot to learn
from the leaked specifications it'll
have a Wi-Fi radio built-in as well as
Bluetooth a physical mute toggle and
close integration with all Google
services including Google photos and
nest security cameras that can really
take advantage of having that display
we're also hearing some reports that the
Google home hub could come with a
starting price tag of a hundred and
fifty dollars which would definitely be
an aggressive price point in this
more home market so I want to ask you
guys this question would you buy a
Google smart home hub if it costs only
$150 do you see the appeal of Google
assistant on a screen does this device
sound appealing to you at all and what
are you willing to pay for it leave a
comment down below and let us know for
your chance to be featured on the next
episode of the lo comp LG sent out press
invites last week saying take 5 hinting
at something big coming to the next lg
flagship phone the LG v40 thin queue is
rumored to have a 5 camera setup on the
phone
a triple shooter system on the back and
two cameras on the front the three back
lenses are rumored to be a 20 megapixel
primary lens a 16 megapixel wide-angle
lens and a 13 megapixel telephoto lens
with the two front lenses allegedly
configured in a stereo left and right
sort of position that could be used for
some sort of 3d facial scanning feature
below those cameras on the front is
rumored to be a large almost bezel s
display along with a dedicated Google
Assistant button near the volume rocker
on the side of the phone a fingerprint
reader on the back we should know more
about the v40 thin queue soon LG is
holding an event in New York City to
publicly show off the phone and that
event is going to be before the pixel
event this one being on October 3rd in
the last episode lowdown I asked you
guys what was important to you in a
phone what qualities and characteristics
do you look for when you go to buy phone
and Windows Windows Master sorry if I'm
mispronouncing that they gave this list
I think most people will agree with one
excellent display two excellent camera
three durable metal and number four
longevity software updates of hardware
issues etc and I definitely agree with
this list I also look at the display the
build quality software updates see if
there's any firmware issue stuff like
that one going to by phone I think this
is a list that pretty much everyone can
agree on is important when looking to
buy a new phone and that is all the tech
news I've got for today thank you as
always so much for watching and I will
be back here on Thursday to break down
the headlines and talk more tech news
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
