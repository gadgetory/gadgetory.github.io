polarizing as Apple himselves they're
either innovation embodied or an angry
set of emojis about why anyone would
ever spend over 14-under bucks for
aspect out Max and I'm not here to try
to change anyone's mind but I am gonna
do at least hopefully stuff we decide if
either of these two new phones are right
for you I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and this is our review of
the iPhone 10s and the 10s max
so I want to start with a bit of
perspective about how far things have
come since 2007 an original iPhone the
10s max has over 21 times the resolution
of that first iPhone mobile technology
has evolved crazy fast and with it kind
of our expectations too so I'm gonna
work backward and start this review by
saying if you currently have an iPhone
10 you can happily and confidently sit
this gen out with one exception that
we're gonna get to but if you're coming
from anything older or from Android this
gen is a really awesome entry point to
get the latest from Apple so design why
is Apple's continuing the iPhone 10
design language in fact just looking at
a 10 into 10s head-on be pretty hard
pressed to tell a difference so despite
not being obvious the refinements are
there you just kind of gotta know where
to look for example a weird choice for
Apple a company that generally obsesses
over small details is asynchronous
speaker grille at the bottom
functionally it was done to accommodate
for the new extra antenna bands which
does positively impact reception but
just looks off the banding around the
frame is also a bit curvier and it now
features ip68 for better water
resistance and there's in your gold
color which I picked up so I can tell
the difference inside obviously things
have changed as well but I promise we're
gonna get there the max is where at
least aesthetically things start to look
different which for a lot of Apple oil
lists is enough of a reason alone to
upgrade the screen jumps from 5.8 the
6.5 inches and fills the void left by
the former Plus series of devices and
despite being big it's actually a
smaller footprint and then note 9 the
pixel 2 XL and almost identical to the
A+ if you need to see how one would feel
in your hand this is a tough phone to
navigate one-handed even with reach
ability and even if you have larger
hands it becomes for the most part of
two-handed affair with that extra screen
real estate it's really disappointing to
not see the OS take advantage of it
things are just bigger and for some
that's enough but for me I'd really like
to see things like side-by-side
multitasking and floating a video all
feature is that most of their large
screen competition are now offering did
you'll get dual panes in some core apps
but really appreciate more for such a
big screen and speaking of screens the
iPhone 10 had one of the best in the
business that's no surprise the 10 s and
10 Macs have incredible displays the Ola
tech shows off the really dark blacks as
you'd expect colors are bright and
vibrant the movies games apps whatever
you're doing just look really good and I
feel like notches at this point are like
most politicians I don't like them but I
accept that they're necessary but I do
want to point out that Apple is one of
the few manufacturers who've actually
bent the display to avoid having notch
into chin so credit where it's due with
Apple at least they're not chides a true
depth sensor that enables face ID I know
it's supposed to be faster this time
around but I honestly haven't really
noticed it but I ever really thought it
was slow on the iPhone 10 in fact I
prefer it to touch ID but I recognize
that's more of a preference thing I
really do enjoy using it for things like
apathetic ation Apple pay and usually a
seamless unlock assuming you don't mind
picking the phone up to do it I never
felt like the iPhone 10 was slow but the
10s and 10's Mac come with the
obligatory speck bumps powering them is
the HMO of ionic and although Apple
doesn't advertise it brands been up to
you're from you three gigabytes to four
predictably everything is really smooth
absolutely quickly gestures are buttery
smooth animations are snappy it just
feels fast you invit doesn't feel much
faster than the 10
the cameras though are where the real
differences are and if you are just
gonna look at a spec sheet or even the
design of the devices you won't see the
whole picture the improvements though is
in the usage and the machine learning
and most importantly the photos
themselves so there are three different
cameras a seven megapixel selfie cam and
two rear-facing 12 megapixel sensors the
wide-angle lens is now a bit wider and
it's got a new bigger sensor with faster
focus and the other is telephoto it's
the same as the iPhone 10 colours and
photos are really vibrant more than in
past years they always look completely
accurate at least to my eye but but I
kind of dig it
get it's a preference thing and if you
don't like it it could be dialed back it
it's not your damn pictures also look
extra sharp to my eye this time around
give the images a real crisp look smart
HDR is also a pretty big deal and I dama
Crane jiz really impressive portrait
mode is still a work in progress but
solid now you can adjust aperture after
the fact an apple is definitely not the
first company to do this but it is a
nice addition the front camera though is
gonna split some folks
there's some pretty aggressive noise
reduction going on it's creating kind of
a smoothing Beauty effect it doesn't
really bother me but something you
should at least know about the cameras
boil down to this they are all really
good and when held up to images from the
iPhone 10 it's a big improvement
if you want the best Cameron mobile I
still think it's made by Google but if
you want the best camera set up Apple
has to offer this is a big reason to
upgrade from the iPhone 10 now you put
stock in DxO mark the iPhone 10x max got
a score 105 the second highest score
they've ever given to a mobile phone
second only to the 109 given to the p20
pro so when it comes to battery life
both of these phones will easily last
you a day and that should be the minimum
of what you expect from phones
I don't mind charging at night but don't
make me at the top off mid day and my
usage is the max well taking off the
charger around like 6:00 a.m. and plug
it in around 11 p.m. and she had about
40 ish percent left speaking of charging
I know I'm not alone here but you can
now turn your phone off and wirelessly
charged at night there's with the 10 and
the iPhone 8 it would randomly turn on
at some point I'm not gonna really
comment on the not charging with the
screen off issue since as of this
filming a software fix is in beta
so buy time most of you see this it
can't be an issue at all what is an
issue though is Apple still including a
5 watt charger in the box which is
mind-boggling at this price so the big
question and the new iPhones worth it
well I don't think any phone is worth
more than $1000 but I so buy a lot of
stuff that are necessarily worth the
price and not wager you do to their
coming from any iPhone other than an
iPhone 10 that's an incredible upgrade
and one I don't think you'll regret
we're debating switching OS allegiances
the same applies to you but get the best
Apple ass offer in a package that's
overall pretty impressive are they
perfect absolutely not but they are
really good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
