I'd like to do a dramatic intro orderly
I tell you all about the history of
Samsung S series devices from the first
S to the eighth iteration but this
thing's been leaked like crazy so meet
your old friend the Galaxy s8 there's
some stuff here that's new that maybe it
didn't know about but if somebody who's
had a chance actually holds the device
let me tell you what it's like to hold
feel what the experience is like with
Samsung's latest flagship any discussion
about the Samsung Galaxy S they should
start and stop with the screen so the s8
got big it's a five point eight inch
screen but it's not as giant as you
might think
in fact 83% of the entire front of the
phone is that beautiful AMOLED plus
display nothing on the specs she's going
to jump out the story here is more of
how these part two work together for the
whole but just so you're aware
Snapdragon 835 in the US XE knows
variants elsewhere that 5.8 inch quad HD
plus the resolution of 29 60 by 1440
that gives it a really solid 570 PPI
when it comes to battery life at least
now you expect seems like to be really
thoroughly spent a good portion the
presentation talking about their eight
point battery safety test so they didn't
squeeze a gigantic battery in here focus
a lot on making the battery just last
longer and is a 3000 milliamp hour
battery in the galaxy Fe so the camera
on the SI it's going to make you either
happy or bit disappointed it's the same
sensor we saw on the note 7 the same
sensor that's sitting on probably the
phone on your desk the s7 or the s7 edge
it's still a really good 12 megapixel
shooter but would have liked the
improvement especially on a new phone
the approvement though were saved for
the front megapixel sensor that's now
eight megapixel with an F 1.7 aperture
as steeple on Samsung phones has been
that oval physical home button that is
gone the home button moved to the back
very curiously located next to the
fingerprint sensor and you think about
logistically how your hands going to sit
when you tap that you're going to be
smudging the heck at Atal megapixel
sensor on the back that's not the only
way you can unlock your phone though
simply include the iris scanning
technology we found
galaxy s7 as well as crazy-fast
face detection which as I tested you can
see work like I said crazy fast there's
now a pressure sensitive area on the
bottom of the phone lets you access the
home button so pretty much you can just
press hard there in any app it'll take
you home but when you are that home
screen you'll see on screen back and
most anybody also new here is Big B
Simpson's new AI which you're going to
hear a ton about over pretty much every
Samsung device coming out over the next
few years it's they're intelligent user
interface and Samsung is claiming
anything you can do with your finger you
can do with your voice with big feet
so bic we've got cognitive tolerance
they'll kind of know what you're doing
so if you're having a conversation with
your friends and you say send the last
picture it'll know to send the last
picture that you took and i'll send it
to that friend and one of the things I
really like about Bixby instead of just
saying I can't do that whatever you ask
it allows you questions to get that job
done underneath the big speak umbrella
you also have big speed visions there's
going to be a little button inside of
the camera apps and tap that and it's
going to centrally give you a grant to
the reality point the camera at a
restaurant
I'll give you reviews pointed at a
camera and yet electronic or device I'll
tell you prices books you don't tell you
it's adopted what it's going to be about
you can do a lot of cool stuff and it
should get better as the AI tends to
learn more so storage on all the SH
they're going to be 64 gigs but you can
up that with a micro SD card of 256 or
higher at a target support and other
Samsung staples you'd expect you're also
on board here you've got fast charging
via USB see you've got fast wireless
charging and of course ip68 I know a lot
of you have knocked on Samsung for the
software in the past and myself included
they stepped out of their own way here
the launcher looks good
Samsung thing to stick with what they
did well and took out a rest of the
flock so the UI seems pretty solid this
time around so aside from the Galaxy s8
and the SI plus stenciling unveiled a
slew of new things to go along with them
we've got a new Samsung Connect home
it's a mesh Wi-Fi system with smart
things built in Samsung decks is
Samsung's desktop docking station
essentially you get the power of the
keyboard mouse all powered from your
phone it's akin so what you've got with
Microsoft's continuum they drop your
phone in you're going to get full access
to all of your stuff support for every
droid app is going to be there they
worked really closely with Microsoft to
get support for full office and own
windows as well as trying to get
virtualization for Windows 10 coming
also got a new gear VR through gear VR
controller it's going to be backwards
compatible with the obviously the s8 but
the s7 or the note 5 with some adapters
thrown in and the last new thing they
announced is a gear 360 smaller it does
4k now actually livestream @qk got kind
of a new bulb issue periscope edesign so
that is the s8 and all of its
accessories of friends if you want to
learn more about the Galaxy s8 plus
links that down below or we will link it
on screen so go ahead and click it and
take a look and as you guys going to
pick one of these things up if you are
which color if you're not why not leave
in the comments down below and let us
know so next time Jon render some
technical
