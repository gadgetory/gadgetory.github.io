editor technobuffalo calm and i'm here
with a look at the Rayman legends demo
for Wii U let's check it out alright so
this demo is available for free right
now in the Nintendo eShop for Wii U
owners and it comes with 30 plays I
think that's pretty standard for the wii
u demos i believe they all come with 30
plays but i might be completely making
that up I just wanted to start it off by
going into this unlock area and grabbing
the new hero she's brand into the game
unlike anything and the other ones and
before you ask what's on the gamepad and
what's on the TV what you're seeing on
the TV is exactly what's on the gamepad
in this level especially all you're
seeing on the gamepad is exactly what's
on the screen so before you ask why I'm
not showing the gamepad for the wii u
just know that nothing's happening there
the gamepad gameplay in this demo is
simply tap you just tap and slide on the
screen just like you would on any other
gamepad or tab order an antenna 3es this
demo is the same one that i actually had
the good fortune of playing at e3 and
then again at a press demo that Nintendo
held in New York City before that we use
launch so I am familiar with it for the
first bit I've never played it solo
before and I've kind of wondered how
that would work out because when you're
playing this game with multiple players
on the wii u the characters running on
screen are actually using the Nintendo
Wii remotes that are compatible with the
system and kind of platforming exactly
as they would have been with Rayman
Origins the game from last year that
really blew my mind ah but the gamepad
user is actually just tapping so we'll
get to his section later you'll know
it's pretty apparent in and start that
but for now i am using the gamepad to
run and jump and everything else so if
you do own the gamepad this is not
game that will make you use the Wii
Remote moment to play traditionally you
can use the gamepad there I don't know
if it features that nice off-screen play
where I can turn off my TV and take this
game upstairs and continue to play on my
gamepad ok so here it's going to ask me
to switch to my gamepad there you go so
now on the pad I'm seeing exactly what
you see on the TV and it's just showing
me touch icons just touch this eyeball
watch this and that's all you do when
you're playing with multiple players
it's really fun here the computers just
kind of taking care of everything for me
while I kind of tickle bad guys like a 2
here and make my way through the level
as Murphy the exploding omnipresent
fairy when you're playing this game with
friends though what's interesting is
that when you're playing is Murphy you
can either help or hinder them here it
doesn't make much sense to enter the
computer because I'm not really giving
anyone a hard time but when i played
this set press demos with fellow writers
and guys that I've known for a while it
was fun to just you know grab a platform
and slide it out from under them as they
walked over it that was hilarious here
solo it's an interesting gameplay
mechanic but it's not one that I think
would make the game two entirely fun so
it's nice to know that Ubisoft doesn't
make it so that that's all you can do
with the gamepad hopefully with New
Super Mario Brothers you the only way
that you can play with multiple players
is if you all use the Wii Remote and you
can play with the gamepad but you're not
allowed to play as Mario Luigi or one of
the toads instead you're kind of forced
to only lay blocks it's really boring
and I love Mario but I'm going to be the
first to say that planting blocks for
players to play on is not very fun here
it is actually enjoyable to play with
the gamepad it's not something I'd want
to do all the time but if someone asked
me to I wouldn't roll my eyes inside so
this demo has changed up a little bit
these rooms were a little bit more
difficult in the press demos that I
played and I guess they might have just
made them easier for the sake of this
demo hopefully they return to the
original difficult to win the game
only comes out rayman legends was
supposed to be a wii u launch title now
it's been pushed to a launch window
title the release date is sometime this
spring i might be march again i could be
making that up I don't know so I will
say that I was a big fan of Rayman
Origins I played it once on the 360 and
then again on the PS Vita when it
launched with that handheld I loved it
both times on the 360 I played the game
almost exclusively as a multiplayer
title I might have romped through it
once or twice just for fun but it was
something that I always busted out what
my friends came over and then for the PS
Vita I wound up completing it again and
earning all the trophies it's one of
those games it's just a lot of fun
there's so much charm here and the art
style is gorgeous we're recording this
video in 720p but I believe that it
outputs in 1080 the only reason we're
recording in 720 is because the capture
equipment that i have is limited to 720
so sorry about that but again with with
Rayman Origins the art style on the
gameplay was so smooth and simple and
gorgeous that the game really saw it
looks like they're repeating that for
the women you like I said this is
currently a wii u exclusive for a little
tidbit i did actually ask ubisoft e3 if
they would be releasing this on other
platforms before the wii u exclusivity
was announced specifically and they just
said we're not talking about anything
else right now that hasn't changed but
maybe there's hope that it'll come out
for other platforms so the game is that
don't own the way you can try this title
out i'm already looking forward to it
i'm going to let the demo play out from
here soon because this is a music level
if you listen to the instruments in the
background notes that gives you my cues
for jumping Rayman Origins had these
perpetual running levels where you were
challenged with getting from point A to
point B without stopping that's what
this is here it's a very early level it
is not challenging at all this is the
first time i played it since i had the
demo installed on my wii u but check it
out and follow us at TechnoBuffalo com
for more gaming news thanks for watching
guys
well I mean I
when I me
happy
