to you by Squarespace kindle fire apple
and woz and dream cars jon rettinger
zewail i'm noah kravitz and this is ask
the Buffalo what is going on everybody
happy monday of noah kravitz
editor-at-large for technobuffalo
welcome to another edition of ask the
Buffalo I'm filling in for jon rettinger
this week which is my pleasure it's a
fun show to do he will be back so don't
worry he reads your questions he wants
to answer him and somebody asked had
John how do you get your hair so perfect
i'm obviously not equipped to answer
that question i don't have to do
anything i just look naturally that's
good anyway let's get to the questions
you can submit questions to ask the
Buffalo via our website or via Twitter
on Twitter use the hashtag ask the BAS
Katie heb and on the website every week
we put out a call for questions so just
go over to TechnoBuffalo com just read
everything because it's worth it it's
you know it's great tech news and
reviews and eventually you'll find the
post that's asked the buffaloid ubique
oh yeah that's what I came here for so
there you go alright let's get right to
it the first question comes from hits
vara 51 he or she wants to know do you
think the Kindle Fire will be a serious
contender in the tablet market yes
absolutely but it's going to be
different the thing that Amazon is doing
which is so smart and speaks to the ways
that the other tablet makers not named
Apple have so far failed to capture
market share is they're playing to their
own strengths they're not trying to
outdo Apple Apple got the prime mover
advantage they have the infrastructure
with the iTunes Store the apps the
success of the iPad and their ability to
make very intuitive easy-to-use software
for touchscreens and they took that and
you know the story goes originally they
wanted to release a tablet way back when
but different you know different things
the availability of large touch screen
panels that were high quality other
stuff in the market they decide you know
what let's go with the smartphone first
and so they released the iphone several
years later ipad came out now they
command something like you know 95% plus
of the market so while you've got
samsung
in a sous and HTC and all these other
companies trying to outdo the iPad on
the iPads terms amazon is coming in and
saying no no you know what we're gonna
do a different way we're going to
release a very low-cost tablet that's
all about media media and services that
we already offer so it's a shopping
machine it's a video machine it's a book
reading machine it's a music playing
machine it's it's been you know there
have been reports that amazon's losing
money on each kindle fire they sell
they've been reports they're making a
little bit of money either way really
what it is it's a hook to get you into
the Amazon ecosystem because this thing
is going to make it super easy for you
to get everything through Amazon
especially if it comes with a you know
comes to the trial prime account prime
is a prime is addictive to me like candy
is to jon rettinger once you have prime
you think to yourself oh well why buy it
anywhere else amazon probably has it and
i get free 2-day shipping anyway so I
you know the Kindle Fire an interesting
device on its own right it looks like
the software is really well done ties
into all the services that lots of
people want web it's got an app store
music video books magazines newspapers
all that stuff but then it also serves
as a front end for what really is you
know one of the largest shopping malls
in the world in amazon com so yes I
think it will be a big content a big
success definitely a contender but a
little bit different than what we think
of right now as a contender in the
tablet device in the tablet market
Matthew Jackson what do you think it's
steve wozniak return to apple as a new
spokesman what's the likelihood of this
happening not going to happen woz has
taken a different path you know Kathie
Lee Griff Griff ered Dancing with the
Stars gripper to set an anchor no Kathie
Lee um talk about Dancing with the Stars
all that stuff was just kind of on his
own trajectory you know when you lose
when a landmark event happens in a
person's life you lose a dear friend
family member someone like that you know
sometimes people their lives suddenly
take a different direction it's like
they have a revelation or something
happens they decide to you know sort of
scrap the course that are on and go go
somewhere else so I suppose that could
happen with woz but I don't personally
see Steve Wozniak coming back into the
Apple fold in an official manner
I think you know I think he's doing his
thing he's more of the affable guy he
likes to play with tech and do lots of
different stuff and not kind of the
hardcore businessman and visionary that
that Steve Jobs evolved into in his time
with apple and away from Apple and back
with Apple so I don't think it will
happen I think you know having was
around in the capacity that he's in sort
of an unofficial ambassador for Apple
has been good and you know you never
know Never Say Never but but I don't i
wouldn't expect at any time soon

quote from number two
Danny mal has a question via
technobuffalo calm and I I I stole this
one away you probably want to know what
car what John's dream cars maybe he can
answer it as well in a future episode
but I had this this one caught my
interest because I become kind of a big
car geek in my fantasy life not my real
life so I will answer the question daddy
wants to know what kind of car do you
drive and what kind of car would you
drive if you could have any car in the
world assuming that you had to pay the
insurance as the taxes and that sort of
stuff good question i like these
questions where it's not just like
Fantasyland but there's a little bit of
reality grounded to it like you can have
any car you want but you gotta pay for
upkeep and all that cast so currently
i'm in a two-car household we have a
2009 toyota prius hybrid that was
actually the first car that i ever
bought right a hand and buying all the
other cars I've ever driven have been
either there's one hand me down and the
others were like my family you know my
parents car they let me drive that kind
of stuff so we've the Prius and then we
have a 1995 mercedes benz c280 which was
a hand me down so we've got you know
hybrid future tech the whole thing and
then an older german car that's got like
140,000 miles on it and is still a blast
to drive if i could have any car in the
world to drive a dream car well i have
to answer for one is i'm still enamored
of the Tesla Model S I've never driven
it never even been in one they won't let
me go in at just stuff on the outside at
CES but I think that car looks great i'm
a big fan of the maserati quattroporte
just the design of it and the s you know
has similar lines to it with the
fastback styling the hatchback adds a
little bit of practicality it seats they
say you can seat seven five adults and
then two kids in the back facing
backwards I don't know if I had two kids
I don't know if I'd trust that but you
know offers a little bit of practicality
and then the performance package goes 0
to 60 in like 4.5 seconds and that's
pure electric so assuming that thing
drives like they're advertising when it
finally comes out I think that would be
the dream car because it's a combination
of practicality functionality
eco-friendliness future tech and sexy
sexy lon
that being said right now cars that are
on the market I would go with a BMW
diesel I would want a wagon imported
from Europe because they don't sell that
many Diesel's here in the states based
on what they sell in the states i would
get a 335d sedan because again you know
have as much practicality that's what I
want the wagon haul stuff around I'm a
drummer and you just have more
flexibility and that kind of stuff but
those three series cars handle great fun
to drive and the diesel you know makes
it the most fuel-efficient car in the
North American lineup the 335d but you
have a ton of torque so even though you
might not be able to take an m3 off the
line once you're up to speed and you're
driving sort of normally on the freeway
you can pass anybody that kind of thing
it's probably too much car for me to
handle I'm not that great of a driver
but I think that's what I would go with
the Model S when they ship or for now
you know I'd want to import a diesel in
Billy wagon ride takes 335d there you go
there's the answer John you know I know
I know John has said some some he's
whispered some sweet nothings into an
Aston Martin's ear once or twice in his
life so we have to get him to answer
that question all right there we go it's
asked the Buffalo again Noah kravitz

questions but I had a blast doing it
ought to see if I'll let me come back
