from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of one of these smallest blackberries
around this is the new curve 9360 for
AT&amp;amp;T let's go ahead and open it up so
this guy is available now on a two-year
contract you're gonna want to check the
carrier's website for pricing let's go
ahead and rip open the box run through
the specs and do all that good unboxing
business so a picture of the device on
the front we've got some features on the
back highlighted by a corded keyboard
that Blackberry email which is really
its bread and butter social networking 5
megapixel camera and video and Wi-Fi of
the BGA ten variety alright are you
ready
BAM brown brown out there you go
alright so we've got a QuickStart guide
for getting started quickly you go ahead
and open it up and learn all kinds of
tips and tricks for example that's where
the headset jack is don't try and charge
it through the headset jack cuz you're
not gonna have any luck here is the
blackberry curve 93-60
extremely diminutive tiny phone push it
off for just a moment see what else we
are going to get in the box you get a
plastic tray which could make a dog toy
underneath that we've got a connect me
book or connect me piece of paper for
connecting information we have a battery
let's go ahead and see what battery size
this is so what model we got go ahead
open this up it is hard to open
it's the em1 battery and it is of size 3
point 7 volts 1000 milliamp hours so
that happened we've got a headset with a
microphone built in there got a very
tiny little wall charger for charging in
a wall then you've got a sinking cable
of the micro USB variety we don't have
any uh cases here though a blackberry
generally includes some sort of holster
not so here alright so let me go ahead
and pop in the battery
and we can run through all the specs I
will peel off all this blue stuff I know
you guys hate seeing that and we did get
a very satisfying whooshing noise pop
off the back he's tempted to pop up pop
off the back probably should have read
that quick start good so the back has
been popped we'll take the battery and
we will put it in like that I'll take
the plastic back snap it that back in
place and bada-bing bada-boom
we are powered or at least we should be
powered let me go ahead and turn this
phone on hey phone alright so sit back
and relax because BlackBerry's
notoriously take a very long time to put
up so well this guy is doing its thing
you can watch that bar move forward I'll
go ahead and run through the specs so it
is running BlackBerry's latest OS 7 this
is not a touchscreen though while you
can physically touch the screen meaning
you are capable of doing this it's not
gonna do anything with the operating
system so from a dimension standpoint
it's 4.2 9 inches by point by 2.3 6
inches by a pretty thin 0.043 can see
how thin it is right there
it weighs three point four nine ounces
and you really feel how light phone is
it's actually still shocking that the
battery is in there this thing does not
weigh very much at all the display is
2.4 inches measured diagonally
with a 480 by 360 resolution the battery
we talked about is a thousand milliamp
hours you get five hours of talktime
about 300 48 hours of standby time it's
got a single core 800 megahertz
processor 512 megabytes of RAM also 512
megabytes of storage expandable to micro
sd 2 gig card is going to be included of
course you're going to get 3G
capabilities but just 3G none of that
fourth one in there bluetooth 2.1
available in black and purple and it'll
play a video for you 5 megapixel camera
with LED flash will live on the back of
the device alright so we are booted up
I'm go ahead and do a quick tour of the
phone no don't show me how
they continue all right so that's gonna
do its thing so you've got a very curved
ask obviously this is a curve style
keyboard here you've got your BlackBerry
non-colored anymore
so you don't they're not green and red
you've got your send button your
blackberry message button or your
blackberry menu button rather back
button and end button on the left hand
side of device that's where the charging
ports going to live on the right hand
side it's sort of hard to see but very
easy to feel I've got a volume up and
down button and you've got a hard
physical button right there as well that
you can push the back is plastic does
not appear to be fingerprint magnet
plastic though but it is shiny black
plastic a little bit of a speaker grille
underneath there there's a five
megapixel camera with a little bit of a
black thing that's the LED flash that's
the camera on the top you've got a lock
button then there's a 3.5 millimeter not
a charger jack we can see what the
operating system looks like BlackBerry
OS 7 and all of its OS 7 glorious let's
look through some of the applications
that we're going to have here all pretty
standard fare visual voicemail is
included from a carrier you've got media
we've got some it doesn't appear to be
much AT&amp;amp;T stuff out of here it's going
to take a look at will jump into
applications we've got wicket ood for
augmented reality and showing some
attitude documents to go and some rest
of the messaging stuff as I mentioned
this is a really small phone so let's go
ahead and do some size comparisons with
some stuff that you might want to see
size compared with so let's compare it
first versus its big brother BlackBerry
Bold 9900 obviously a much larger phone
1900 is still one of the thinnest phones
on the market and you can see that right
there
although the curve is no slouch in the
fat department alright so let's do some
size comparisons versus some other
things you might see laying around
versus the HTC Titan versus Android guy
versus a hammer versus Angry Bird versus
Avery Brandon also the same as
constipated Brandon versus angry Ralph
versus
we do Ralph versus me and my microphone
dance central versus refrigerator versus
a plan alright so now that we know what
the phone looks like again it is
available now in case you want to pick
one up if you watch or read
TechnoBuffalo quite a bit you will know
that you've got a chance to win a trip
to London to go be the official
Instagram for for GE you get a chance to
take pictures of one of their
state-of-the-art jet engine facilities
kind of cool open to anyone in the world
even those you that might live in London
it'll be a short trip you just have to
be 18 or over all the links and details
to learn about that trip are going to be
down below I am John rut insurance has
been an unboxing first look in crazy
size comparison of the blackberry curve
93-60
