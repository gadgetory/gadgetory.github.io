10 came out and presumably were a few
weeks away from its successor heading so
for out the past ten months I've had the
iPhone 10 in my pocket that I deal e
phone or a secondary phone so I've
gotten to know it quite a bit what's
gone well with it what's been
disappointing about it so as we are now
almost at the end of life on the iPhone
10 I thought we could look back and kind
of do a final review with it so there
are a couple of big features that were
touted when the iPhone 10 launched the
big one is the knotch and with the notch
came that new design you guys like to
say
looks like my haircut when knotch first
came out I was a bit thrown back by it
it was kind of a new design something
new to see a certainly essential had a
notch there before just the first time
we seen one that large and it was more
glaring and more jarring the first few
months that I used it you know watching
video when I would expand to full screen
I was very aware that it was there three
or four months in though the knotch
became a very bless of an issue for me
perhaps I don't watch that many
cinematic movies on my phone where I
would see the notch and see the content
get cut off but I've really stopped and
noticing it and I really haven't thought
about it until a new phone comes out
that symbol seems to look almost
identical to it with that notch the big
feature of the iPhone 10 brought was
face ID and I think I'm in the minority
of liking face ID I think I like the
convenience of face ID in practice it
certainly hasn't been perfect
I think touch ID was definitely more of
a absolute science let's say it worked
more reliably than face ID but I really
like the convenience with the one caveat
being when it's on a table you can't
just like look down it you got to pick
up your phone and have it see your face
those are small trade-offs that I'm
willing to make others in the office
though wish touch ID in some form would
come back the best use case that I've
seen for face ID is with third-party
authentication if we're using password
apps like one password for example I
love being able to use my face and
access my information I don't think
about it the concerns that I had when
face Eddy first launched was could it be
spoofed we tried it with a mask is it
gonna work in the dark I've had no
issues at all with the dark and
actually gotten better at software
updates have gotten better even when I'm
on my side in bed it's been able to
unlock that sunglasses no issue but
again that's my experience my wife has
had a lot of problems wearing sunglasses
just take her sunglasses off to unlock
her iPhone 10 so your experiences
definitely might vary there the design
was also a big deal with the iPhone 10
as Apple's first kind of all screen
design and I'm so extremely impressed
they were able to almost bend the glass
and bend the display so you don't have
that chin that we've seen plagued a lot
of Android manufacturers and I like that
I still really like the design the
iPhone 10 is also slightly thicker than
what we've seen about the iPhone 7 or
the iPhone 8 along with it I don't mind
that extra thickness but presumably it's
for the battery inside and I haven't
noticed any battery changed at all from
really my first week of using it to now
you know almost 10 months and batteries
been really good for me and again I
don't watch that much video when I watch
videos really drains it faster my dealer
use buy time I get home I've got about
40% battery life left I'm pretty heavy
on social media and that kind of stuff
so I could easily say it's a day and a
half er which is something really
important for me especially when I'm
traveling that's where something like
the iPhone 10 has been really good in
the battery life Department so the other
new thing that the iPhone 10 brought in
was gesture control it was a little bit
weird the first few months there's
definitely a learning curve but it's
become definitely second nature now when
I use an iPhone 8 iPhone 7 or anything
that came out before by myself trying to
swipe up and swipe down I think Apple
absolutely nailed the gestures with the
iPhone 10 it's an all glass phone
especially an expensive all glass phone
makes me super nervous and I got two
kids at home their consulate grabbing
the phone out of my hand so I've opted
for some form of protection for the
iPhone 10 I bought Apple care to go with
it just as a safety net but I have had a
case on it all the time the case is not
on it I always got a D brand skin on the
back please make sure the back is
protected they got a ton of
customization options so if you're sick
of the space gray or you want to make
your phone look different you could pick
one got a yellow carbon fiber here makes
it stand out it's easy to find when it's
on a table I really like the option
gives the protection
the back - you guys are interesting you
want to pick up a D brand skin maybe you
want to go yellow on your phone cuz
apples never gonna release yellow or you
want to make your own red iPhone 10 pull
you to them all down below but I think
perhaps the biggest feature and the
reason that I tend to just keep using
the iPhone 10 or at least have it with
me in conjunction with an Android phone
is the camera and there's an old saying
the best camera is the one that you have
with you and I've been really impressed
with the camera from the iPhone 10 I
think overall as a whole it's not quite
as feature complete as something you get
with the pixel - or pixel to excel but
it has worked really well in almost
every usage the pictures are always some
form of good very rarely do we get a
picture and look at it just go ooh that
looks oversaturated or I can see a ton
of artifacting pictures generally just
look good so it might not be the best
camera in the market it does everything
really well I still have issues with iOS
iOS 12 included things I wish that were
there I wish Apple would do differently
but I knew those shortcomings going into
using the phone I wish there was more
customization options
I knew that and I've kind of accepted
that that's the case maybe iOS 13 next
year will will change that although I'm
not holding my breath
but overall I've enjoyed the iPhone 10
and I'm surprising the features I
thought that I was gonna most excited
about the things like having wireless
charging and an emoji I've used very
little and what's been a big selling
point and keeps bringing me back to the
iPhone 10 has been battery life and the
camera that'd be kind of fun to revisit
the iPhone 10 a final review and share
which changed since the phone initially
launched if you guys liked this final
revisited let us know in the comments
down below give the video a thumbs up
and of course the subscribe button
notification bell so you get notified
when new videos are coming your way
if YouTube doesn't notify people that
much anymore hope you guys enjoyed till
next time
