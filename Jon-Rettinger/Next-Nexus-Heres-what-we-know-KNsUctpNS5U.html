technobuffalo here some of my favorite
phones every year are the pure
unadulterated Android goodness bestowed
upon our smartphone loving hands by our
overlords at Google last year we got the
nexus 6 which I absolutely loved it
brought in the first device shipping
with lollipop and it's a pretty badass
phone it still is but phones never rest
on their laurels and what the next Nexus
or NEX I are going to be a starting to
leak out so I thought to make a video to
tell you what you can expect from the
next Nexus devices when they eventually
hit sometime in October let's start with
the Big Daddy our old friend and when
the most prolific phone makers ever Evan
blast from efflux back with some dish
and we're going to see from the hallway
built next Nexus the first 5.7 inch qhd
screen with metal body we knew 5.7 CH
before but the qhd is new information to
be powered by the snapdragon 820 is a
quick refresher what that's going to do
it's a first 64-bit custom qualcomm cpu
core called cryo and it's kind of a just
a random fact about the 820 the new
system chip is also the first of a new
platform called zero off I don't know
what I got the name system from either a
day 20 is also going to usher in some
new Qualcomm tech particularly the
Snapdragon cents with 3d fingerprint
technology which would go nicely with
android m's native support for
fingerprint scanners which the hallway
bill phone is going to be packing I ran
the out the specs we're hearing the
battery is going to be about 3500
milliamp hours and it's going to have a
USBC port which google was all giddy
about during i/o again it's one port
reversible same ports being used in
laptops using the Chromebook it's
probably give either one port to rule
them all relatively soon but that might
not be the only new Nexus we get this
year might be the first year we get not
one but but this many new Nexus rumor
has it google also unveil a smaller
lg-made Nexus phone around the same time
and if you're a fan of Nexus 5 LG making
Nexus phone is probably music to your
ears the device is let you go in a pack
a 5.2 inch display is much smaller 27
hundred million power battery a
Snapdragon 808 processor which is super
capable in its own right I might also
feature
totally new design rather than is
refreshing the current LG phones the bad
news to those ghouls on expecting to
reveal any new Nexus goodness until late
2015 releases the final build of Android
M typically happens to the end of
October still have a few more months for
these rumored phones getting veiled and
probably a few more weeks if we start
seeing leaked pictures what these guys
are going to look like I love Nexus
phones amba dubious on a hallway built
Nexus phone but i'm going to give Google
a better for the doubt and be super
excited 5.7 just do a big phone smaller
footprints that we have now with the
current Nexus 6 i'm all about it just to
give it to me let me have that android
marshmallow android malamar and druid
milkshake just eat it up you guys are
going to make memes with me doing that
aren't you I'm excited about the next
Nexus phone just for my own interest
start doing research on what I thought
it was going to be I figured I should
just share with you guys what I found so
that's what we know as we get more
information I'll be sure to tell you and
of course stay tuned the TechnoBuffalo
for latest news if you want to take a
look at the new build of android Emma's
been seeded to developers hit this link
right here and go check that out till
next time John render for TechnoBuffalo
