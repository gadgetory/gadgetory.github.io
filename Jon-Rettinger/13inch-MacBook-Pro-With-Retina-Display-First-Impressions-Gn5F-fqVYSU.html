TechnoBuffalo with my first impressions
of the brand-new 13-inch retina macbook
pro I'm gonna give you guys a rundown
fill you in on the specs but I solium
mainly want to talk about and focus on
the retina display because that is the
whole reason we are here and that is the
biggest feature of the news 13 inch
retina MacBook Pro now real quickly this
is the baseline 2.5 gigahertz core i5
model a gigs a ram at 128 gigabytes of
flash storage this configuration starts
out at 1699 us so you're gonna get no
arguments out of me this is definitely a
premium product and it is damn pricey
now is it worth that premium price tag
that is still up in the air it'll get a
little more into that at the end of the
video but to put things in contrast if
you take the 13-inch non-red the MacBook
Pro you bump it up to these same a gigs
of RAM and 128 gigabytes of flash
storage you're actually only paying
about 200 extra dollars for a beautiful
beautiful display now real quickly just
benchmarking the SSD I got read and
write speeds over 400 megabytes per
second and to put that in perspective a
typical 5400 rpm hard drive is gonna
read and write around 60 megabytes per
second so there is a huge difference and
that translates to much faster app
loading times insanely quick boot ups
and shutdowns that overall just a much
better user experience the new 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro is also thinner it's
nearly eight pounds lighter than its
non-retina sibling and real quickly just
giving you guys a tour of the ins and
the outs with the MagSafe 2 connector we
have dual Thunderbolt ports one of the
two USB 3.0 ports the headphone jack and
dual microphones rounded up the
left-hand side on the flip side you can
see gone is the optical drive which
translates to the thinner form factor
and the lighter build we then have the
SD card slot HDMI out and the second USB
3.0 port now getting into the heart of
the matter the Retina display it is
rockin a 2560 by 1600 resolution which
is four times the pixels as the current
13 inch non retina MacBook Pro now a lot
of people will react and say why the
heck would I want to resolution that big
on a screen that small I'm not gonna be
able to see anything text is gonna be
small icons are gonna be small but it
actually works a little different than
you might think
so by default that 2560 by 1600 looks
like 1280 by 800 they render it at that
ultra high resolution and then scale it
down to fit in that screen
state form factors there's actually four
times the pixels in there and that's
gonna result in insanely crisp pecs and
a really really vivid picture now where
it gets really cool is you can actually
scale it where you can see much more
screen real estate than you normally
could on a 30-inch non-retina macbook
pro you can bump it up to look like 1440
by 900 and that actually renders
everything at twenty eight eighty by
1800 which is absolutely insane and it
actually even goes one step further you
can make it look like 1680 by 1050 and
that actually renders everything at
thirty 360 by 2100 which is absolutely
ridiculous it's pretty much impossible
to see through a 1080p video but I have
full resolution screenshots down in the
description below you guys should check
those out click them and see exactly how
much screen real estate is actually
smashed into this beautiful 13 inch
display so in terms of real world use
this is what web browsing looks like on
the standard retina setting this is what
it looks like if you bump it up to 1440
by 900 so you can see there's a little
extra screen real estate and if you go
even higher this is how it looks if you
render it at 1680 by 1050 you get even
more screen real estate now as far as
performance goes I was a little worried
about not having dedicated graphics but
as a little mini stress test here is
Final Cut Pro 10 running the rectangle
with a video that is full resolution
1080p and you still have extra screen
real estate around it it's actually
crazy so I'm gonna keep that video
playing in the background just kind of
move it around do a little scrolling on
the web browsing and you can see it
doesn't really lag at all so the a gigs
around kind of helps with multitasking I
really really would like to see
dedicated graphics but for what it is it
actually runs pretty smooth now as far
as is this worth the price it's hard to
say because I really feel the 15 inch
retina MacBook Pro is a much better deal
if you actually bump this 13-inch model
up to an i7 processor these same 256
gigabytes of flash storage it's actually
the same price but with the 15 inch you
get quad core CPU and dedicated graphics
and obviously a bigger screen and that
leads me to believe that this is a
premium product it's not for everybody
but it is gonna pave the way for future
products next year I can see retina
possibly as a standard but lower price
points for sure and is also gonna pave
the way for other laptops non Mac and
Apple aside so thank you guys for
watching if you guys did enjoy this
