technobuffalo here as Wednesday January
27th draws near the curtains are finally
going to be unveiled on what Apple and
Steve Jobs you're going to be showing us
I thought I'd give a rundown on what I
think we can expect I did a video on
this last week but sort of in that time
frame the rumor mill and sort of some of
the more respectable sites on the web
Wall Street Journal and such I've
reported on some concrete news and I
want to share with you this video is
going to be a rundown I think of what
you can expect from Wednesday's keynote
let's go ahead and get started the first
and probably the biggest thing on
everybody's mind is the tablet I think
there's very little Delta or finally
going to see the tablet specs are a
little bit unknown but we're led to
believe it's going to be a 10.1 inch
screen coming in at about a seven
ninety-nine price point running a
heavily modified version of the iphone
operating system it is just because it's
running a heavily modified version the
iphone OS does not mean it's going to
look like the iphone operating system
you know you've got linux OS does it
look completely different I think it's
gonna be the same thing with the iphone
OS think it's just a scaled-down version
of traditional Mac os10 you're going to
get full functionality that you'd get
probably on most standard computers
probably in a more closed environment i
would assume just something that i'm
anticipating we're going to see books
e-books and text books and magazines be
a very heavy focus of the education
market and sort of the recreational
market as well if you're going to see
textbooks are gonna be launched with
this and i'm finally going to see a
ebook reader store or an ebook store on
itunes as well as magazine subscriptions
or individual sales on itunes and of
course newspapers as well New York Times
been rumored to be very heavily involved
with this apple tablet now what it's
going to be cold nobody knows rumors
have been circling about I sleep sort of
what everyone's just for calling it the
ipad which sounds like a feminine
hygiene product evens people talking
about bringing back I book which could
be kind of fun if there's a very heavy
ebooks key to it I think it's probably
be called something that nobody expects
you know maybe it'll be macbook touch
ever talk to that going around for a
while and this is going to be a very big
product sort of in the vein
the iphone how it changed the industry
now setting previously whether you like
yak phone don't like the iphone it's
really hard to admit that it didn't
change the industry the marketplace I
think this tablet is going to do the
same really the tablet sphere is not
going to establish it people are really
sure what to do with the tablet I think
I get questions all the time how am I
going to use it what am I going to do
with it what is it good for I think were
going to finally see that market and
that niche really carved out by Apple
whether or not you you like apple or
don't think you're going to see other
company sort of follow mine with the
target demographic the Apple is going to
be looking at certainly their invitation
has looks like as a core of a creative
edge to it but again really nobody knows
far as text and football we're going to
have and the rest it's really up in the
air rumors are circulating that's going
to be have a 64 gigabyte solid-state
drive so plenty of storage so alike you
leave this conference is going to have
three main focus is the first one being
the tablet second one supposedly is
going to be a redesigned I life 2010
supposedly modified for touch I think
we're going to see finally a new ilife
which I'm quite happy about I do a lot
of my editing in imovie so I think
you'll be very nice to have sort of an
updated sweet those you don't know what
I like is it the suite of applications
that come pre-installed with every map
it's I life or the sets I movie I web I
DVD and the rest or the I suite of
application so it can be very nice and
certainly to see what the creative focus
maybe with those as well but their focus
moved to be on iphone OS four point oh
so not a new iphone hardware but I new
operating system supposedly apples been
holding this OS because it's just
riddled with tablet references which I
guess would make sense that they're
running the same operating system
supposedly this is going to turn the
iphone into a full functioning pc so it
should be very interesting to see what
it does I've done other videos running
down with features i think that the
iphone and west four-point-oh is going
to have but sort of the short synopsis i
think we're going to see multitasking a
redesign homescreen redesign lock screen
and a few other sort of key features so
i think finally we're going to see the
iphone almost now catch up to the
competition so catch up to android catch
up to webos far as multitasking goes i
think that's really one of the key
things that the iphone was
and the OS itself has just gotten boring
and that's really changed much or at all
since it first launched some other minor
announcements I think we may here we
made you see pop up on apple's website
redesign or upgraded SPECT rather
MacBook Pros with the same design using
the core i5 mobile chip maker could
possibly see that as well I think we may
see a redesigned macbook air sort of
catching up design wise to the current
line of aluminum laptop so with the
black bezel on the glass trackpad with
no button addition there been rumors of
a 22 ish inch touchscreen imac I don't
think were going to see anything about
that this press conference certainly has
been talked about touchscreens I think
that this tablet make uh sure in and the
touchscreen generation for Apple really
to tell what's going to be the first
focus a touchscreen I'm actually merit
its own keynote to discuss all of new
features that would go into that so I
would not hold your breath to see that
at all but also been rumors swirling
that Wednesday may mark the end of
apples exclusivity with AT&amp;amp;T so whether
you however you feel about that there
have been sort of grumbling that we may
hear verizon's name mentioned whether
it's mentioned as far as being a 3g
option for the tablet or maybe Apple Eve
announcing a iphone version of the 3gs
allah would make sense that apple would
announce a partnership with verizon for
the iphone when they announced the
iphone 4g so the new hardware so i would
expect a iphone announcement but we may
see the tablet have a 3g cdma option on
verizon definitely something to look for
i'm very excited about the conference if
you can't tell I've long been an admirer
of apple products in their business
model and I'm really curious to see what
they come up with if you guys want some
coverage on what's gonna be happening at
the keynote on Wednesday starts at ten
