technobuffalo here we are in New York
City take you look at the just unveiled
samsung galaxy s4 this guy is going to
go head-to-head with a lot of phone the
one that comes to my mind first is the
just announced HTC One and there's a lot
of similarities here we got a 5-inch
screen here on the galaxy s4 and a
5-inch screen our 4.7 inch screen rather
on the HTC One both 1080p displays
obviously a little higher ppi here on
HTC One other screens are they look
absolutely gorgeous us are supposed to
have no shutter lag at all pretty much
on the galaxy s4 let's take a quick look
let's put that to the test only go ahead
and make sure all applications are
closed here just to make sure things are
nice and failure will do it all on
camera so everybody can see these are
test students that have been shown here
so there's obviously a lot of
applications open Iranian can see the
two gigs ram it can handle that no
problems there was one more didn't make
it closed there we go we'll do the same
thing here on at the HTC One double tap
the home button close everything it's
open but we'll leave camera opens that's
we're going to be using anyway we'll do
the same thing here on the galaxy s4
let's take some table pictures this is
going to be quite an act of finagling so
first thing you see coming up right
there is the fact you can show your
front camera they reckon at the same
time but that's not what we're showing
here I will show that though in an
upcoming video alright so we got both
phones all lined up here go ahead and
try and snap a picture if i can get it
just right see how things look video
alright sound bitchy here and see how
things look so with a little bit quicker
on each you see one try that one more
time obviously not the most scientific
up test year but as you can see what the
camera interface looks like on each of
course you've got the zoe here on the
HTC One and a lot of other niceties
built into the camera on the Nexus 4
let's do a quick size comparison to see
how things look side by side again five
inches first for just a little bit
thinner here on the HTC One the big
difference though is going to be the
build and what's important to you the
build quality is certainly a little bit
better here on the HTC One but it
doesn't offer removable battery nor does
it offer expandable storage literally
going to be what's important to you see
what phones look like on the left hand
side and the right hand side of each see
they've got the buttons slipped left
hand side on the s4 right hand side for
volume on the one if we do a little clip
on the side see what those two look like
as well again this has been a very quick
comparison of the samsung galaxy s4 vs
HTC one of course we let these guys
battle it out in an upcoming video check
out technobuffalo calm soon as we get
this back in the TechnoBuffalo offices
gives video a thumbs up I will see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
