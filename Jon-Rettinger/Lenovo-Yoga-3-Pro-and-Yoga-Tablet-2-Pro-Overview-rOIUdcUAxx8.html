TechnoBuffalo here before we begin I
want to thank Lenovo sponsoring this
video we a TechnoBuffalo have the
privilege nay the honor to look at the
latest laptops tablets and phones
eventually though things start to look
like just different sized rectangles
let's take a look at to that break the
conventional model and offer some killer
features that you may have never seen
before let's go ahead and start with the
yoga tablet 2 pro I've got done up right
here you're probably looking at this box
and thinking that's not a run in the
middle 89 inch tablet this vending mamuh
jama offers a 13.3 inch screen and a
2560 by 1440 pixels resolution and an
Intel Atom processor all running on
Android 4.4 KitKat if I was in the
footsteps of lenovo's other yoga tablets
with the unique kickstand design that
offers you to prop the device up on the
desk easily and is built out of aluminum
which helps it look and feel more
premium than its competitors and for you
folks to pronounce it the other way
build out of that aluminum so don't yell
at me so I didn't mention something
unique here this sucker has a built-in
pico projector which allows you to
mirror your display on any surface
allowing you to project up to a 50 inch
screen which is pretty badass in my book
that means you can projected
presentations game to just kick back and
watch a movie with your boo all which is
a flick of a button so let's update
offers features no one else has the yoga
pro 2 can be yours for 460 $9.99 so
while the yoga tablet 2 pro can do
pretty much anything you wanna throw at
it you might also want a desktop OS we
fell in love the yoga 3 Pro and Lenovo
introduced it back in early October
starts just $12.99 99 features a brand
new Intel Core M processor clocked at
once point 1 gigahertz 64-bit Windows
8.1 out of the box a really nice looking
13.3 and display with a 3200 by 1800
pixel resolution Intel HD graphics 4300
eight gigs of ram with 256 gigabytes of
substance your door right out of that
box so if using it for past few weeks
here and the coolest feature at least
for me is that crazy
hinges I have to flip the screen around
a full 360 degrees allowing you to use
it
tablet mode and tent mode for viewing
movies or of course just like a standard
laptop it also means it's superlight
which like let's say you're going to
Electronic Show coming up very soon and
you got a bag on your back you want to
carry a laptop with you it's not going
to want to feel like you've got to go to
the hospital because it weighs so much
it's super duper light I'm gonna know
it's there gonna be like ah my shoulders
are going to thank you if you lookin for
a new laptop this holiday season put
this guy at the top of your list you
won't be disappointed thank you to
