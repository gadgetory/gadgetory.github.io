kind of two camps you have the high-end
cinema style for your home and you have
the smaller portable but less high
quality that you can take around now
usually you have to choose between the
two and they serve different purposes
but now you don't necessarily have to LG
reached out wanting to sponsor our video
instant over this the LG UHD Sinha beams
projector and it combines the high-end
quality of a cinema home theater
projector with the flexibility of a
portable one hardware-wise this is the
most interesting projector I've seen
when you look at it you don't instantly
think that this is a projector but this
design lets it be used in four ways and
besides the remote control everything
you need is built right in around back
are your inputs like HDMI USB Ethernet
optical audio there's an antenna input
and there's a built-in retractable power
cable there's a handle dials for zoom
and focus and then the most interesting
part the laser light source and the
mirror which is what allows for the four
convertible modes first let's touch on
the actual image is a 4k DLP projector
with support for HDR 10 and you can get
that image from 40 inches up to 150
inches so it gets bit the laser outputs
2500 lumens which to purchase some other
projectors we've tested isn't quite as
bright but even still the image is easy
to see although for the best picture
you'll definitely want to dim the lights
it's designed for a dark environment it
has motion compensation and estimation
for fast-moving video and most
importantly it has an eye shaped engine
and without mirrors and improve cooling
system which not only keeps this quiet
but also makes it very compact compared
to other projectors of similar quality
now one concern we've seen with laser
projectors is the laser life since
unlike traditional lamps you can't
replace them the lifetime here is rated
at 20,000 hours so after to that amount
of time it won't perform quite as well
yes it's a bummer that it can't be
changed but it'll has significantly
longer than a traditional lamp so it's
pretty much maintenance-free and till
the end of its life now this is also an
LG Smart TV so you can use apps like
Netflix and YouTube you can connect a
bluetooth keyboard and mouse for easier
navigation it works almost the same
as a dedicated TV it's just a projector
form I will say the navigation is
strange I think it's more a fault of the
controller but some of the buttons
didn't work exactly as I expected
for instance the back button often
wouldn't go back it wouldn't do anything
besides that though I enjoyed using this
UI finding everything was easy and I was
able to get to the content quickly now
that's all fine and dandy but how does
it actually look and one word great the
image is sharp the colors are vibrant
even when projecting on a wall without a
dedicated screen although obviously
using a dedicated screen is preferred
for normal viewing the images look
smooth and not jittery so from a pure
visual angle the projector gets a thumbs
up but now to the most interesting part
about this the for use modes the first
two are like a traditional projector you
point it or attach it to the wall and
you project across the room but you can
also stand it vertically and then
project them to the ceiling so for me I
used it in bed to watch a movie was
interesting but if you don't want it
across the room where you don't want to
attach it to the ceiling you can use the
built-in mirror to project onto the wall
from a shorter distance
this makes the projector much more
versatile overall and it's super easy to
set up in each configuration I was able
to move from projecting on the ceiling
to then the wall with really no fuss
although it will say the marketing
behind this is a little interesting this
is a high quality cinema projector best
suited for home theaters but at the same
time it's portable and meant to be moved
around that doesn't really affect the
quality of the projector at all but it's
a unique take for sure so for the $3,000
the lg UHD cinema projector is kind of
the whole package great 4k image quality
compact design and it's portable enough
to take around with you if you need it
but let us know if this is something you
would consider picking up yes it's a bit
pricey but you're getting a 150 inch
screen for that money so it's not a bad
deal if you enjoyed this video and you
want to see more be sure to hit
subscribe and that notification bell to
see when new videos are out I don't
think you all so much for watching
I'm Atkins also TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you next time
