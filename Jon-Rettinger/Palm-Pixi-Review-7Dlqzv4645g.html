TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the palm pixi for Sprint
we're gonna try the phone review and a
sort of new angle I'm just gonna focus
on the phone instead of me talking so
let me know what you guys think I'm
gonna break this review up the two parts
first review the pixi on its own in its
own little sphere and then focus on the
grander a cell phone scheme particularly
in Sprint's lineup so the pixi is going
to run you just about a hundred bucks on
a two-year contract before I did do my
phone reviews I generally like to talk
about call quality first since it is a
phone and it's got to make good phone
calls no matter how good the browser or
anything else that does if the phone
quality sucks it's not gonna be a good
experience for you so the phone quality
and the cult quality on the pixi is
actually fantastic that may be due to
the location of where I am in Southern
California and Sprint service here is
very strong but the calls were crystal
clear people on my end reported
absolutely zero white noise people on
the other end of the call reported zero
noise as well they often thought I was
even on a land phone I use this phone as
my own phone is my daily driver for just
about two weeks and in two weeks I only
experienced one dropped call so the
network was quite good enough really
impressed with Sprint service so if you
are worried about call quality on the
pixi don't worry if you're a heavy
speakerphone user something to keep in
mind the speakerphone on the back well
it does have those two speaker grilles
it's not the loudest so if you rely a
lot on speakerphone this one might not
be the phone for you if you just use it
passively it's certainly a lot enough to
use but if you're relying on it in a car
for example if there's a lot of traffic
or a big truck driving by you didn't
completely lose the call and not be able
to hear what they're saying so you saw
me do a video of the Prix and showing
you how the browser works and
demonstrating multi-touch I will say
that the multi-touch implementation on
the pre is probably one of the best that
I've seen it works just really well
probably second best to let's say the
iPhone motets capabilities as far as
managing your pictures or using the
browser really just doing anything that
involves a screen
multi-touch just works really well it's
very smooth we've seen multi-touch
implemented on devices like the HTC Hero
for example and while that works in is
quite functional it can be a little
choppy at times and that's just not the
case here with the pixi it works really
smooth and and quite well so if you're
looking for a multi-touch enabled device
the pixi really is a good way to go and
that's true of all of the webOS phones
so including the pre as well so the
keyboard was one of the things I was
most worried about about the pixie and I
did a video of demonstrating how the
keyboard works and I gotta say I was
really impressed with how easy it was to
type on you wouldn't expect it look at
the size of the device it's really quite
small the keyboards look very cramped
but they're surprisingly easy to use the
keys have a little bit of a tactile
clicky feel to them and there's a dome
on them so that to be stick up a little
bit more than the Prius you don't have
the bumpers on the side so you can
really get your hands around the device
for typing it makes it just a little bit
easier overall I was very impressed with
the keyboard
one of the things that I don't like
about typing on the pixi and the pre as
well that doesn't have any sort of
autocorrect and while the keyboard is
very good you certainly bound to make
errors and I really would have liked
some sort of autocorrect feature when I
first reviewed the pre probably back
almost six months ago that was one the
beach dogs really hoping for with webOS
I would have assumed that palm would
have rolled that out and over there
update but it still hasn't come yet so
if you've got very fat thumbs and you
tend to make an error - if you want to
be very aware of that when you're using
the pixie but overall the keyboard is
very usable and surprisingly easy to use
camera quality was just ok it wasn't the
best it's for me passable for a cell
phone camera but right now you cannot
take any sort of video and it does have
a single LED flash one of the other
downsides of the pixie in certain this
is true the pre as well is the boot up
time that's just a webOS thing it can
take upwards of a minute and a half so
that seemed to go from off to on
get to be a little annoying so working
with the phone you're gonna be dealing
primarily or obviously full time with
the operating system and I really like
webOS is the operating system that this
is
it's very intuitive easy to use I think
it's even fun as well the card
management system I think makes things
just very easy you can take an
application and throw it away when
you're done and really manage multiples
right from this card interface it's very
elegant and I think it's quite useful as
well
also there's presence of synergy which
pulls all of your contacts and calendars
from from a Gmail from Yahoo from
Facebook now and from even LinkedIn into
a single unified format so either you'll
see all your contacts listed into one
contact or all your emails of being a
single mailbox you can divide them up if
you like but it's nice to have an option
of having them all there especially
having calendar so if you use an
exchange calendar at work you use your
Gmail at home it really makes it quite
nice to have all those sort of combined
and synergy does a really nice job of
doing that
you know just with calendars everything
will show up right there
I really makes it very easy I one of the
things that I really do enjoy about
webOS in this case in the pixi is how it
handles notifications so you'll see
right there I've got a little envelope
if I tap it it's really unobtrusive way
to get emails and if I don't want to
read it I just toss it away if I want to
open it up I just click on it the pixie
does not come with Wi-Fi I just there's
something to keep in mind a lot of
Sprint's add-on features like the video
NFL Network NASCAR or you can sprint TV
obviously very data and video centric
and the quality of the video well
watchable definitely isn't Wi-Fi strong
so if you're going to get a little
pixelated as we take a long time to load
I'm gonna keep in mind from a browsing
standpoint it's gonna be okay because
Sprint's Network does tend to be very
fast but something I want you to keep in
mind looking to get the device rely
heavily on Wi-Fi or you want a little
bit of extra speed this is something
that pixie does not have overall in the
pixie on itself
I was very impressive but I really like
using the phone it's extremely small and
very portable and you can't see the size
the device you put it next to something
you're familiar with so here's the
iPhone for example the pixie looks
downright miniscule and it really is
quite tiny
one of the other downsides of the pixie
as well is that it's stuck with your 8
gigabytes of storage there isn't any
sort of microSD expansion so if you're
looking for a lot of music you want to
bring over your whole library you're
gonna run in some trouble deftly have to
do some management so the pixie has a
hole it really is a great phone I really
enjoyed using it the screen was bright
and vibrant the keyboard was a file easy
to use call quality was really good and
overall was a very good experience so
back to rank the pixie on a one to five
I give it a very solid for missing that
extra point because of the lack of
autocorrect keyboards lack of Wi-Fi if
I'd have those things it would have been
a very closed five there's been a lot of
questions about the Pixies processor
being a little slow and laggy and my
experience the processor held up just
fine I was able to keep three four
sometimes even five cards open without
really experiencing much of a slowdown
so I think that's been greatly
exaggerated so in the greater scheme of
things I'm gonna be hard-pressed to
recommend the pixie over the pre which
is fifty dollars more coming in just
about one forty nine ninety nine while
the pixie does have a better keyboard
the pre offers you a lot more it's got a
bigger screen it's got a it's got Wi-Fi
and it's got a little faster product are
going to want to manage more than five
cards for example the pre is going to be
the way that you're going to want to go
when you put them both side to side it's
really hard to see who palm is targeting
with the pixie definitely a $99 price
point is quite good but only fifty
dollars more to upgrade for a faster
processor bigger screen and Wi-Fi I
would probably the way I recommend but
if you do like the form factor of the
candy bar you don't want the slide out
mechanism that to be pre had pixie is
gonna be a great buy for you hey guys
I'm John rector TechnoBuffalo I hope you
enjoyed the video and I'll see you in
the next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
