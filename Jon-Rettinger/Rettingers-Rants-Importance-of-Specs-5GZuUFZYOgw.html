you by Linda calm what is going on
youtube welcome back there episode of
renter's rinse it to show where I rant
and rave on something that is pissing me
off up this week it's me I'm pissing me
off I'm gonna talk about my perspective
on technology and how it has worked my
brain this is rector's rants let's go
and get started so last week I got a
little introspective our own brain Dan
Russell wrote a post on the Moto X that
got me thinking in the post he said
listen a lot of times it's not just
about the specs of a phone it's about
what the phone can do for you whether
it's got two cores 4 cores longest
performs the duties that you need it's a
good phone that kind of got me thinking
about my perspective on phones and
tablets in general as I do this for a
living and I get an opportunity in the
privilege take a look at a ton of phones
and tablets I get crazy crazy jaded and
I look at a device you know I've got the
galaxy note 2 in front of your pick any
phone and tablets come out over the past
few years and you could access the
complete depth of the world's knowledge
on a tiny screen anywhere you are that
is an absolutely incredible achievement
of humankind and I forget that I look at
a tab but I'm like yeah the screen 720p
it doesn't have eight cores it sucks you
know I forget what the phones can
actually do is absolutely incredible so
sure it might not give me everything in
the world you know lightning fast but it
still gives me everything and just a
matter of perspective so I started
looking at to my older devices and
thinking could I still use this I picked
up the old motorola atrix the phone that
came out on think about a year and a
half ago the original atrix and by all
means is still a very quick device and
it worked loaded websites they able to
scroll I could put email in it but it
wasn't crazy fast I wasn't getting
information right away and it's sort of
I thought is fostered I've entitled
almost tech generation I am certainly
part of that I feel entitled to fast
data I feel entitled to a 1080p screen I
feel entitled to be connected anywhere i
go to view videos anywhere i am just
sort of the way the world is going and i
want to sort of step back and say you
know what what these phones can do
regardless how many cores they have
because when i signed a contract it's
still an incredible device it's still an
awesome
but it might not be the crazy fast
singing well but I can still get all the
information that I want out of it and it
kind of helped change my perspective on
things and I really appreciate it sort
of that refresh on stuff so i thought i
would share it with you guys think about
your phone or your tablet as you look at
it maybe you're coming through the end
of your contract and you're like oh I
hate this I can't wait to upgrade my
iphone 3g is slowest thing in the world
I want to throw it against the wall
think about what that device can do
logically what it's capable of running
what it can hand on how it changes your
life and makes you like better sometimes
worse and put it into perspective I've
tried to get approached with a lot of
things in my life you know I feel like I
need a bigger faster car bigger you know
house or more things more things and I
realize the things don't always matter
as much as you might think these
students can access is anything in the
world you can look up how many species
of mountain goat live on the plains in
northern Africa you can get that
information in under 10 seconds it is
ridiculous and incredible and I feel
honored to live in a generation that has
access to the information and that's
your the point of the video and is
really I want the Durant on myself
getting so upset and mad it wasn't the
best and the biggest in it with a
fastest thing in the world it's still
very serviceable and works really well I
guess you could say that about me I'm
not the big ism the fat's in the world
but I'm still serviceable I still work
