editor-in-chief of the site I'm joined
by executive editor of mobile Todd
Hazleton everyone and executive editor
of gaming joey davidson hey what's up
everybody oh here we are this is the
first episode of the all-new
TechnoBuffalo show for those of you that
may have been around for tech on the
range as we set at the end of June where
we were ending that show and we were
going to start over and this is the
whole new show what we're going to be
doing is we will be on video every week
wednesdays at 12 eastern 9 a.m. pacific
we will be broadcasting on our main
youtube channel you can also find a post
on the site we will then release the
show as a audio podcast later in the day
so for those of you that still want to
listen that way you'll still be able to
we don't have night UN's link yet
because you have to have the first
episode before they looks up the feed so
and soon this is interesting I this is
our part of the joys of being live I'm
now hearing myself from when the show
started well mute it close that I'm not
sure where oh I know where it's coming
from it's because I have the YouTube
channel open my god there you go well
the joys of being live well and I guess
we should apologize in advance I have a
dog she's somewhere if someone walks by
if like a gust of wind blows by she's
gonna lose her mind that that's the
nature being live and well as that sort
of stuff out of the audio show but if
you're watching live you're going to get
to see the extra stuff like that so
that's about it we're going to get into
we're going to be doing things a little
bit differently we're going to be trying
to focus more on one topic per week and
then towards the end of the show we'll
throw it open to questions so if you're
on YouTube if you're on the site if you
want to throw questions and please feel
free and you can also plus one though so
we get an idea of which questions you'd
most like to see us answer at the end of
the show this week we're going to be
focusing on the aspects of twitch and
how it's changing gaming and Joey that's
kind of your
or wheelhouse so if you want to lead us
off here um well I think I can start by
saying that that I have never been much
for twitch never really used the service
when just from straight pc gaming but
started using it because of the
PlayStation 4 when it launched it had
the twitch streaming app kind of built
in like soon as you press that share
button you have the option to either
stream on ustream I think or twitch and
because of how stupid easy it is on that
console and it just launched on the xbox
one it's just as easy there because of
how stupid is easy it is on those
consoles i am into twitch now like I
actually watch twitch in my free time
that's what I do so I just think the
twitch in general is is kind of changing
the way that we game socially and I
think that it's just been a really
awesome invention for this generation
and I would even argue that you know
next to graphics or whatever twitch and
social gaming and sharing gaming it's
probably the biggest benefit to the new
generation of consoles so not as you
guys we didn't have you ever been used
twitch Todd Sean yeah I used it in the
past and I would just look up like
Starcraft matches and stuff but you know
what i think a blink you James you know
I think I think what's really cool about
it too is that you can get a sense of
how the gameplay is without like looking
at demos and stuff online or replays you
know you just bring it up right on your
TV sort of see exactly how it's gonna
look and then I liked it you get kind of
strategies to you can see how some of
the best players in the world are
playing you're like oh well I've never
played like that or you know anything
like that so it's not cool yeah I've
never transmitted anything on Twitch i
have watched Joey as you know I watch
you when you play quite often it's a
tedious thing I mean I time saying it's
a great way to get an idea if the game
is actually going to be I mean it's one
thing to read it about a game but to
actually see it an emotion is a totally
different beast you know and so like I
was watching you play titanfall earlier
this morning and you were having trouble
with games loading and so you know that
that gives
a little bit more to think about because
you know do I want go through that
hassle maybe I should wait a week maybe
I should you know skip the game all
together and that's not something that's
gonna come across in a review as well as
seeing it live on a video stream yeah
it's pretty cool I was actually checking
in this is kind of weird I guess but I'm
like old games that I used to play to to
see what has changed a guy I saw at
which for Ultima Online which I love you
guys know that so I tuned into that
yesterday on my on my phone after i
loaded on my xbox and that was cool and
like watching world of warcraft like
some of the advanced you know levels
that I would never even get to and
seeing how they play there so you get
like insight to games that you play too
you know I might not have time in World
of Warcraft for example to ever get to
those places yeah what and let's talk a
little bit about the mobile app because
twitch just announced that they're gonna
let mobile streaming happen yeah that's
pretty cool is it cool I think it's kind
of weird like I don't know I mean I feel
like let people you know broadcast
everywhere I think that's what makes it
so compelling right sure oh I'm not I
won't argue with how compelling that is
I just think it's I don't know maybe
maybe I'm just being get off my lawn
right now but I feel like streaming
mobile games just seems like so weird
like why would anyone want to watch me
tap stuff for a while you know what I
mean yeah I think I mean there's a point
there but when you look at like Nvidia
shield right like you get I think a
little more advanced games in some
respects that would be fun so I hadn't
even considered that man no someone has
that's what like androids come on yeah I
was just saying that I come across you
so what do we think about situation why
don't you shuffle that up to the yeah I
I am doing that right now uh we were we
were asked by a viewer what is your
opinion on things like twitch plays
Pokemon do you guys like to watch them
do they interest you and that was asked
by I apologize if I mispronounce your
name shashin baha i didn't get into what
I I tuned in once or twice and it looked
like absolute chaos to me he's don't I
didn't stick around I think they're I
haven't checked in awhile i think the
channel moved on to crystal because they
started with
red and blue known i think that they
have they have since started pokemon
crystal and i love those streams i love
it i just think it's such a really
awesome way for gamers to be involved
with a game that's really really really
old I don't know like the guy who
created I have no idea why he decided
Pokemon was the one to pick but it is
super compelling I love watching those
streams yeah I I did like looking at all
the fan art it generated though and all
the stuff about consulting the fossil
say well they got rid of the helix
fossil right right at the beginning
sorry I'm Pokemon nerd now that's
another thing to change with the new
show Joey will completely nerd out over
Pokemon this he brought it up we'll talk
about phones i see that question yes I
and real quick for we're getting some
questions about yo I thought there'd be
talking about phones the show's gonna
change every week it just depends on
what we decide is the topic of the week
so this week it's gaming next week it
could be phones it could be tablets we
don't know we will just be doing this as
we go and i will move that question the
top and then get rid of it awesome thank
you for the question man yes thank you
everyone that's submitting questions we
do greatly appreciate well here's
another twitch related question though
do you think twitch might partner with
steam concerning the steam box upcoming
do they need to I mean it seems like
it's oh I guess I see what you're saying
kind of like having an ingrained inside
steam man I think it already is with
origin I'm making that up even though it
seems like would make perfect sense
though I think it already is with origin
I remember fooling around with that with
simcity when it launched it makes
perfect sense to me I think if they
don't include it in steam that's kind of
silly butt twitch twitch is like out to
take over the gaming world right now so
here's my question Joey what's their
business model 23 yeah well there's
advertisements so you can that you can
pay to be like I can't remember what
it's called but let's call it a premier
member
right i don't remember the name you can
pay to remove advertisements from your
channel and then it's a subscription fee
there or there's like an ad that plays
every couple minutes while you're
watching see I was when I was going
through last night I saw the ads pop up
and I thought those were the like the
gamers that were broadcasting on Twitch
head like some kind of revenue model
themselves really they so a lot of like
hardcore streamers who maybe even do it
for like a living right they can they
can set up like donation boxes and stuff
so that why people will just come in
anonymous people will say like I like
how you're playing this game here's ten
thousand dollars whatever I mean I wish
that happened to me no I whenever I tune
it it's just a lot of you rocking back
and forth each early for four long been
waiting for so much I know the power of
the cloud and whatever for Microsoft but
I was so disappointed with all the
server issues titan falls been facing
right now I mean it was inevitable the
game is flippin huge but well I speaking
to the twitch and steam thing I think
that twitch has shown that it's going to
put itself wherever it can I mean with
the integration into the PlayStation 4
and the integration of the xbox one I
think it's inevitable that somebody is
going to make that conversation happen
but now here here's a good question
right here what is twitch is this like
in the literal sense or like in the
existential why we're here my guess
would be the literal sense but twitch it
started on PCs but it's it's a way for
you to broadcast your gameplay to the
internet for free kind of a very similar
to YouTube except it's live there's a
chat room that runs alongside the the
streams and then if you have the
hardware setup for it you can speak with
a microphone while you're streaming so
like we've TechnoBuffalo we actually
have only officially screwed one thing
we were just fooling with it but octodad
we stream that for a while which is
ridiculous but that's at which is it's
actually a pretty cool social feature so
no yet now that and that brings up an
interest
question I wonder white which seems to
be the the the service of choice right
now as opposed to say a YouTube why is
twitch the preferred model for gamers
twitch is super friendly for gamers
first of all of it for instance you can
go in at which right now and browse by
game and that's something that they've
set up internally when you start a
stream you select which game you're
playing from from there already build
library of games and then you
automatically get channeled down so it's
not like on YouTube where you would fire
up YouTube and then if you're looking
for a stream of World of Warcraft or
something you would the only way you
could find it is by typing it in I don't
even know how you would find a stream by
World of Warcraft actually like not a
archive broadcast but a live stream I
don't know you know what I found really
cool too is that I can sit here and sort
of have a game on like I would like an
NBA game or something and just having
him in my living room and watching like
some of the best players out there just
kind of chat and run around and shoot
stuff it's really fun to just count so
you didn't see that yeah I agree and I
think I also agree with you Todd it's an
awesome way to kind of check out a game
beforehand especially something like
titanfall which we may or may not be on
the fence about already so but yeah
which is pretty sweet man I I definitely
wasn't a fan six months ago but here I
am so we have a nether question here or
I appreciate everyone turning questions
related to twitch we actually plan to do
Q&amp;amp;A at the end but you're in the
conversation with us and we think that's
great so this question so what would be
a good setup software hardware for
streaming on Twitch ok so for PC let's
well let's start with the xbox one and
playstation 4 they have it built into
the hardware so especially if you update
the xbox one with the most recent update
excuse me all you have to say is xbox
broadcast for the PlayStation 4 you just
press the ps4 button you do need a good
internet connection i recommend wiring
your machines for this especially in my
house where for some reason like six
feet from my router I'd like data
monster comes in and like blocks all the
signal but so wire it if you can for the
pc i'm not sure if
you can stream from I mean I'm Mac or
Linux I'm certain you can I'm certain
there's a way but I use uh gosh open
broadcast is the software i use that's
free i think it's called open broadcast
it's free it's pretty powerful it's
pretty easy to set up and as long as you
have a halfway decent video card you
should be good to go and I've streamed
things you know octodad Banner Saga a
couple other games and I've run into no
issues with lag and my pc is top of the
line from two years ago so yeah and that
is the great thing I mean with with
twitch being built into the xbox one in
the PlayStation 4 you just click a
button and you've done yeah and that's
that's what's really made it awesome for
me I it was that it was it was being
able to just click it and go I actually
have a question for you Joey so what's
the deal with like supported games like
I just was loading it up right and I
have titanfall on the way today but I
don't have it yet and like I can I do
battlefield 4 it said I don't have any
games and support which i have no idea I
think I do anything right am I rod but
then that's what I thought but it said I
don't have any twitch supported games
hmm no no I don't know maybe I have to
and NM my question for that would be
what makes a games worth which supported
but I don't know I might my guess and
this is strictly a guess would be
licensing situations oh I mean that's
not really the nature of twitchett so
maybe once it got on consoles they had
to change some of that licensing stuff
up but well I saw a message yesterday
when I went to watch one of your live
streams of titanfall it was saying I
can't remember which game it was but
there was one game of saying that you
may not twitch it until the 18th and the
big movie was a specific launch date
yeah it was tied to a launch date and so
it was saying if you you know broadcast
before that date they would remove the
stream hmm yeah that's a good point i
wonder what happens with like uh
embargoed game reviews right and then
you're like oh well I'm just gonna
switch this everybody I imagine if I
imagine any reviewer would because I've
gotten for instance with super mario 3d
world right there was an embargo on that
for
video coverage where I was only allowed
to post pre-recorded video in like three
minute clips you remember this Sean yep
so in that same embargo email it said
you will not you are not allowed to live
stream this game until whatever its
release date was cool okay so they have
that all figured right so I imagine like
a lot of I mean with pretty much every
review i've gotten every review copy
I've gotten so far there's always some
live stream information there so yeah
exactly and that I think it was
two-minute clips and they couldn't be
consecutive to two-minute clips and a
there was all searches yeah hendo they
so long it was ridiculous guys along
with that ah another question from
saucon Mahal I'm trying man I'm trying
hey I appreciate the pronunciation the
hall right got a bit I I'm look I've
lived with the name ani my entire life
and there's like five of us in the
entire country hunay and exactly tech
will we be seeing technote afloat now I
can't say the name of the site will we
be seeing technobuffalo doing more
twitch live streams yeah we'll well Sean
I'm fine with it okay well Joey can we
can we game together and like if people
like longitude in and watch us both play
titanfall that works right I don't know
why someone would want to do such a
thing but yeah they can if they want to
make some jokes you know we'll make fun
yeah just you know 45 minutes of poop
jokes while we get shot of each other
sanity what that brings us to a another
question that's coming have you guys
ever entertained the idea of having a
full private lobby in one game with all
the TechnoBuffalo staff along with your
gaming fans yes we do discuss that from
time to time the big problem is that we
live in so many different time zones
that's hard for us to all line up yeah
you know so when the guys in irvine are
getting off at five o'clock it's already
eight o'clock for Joey and Todd and Joey
has a son so he's been ice time you seen
for a half an hour but exactly todd todd
is the oldest member of the staff
mentally it appears is true 30 oh he
gets on and he goes I got too much sleep
last night I'm an old man who says that
I don't know I chronologically I'm the
oldest member of staff but somehow Todd
is older than me but my tribe as soon as
we're forgetting all out in all aspects
of my life it drives my wife nuts like I
you should see my desk it's like this
old man wooden desk that sounds awesome
I have this bankers lamp like was born
in the 40s I think bankers lamp hey hey
here here's a question that could start
a fire some what do you prefer xbox one
or ps4 I'm not going to touch that oh
boy we like having an audience I'll be
honest in what I prefer since i'm when
i'm outside the gaming department and i
go for it oh god is no it's just who has
who has a like where my friends are and
right now my friends are on ps4 it's the
staff of the site but i have xbox one
too and my friends outside of
technobuffalo are still on the xbox 360
so I'll game with them there but once
they upgrade then I don't know it might
change no so because for me it's a very
social experience with with people that
I know in real life too yeah when I was
before I like I committed to owning
every platform um I've gained where my
friends game as well Sean so I don't
Todd I don't think that's odd i think
that that's pretty normal i guess
preference i can tell you what I've been
playing more recently and it's only
because of review copies and that's xbox
one but titan falls on xbox one plants
vs zombies garden warfare was on xbox
one I had no real preference I love all
the current consoles wii u included so
yeah we use awesome Joey convinced me to
buy we you know I know man get out there
enjoy a good question what is your
twitch name so we can follow you same
thing is Twitter which is down below its
joey davidson no spaces so yeah and
that's mine in case anybody wants noble
rod robot odd
photon right robot on that's Sean P ani
not Sean punny as some people think but
uh you know hey to the will
technobuffalo show keep bearing at this
time yes this is currently are chosen
time so be looking for us every
wednesday at noon eastern nine pacific
what do you think about the new
southpark game review went up yesterday
on the site Joey gave it a 7.5 you can
go over there and read the full details
and I still want that game even though
you gave it a 7.5 hands is the 7.5 is
not a bad score man I know game if you
love south park like love love love
South parkin it might as well be a 94
you so hey it's dave from geek annoyed
coming in with a question how you doing
Dave hello from geek annoys in the UK
yet again a big game launched with
titanfall on so many issues with game
servers do you think big publishing
company should put more money behind
delivering smooth launches yeah are you
Joey well what's what's crazy here you
can't even really blame this one on EA
which I know is what people want to do
but these are Microsoft servers this is
not EA has a really bad history with
launching games and and servers just
crippling under their day one wait but
this is a microsoft server launched with
titanfall and it just absolutely
destroyed itself I think it's a problem
I think it's really sad that we've come
to accept it too I think that's I think
that's the bigger problem is that some
gamers and some critics say oh it's day
it's a day one launch its to be expected
it shouldn't be expected we should be
upset about this it's it its customer
service you know what I mean they should
be preparing themselves for the obvious
influx of users so well met here's the
question I was trained some texts with
somebody last night who i'm not sure if
they want the names i won't name them
and we were discussing whether or not
you know how is this going to reflect on
microsoft down the road and my response
was once the games playable again there
even gonna remember this happen but that
being said it still should not have
happened yeah that's what that's my
feeling too is sort of like oh yeah I
remember that but who cares you know
well and and Todd you can speak to the
somewhat you know from like say every
time Apple releases a new version of iOS
although I will say the the 7.1 launched
earlier this week didn't seem to have
any problems see I did have some issues
but really I a different cited by iPhone
and my iPad oh really minor and they fix
themselves but it was weird I don't know
yeah it's I don't know it's I don't
think it's something we should accept I
don't think it's something we should
expect and speaking directly to dave
from geek annoys question yeah they
should they should pump a ton of money
into this they know especially with a
game like titanfall that everyone's kind
of looking at is the first big
next-generation launch they should have
had every server imaginable ready to go
yeah yeah it just it was unfortunate and
I i agree through Joey we should not
just sit back and go oh well that's just
the way it is now that's that that
logics almost unacceptable to me so yeah
exactly exactly yeah we got a question
about hello why is EA servers never
working kind of dress that I and they
just companies are not putting enough
money into their servers well it's again
tight these servers the pc side is EA
the xbox one side is is microsoft so ya
know that this was definitely microsoft
because this was an issue where you
couldn't get into xbox live at all yeah
yeah yeah so this was not a Titan fall
specific issue that this was microsoft
in this particular situation mm-hmm
working a lot more questions than i
expected i want to thank everybody
that's sending them in we greatly
appreciate it a couple of these i'm
going to save until the end of the
episode because they're related to other
topics so joey i mean i know that in the
past you've said that you're not that
big on the whole social gaming scene but
do you think twitch is
a more appropriate social system for
gaming okay so when I say I'm not really
keen on social gaming I think just to be
clear I'm talking about the stuff on
Facebook yeah yeah games so if that's if
that's one definition of social gaming
no I'm not a fan of the twitch style of
social gaming where someone will talk to
me in the twitch chat room and then that
camp conversation will carry over to you
know Xbox Live or the PlayStation 4 even
steam that side of social gaming I
really like and I'm really excited about
where it's going so I think it's
probably really awesome I do you think
this is like what's gonna take eSports
mainstream to in the United States
because I've always and I know they
exist I mean when we were in vegas for
CES we were in a in a place that had TVs
everywhere that you could sort of play
games with other people and tune in i
thought well wow this would be a great
place where you could also have a live
broadcast of like you know Starcraft
tournament or something like that and I
know those places exist but people i
mean i think it's a very niche market
and right now with twitch now anybody
can sort of tune it you think we're
going to see you know the major league
gamers and stuff start promoting all of
this but they'll say like 6 p.m. on
saturday come in and tune in for the
tournament well i like millions of
viewers vs I think well at least the
United States vs funny you should
mention that and I'm not really even in
the e sports fan so to speak like I
don't I don't follow it religiously I do
know that there was a statistic out
there that the League of Legends
championships for this year the
livestream had more viewers than the
Super Bowls live stream wow wow that's
that might just be a difference of the
audiences like obviously people watching
the Super Bowl probably just tuned in on
their television not the live stream but
it's just it's crazy that I see you're
saying versus yeah but I why the
potential is huge right so I think yeah
Todd I do think it could take esports
now if not mainstream it will definitely
collect a lot more interest this way so
I would love that yeah all right well
we're coming up on the questioning sir
we've got a lot of questions coming in
so we're probably gonna have to power
through some of these so you know please
thank you again to everyone that's
sending in questions we really
appreciate it so these are going to be
all over the board they're not going to
be specific to the twitch question Joey
do you have any closing thoughts on the
twitch situation now it which is good
cool it's good okay so opening it up to
questions what do you guys want to see
in the new HTC One Todd this is all you
um good question i really want to see
this become a software play for HTC
because I did hardware is great but
there you go ok Joe choice you have to
say something so you show up on camp sec
did a great job with the original one
right but sales aren't that awesome and
the company's sort of going down the
tubes like honestly our revenues or
they're gonna miss their estimates for
this quarter so I think really they're
gonna have to show the audience like
what are they doing differently and it
can't just be hardware because they
already did that with the HTC One I mean
it's a beautiful phone it's a great
device all around so what's the new one
gonna do I don't know the camera looks
unique I don't know if that's gonna sell
it to to consumers and I think you know
we're gonna expect a Snapdragon 801
processor 1080p screen a lot of the same
specs so software play let's see what
they do in this offers up yeah I tend to
agree with you I think we're at a point
with phones yo and we keep hearing about
the quad you know k displays and all
that folks come on yeah you don't read
you don't eat a 4k display on your phone
I'm sorry you don't I i yes a 4k
television they're gorgeous but on a
phone that you're holding this close to
your face no so yeah I think it's going
to be more of a software play than
anything although I'm interested to see
what the the dual camera setup is all
about so we shall see thank you for that
question Nathan coming up and they also
thank you to everyone that's plus
wanting these so we see which ones
you're most interested in Joey this is a
gaming question do you see a day when pc
console gaming will become irrelevant
and that all
move over to mobile I know the answer
it's coming to this was it's a hard and
definitive no I I don't where to start
on this I mean first of all your your
phone doesn't there's a difference
between tactile input on a controller or
our mouse and keyboard then there is for
touch gameplay I love touch gameplay I'm
not knocking it but there are two very
different experiences and i do not see
mobile coming up with a solution that
makes sense in terms of being in your
pocket and being a phone but at the same
time providing tactile play there's a
reason why people were running out and
buying those uh those game clips in
droves that the clips that like clip
your phone to your Dualshock 4 or
whatever so first of all no on that
front but for console gaming and pc
gaming and maybe even the steam box
there is a certain allure to sitting
down in front of your television and
playing games and i don't see that
disappearing and i'd argue that the what
6 million people that have purchased a
playstation 4 and the four or five
million that are purchased an xbox one
would probably agree with me they prefer
consoles over mobile gaming and mobile
gaming is great when you're in between
things but as your your mainstay and
your main focus I don't see the whole
world switching over to that not I mean
maybe like a bajillion years from now I
don't know right right let me just add
sorry oh no go ahead thought when we met
with the oculus at CES they said that
you know the virtual reality gaming it's
going to advance rapidly but it's always
going to rely on the latest computer
hardware to have the best experience
they said even consoles aren't going to
keep up with where they want to go and
so I think that's good also I mean if
virtual reality like that's really going
to take off then I think pcs have to do
right yeah well I'm people people like
to argue especially mobile phone users
that you know the phone specs are
catching up with console and PC specs
I'm not going to argue with that you
know in some regards they are but
there's a lot more to gaming than specs
it has to do with the lifestyle playing
on a television playing with a
controller you know that adds very
different layers to gaming itself so
well I see a lot of people pointing to
the fact that mobile has become the
dominant gaming so way to game in Japan
but you
after remember Japan is a very very
different beast than the rest of the
world these are people that's been large
chunks of their life on trains sure I
when we when I was in Japan who is a
30-minute commute on train was short so
yeah yeah I mean every time I've been to
Tokyo it's like on the train on the
train on the train so yeah I can see why
it's happened there but in the rest of
the world no I don't think mobile is
ever gonna replace pc and console gaming
completely it's just not going to happen
okay thank you for that question
Jonathan okay next up what do you think
is better Twitter YouTube live I I'll
just quickly say I think it depends on
what you're trying to do if you're
trying to stream games i would say
twitch if you're you know the reason
we're going with youtube live is this
will be archives for later viewing you
guys have any thoughts on that nope odd
no I don't know yeah it's all based on
your use case sure yeah so you know try
them out see which one works best for
you this is a really technical question
I'll answer this one as quickly as
possible I've been trying to listen to
podcasts on my phone but no matter what
app stitcher podcast attic the audio
will cut out soon after the screen goes
off is this a setting problem or my
phone I am going to say it's probably a
setting problem so go into your settings
and see what your sleep settings are set
at because typically when the screen
goes off the podcast should continue to
play it also depends on which phone
you're using another one from David geek
annoyed thank you Dave thanks for answer
I would be very interested to hear your
views on 4k video creation for YouTube
do you think it's too early for online
couriers like ourselves to invest yeah
John I degrees John I degree I mean it
you're talking about capturing equipment
is something like a camera is something
like forty five thousand dollars for 4k
and then outputting depends on the user
how many people do you know with 4k
displays yeah that's a good point so I
got it you're you're appealing to like
your your audience is getting super
super nice so I mean I don't know if
it's worth the investment yet I mean
yeah YouTube will adjust to whatever
your display your users displays are but
at the same time I mean if you've got a
great working camera right now yes you'd
be future-proofing yourself but y Huget
up that's right so I mean the prices of
the 4k camera a year from now we're
going to be a lot different than they
are now and the depreciation on that
camera you bought today is going to be
Laura right just go put a down payment
on a house yeah yeah exactly uh okay
next question have any of you guys
played the Elder Scrolls online beta no
but I can't wait negative no I didn't
get in yeah I know Todd's anxious to
play it but I have gotten like mmos okay
is that okay do you think YouTube
content creators should be able to
enable or disable the video rating
system I that would be a question for
jon rettinger and he will be appearing
on the these shows from time to time but
yeah I think more content control is
better so the answers yes I I think I
know that there's an argument there that
some creators might want to insulate
themselves from negativity in both good
and bad ways but in my mind give the
creator's as much control as you can
totally agree totally agree um oh do you
think the 6-inch iphone is going to be a
reality no not now I think what we're
looking at is probably like the 47 4.7
inch used to be the most talked-about
rumor and then you also go to 55 and 57
57 was a new one I don't even know where
that came from uh maybe I mean I think
if Apple really wants to hit these these
asian markets where the phablet's are
really huge popular than it could be a
good choice to go that way yeah i just i
don't see Apple go they may eventually
but it's not more likely like a 47 yeah
it's not going to be this fall for sure
I am new to android so's Nexus 5 a good
choice for a starter yes styrian it fun
yep
because you're doing a pure Android
experience and none of the you know if
you start with say like a samsung phone
with TouchWiz on top of it then you're
going to form your opinion of android
based on moron with an Android so yeah
it was yeah excellent choice moto X was
going to be much choice it wasn't for
this HTC One but yeah uh let's see here
we've got a lot i'm not sure we're going
to get all these folks so let me scan
these real quick here and see here's a
good one what do you think about the
Comcast Time Warner merger bad bad bad
is not good for anybody between that net
neutrality man I think the internet that
we see at least the the internet that we
in the United States see right now is
going to be very different from the
internet that we see in six months to a
year which kind of sucks yeah this is a
horrible merger and I'm really really
helpful the FTC steps in on this one
it's not gonna be good for the consumer
at all mmm yeah Creed's manam yeah well
I don't not really but darn close oh
yeah I mean you're so fios floating
around you have google but i mean i'd
call it a regional monopoly almost Oh No
yep well I mean my town of emily has one
cable provider rayo new york city or
county torn i mean time warner has it
big grip and then files is in pockets
and you have RC in some pockets just
come orders to come to like everywhere
just bring it everywhere give everyone
free internet with that hundred-dollar
one-time install fee and let us write
off into heaven together until our data
do you like dumb well we'll be thumb on
Louise like as we drive off the cliff
with Google Fiber oh boy I like that top
question yeah with mobile computing
becoming more of a thing do you think
desktop os's will go away or really
change their look to match mobile OS as
example Windows 8
what I think is going to happen is it
will have mobile devices that run both
right so you have a mobile experience
and then you plug it into your monitor
or maybe wirelessly and then you get a
full desktop experience I think that's
where we're going I mean you'd love to
you is doing that with you want to touch
so yeah yeah I I I don't know I i think
that uh you know apples address this
recently because there had always been
these rumors that OS template was going
to go more of an iOS direction and
they've said you know there's a reason
that the two of them look different
because the way you use the os's are
completely different so yeah I think
we'll see a lot more design cues but I
don't think we'll see the same
functionality exactly but on that front
it doesn't rule out that you could have
iOS 7 on your iphone and mac OS x on
your iphone but you don't run OS on your
iphone you plug it into a monitor and
then your iphone to power that you know
what's up exactly here's here's a
housekeeping question it also is it
possible to make these podcasts
available download directly rather than
or in addition to itunes yes there will
be an RSS feed and you will also be able
to listen to us on the stitcher app so
we're getting that all set up the that
will be available we should have all
those details for you in the next day or
two but you must have an intro song too
yeah Joey we'll talk about that later I
relisten to that one that you hated the
least decided it wasn't good so we're
still picking a theme song at this
moment yeah oh let's see here boy you
guys are just asking tons of questions
which we love but i watch i get to as
many as we can uh what do you think
about the new galaxies and galaxy s5
Todd you're the only one that's touched
it yeah I really liked it I liked it a
lot um I think Samsung fans will get
more of what you expect from Samsung I
think ip67 water resistance is really
cool it doesn't affect the display at
all we're like the overall design I
don't know if people are really gonna
like the hatch on the bottom a camera
interface was really nice looked really
smooth and TouchWiz has been cleaned up
its flattered
I think the experience is much improved
now whether or not someone's going to
choose that overly eight the new HTC One
I don't know because they're going to be
totally different devices so you have to
play with them both yep all right I'm
going to take two more questions and
then we'll we'll call this first episode
done and again thank you everyone as
tuned in the this has been a great
experience and we will be fine tuning
this over the coming weeks so what you
see today may not be exactly what you
see in the future but it's gonna be darn
close it's just gonna be this except
I'll have my shirt off I think that's
gonna be the only idea okay that was
disturbing anyway okay so let's see here
Joey what do you think about titanfall
so far it's good i've been playing it
this morning i am kind of taught I know
yours is on its way right yeah yeah
every last night with like Amazon's
express delivery so should be here today
right on when from when people play with
and I did it eric frederiksen another
one of our writers has it so we'll be
playing together but it's fun it is I
know that some people might not like
this but I do think it is an upgraded
version of call of duty it's more
interesting than call of duty it's more
fun than call of duty is but I do think
that it feels very familiar but you know
so I i I'm excited by it i'm working on
the review now think i have like three
hours played so not much yeah i've got
my copy I just need to get logged in and
start playing so Joey can start kicking
my ass which I'm sure will happen uh
let's see real quick here here here's
one I've got to take this one because
this is a topic that I talk about all
the time what do you think is going to
happen to the ipod line is the pono
player and store going to be a hit first
off the ipod line is headed for death
there's no question I I cannot believe
the ipod classic is still considered to
be in production even though it's not
been updated like 1600 days only people
i know with an ipod are people who have
it's better really young that they don't
want them to have oh come on Shawn phone
okay here-here's the the whole reason I
still use an ipod classic if I'm working
out I don't want my phone around weights
or a treadmill every bothering you yeah
so Sean Sean Sean you working out nobody
I swear Joey has a sensor in my
treadmill that has crossed the office
and every time I step on that treadmill
i get i am ding from joey davidson hey
good save this gif never fails yeah the
pono player and store going to be a hit
no no $20 albums I don't care what
quality they are nope hey the first off
mp3 players are dying off there there's
no question about that because i am the
oddball here i know that most people are
just going to use their phone for music
the puddle player is too big it's oddly
shaped it's not gonna be easy to hold
I've never even heard it opens a new
range yesterday it's a Kickstarter from
Neil Young immoral Neil Young Neil Young
is trying to start a new mp3 player and
I actually I think it's gonna be playing
flax 93 Black is awesome I mean I mean
that in all seriousness uh nope it's
like a pure park I know I said that was
the last question but one is popped up
that must be addressed yeah I saw that
too it's fine no vanillish comments
