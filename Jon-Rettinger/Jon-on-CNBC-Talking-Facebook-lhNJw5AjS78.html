president of technobuffalo John great of
you to join us today so they've got a
couple of problems here at least
according to reports advertiser fatigue
and user fatigue will this new redesign
help so this redesign is aimed squarely
at addressing both of those issues now
certainly putting pictures front and
center making videos easier to find is
great for the end user and it makes the
end users are able to find information
easier but also advertisers find
information a lot easier so people
should get ready for larger louder ads
this is the digital version of putting
giant neon lights glowing and arrows
pointing right at your new news feed and
in terms of the ads that need to be on
the facebook and am I writing thinking
here John they kind of need to be very
participatory you know the average
person who goes on facebook is used to
interacting wants to be out of shape
maybe the ad campaign themselves they
need to have that interaction absolutely
facebook is now responsible to their
shareholders they're going to be judged
squarely on user engagement and the user
engagement has been going down and down
despite you know over a billion users on
the social network so the idea is by
putting these loud ads are right in
front of you the engagement is going to
be much higher email to finding
advertisements that are geared directly
toward to the user is there any
possibility this is going to just turn
this a lot I mean John I mean you know
just just more ads more stuff is it just
going to turn people off and and
exacerbate the problem that's already
going on you know so there's absolutely
that problem facebook though despite
sort of losing that user engagement
people are still going to Facebook 61.8
percent daily active users they said in
their last quarterly earnings so no
one's going away from facebook the idea
is out to make the ads seem more organic
to the new news feed so you don't mind
seeing them and the bringing in
information from all kinds of sources
Facebook is even bringing advertisements
from local card purchases that I've been
done completely offline if you got a
rewards card the grocery store you'll
start to see those ads show up in your
facebook timeline Julia and Mandy I just
want to say the the reason why they are
putting such an emphasis on photos and
why we'll see that also impact away ABS
is because Facebook has found that
people engage much more with photos in
their newsfeed than they do with text
updates so people want to see photos and
that's why that's really influencing all
of these changes and at the end of the
day what people engage with whether it's
from their friends or with advertisers
if it is photo-based and that is going
to really direct a lot of what we see on
the site moving for one can I ask a
question is kind of off the topic of
Facebook but in the same sort of sector
here John whatever happened to Google+
you know so funny you should mention
that the new redesign actually looks
like Google+ Google Plus has been
growing is becoming a platform for
sharing video a lot you can do live
video interactions and live streams via
a google plus they certainly haven't had
the engagement that Google was hoping
for years ago but it as far as social
networks in Google go if there be a
success to date so you can look at that
anyway what do you think Google+ is
going to be here to stay and get bigger
and better yeah I think Google's got the
resources to make sure Google+ is here
what do you tell a while well Mandy I
think it's really interesting that
Zuckerberg stressed today that people on
their newsfeed should be able to share
with their friends a small group and
also with the public a larger group and
that's really what Google+ has not
mastered this ability to share with
different circles of people and so I
think that what Zuckerberg is trying to
do is make sure that Facebook isn't just
a platform for friends to share with
friends but for it to be a platform
we're sharing with anyone exists which
is what Google Plus does and what
Twitter does with sharing them homeland
and that's very interesting facebook is
almost competing with themselves with
their Instagram purchase by really
putting emphasis on photos they're
trying to almost undercut themselves
with Instagram fascinating stuff is good
space to watch thanks Julia thanks John</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
