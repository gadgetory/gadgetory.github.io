on the iTunes Wi-Fi store on the iPhone
I met a couple things sorry the videos a
little shaky I took the video with my
digital camera still getting used to it
and also I mentioned
all right make mention to the video I
made of the software update to 1.1.1 on
the iPhone that I didn't post because it
was really long and really boring so
there's the answer that question I'm
white talk about that a little bit
anyway guys enjoy go ahead and ask
whatever questions you have thanks for
watching and thank you guys for
subscribing and case anybody's wondering
I'm wearing the Hat because baseball
playoffs start tomorrow
alright guys talk to you soon bye
alright guys as promised I'm going to
walk you through the new iTunes Wi-Fi
store on the iPhone the first thing I
want to show you before I do that is one
of the new cooler things that the
software update 1.1.1 did lets do with
the Bluetooth headset if you look right
up at the top of the phone right there
you can see a icon now for the headset
so if I go into menu for example I can
see it a lot clearer a little blurry but
right up there it tells me how much
battery life is left in the headset
which is nice didn't do that before okay
so now let me walk you through a
purchase on the iTunes Wi-Fi store so I
will just go to purchase or good iTunes
Wi-Fi I'm connected to my Wi-Fi network
at home it's on downloaded but I can
click on featured and it pulls up a
whole menu here of new releases top
what's hot and genres I don't know what
song I want to download here at the
bottom I have across here featured top
10 search and downloads and right now
you can only download music and can only
do it over Wi-Fi so that means no TV
shows no movies and you can't do it on
singular xej network not that you'd want
to so let's see if there's a song that I
want here maybe these people are alright
let's check what's hot
reba mcentire eddie vedder millionaire
Pat Monahan just bought that album
Nicole's something um check John Rose
here
it's gonna rock let's see all right it's
fine I don't know the song but
Nickelback download that song let's
click it and if proxy pulls up a whole
album so let's say here's all the songs
in the album let's say I want to hear
example of it I don't want to hear one
from the first song here follow you home
I'll click it there we go I think it's a
30 second sample ok let's go ahead and
bias on here what song sounds good
I'll just download the first song follow
you home so I'll click it pull up a Buy
Now thing I'll click buy now go to
downloads asking me for my password so I
will type that in here you guys look
away over here
alright password and typed in kid ok
let's try to type the password in right
and those downloads goes to one click it
if you look just in that time the song
is almost already downloaded finished so
the song we downloaded in what 7 seconds
8 seconds real quick so now the song is
in my iPod that's where if I go to
Nickelback Nickelback and there's a song
follow you home so now let's show you
how to get it from your iPhone to your
computer so I'll take the iPhone put it
in the dock here docked I already have
iTunes open opens up iPhoto again ok I
now have on my computer a purchased on
Jon's iPhone
folder which has on my purchase music in
it
I will have to sink down here and John's
iPhone sinking sinking contacts taking
bookmarks transferring purchase music
updating purchase music follow you home
and that's it it's there so now if I go
to my music search for our Nickelback
hit go back follow you home there it is
there's a song that we just fought
creeping easier than that with the album
art I don't the song structure now but I
guess we'll find out alright guys that's
how easy the new iTunes Wi-Fi is I'm
actually really impressed with how easy
it is and they're right to the speaker
is now much much much much much louder
after the software update and again my
software update was real easy you can
check out on the video
I hadn't hacked the iPhone so it was a
little piece of cake alright guys thanks
