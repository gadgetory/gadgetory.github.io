at an even to both consoles have shown
their strong points and revealed some
weaknesses well hardware is all but
covered in the next two arrives we'll be
taking an in-depth look comparing the
user interface that both consoles the
Xbox 360s new Xbox experience versus the
ps3's cross media bar is up next
so get ready for some heavyweight game
console action its LP from TechnoBuffalo
and welcome to the next installment of
the console wars
every device these days seem to have
some kind of user interface and in this
generation of game consoles it's a given
but mad how cool would it have been if
the old 8-bit Nintendo had a UI imagine
playing 8-bit tunes off your 64
kilobytes internal storage and proving
to your buddies that you've truly beaten
double dragon 2 and Castlevania by
showing off your gamer trophies well
this is possible in current generation
game consoles
well excluding the Wii of course you
still can't keep track of what games you
play on the Wii but you can always cast
a vote on the everybody votes channel
which is pretty awesome yeah but in any
case in this run we'll be covering the
user interfaces from the standpoint of
functionality we'll be focusing on
design overall usability and speed we'll
also be taking a look at some of the
more prominent offline features and
there's so much to get through that if
something doesn't get covered in this
round stay frosty he'll be covered in
the next one the ps3 and xbox360 are
both very capable media devices with
sophisticated user interfaces the Xbox
360 was first out of the gate with the
dashboard interface that paved the way
for the modern game console UI the
original dashboard was complimented for
its straightforward ease of use but
since the Xbox 360 dashboard recently
received a complete overhaul and
renaming to the new Xbox experience that
is what we're going to be looking at
first impressions are important when
assessing anything with graphical design
if something is ugly on the first glance
it's usually bound to be ugly on the
second and third look as well but I have
to admit I was a bit wowed by the design
of the new Xbox experience I was not
expecting anything this graphical and
vivid from Microsoft the Nintendo mihrab
of avatars aside the new Xbox experience
or NX II has an appealing design that's
nicely integrated into a unified
experience and it does have an extremely
polished and thought-out feel to it the
last remnant that the old dashboard can
be accessed when tapping down the menu
button on the controller which is also
accessible in-game the cross media bar
or XMB is a totally different experience
from a design standpoint Sony has taken
a very minimalistic approach to the UI
it has a very sleek but simple look to
it and the layout of the cross media bar
can be made out in single glance which
is excellent even though I was impressed
by the clean looking design of the XMB
it did not wowed me as much as the new
Xbox
experience the new Xbox experience with
its highly visual approach is definitely
more accessible for the new user both
systems have user profiles that work as
your digital identity on the game
consoles on the Xbox 360 the gamer
profile is identified by a profile name
called the gamertag the gamertag works
is the Xbox Live account name but also
an offline profile for your profile
you're required to create an avatar the
Xbox 360 avatars are basically
high-definition versions of meze
Microsoft has got a little flack about
the avatars other resemble to the
Nintendo DS but you really can't invent
the wheel twice so I don't blame them I
actually think the avatars are pretty
cool they have vast customization
possibilities and I even like the theme
playing in the background avatars are
also how your friends see you on Xbox
Live and you can also take a picture of
your avatar for your gamer tech there's
also some mini games that you can enter
with your avatar and play against your
friends but I don't know I just rather
play modern warfare 2 it is pretty clear
that avatars were added to the new Xbox
experience to appeal to the wider casual
audience
I'm betting hardcore gamers could have
done without them but after having
created in the user navigated in making
the Xbox 360 experience more appealing
to the wider audience on a side note I
actually notice the other day that you
can actually buy pets for your avatars I
think this may be going a bit too far
but some I've always kind of wanted a
pet monkey the PlayStation 3 also
requires you to create a user profile
but the ps3 suffers a bit from an
identity crisis first you have your
PlayStation user account name where you
can add your own avatar then you have
your PlayStation Network profile that
also has an avatar and what do you know
there's also an avatar in PlayStation
Home which is an entirely separate
experience Otacon
yeah not a con the point is they all
feel a bit detached from each other
where's the Xbox 360 user profile layout
feels a bit more unified and I think it
might make the ps3 more accessible to a
wider audience if they unify the ps3's
profile scheme but there are some perks
of the ps3s profile system firstly the
system does work very well if you have
multiple users playing on the console
the ps3 provides very efficient access
to the different user accounts but most
importantly the profile scheme gives you
the ability to create user accounts
registered to different regions giving
you access to various places in network
stores I have set up accounts for Europe
USA in Japan
alrighty next we're going to be checking
out the customization possibilities on
each console themes work as an extension
to the design of the interface the
PlayStation 3 has extensive
customization possibilities for the ps3
you can find countless amount of themes
online and you can also create your own
themes using some third-party
applications with a 3.0 firmware update
you can also have some very cool
animated themes some free and some will
cost you a few bucks themes on the Xbox
360 are also kind of cool most of the
time they work as a wallpaper or
backdrop but for example the French
channel is nicely integrated into the
theme with some 3d elements as well
but unfortunately most of the themes on
the xbox360 are not free and while I
like customizing my console I'm not
willing to pay for it
customization possibilities and themes
are nice add-on to the user experience
and I think the ps3 has a bit more to
offer navigation on both systems is
straightforward and simple but the
system's have a slightly different
approach to it navigating the new Xbox
experience happens on two grids the
vertical grid consists of channels for
different categories of content and the
horizontal grid consists of sub panes
under that category as you can see the
new Xbox experience is tightly woven
into Xbox Live pretty much every channel
has at least some integration with
online service I'll get deeper into the
services in the next round
but from a navigational standpoint
entering for example the Xbox Live
Marketplace can be done from several
access points which is convenient for
the experienced user but for someone
who's new to the interface the NX II can
be quite easy to get lost in and in my
opinion there may be too many pains to
take you to content that cost you your
hard earned cash navigation why is the
biggest problem of the NX II is that you
can't see what's on the other edge of
the grid so you're forced to flick
through the panes to find out what's on
the other side of the grid a very good
example of this is the friendslist you
now have to scroll through the list to
see who's online it feels a bit
unnecessary it's not too much of a
hassle if you know where everything is
but it takes some exploring if you're
new to the system the ps3s cross media
bar has a bit more straightforward and
classical approach to the navigation the
XMB is also aligned on two grids on the
horizontal grid we find icons
representing different categories under
the icons the XMB is opened up by a
simple list that runs vertically
navigation on the ps3 is quite
self-explanatory under the tool icon you
find your settings and under the music
icon you find audio content and so on
there is less integration to online
features but on a positive note the
online content is not scattered all
around the interface and the PS Reis
cross media bar definitely feels a lot
less bloated with content than the nxe
and there's also less coercion towards
paid content on the ps3 game launching
on both systems is excellent getting to
your games is fast and easy
but the ps3 has a more graphical
approach which is definitely more
appealing to the eye
speed is something I appreciate I'd
probably overclock my toaster word
possible and the new Xbox experience is
in many ways fast but speed is where the
simplicity of the cross media bar shines
the XMB is very fast to navigate and
it's basically as fast as your fingers
if you know your way around the
interface everything is within the reach
of a couple of seconds for example
accessing your music and videos is
almost instant
you
while accessing media content on the
xbox360 is behind several I think
unnecessary steps don't get me wrong I'm
not saying that the new Xbox experience
is in any way slow but what I am saying
is that the ps3 interface is definitely
faster and more responsive to sum it up
the NX II is fast but it's limited a bit
by the animations when moving between
the panes while across medium bar is
basically only limited by the speed of
your fingers as a tech enthusiast I
enjoy tinkering around with the settings
so let's take a quick comparison when we
take a look at the settings on the ps3
we immediately notice Sony's hardware
background you can adjust the settings
of pretty much every aspect of the
hardware and this is to my liking the
settings on the ps3 may be
self-explanatory for the average tech
head but for the casual user there's not
much description to what most settings
do on the 360 the settings pane is also
quite extensive but with the difference
that everything is explained with
simplistic detail there's also a very
convenient troubleshooting guide with
fixes and solutions for your most common
problems
overall the ps3 extensive settings may
appeal to the tech head but the ease of
use of the Xbox can be a bit more
appealing to those who are not
interested in the tech side of gaming
but this is where we get to the
comparison of in-game user interface for
the first year and a half of the ps3's
life cycle there was no in-game XMB
while the Xbox 360 had a very functional
in-game interface from day one even with
the new Xbox experience update the
in-game dashboard has basically gone
unchanged it does feel like a separate
experience compared to the NX II but I'm
pretty sure Microsoft has left the old
in-game interface as a fail-safe and to
keep the hardcore gamers happy you've
always been able to play your custom
music tracks compare achievements adjust
some settings and chat with your buddies
via the dashboard interface it's a
system that worked very well from the
start and it's really no surprise that
Sony copied the whole concept
in game X and B after Sony's numerous
firmware updates the features are now
pretty much the same but the in-game
cross media bar still has some
limitations for example custom music
tracks are still not supported in every
game in terms of layout and navigation
the in-game cross media bar is basically
the same as the cross media bar outside
the game only difference is that it runs
a lot slower any speed benefit the ps3
had outside the game is essentially gone
the contrast in speed is such that I
have to prefer the xbox 360's in-game
user interface because it feels solid it
works fast and it works well this round
is coming to an end and I got to tell
you it was an extremely tough round to
decide and that's because both
interfaces offer an excellent user
experience the cross media bar and the
new Xbox experience are a my opinion
both excellent user interfaces the new
xbox experience looks great it has great
integration but it's a little bloated
with the content and it's trying a bit
too hard to appeal to everyone and when
it comes down to it at the end of the
day all the glitz and glam of the
interface will become secondary
functionality and speed is what will end
up mattering and the cross media bar
offers both so by a marginal edge the
ps3 gets a point in this round but this
was only the first half of rounds
covering the interface in the next round
we'll be taking a deeper look at the
features including trophies and
achievements will also be facing off the
places and network against xbox live so
stay tuned for the next round
