joining like a Freddy vs. Jason sequel
and a good video game movie and the list
of things that are never going to be
happening today Apple took the ramps off
the iPhone 8 and the iPhone a plus the
little brothers perhaps to the flagship
iPhone 10 so let me say a little bit
about the eight and the eight plus first
there's kind of a new ish design
aesthetically the phones look the same
they still have the touch ID button the
same bezels but now they're made of
glass as a port wireless charging which
I give Apple credit for using the Qi
standard and I've been saying for years
please give me a wireless charging an
Apple now after years of asking finally
delivered and again nice edits cheese so
most of the wireless charges you may
already have at home will work the
screen size is staying the same 4.7 inch
and 5.5 on the 80 plus respectively the
resolutions also appear to be staying
the same if you want a higher res screen
and Ola technology you want to look
towards the iPhone 10 so despite the
resolution not changing Apple is
bringing the true tone display that they
debuted with the iPad pro to the iPhone
line so the screens and the pictures at
least should look better than last gens
and these screens are gonna be wrapped
in three colors either silver space grey
or a new gold new gold does look really
nice
also new here Apple's got stereo
speakers that are 25% louder a
supposedly deeper bass and powering the
new iPhone 8 an A+ is the not surprising
Apple's a 11 Bionic chip but what's
surprising it's the first Apple designed
GPU and what that's going to mean you
should get about 70% faster performance
than the last gen iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
and that is a gigantic jump in
performance so I mentioned these phones
sort of look the same and the cameras
looked the same on both so the iPhone II
it's got a single sensor to a medic
pixel where's the iPhone 8 plus has two
sensors both of which are 12 megapixel
of course k plus games before portrait
mode bethey plus is also gonna support
something new at least in beta
called portrait lighting where you can
sort of simulated different lighting
environments from your phone it cuz if
you it live you can also take a picture
and sort of add those effects afterwards
apples claiming it's way more than just
a filter they also claim it's the best
video that's going to be taken in the
smartphone slo-moes gotten way better at
1080p you can go 240 frame
per second which is double the frame
rate of the last gen no roll the cameras
just look better other things you'd
expect here support for LTE advanced
which is a huge deal as we start moving
towards that 5g progression LTE advanced
they're going to sort of be the backbone
of 5v what things are gonna fall back to
you wanta have a phone that supports
that so hats off to Apple for supporting
that other things you'd expect like
Bluetooth 5.0 are here as well so
pricing and storage sizes so sizes are a
bit different this generation it's
either 64 or 256 for both phones then
you're out you go for the 8 or the A+
the eights gonna start at $6.99 whereas
the A+ is going 300 bucks more at $7.99
and they're gonna build a pre-order in
just a few days on September 15th and
shipping on my son's birthday September
22nd and of course don't forget about
the Big Brother the iPhone 10 coming in
November pre-order starting in October
you're thinking that that might be the
phone you want to get we've whole
separate video on that I will link to it
here and down below if you want to check
it out
so iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus they look
like nominal improvements over what we
have with the lash in it sort of been
true with the S line of phones this
would have been an S phone had Apple not
side to jump and just go for a new
number but nice things are here he got
better speakers I got a presumably
better display I would have liked higher
resolution
I've got wireless charging and of course
the stuff that we liked last gen like
dust and water resistance but it's
enough for you to pick up an iPhone 8 or
Nate Plus these are not cheap phones and
stretch the imagination is it enough to
get you back to Apple there's enough for
you to upgrade your last gen phone or
you gonna skip this and wait for the
iPhone 10 ll tell your thoughts on it
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do I think I
got a wandering eye that iPhone 10 but
the iPhone 8 plus does have a bit of
appeal to me I like the fact that it's
got a physical touch ID button I'm not
yet sold on facia unlocking with face ID
and we're leaving a comment down below
give you a thumbs up we appreciate it
until next time John Ranger and
