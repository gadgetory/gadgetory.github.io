lake is calm here with another review
for you of the t-mobile g1 you may
remember or you may not that I reviewed
this device when it first came out a few
months ago but I only had the phone for
just a couple days so I couldn't really
put together a comprehensive review as i
would have liked so the folks at
t-mobile are nice enough to let me play
around on this one for a little longer
period of time so let me give you my
updated thoughts on it so first thing I
want to say is up and very happy with
the phone but seeing as it's a phone
first it's got to have good call quality
I can't say that I've been extremely
impressed with t-mobile's color quality
well certainly may vary by your location
where I am right now I get five bars of
3g and call quality has been fantastic I
don't hear any jumbly your noise or any
echo when you start hearing things twice
twice twice things have been very clear
people on the other end haven't heard
any white noise or nature garbled so it
has been very clear so definitely given
an a-plus for call quality some of the
things I like about the phone I really
like a navigation on it I think having
the scroll ball makes a navigation much
easier at times when using your finger
isn't the best way to go in previous
videos I've walked you through the
Android operating system I've shown you
the browser I'm not going to show you
guys too much of the divisor in this
review so mostly just going to be me
talking about it just give me a heads up
so navigation is actually very easy to
do the scroll ball is nice and easy and
using the screen has been absolute piece
of cake android has really been a
pleasure to use I've enjoyed it I've
also liked getting to know how to use
the operating system you can see the
power potential that it has but I don't
think it's where it needs to be to be as
competitive in the marketplace right now
so the best example I can give you
there's a lot of times when I just want
to look something up real quickly or go
to a website and I got to take out the
keyboard slide it up wait for it to
rotate and then type the g1 is severely
suffering from an on-screen lack of an
on-screen keyboard something that will
be fixed in probably imminently what I
believe what's called a cupcake update
it's actually that's going to give it
keyboard and looks like a really nice
keyboard so I would look for that soon
so my grapes about the phone are things
that I think can be fixed very easily
with software patches on screen keyboard
is certainly one of them one thing that
I know with me about the phone it's the
only way to switch profiles meeting
going from ringer to vibrate dad hit the
volume button and go all the way down
all the way down all the way down so
fortunately there is an application in
the android marketplace that actually
lets you control the ring volume in the
ring profiles it's called ring toggle
that really is a must have some of the
graft I had with the phone actually
we're rectified by programs that i was
able to find in the android marketplace
things like quote pro for tracking my
stocks wait life much easier for me and
twix droid which is a twitter program
used for the g one so the stock programs
the quote pro I don't think are as good
as the built-in programs on other mobile
devices for instance in touch flo 3d on
some HTC devices they've got a stock's
little window there and on the iPhone
the stock's program that comes on there
a little more full-featured but quote
pro for just getting your quotes you
know is relatively nice so on to the
hardware Island device this is the first
time that andrea has been released HTC
made this off or the hardware for the g1
and it is a little bit on the bulky side
it's a little bit thick and often times
it felt like a generation one device
starts to creak a little bit when you
open it up even just a few weeks I've
had it the spring mechanism that opens
and closed devices is this crisp as it
used to be and you can see that over
time the device is probably going to
wear but that sometimes to be expected
in some of the price you pay for being
an early adopter this is actually the
first phone that I've used that I've
tested in quite a while that I could say
I could use this in place of my iphone
which is my daily driver I could use
this phone the browser is full-featured
there's a very nice YouTube client on it
there's Maps there's GPS I have a nice
keyboard on here granted it's a tactile
keyboard this is really the first device
that i can say that on and say that
wholeheartedly and actually recommend to
people who are looking for a full
experience if you use gmail as your
primary email browser the g1 is going to
be fed
set for you gmail is integrated so
nicely with the device you sew up your
finger down get all your gmails slightly
back up and you're done if you use
another email server you're going to
have some difficulty be built in just
pop email client not so good again I
think that's something that will be
fixed and rectified with software
updates and applications in the Android
Marketplace just something to bear in my
eyes you're going through this also if
your company or work or whatever you're
with uses exchange server right now
there's no support for exchange server
which is a little bit annoying side it's
the only way to get your contacts inside
Rovers to actually upload your contacts
to google and then let google download
them for you well bit all the annoying
side but all those little bit picky
things decide the g1 is a fantastic
phone and again one that i can recommend
to you if you're looking for ultimate
web browsing experience a great keyboard
email mms all that stuff really the g1
brings it all to the table and it's
impressive how much they brought with a
first generation device so that's some
certainly some nitpicky things but
overall i've been very pleased with the
g1 and I think you guys will to the
question I get quite a lot is should i
get a g1 or an iPhone I cancer that
question for you depends on whether you
like AT&amp;amp;T service or t-mobile service
whether you prefer one device over
another that's a personal preference for
me I'm sticking with my iPhone I've been
very happy with did you want if this was
my phone it would be fantastic but I got
to send it back to tmobile I don't have
an account with them so guys jon
