technobuffalo here at a full review for
you of the samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket
it's the second galaxy s2 member of the
AT&amp;amp;T lineup packs a few things that its
regular galaxy s2 brother does not let's
go ahead dig in and see if this is the
right phone for you so before i get into
the full review let me remind you of the
specs of this guy cuz there is a lot of
stuff packed into a pretty thin little
package so its first LTE compatible it's
one of two LTE devices with the HTC
Vivid that works on AT&amp;amp;T is just
launched and now slowly becoming more
popular LTE network it also has support
for hspa+ if you don't live in an LTE
market like me it's got a 4.5 inch
diagonal amoled plus display the same
resolution of its smaller galaxy s2
brother on AT&amp;amp;T of 480 x 800 it's got a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor and
that's the qualcomm built snapdragon
variety on the back side got an 8
megapixel camera with a single LED flash
i can shoot 10 20 p video on the fraud
and ups the front camera game with a 2
megapixel sensor that lives on the front
it's going to be available or it is
available for about two hundred forty
nine dollars on a two-year contract
although coming to the holiday season
chances are this guy is going to get a
nice discount it's running android 2.3
point five so that's of course
gingerbread 16 gigs onboard memory and
you can expand that via micro USB with a
pretty large 1,850 milliamp hour battery
ha i take a deep breath so now you know
what's in this phone let's go and talk
about whether or not this is the right
phone for you let's talk about call
quality call quality on this guy was
pretty decent i didn't have any white
noise on my encode and have any white
noise on their end i didn't have any
popping although there was a slight hiss
in the call quality department i heard
it on about six to seven of my 20
and I did have to drop calls during that
test AT&amp;amp;T has been getting I'm doing
much better with dropped calls the past
few phones I've tested I haven't had any
so this one might have a bit of a worry
when it comes to the signal go and show
you a little sample what that sounds
like go ahead and jump on into the
dialer hit 611 you also do to hear what
the speaker sounds like so go ahead and
let that dial go ahead and kick the
speaker on it's got a cool feature to in
the phone rings if you flip it over
it'll automatically meet the phone for
you so you can hear a bit with a speaker
2 sounds like you can see what the call
on her face is there a HTC is that same
thing as well I can flip it over and
hops on into speaker if you're on a call
or will muta for you it's kind of neat
so call quality pretty decent not the
best though out of 18 t-phones that I've
tested recently let's talk a bit now
about the design this is a larger phoned
a 4.5 inch screen and it gives a pretty
big footprint so it's 4.5 inches tall
2.75 inches wide and about point 37
inches on the thickness department it's
going to take up a decent amount of room
in your pocket so if you do we're very
skinny jeans you might want to try this
in your pocket first not cuz you sit
down you might give it a little bit of
flex even though it's got Gorilla Glass
and it's a pretty durable phone it's
going to create a very very noticeable
um I guess jokes intended bold in your
pocket it also feels a little bit on the
cheap side samsung packed tremendous
processor and specs and their phones but
also use sometimes low quality plastic
this guy feels a little bit higher
quality than the galaxy s2 for AT&amp;amp;T at
least the one that came into the u.s.
shores it's a little bit thicker plastic
the battery sits flush with the battery
door so you don't hear throw that hollow
noise but this is plastic all around you
definitely feel like it's a plastic
phone it doesn't feel like the highest
quality of devices out this question you
compare it to the metal accents of the
HTC devices however one of the benefits
of that though is that it weighs much
less so you're going to be able to
carry this phone around with this larger
footprint with a little bit less weight
coming in at just four point six ounces
so that's a little bit nitpicking it's
definitely personal preference the
screen here is super amoled plus and
it's a tremendous display we've seen it
many times text for example you can see
right here it looks absolutely beautiful
it's crisp it's clear images also look
tremendous if you zoom in on an image or
thans that picture you took with the 8
megapixel camera things always look
great a resolution wise though we're
still stuck the same resolution at 480 x
800 or 800 x 480 which for someone like
me with not the best eyes is great I
like things look a little bit bigger but
if you're very into resolution in this
dawn of 720p displays you may want to
look elsewhere it was never an issue for
my eyes but I definitely see how others
might want a device with higher
resolution especially as applications
start taking advantage of more pixels so
go ahead and jump back and actually I
move to the side here so this is a white
background you can still see there's a
little bit of a blue tint that we've
seen on amoled amoled plus super amoled
plus and other variations of AMOLED
technology it's not as prevalent as
we've seen on previous iterations but
it's definitely there you get used to it
very very quickly yuly only notice if
you hold your phone up against another
device that perhaps doesn't have that
same backing so if I for example were to
bring in my iphone4 there on the side
there it's sort of see a little bit of a
blue tint on that screen not a giant
deal so the operating system this is
running as android gingerbread 2.3 point
5 with TouchWiz four-point-oh in touch
with Samsung's proprietary skin and that
brings a lot of sort of fun stuff here
it's on the stuff we seen on previous
version of touch was so if you pull down
the menu this one my favorite features
immediate toggle for Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
flight mode screen rotation and the rest
go ahead and pull that off and if we go
look to where you go ahead and add some
widgets so if you long press on the
screen you get now a nice four-way bar
here it can pick what you want to do and
you get a ton of Samsung specific
widgets
can see them here they go in scroll
through buddies bookmarks applications
monitor classic clocks there's a bit of
animation to a little bit of a 3d effect
as you scroll through overall the
TouchWiz four-point-oh didn't bring that
much it brought a lot of subtle OS
tweaks and new animations that really
take advantage of the raw horsepower of
this phone alright so speaking of raw
horsepower let's go and talk about speed
it's a fast phone but it's not blazing
fast I did get a quadrant score of 2560
one which isn't always the most
scientific way to test phone but is what
i use in all of my devices a lot has
been made that this uses qualcomm
chipset as opposed to the X enos
hopefully I'm trouncing that right
chipset that is in the regular samsung
galaxy s2 despite a faster clock speed
here of 1.5 gigahertz doesn't always
necessarily mean a faster experience
using the phone that's sort of how it
ties in with with graphics the GPU and
such but this phone for everyday use
some gaming is plenty fast and pretty
quick it's not going to set the world on
fire but opening applications I had no
issue I didn't have any slowdown I
didn't have to go into any task manager
and shut things down things just worked
very nicely and you can see it there
with that gig of ram on board really
really helps so things are very quick
scrolling through applications open up
without a problem all your games you can
be able to play without any issue so
we'll go ahead and jump back this is LTE
cable as I mentioned and certainly LTE
is expanding as we speak into more
markets I don't unfortunately have LTE
where I live but people are reporting
speeds in the 12 down 25 up range and
certainly that's on uncongested networks
since they aren't that many LTE devices
out there it's also hspa+ compatible I
generally got speeds around three down
at about point seven five up but again
that's going to depend on where in a
country you live so let's sort of wrap
this up actually you know what let's
talk about camera very quickly before I
do
we'll go ahead and jump into camera here
the camera shots actually we're pretty
pretty decent you get a lot of effects
here in the camera as well and things
that you can manipulate and change you
can change the white balance to change
it is oh there's some color effects here
and it was pretty good in low-light
actually go and snap an image go ahead
and take a good picture a lot of focus
if you tap the screen it's go and jump
at the settings and show you what I was
just talking about dicen the shortcut
shooting mode scene modes exposure value
timer effects resolution white balance
ISO image quality GPS and shutter sounds
a lot of stuff you can customize let's
go and put this back so as you're
looking to get a phone and you're not
sure what to get certainly some
confusion between the galaxy s2
skyrocket and the galaxy s2 so let me
help shed some light onto which one you
should get I for deciding between those
two and which one I would get so for my
personal use the fastest phone available
doesn't mean that much to me or at least
the fastest theoretical phone doesn't
mean that much to me if that means a lot
to you as far as processor you're going
to want to look at the original galaxy
s2 if speed matters to you most as far
as network connection you don't want to
look at the sky rocket because it does
have LTE capabilities and even if LTE is
not where you live right now chances are
it will be within the two years of your
contracting something to really keep in
mind that you looked for a phone that's
going to keep you up for the next two
years this phone is plenty fats by no
means a slow phone and if we were in a
world where the regular galaxy s2 didn't
exist probably say this is one of the
fastest android phones in 80 and T's
lineup despite the questionable build
and plastic material choices is a pretty
solid phone represents a great choice
for those in AT&amp;amp;T however this is a big
however it is running Gingerbread in an
Ice Cream Sandwich world we are on the
dawn of the galaxy nexus and other Ice
Cream Sandwich phones coming Samsung
hasn't said specifically whether or not
this device is going to get ice cream
sandwich they have said the galaxy has
two phones will so presumably it will
make its way here to the sky
rocket but you're going to have to wait
and if you don't mind having the not
most or the end of the second generation
operating system or one that's not the
most recent generation go for this if
you want to wait for ice cream sandwich
worked out its bugs but I'm Samsung gets
it to the sky rocket then you're going
to want to go for this if you want to
have the latest and the greatest you
want those features of ice cream
sandwich how we've covered you're going
to want to wait a little while ett has
announced that they're going to be
carrying the Galaxy Nexus however a
Penta band unlocked version using hspa+
well will be available or you might want
to look at the verizon galaxy nexus
that's going to be coming with LT
capabilities so there's a lot to weigh
in a lot of options as you figure out
which phone is right for you if you
decide to jump on board the skyrocket
you're going to get a great phone you're
going to get a phone that's going to
perform very well perform admirably over
the next two years but you've gotta
weigh the pros and the cons hopefully
