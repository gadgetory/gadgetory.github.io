to you by linda what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup is to show we round up all the
technical is from the week at least
that's what we usually do but I've got a
very special end of your episode for you
I'm gonna run down my top 10 tech
predictions for 2013 things that will
undoubtedly be rumors and upcoming shows
its go ahead and get started let's start
with the iphone 6 i'm predicting it's
going to launch in june with a 1080p
updated retina display complete redesign
still be made of aluminum and glass and
blows you that are holding out hopes for
a baller awesome curve display I don't
think we're gonna see it but I do think
we're gonna see though is wireless
charging I don't think it's going to be
a Qi standard and anything else that's
been standardized things can be apples
totally proprietary wireless charging I
don't think it's going to be that
wireless hub that we saw we're sort of
your computer at home can charge all
your gadgets wirelessly I did you have
to put it on a pad it'll charge but you
think we're finally gonna see it I also
think we're finally gonna get NFC which
I'll talk about a bit later for mobile
payments and other kinds of data
transmission we're finally gonna see 802
11 AC which I was flabbergasted that we
didn't have with the iphone 5s
flabbergasted and I also think the
iphone is going to regain the crown of
the thinnest smartphone on the market
thanks to brand the new Apple patented
battery technology what is that iphone 6
going to use in the software front it's
going to go with iOS 8 which is going to
launch with that iphone 6 gonna look
unfortunately the chagrin of some of you
the same as iOS 7 with new features i
think it's gonna have a brand new apple
NFC at maybe look call it apple transfer
or i transfer or I air wherever they
decide to call it I think you're going
to see a revised notifications tray with
widgets absolutely 0 to run we did I
think you be able to pull over the tab
to the left or the right you're gonna
get information at a quick glance I'm
saying it iOS 8 we're finally gonna get
widgets somehow of course iOS 8 gotta
compete with something I think we're
going to see Android 5.0 finally hit the
market they's gonna come earlier
back it in March so what's gonna look
like and you're gonna have a completely
redesigned vacation shade it's become
kind of a mess up there with apps just
throwing things in there my big one
we're finally going to have actual
backup and restore I'm hoping maybe it's
just me hoping but I'm saying Google
found the way to figure it out I also
think we're gonna see Android 5.0 in app
form now not get the whole android 5.0
and apps but i think that the key
programs will be available in app
scimitar downloading gmail or
downloading the google calendar for
example you can go to get the best of
the newest version of android in apps
you can drop the skinned apps if you
don't like them lastly i think it's
gonna allow for skin switching at least
i'm hopeful that whenever carriers are
manufacturer start working together our
new skins in order to make it work with
android they got to be able to
completely allow it to be d skin so
imagine was a flip of a switch turning
off TouchWiz or turning off sense and
enjoying that delicious stock Android I
would love that probably not gonna
happen but I'm hoping at it does come
true and you can see you heard it here
first Samsung is not gonna be left out
in 2014 it's going to be the year of the
galaxy s5 I think we're gonna see it in
March I think they're going to go away
from their plastic so they look like
leather and on the back and go the way
of metal Samsung has really done a nice
job of just cramming crazy technology to
their flagship phones now technology
doesn't always make it to us shores or
other carriers across the world like
octa-core for example but you think we
are going to see a version of the s5 if
that as I mentioned is metal it's going
to have a 2k screenings gonna be the
first mass Bruce one with a 2k screen
octa-core processor is going to be
standard it's going to have a creepy
advertising campaign which is probably
pretty clever and takes aim at Apple so
while it wasn't that much for change
from the galaxy s3 to the s4 there's
gonna be a huge jump from the s4 to the
s5 I also think 2014 is gonna be here
that Blackberry finally gets sold for
parts and patents they've sort of been
circling the bowl for a couple years now
rumor is they had a cancel two of their
flagship films in 2014 I don't they got
enough in the tank to last think they're
gonna cut their losses and I would wager
that we see those patents go for sale
sometime towards the end of 2014 also in
20-40 it's gonna be ready i watch is
going to launch think it's gonna come in
august with facetime a curved display
and that new apple wireless charging i
don't know what
it's gonna deems I can't think of what a
SmartWatch can do other than give
notifications but perhaps Apple has
something new in store also in floor
from Apple I think they're finally going
to talk about and acknowledge the Apple
television set but not launch one in
2014 I think we're also finally going to
see a 2k ipad pro perhaps is the 12 inch
ipad behind rumors about next I think
Windows Phone 9 is going to hit gonna
merge its Windows RT and be a really
viable third OS not just in phones but
now in tablets after the merger with rt
Windows Phones done an incredible job i
think the past year you gave the
applications that they needed and i
think this next iteration is going to
take it to the next level it's gonna
bring things like notifications and i
think it's gonna do a really really nice
job lastly i think the $1,500 Google
glass is going to launch in production
form for anybody about an invitation for
the price of four hundred and
ninety-nine dollars like we're gonna see
it sort of hit that mid five hundred
dollar price point and we'll see who
wants the bottom the wearable technology
it's certainly more affordable five
hundred bucks but way far away for an
