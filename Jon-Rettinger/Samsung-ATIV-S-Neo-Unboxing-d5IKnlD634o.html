technobuffalo here's an unboxing of this
guy the Samsung at Eve as neo I keep you
can I should be dodging bullets in slow
motion odd is the latest Windows 8 phone
from Sprint and Samsung go ahead open it
up see how it looks so here is the box
for the Samsung achieve as neo it tells
everything I gotta know but let's go
through and i will share all that
information with you here's a picture of
the phone it's telling you right on the
box you've got a hike with janny which
is quit the only a pretty awesome name
nothing else that exciting here on the
box and it's Prince Bach which is made
from wonder-percent recyclable material
which is always kind of nice let's go
ahead and open this sucker up and there
it is looking eerily familiar to a
samsung galaxy s2 dropped aside for just
a quick second see what else we're going
to have living inside of this recycle
box we've got paperwork for getting
started also sprint always includes a
recycle bag which is really nice eat up
to throw away all your old cell phones
and their old batteries Stan's
princewill recycling for you we also
have a charge and sync cable it's the
sort of generic microUSB variety and a
samsung wall warts but that is not why
you are here you were here to check out
some windows phone 8 Action let's power
this guy on and I'll run through
everything this phone has looks very
nice it is a four point eight inch
screen which is pretty nice size as far
as Windows Phone usually go with a 1280
by 720 pixel resolution that's a 306 PPI
a windows phone 8 at launch being
powered by a 1.4 biggert qualcomm dual
core processor it's got a single
gigabyte of ram and 16 gigs of storage
but you can expand that with a microSD
card which I'm going to assume live
somewhere under the back here we'll take
a look at that in just a second we also
have an 8 megapixel camera which is
pretty decent we got a 1.9 megapixel
shooter right there on the front in a
211 ABG and n Bluetooth 4.8 million
power battery and that is the gist of
the phone coming around we've got that
physical windows home but we've got
capacitive search and back buttons we've
got volume rocker
bend down got your power and lock button
in your blog ettore camera button which
I really like having a dedicated camera
button they print by millimeter headset
jack noise cancelling microphone there's
your chart in Cinque Ports going to can
get this back off see if that is where
your fennel storage is going to be and
this is an LTE capable device on
sprint's gearing up and becoming more
ubiquitous LTE network all right you got
the phone all booted up here and ready
to go to familiar modern UI look so
you've got live tiles obviously you can
resize them to any size you want no
matter what that is I won't say I forgot
how easy to use Windows Phone 8 was I
let my father use a windows phone 8
device he had never used really any
smartphone before he took to it really
quickly it was very intuitive from the
learners kind of fun to watch so it is
very very very easy to navigate Oh slide
it over take a look at all the apps some
samsung specific things but for the most
part I stock Windows Phone and some
sprint things in here as well this does
have NFC support so you can do NFC like
beam things for instance if we go into
photos here and if we scroll on over you
will see there's a TV and you could send
things just as you would with NFC and
you tap the back and click the picture
to send so nice they've got that here on
board this is a 720p screen that does
look really really nice the Windows
Phone tiles I think look beautiful on
samsung screens I did a really nice job
here I'm excited take a look at it see
how performs I'm even more excited to
take a look at sprint's LTE network i'll
drive up to Los Angeles and take a look
at it we are stuck with the old faithful
3g here in Southern California least in
Orange County for the time being that
photo right there by the way every
Windows Phone I've had for the life of
me I thought I took a picture of where I
was parked in a parking lot so I
realized I was just a default picture
that got shipped on a windows phone I
kept seeing it on it other people's
films like why do you have my picture of
where i parked my car I have a really
bad sense of direction but that's just
me did anything you guys want to see be
sure to let us know I will leave in the
comments down below this has been a
