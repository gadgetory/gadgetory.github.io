wait wait we'll get here but the story
started long before this in life and
generally don't get the opportunity to
be surrounded by what you love when you
do those stories generally don't start
by traveling 17 hours to the other side
of the globe but if there was a reason
to travel this far this we're invited
out to Finland for the ultimate Tesla
experience it was 72 hours of
Awesomeness
driving out to visit reindeers driving
on snow sliding around ice and it ended
perfectly with a brand new car
Matt and I hopped in a Model S and we
drove to a legit reindeer farm I had I
think maybe I'd seen reindeer before at
the long time ago or like a Santa's
Village kind of thing but actually like
see reindeer in Finland was really cool
it also let us kind of see the Finnish
countryside it's my first time ever in
Scandinavia and it could not have been
at a more picturesque time you know
there was snow everywhere the skies were
blue it was just gorgeous to drive and
see snow everywhere to see houses and
huts that look different that we see in
the United States it's always
interesting to experience a new culture
but it was really an experience that I
won't forget being able to see things
I've never seen to talk to people I
never spoken to before and it was really
neat to get to see them I have
experience driving on snow and ice
before I spent four years in upstate New
York and those winners were brutal that
was a really long time ago these ice
tracks and chemi Finland were unlike
anything else I've ever seen in fact
it's the only track area in the world
you can actually drive on frozen
seawater like if you look at the GPS the
little red triangle literally in the
middle of the ocean and it was
incredible
so as comfortable as like I felt driving
the model three at the end of the day
they let the instructors go behind the
wheel and we got to kind of be along for
the ride
and they put on track mode and I have
never experienced drifting before
initially I especially never experienced
drifting on ice the instructor is
actually taking turns it seemed like we
were going backwards around sort of
drift around these really sharp turns it
was awesome
it was really cool to experience
actually be in the passenger seat with a
professional driver I have never
experienced anything like that it felt
like a roller coaster feel like an
amusement park ride it was incredible my
legs were and I want to see a little
wobbly at the end you know but going
around and getting experience to do that
and then to actually watch other
instructors do it kind of from not in
the car was made an already awesome
experience just like an extra level of
like awesome after the incredible
Finland experience Matt and I flew home
it was 17 hours to get back
barely had enough time to hug my kids
hug my wife take a quick shower and hop
in an uber to go up to Hawthorne to see
Tesla's grand reveal of the model why is
a perfect end cap on an already awesome
experience this was my first my first
time ever at Tesla event I've watched
every life even they've ever done so it
was kind of cool to be there I was I was
honestly fanboying out a little bit when
like Elon Musk
came out on stage you get the whole
history of Tesla it was just a neat
thing to be and certainly like a bucket
list item for like this teching car guy
and and Tesla fan that I can serve
happily check off I was really excited
to see the model why I drove in Model S
I drove a Model X now and I've been kind
of looking at the Model 3 but I got two
kids and a third one on the way is so a
kind of a crossover version of the three
really kind of got me excited and then
we saw the model Y and it was exactly
kind of expecting it was a taller
hatchback version
of the model three we had a chance to
actually drive in the model y as well
it's a crazy experience in a car that
just has glass going all the way back
there's an a sort of like cross feeding
that's breaking that up it is one
gigantic piece it looks really cool to
see and experience the car drove like a
model three which is kind of to be
expected we did get a chance to see the
optional third row which looks small and
cramped and probably only good for you
know tinier humans and for short
distances
I liked it it's a hatchback I drove a
Model S really liked that hatchback
option it's kind of pointed to three
which is standard trunks so really if
looking for a model three that's
slightly more space the model wise
probably gonna be your jam this whole 72
hours in Finland and ending with the
reveal of the model y like a dream I
couldn't reply to the email asking us if
we wanted to attend fast enough I'm a
Tesla fan I'm a fan of electric mobility
a fan of technology in the cars and get
a chance to experience them in such a
rare way in such a cool place but
something that I am never gonna forget
in my entire life and made me feel kind
of honored and privileged and lucky and
humbled all at once to have the
opportunity to do this for a living to
get to go to a place I've always wanted
to go to drive a car that I feel
generally passionate about and to end
with an event that I've always wanted to
go to it kind of just just caps you know
four ish days of an incredible
experience and one that's gonna be with
me I think for a really long time
