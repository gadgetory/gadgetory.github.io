technobuffalo here just a few minutes
ago Apple sent out press invites for
their long-awaited January 27th event
with the tagline come see our latest
creation take a look at the invite so
lots of colors lots of paint splattered
around sort of the speculation can
really go anywhere as far as to what we
think could happen however a few things
are relatively guaranteed so let's go
through some of the rumors and some of
the things that I expect and some of the
things that may happen or may not happen
so I think the biggest focus is going to
be on this long rumored long awaited
almost mythical apple tablet we've been
hearing about it for the better part of
three years even dating back before the
iphone that hasn't really been much of a
secret made that the iphone technology
came from a tablet that Apple was
developing I think we may see sort of
that same form factor in this tablet
what people leave is going to be about
10 inches when we were at CES there was
definitely shortage of 10 inch
capacitive touchscreens and prevailing
opinion seems to be that was because
apple bought them all so let's talk
about this tablet and some of the specs
that I think that we're going to see on
it so again is going to be a 10 inch
touchscreen think it's going to be a
beefed-up version of the iphone OS but
it's going to have a very different look
and feel to it I think it's going to
focus a lot on certainly the internet
ebook reader to think are going to be
very strongly featured with the tablet a
10 inch screen is fantastic for reading
it's really they've been ebook
application for the iPhone but it's very
hard to read on a screen that small I
think we're going to see definitely
readers by a big big part in the
announcement on the twenty-seventh also
that I probably lead to an ebook store
in iTunes which should be interesting I
think we're all so we're going to see
sort of the revamp of magazines as we
know it the tablets going to be very
magazine focused subscriptions have been
dropping physical media and is dying and
certainly print as well and i think that
the digital is certainly taking over i
think the tablet is going to slot right
in nicely i think that we're going to
see magnet subscriptions being able to
be managed and purchase and single issue
purchases right through itunes or
wirelessly from
the new tablet you know if you imagine
flipping through the pages and sort of
interactive immersive environment you
see pictures you can flip through the
pictures p a video you can just hit play
I think it's going to be quite exciting
i'm really looking forward to the tablet
i'm going to see sort of the same launch
things that we saw with the iphone
probably do one or two things really
really well and probably lacking some
the features that maybe we all expect
there have been rumors about having a
front facing camera remembers about
having it not having a front facing
camera i personally think that we are
going to see a front facing camera i
think it's going to be heavily featured
for 4i chats heard of technology that
we're going to see sort of our way over
to the iphone fourth generation which i
talked about Justin minix think we're
going to hear a little bit about the new
iphone on the twenty-seventh as well so
I think though we are going to see a
front-facing camera I think we're going
to see sort of low-resolution maybe 1.3
megapixel enough to do some typical
skype calls I think it's gonna be about
the same thickness of the iphone rumor
has a 20 running a chip that Apple
developed in-house you know certainly
I'd say as powerful as a ultra low
voltage core2duo more powerful than your
typical atom processor you know probably
a gig of ram and certainly a solid state
drive probably 64 gig some speed of
prevailing opinion it does appear to be
plenty of space so people have been
talking about that this is going to run
a modified iphone operating system how
can I able to work on it as a regular
computer well there's also been
significant sort of whispers about a
touch implementation of apples iWork
sweet fouzia don't know what I work in
sort of apple's version of microsoft
office so it's got a text application
presentation application spreadsheets
and all the rest and certainly when
you're looking at a tablet text entry
and it's going to be a really big
important deal sort of how Apple's going
to handle text entry you know is quite
important it's really a difference you
can use a good tablet as a niche device
using a tablet as a regular daily driver
certainly you want to type out emails on
your computer you want to be able to be
able to get email addresses and things
like that and a 10 inch screen is a
little bit too big to do some thumb
typing on so how is that we're going to
handle text input this is something
that's really not known speculation has
been rampant from anything from keyboard
bumps that actually pop out at a screen
to text entry / voice you're going to
split keyboard
on each side you know that i really
don't know or have any sort of
inclination or feeling which way it's
going to go i think we're gonna see
something new I don't think it's going
to be a typical on-screen keyboard like
we see on the iPhone or other tablet
devices so a lot of talk about stylist
as well so we're going to see a
capacitive touchscreen which is not
traditionally stylist friendly Silas
Risa generally associated with a
resistive touchscreen we may see some
terms of capacitive stylus for um you
know precision painting and drawing
there have been modified versions of the
macbook called the modbook which turned
it into a tablet not relied on stylus
with some inkwell technology so you may
actually see up and bring back the style
of sort of bring in venta stylist as far
as the passage goes some more spec about
the device and what we think that it may
or may not do 3G connectivity is it
going to have AT&amp;amp;T 3g is going to have
verizon 3g is going to offer both i tend
to think it's going to offer both i
think you're going to give the choice to
the consumer I don't think either
carrier is going to offer a subsidized
version I think you can be able to buy
it just with the option what do you want
to activate the 3g is going to be up to
you all i do you think we are going to
see AT&amp;amp;T of course think it's going to
be apple's first foray into verizon so
if those you that are holding out for a
verizon dup iphone this may be your
first taste of how Apple products work
on your EVDO network so i think the
tablet is definitely going to be the
highlight of the show I think we're also
going to see a lot of iphone news
particularly iphone OS four point oh and
possibly even some iphone 4g so OS four
point oh is rumored to have been on hold
because the code is littered with tablet
references certainly would make sense
Apple would hold on to it we've been
seeing an iphone OS update for quite
some time certainly long longest period
that we've had since the phone was first
released so what might we see an iOS
four point oh I think we're going to see
a completely redesigned and much
appreciated user interface I think the
iphone OS is stale and it's become very
boring if it wasn't such a darn good
internet browsing device you know i
would probably have ditched it quite a
while ago i think we're finally going to
see we design user interface think we're
going to see true multitasking and we're
going to see file management and i think
we're going to see sir
pay a new take on the icon array that
Apple currently has now perhaps tax or
folders sort of a more intuitive design
going to see some upgrades to the home
screen certainly more than we write have
now on the typical lock screen on the
iPhone that's been unjailbreak in you've
got your times notifications and your
unlock bark and that is about it that's
a lot of ways to real estate space so I
think we're going to see a ton of
updates to the IFO know what I think
Ravenna developers can get the first
take and taste rather of OS 4.0 I don't
think we're going to hear much rumors
about iphone 4g or the 4th generation
iphone but Apple may touch on they may
even show it for all we know you know
Apple is not shy to show products now
and launch them a few months later like
I think they're going to do the tablet I
think they're going to show its to us on
27th and probably not released until
March you certainly have to go through a
ton of FCC rules and clarifications it's
got a pass tests and Apple were to go
through that due diligence now we're
certainly would have leaked dad about
the tablet the bias I think they're
smart to show it then let it run through
its paces governmentally and then sort
of come out to market Apple events sort
of coincide with some small releases as
well I think we may actually see some
macbook pro updates think we're probably
going to see the core i5 chip drop into
the macbook pro certainly that's a
natural evolution of the computer optic
going to see much else the macbook pro
the macbook itself plastic windows got
an upgrade so i wouldn't expect that but
the macbook pro on the high end think
you'll finally be able to get your core
i7 in there i'm also thinking that we're
probably going to see an updated MacBook
Air it's design is getting a little bit
dated no longer the thinnest computer
around the damo XPS has taken that crown
from it and now just a little bit of a
bit underpowered niche machine doesn't
necessarily fit with the design some of
the other aluminum enclosed macbook pros
as well so i think we're gonna see sort
of the black bezel the multi-touch
trackpad it out the button probably an
upgrade to four gigs ram and a new core
2 duo chip which would be quite welcome
the macbook air is a pretty powerful
computer hasn't gotten much press and
for all we know this tablet may very
well be called the macbook air maybe
we'll see a new design for the macbook
air maybe a convertible tablet that has
a keyboard attached to it we
really just don't know it's all
speculation but it's fun to speculate on
what Apple might do turn me outside are
probably a few key executives I don't
think anybody really knows but you
certainly can just guess so what do you
think app was going to down s'what do
you want Apple to announce do you have
any inkling any insider information
never you like to hear from you so leave
a text or video response and I am
certainly excited about the 27th I will
be tweeting live updates of the press
event so if you're in school or at work
