to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the märklin Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's very
special episode of rumor roundup we'll
be talking about LG and samsung also
make sure you guys stick around towards
the end of this video because I've got a
few other things to say this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
LG is reportedly looking to enter the
mobile payment market with a service dub
G pay the payment service would
presumably work across the company's
portfolio of Android power smartphones
and Android wear smartwatches competing
with existing services such as Samsung
pay and Android pay according to et News
LG recently applied for a jeep a
trademark in Japan Korea and the United
States the company apparently gained
interest in space after Samsung launched
amzing pay though LG service won't be
able to offer the same kind of mobile
transactions samsung pay takes advantage
of NFC in addition to magnetic stripe
terminals the latter of which is a
unique service originally developed by
lupe which Samsung acquired last year ET
News said LG has been in touch with
South Korean financial businesses since
the beginning of this year and has been
piloting mobile payments with a company
named cash B in South Korea
most people believe the LG Electronics
mobile payment solution which focuses
more on second-tier strategy than early
pre occupancy of markets will have wider
payment range and be more versatile than
Samsung pay ET News said industries are
putting more importance on use sim based
payment systems including NFC
technologies rather than Samsung pays
magnetic stripe method now unfortunately
there's no specific date when LG plans
to launch its service but be sure to
check out TechnoBuffalo com for any news
regarding LG pay Samsung's answers at
iPhone 6s is still a few months away but
the company could already have an
equivalent to Apple's 3d touch which a
report out of China claims the upcoming
Galaxy s7 will offer its own version of
the technology the galaxy s7 will
allegedly use a nuclear force touch
screen from synaptics a california
company focus on displays and biometric
technology the screen could offer a
similar experience to 3d touch but with
even more capabilities that includes the
option to speed up scrolling with a hard
press control of zooming and panning the
ability to turn on the screen or unlock
the device and more Chinese firm Huawei
also in veiled its own for such smart
phone earlier this year with a mate S
though
ice won't be more broadly available
until early next year that's slightly
because synaptics is still perfecting
the technology which it says won't
officially launch until q1 of 2016 with
the galaxy s7 set to arrive early next
year as well it's possible the device
youcome packing a pressure-sensitive
screen but of course this is just a
rumor there's no guarantee Samsung will
offer its own 3d touch alternative with
the galaxy s7 though we assume the South
Korean company is at least considering
the option let me stop this video real
fast and thank our friends over at

TechnoBuffalo at domain.com check out LG
and Samsung already offer devices wood
curved displays but the two South Korean
companies could be racing towards
something even more exciting business
Korea reports that both firms aim to
launch foldable smartphones as soon as
next year Samsung's project Vali Hansen
has been floating around the rumor mill
for quite a while now the device is
expected to offer high-end specs and a
large display that folds up for easy
transportation meanwhile LG apparently
has its own foldable smartphone in the
wings
the biggest hurdle would foldable
displays maybe the issue of
deterioration if the device features one
continuous screen with a hinge in the
middle it's possible that closing and
opening it could do some serious damage
over time however it looks like both LG
and Sampson may already have a solution
the first folding phones from LG and
Samsung may also serve more as proofs of
concept than an actual consumer device
if either company can really pull this
off it stands to make a lot of money
selling this technology to other phone
makers including Apple according to
business Korea Cupertino plans to
release the first foldable iPhone in
2018 though by then the technology could
already be old news last but certainly
not least I am here to tell you the
