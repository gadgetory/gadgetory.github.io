to you by citrix go to assist the number
one global market leader and remote
support hello internet welcome back
there pisode of ask the buffalo i am
your host jon rettinger it's pretty
about a week since we actually did NASA
Buffalo feels good the back of this
table answer your questions this week or
talk about the note 4 verse iphone 6
what features lollipop might be missing
we talked about some kindle news and
what the heck's going to be in the
galaxy s6 disaster Buffalo it's gonna
turn a first question comes from at
caroms summer who asks at Joan for
lakers that's me if you were to spend
money would be the best investment the
note 4 or the iphone 6 plus first
neither a good investment depreciating
essence just never a good choice but i'm
not touching that one with the ten-foot
pole that's a trap it's a trap as
admiral ackbar would say we're going to
do a head to head of both of those and
we'll pick a winner but what I would say
to you is if you want the customizable
options of Android go for the android
route if you serve are in the apple
ecosystem go the iphone route that's all
I'm saying with that or if you need the
s-pen check out the note for but that
comes down to your decision again will
from a video or I will tell you which
one I would pick if I was spending the
money next one comes from I am our cab
who asked at John for lakers friend
droid 5 point 0 de used what things you
think it's still missing in it at
TechnoBuffalo so we love us some
lollipop but it doesn't have everything
doesn't have another handle on the side
so you can just bite it in the middle
it's missing a few things that I think
it really needs first a full backup and
restore solution and no resource apps
and kind of restore settings it got a
little bit better with lollipop but a
full and complete backup or restore so I
can go from any Android device any
Android device running a version of all
the pop and restore and have everything
be there that is huge for me I'd also
love to have built in visual voicemail
so having to run through an app or run
through some sort of third-party those
are two things that I think android
really really needs and I know for
everybody else knew that
are those kind of things if you rooted
you custom rom I'm talking about
lollipop as it ships on the next devices
and as Google releases it just so yeah
I'm aware that you can do that don't
don't think I'm not aware and start
calling me dirty names I know that's the
thing those are the main features other
than that lollipops pretty free and
sweet and if you haven't read it you
definitely should next question coming
from at Liam b.tech at John for lakers
how is it kindle looking for a non-tech
savvy parent I've said it before I will
say again the kindle is the best present
for a non-tech savvy pret a parent if
you want to get them a tablet I got my
dad a kindle fire and he used to call me
with questions all the time but how to
use the stuff now I'm just like dad I
don't know just go ahead and use Mayday
that makes it the best device for
non-tech savvy parents they're not going
to call you you just have math go to
mayday and they'll help him and walk
them through it it's kind of fun to see
my dad call Mayday despite some times I
tell him he's still sure they can see
him and know I'm with dad they can't but
make sure looks nice and gets all
dressed up just in case so yes hundred
percent kindle makes a great gift for
non tech savvy parents or anybody we

question comes from at shawnee boney who
asked at john for lakers what do you
speculate the galaxy s6 will be like
worth the wait or should I jump at a new
phone and now as my contract is up so
we're probably not that far away from
the galaxy s a kind of crazy looking at
blue februari to April time from so a
few things if you're set on getting a
galaxy s
bone definitely at this point you can
just wait few months away if you're not
set there are a ton of crazy good
options that I've either just come out
or might be coming out in the next month
or so you've got the nexus 6 is a
ridiculously awesome phone that's
available throughout verizon you've got
the droid turbo which we absolutely love
you got the Moto X there's a ton really
good solid choice up and of course the
iphone lines as well so if you don't
think you want to wait that long you
don't want a galaxy s phone of course
the note 4 as well then i would go ahead
and buy a phone right now we're hearing
for the galaxy x 6 is that Samsung's you
bringing some crazy heat galaxy s5 might
not have been the sales success they're
hoping for we're hearing rumors as
far-fetched as it having sort of two
galaxies and note edge sort of curved
displays 4k display all kinds of crazy
stuff odd way dripping somewhere in the
middle I think we will have a
high-definition display I think it's
going to be just you it just boy that
we've seen right now I think it'll be
some sort of Note edge feature built
into that maybe on the back or maybe one
of the sides end up curving those it
sort of be my guesses but hopefully it
helped answer your question so I want to
