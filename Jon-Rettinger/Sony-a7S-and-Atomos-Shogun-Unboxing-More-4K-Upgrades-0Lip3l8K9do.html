TechnoBuffalo here with the second in
our upgraded gear videos this is the
sony a7s it's gonna be our B cam 2 the
main ff7 that we unboxed previously if
you want to see that video link will be
down below this is an incredible camera
it's a full-frame sensor in a compact
body that can also record at 4 kale
doesn't need a little help to record 4k
which I'll show you in just a minute
we're also going to unbox the atom of
Shogun's this is a two-for-one type
video the box is pretty simple the sony
alpha logo not much on it just kind of
standard stuff what do you know that
does do 4k and all different codecs and
such that it supports let's go ahead and
dig grey an in addition to being a
pretty awesome video camera it's also a
great still camera really good
supposedly in low-light so we're gonna
use this for all of our product shots to
we're upgrading our camera equipment
from a combination of a 60d and Canon
c100 so we're going from Canon to Sony
so we've got limited warranty
information booklets lenses and
accessories they certainly are a ton of
lenses we did pick up a few of our own
lens to go with this at 16 to 35 55 and
a 24 to 70 the stony Zeiss lenses go
ahead and pull that on back kind of
nondescript in here but this is where
all the goodness is going to live we've
got the alpha 7 not a 7 s strap stick
Sony had some extra pieces laying around
from their last gen camera pull this out
and I love that Sony did this you
actually gets two batteries really nice
either it's kind of indication that it's
really bad on battery life or Sony just
being overly generous probably the
latter we also are going to have you see
you want to charge it just a simple wall
work with just the u.s. prongs and USB
right there
next we've got what I assume is the
camera body it was really light and very
tiny this little guy is a full-frame
sensor and can do 4k although not
internally does 1080p internally so very
simple looking really nice looking grip
on it
you've got manual controls hotshoe I've
got your articulating viewfinder there
as well
goes back in along the back that is
where your battery is going to live this
guy will take SD cards just for normal
SD card ink and push a bat all off the
side and again this is where the
full-frame sensor is going to live cover
that back up before I sneeze in it looks
like there are a few more goodies hidden
inside of here I'm assuming some sort of
wall charger and there is the battery
charger there is a micro USB cord
presumably for software upgrades are
also perhaps transferring information
off so in order to record 4k on the a7s
needs to recorded externally and what
we've got what I think is really one of
the best external recorders out there
this is the Shogun by Atomos so in
addition to just being a external
recorder it's also an incredible monitor
with full leveling it's got a 7 inch IPS
display it's got XLR audio timecode and
all that kind of other stuff which I'll
show you when I open it up but it looks
like it ships in a custom Pelican case
but let's safe
also go ahead and try and get this cover
off I don't think there's any way to
gracefully do this in there
finally unsheathed we've got the case
and just has the Shogun logo on it
go ahead and turn it around open this
sucker up I feel like I need nuclear
codes
and here is everything letting you know
that new playback features are coming
and when those are available how to get
the new software upgrade on it we've got
a strap really cushiony shoulder strap
there and here is the Shogun itself
letting on an update now register for
warranty and that kind of stuff again 7
inch IPS display and all kinds of other
inputs on the back you've got SDI and
that kind of stuff there and where the
batteries gonna go and then you've got a
sled button if you have a couple other
sledding options here as well you've got
mounts on the top and mounts on the
bottom it looks like we've got one
battery here and this looks like a
battery this just we need to put it in
when you want to power it externally
then you've got a couple extra slots in
case you want to put other batteries
there it's all custom cut out just a few
I say a few for extra sleds in case you
need and telling me that there are more
accessories underneath so let's go ahead
and see what else there's going to be
underneath here now I get why they
shipped it in essentially a Pelican case
Quick Start Guide obviously getting
started quickly you can record to an
internal hard drive either a standard
hard drive or an SSD we picked up a 240
gig
SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD and then you
picked up a couple docs for that as well
so here is the wall power plugs in one
of these adapters depending on what
country you're in you can use or if
you're traveling it's gonna be really
handy to have that as well we've got the
battery charger here and also we've got
the power adapter for the battery
charger different countries charging
outlets I haven't seen one of these in a
while but in case you want to charge on
the run in the car you can go ahead and
do that and this is my favorite features
you're gonna get full XLR audio to
really like we use XLR mics in the
office being able to none of any
compromise in case you want to use the
a7 s as a primary camera or out at the
show is really nice to have and then
you've got your powered sled in case you
want to power it that way
so a lot of accessories come included in
this I'm really excited to pair this of
course with the a7 s
and start using this if you guys want to
see what some ungraded footage looks
like coming from the a7 s we'll put that
at the end of the video I think guys for
watching thumbs up for new equipment
until next time I am John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo hey guys next video we
stopped the video just real fast to
thank our friends and good peeps at
Lenovo for like me and you got a hard
time bending down to touch your toes
yoga might not be for you but now it can
be with the Lenovo yoga 3 Pro this is a
crazy cool laptop the features time
different modes like laptop mode stand
mode in tent mode and tablet mode it's
got a gorgeous 3200 by 1800 pixel
13-foot their inch multi-touch display
Windows 8.1 pro super thin design Intel
Core M 70 processor JBL speakers and way
