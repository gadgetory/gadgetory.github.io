recognizable or sparked more nostalgia
than the keyboard on a blackberry and
that is still a thing that is out and
exists so like you to meet the latest
from blackberry this is the key one
they've ditched making their own harvest
manufactured by TCL this is kind of a
tricky phone to go in and talk about
anybody who does a review and bash the
phone for having physical keyboard I
think is missing the point you buy this
phone for the physical keyboard you know
it's there when you buy it's not a
surprise if you don't want a physical
keyboard this looks very clearly not the
phone for you so if you're still one of
those people that's longing for physical
tactile feel of buttons the BlackBerry
key one is a surprisingly good phone and
a really nice package so let's just
start with the keyboard since that's
really the big story here it looks and
feels like a blackberry keyboard it's
got pretty nice key throw it's extremely
narrow though it's going to take you at
least three days to get you typing on it
you're going to have some fat finger
syndrome fortunately though blackberry
software is really good in recognizing
when you're fat thumb hit the wrong key
I also really liked you can set any key
of the shortcuts they also worry about
launching the after we're going to
Instagram if you just set the letter I
as your Instagram shortcut also degraded
to the keyboard this is one of my
favorite things about devices like the
Priven other sort of modern Android
blackberries you can use the keyboard to
kind of scroll through a webpage that
use your finger on the screen you just
go to scroll down the keyboard naturally
it feels really good I also like to
integrate the fingerprint reader
directly into the spacebar we see no had
a weird fingerprint placement recently
with modern devices that makes sense to
me on the bottom of the phone my thumbs
almost there I push it and it works and
it works almost 100% of the time TCL did
a really nice job on the build of this
phone is it's a sick phone but it's kind
of a weird thing to say but refreshingly
thick let's say that GCL was brave nay
it took courage to make a fixed phone I
don't might have a little sticker device
to have better battery life it typed a
pretty big battery into a small phone
it's a little bit over thirty five
hundred million dollars you didn't get
about twenty six hours of mixed use so
easily a full day of however you decide
to use your phone so I usually skip over
speakers in review but I get hammered in
the comments about it so speakers are
awesome they're downward firing and they
are stereo speakers and also speaking
with speakers you are going to find it
frequent five millimeter headset jack on
the top and also USB si
for charging on the bottom pretty much
for at the time now when any processor
and a phone is going to be quick enough
I noticed no slowdown issues at all I
tried some serious multitasking video
watching HD video watching there's there
was no slowdown here google has launched
a huge ad campaign about the camera and
their pixel line of phone and it's the
sony AMX three seven eight sensor so let
me just have you guessed for a second
what sensor is in the key one it's exact
same sensor that's in the pixel on
phones you're getting really quality
images pictures still come out looking
awesome low lights really good outdoor
visibility pictures look really crisp
perhaps a little bit oversaturated side
but I kind of tend to like that there
towards more of what Samsung does at the
processing then maybe what Google does
it they're processing on the pixels I'm
still reviewing the device to see how
performs with my daily tasks usually
like to test devices for a week before
do the review first impressions have
been surprisingly good alright so you
met the BlackBerry key one what do you
want it to focus on in the review and if
you're going to start yelling at
blackberry in the comments about why
would you buy a phone with the keyboard
no one's forcing to buy the song if you
want to phone with the keyboard it's
nice to have options I think that's what
Android is about giving you options to
find the phone that's right for you if a
lot of people the key one might be the
right phones for them it's got a good
feel it's got a great camera decently
priced and if you want to pick one up
you can do so on May 31st let's let's
end this with the comment of the day it
comes from a galaxy s 8 review from
fascinator who says holy they got out
the smoke machine for this and I
realized they had a smoke machine for
Galaxy s8 review might seem like a
backhanded compliment but honestly we
just ordered one to try and use four
cool b-roll and the first video we were
doing since we had it so we tried it I
think the shots came out really cool but
certainly you guys thought we were up to
should Nana Yuri in it if you want to
follow basket a to the link to his
channel down below so on be featured
upcoming comments of the day pretty
obvious just leave a comment down below
so next time I'm Jon rendered
