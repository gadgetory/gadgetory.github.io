to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo I'm
your host John render this to show we
could ask me any question you've got
from the wide world technology don't
know what phone to get don't know what
tablet to pick up can't make sense of
all these operating systems coming at
you left and right this is the place you
can ask up this week on ask the Buffalo
it's all about mobile phones tablets and
applications if you want to submit a
question to ask the Buffalo we made it
super easy every Tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo comm and put up an article
asking you to submit your questions
leave them right down below otherwise if
you want to use social media you can do
so on Twitter then the message to at
TechnoBuffalo use hashtag ask the bee
and leave your question usually we'll
pick between three and five each week
this is ask the Buffalo I'm John Rhett
injure go and get started
user Joe topkis asks hey John what do
you think I should get the next two
sever the iPad Mini please give me your
opinion I'm gonna give you an answer
instead of just saying depends on what
you like best return the politically
correct answer I am going to answer the
question for you but in a few different
ways if you are a cost sensitive and you
don't want to spend a lot of money go to
the Nexus 7 get a much cheaper model get
extremely capable well-designed powerful
tablet no question if maybe you got
extra hundred bucks to spend and you
want to maybe say okay 300 to 350 and
you want the best tablet I still
recommend the iPad Mini when it comes to
mobile phones I think there's a lot of
great choices in fact I'm using Windows
on my daily driver Android before that
haven't used an iPhone regularly for
quite a while but it comes to tablets I
really think that the Apple ecosystem
the Apple design works best on a tablet
I was extremely dubious about the iPad
Mini a low resolution screen outdated
processor something about it just works
the screen is not incredibly awesome I'm
gonna throw that completely out there
and it's an irrational love for the iPad
Mini I get that everybody down below
saying outdated screen slow processor
totally absolutely know it I loved a
Nexus 7 but if I had to pick a tablet
for myself right now I would pick the
iPad Mini
aunt vivek asks do you ever plan to
making android or iOS apps for
TechnoBuffalo we're really cool we could
get an app that has everything to do
with technology so I'm gonna give you
guys the honest answer you know I don't
usually be asked you yes with absolutely
be considering apps for a really really
really long time something that we
absolutely want to do but we haven't
really gotten a development underway yet
and here's why we plan on launching an
updated version of TechnoBuffalo we're
calling it TechnoBuffalo 3.0 sometime
between now and the end of the year ish
and that's been really resource
intensive I didn't want to run to
development projects going side-by-side
this one's been going for the better
part of six to eight months once
TechnoBuffalo 3.0 gets launched we know
it's stable and I can exhale a little
bit then also allocating resources
towards mobile app development I'm
hoping sometime in 2013 so we'll deliver
those and certainly android iOS are the
first two on the docket so if we that
was a long answer than to your question
thank you for asking Travis Williams
asks hey John with the rapid pace of all
these spiffy new phones keep coming out
is it worth it to upgrade to something
like the galaxy s3 the note 2 or should
I just wait that's a really tough
question cuz yeah you can always wait
and something new is always going to be
coming but there are certain periods of
the year where it's a good time to buy a
phone get an upgrade if you're gonna
sign that two-year deal first is right
now November right before the holidays
this is when everything new is coming
they're giving the market for a new
phone for a while and you've been
waiting and waiting and waiting now is
the time to jump galaxy s3 Note 2 iPhone
5 Lumia 928 X there's a ton of great
flagship phones available right now if
you want to wait a little bit midway
through the year is also a great time
sort of june/july start getting into the
summer time that's another great time to
buy a phone so really those two every
six month periods when you guys should
wait to get a phone if you can obviously
they're exceptions to those rules so
right now it's perfect go to your store
pick up an s3 and note to any of the
other phones I mentioned you will not be
disappointed speaking of not being
disappointed let me thank our friends

four Lakers do you think the iPad Mini 2
will have a Retina display so we're
already hearing rumors that TD tiny
almost ending screens already being
produced packing the same resolution as
the iPad 3 in the iPad 4 which means a
Retina Display super shrunk down things
are going to be very tiny Apple's gonna
have to do some sort of pixel biginning
that's magnification to make it look
good the iPad minis essentially an iPad
2 shrunk down they could sort of see the
progression we're gonna have the next
iPad Mini they'll probably have iPad 3
specs which did bring a Retina display
and a better processor so expect all
that in a teeny tiny package thank you
