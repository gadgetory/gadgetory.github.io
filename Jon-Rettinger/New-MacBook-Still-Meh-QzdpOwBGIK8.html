from TechnoBuffalo here it's been about
ten months since my less than flattering
review of this guy the 2015 MacBook the
MacBook that has the single USBC port
and I guess the headphone jack too but
that's it so initially my review just to
recap I approached it as a workhorse
travel computer that Apple positioned it
as I thought I was gonna edit on it
travel with it use it for absolutely
every hand I needed and unfortunately it
just couldn't keep up with what I wanted
ten months have gone since then things
have been updated my use cases have
changed a little bit
my wife was using a very old computer
it's about six years old and finally
died and she wanted a new computer so I
asked her what you wanted and she said
this is perfect prevent she sits on the
couch and browses the web so this fit
very nicely I tried to get her to a
Chromebook so I picked her up a gold
MacBook it's the entry-level model
there's nothing upgraded here it's the
least expensive one you can get and I
found myself actually using it more than
she was at home
Kanoe had two approaches I thought I'd
really my review of it maybe might
change your opinion especially now to
tell him for discount some place is
about $300 off with the current retail
prices so my actual issue was I tried to
edit with it we were editing on Premiere
Pro and it was just not it was so slow
doing assembly cuts and things like that
was okay but actually trying to export
just took so long it came very unusable
for me as a travel computer now I'm not
editing much anymore at least on this
hasn't been much of a problem and I do
want to edit though if I do it in Final
Cut Pro 10 it's infinitely better so if
you do want to get this edit be prepared
for very slow export time but it is
definitely usable on a final cut I don't
do much on the gaming side either so
that's not been a problem do
occasionally fire up some Starcraft on
it much to my wife this man could be the
side I like we got an infant I think the
diaper changed stop playing Starcraft
and doing his emails on it actually been
pretty surprisingly good and I realized
that as I'm talking about this I'm
mostly using this glorified Chromebook
with a little more functionality but if
you're the kind of person that takes it
to school if you only need to do is type
write essays on it it's gonna be
actually pretty decent for you I still
think it's overpriced
but now it's discounts I think you're
getting a little better value now
although it has been 10 months so we
expect updates to come relatively soon
but I've warmed to it I feel less
hateful than I did as a
computer and computer on your lap not as
bad as I initially thought so if you're
looking to get one get it now get it at
a discount and be prepared for probably
some upgrades coming the very near
future I just thought I'd share my
experience with you guys like do that
from time to time initially as they
changed cuz what I thought 10 months ago
was always what I think now anyway what
do you guys think
have you picked up the new MacBook you
load that do you love it do you why you
just totally ambivalent to it what are
your thoughts on it in the comments down
below and of course mash that thumbs up
button helps us out a lot the next time
Genentech the Buffalo so guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
