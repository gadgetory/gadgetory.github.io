to you by carbonite what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of ask the
Buffalo I am NOT Ashley I am jon
rettinger and I am filling in for her
while she is traveling the world in
Berlin at the IFA tradeshow feel good to
be back in the ass to buffalo chair for
a week up this week we're going to talk
about the galaxy gear rumors of a
Haswell macbook pro qualifications you
need to work for technobuffalo and what
phones all the folks the office use as a
daily drivers disaster buffalo jon
rettinger go ahead get started Adam
Goldberg asks what do you think of the
galaxy gear is there a worthy investment
for an HTC nexus guy well if your HTC
nexus guy then no definitely not a
worthy investment because right now it's
only a companion device for the note 3
so clearly right there no but if you're
just gonna say hey I'm an 03 guy is it a
worthy companion the answer i think
would still be no i'm gonna save that
for episode of renters rants coming up
doesn't really do anything compelling to
me that would really make me want to
pick one up it doesn't do anything that
my phone doesn't do and sort of a
neutered experience when my phone
already does I have no we should just
play my phone in my pocket taking a
picture I've noticed you put my phone in
my pocket answering a phone call I've
very little interest in the galaxy gear
at least right now perhaps when I see it
and I use it I will change my mind but
for right now that would be a big fatty
pass next question comes from be
Caldwell 92 who asks when do you think
we should expect the Haswell macbook
pros to launch very very soon is the
answer i would expect well in time for
the holidays usually the holiday
shopping season kicks up around november
ought expect probably end of october
early november for us to finally get
Haswell macbook pros or nice with any
sort of other big redesign but just an
upgraded processor nothing else two
giant i wouldn't expect it to be
mentioned in a keynote or anything
probably just a very quiet update if
you're waiting to get a new macbook pro
and also a new imac your best bet is
going to be to wait just a few more
weeks until we get to end of october
early november hopefully that holds
ain't your question this next question
is one that I get quite a bit over my
personal email coming from Paul
Villalobos who asks hey John where the
quality
I need as well as age nor to work at
technobuffalo or a place like yours keep
up the good work with the site Thanks so
let me first say if you have these
qualifications it doesn't mean we're
going to hire you because there a lot of
people have a lot of qualifications and
I just can't afford to hire half of the
world but what I look for first and
foremost assuming gets for a writer
position which usually what we look for
is love of Technology you have to have a
love and a passion for technology I look
for folks usually that have a college
degree with an emphasis in writing
really good writers obviously important
I mean if you have written about
technology the past that's okay we can
teach you how to write for technology
but you got to have that passion and
they love their you're just a good
writer who fakes it it really shows in
the content I think God love technology
can't over emphasize that enough if
you're asking the next question okay
what should i major in in college and he
is writing intensive whether it's
philosophy or something liberal arts
english journalism are anything that
requires you to do a lot of running
creative thinking i would be a great
thing to get you started on the path to
perhaps working someday or the site like
ours or another site perhaps even start
your own age 18 or over we look forward
just for needle stuff makes it much
easier i'm sure we can keep us out of
trouble abos it really big qualities I
look for good personality fit as well to
mention with the rest of the company
really really important to have a good
fit personality wise otherwise sort of
one odd duck and sort of take down the
entire ship just sort of a mismatch of
different analogies so our last question
comes from urk I think that's how you
pronounce it who asked hey Ashley we
ever do a segment showing what everyone
in the office uses as their daily driver
which is a term just for the regular
cell phone that we use i am using galaxy
s4 Google Play edition with the wireless
charging back I really really love this
phone especially loved the wireless
charging previous wireless charging I
was unable to turn my phone off and
still charge up to my phone totally off
at night but I can't with this guy at it
is super happy I love unskilled maked
androids have been a really perfect
experience for me Roy Choi what is your
daily driver it's the Moto X I just
started using it yesterday as my daily
driver and I really like it it's very
intuitive I've always like Motorola's
use of
technology that incorporates where you
are and how the phone knows how to react
and it's much more natural on this
device than it is on any other motorola
device I've tried um I mean yeah it's
small and the display isn't as high
resolution as some of the other stuff on
the market but I really don't miss it um
I really like it Ryan wrestle you
weren't a few in the obvious that uses
two phones at JP drivers so what are you
using well John I have my trusty iphone
5 that I've been using for the past year
and I got a custom actually Moto X that
I just got the other day I've been using
the Moto X for you know past few weeks
and i loved it i reviewed it my favorite
android phone before that i use the
nexus 4 but right now so these two guys
we show off your custom Moto X what did
you do for it um I actually chose a it's
kind of like a military green color my
stuck with the black front and I got
actually silver buttons you know turned
out pretty good i'm pretty happy with
the custom job though they did Ralph
Lorena's what are your daily drivers my
daily driver Zara iphone 5 and a HTC one
this one's the google play edition so
it's a little special it's super awesome
and my favorite catches so far Lucy what
phone to use is your daily driver
