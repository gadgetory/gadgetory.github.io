from TechnoBuffalo here and today
Microsoft endowed the Xbox 360 with a
brand new update bringing with it some
UI tweaks but also some pretty cool new
features so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you what the biggest new features are
and I'll talk to you about some of the
smaller ones let's go ahead and get
started so this is going to be a
mandatory update next time you turn on
your xbox 360 and connect Xbox Live you
are going to have to download it what
it's going to bring sort of an interest
of the biggie Sears first it's getting
ready for Kinect coming out later on
this month it's gonna bring the ESPN on
Xbox 360 you sort of saw that previewed
a few months ago it's gonna bring a ton
of new zoom music features including
access to the Zune Marketplace and all
the videos that go along with it
Netflix search friggin finally improved
video check quality improved gamertag
creation streamlines and dashboard
virtual keyboard improve the Xbox Live
Marketplace and uija browse experience
easier to get onto a wireless network
ability to sign out of consign how with
using other controllers and the sign-in
UI a new browser experience updated
family settings improved programming and
much better video chatting capabilities
and audio chatting so we hear the
thirteen-year-old screamin at you in
Konya new you'll now here in crystal
quality so let me go ahead and
demonstrate some of the biggest new
features which now live under the video
marketplace so first let's go ahead and
check out zoom which is really service
sorry to come into its own with the
advent of Windows Phone 7 many many many
months past the zooming age DS launch so
this is gonna be a downloaded app you're
gonna have to download it and then it
will watch didn't take a few minutes or
to get it up and working the camera
focus here so you are gonna get access
to everything that the zoom marketplace
really offers including movies which you
can see right here you can rent if you
want to rent sex in the city to for
example I don't know why you would but
you can right here go ahead and sort of
check out different movies of course
back to the feature let's go ahead and
see what this looks like
back to the future or past its gonna
tell you a little bit about the movie
and then give you an option sort of for
renting back to the feature go ahead and
sort of 1210 of different choices
similar so here's a whole trilogy I'll
show you what this looks like I think to
do load not as fast as they do on
something like Netflix but you can sort
of preview it here
they didn't go ahead and rent it or
extreme it depending on what you like
they just have to have a zoom past in
order to do this so go ahead and go back
sort of continue the tour here so you
get movies you're also going to get TV
shows similar principle just sort of TV
shows and there's a decent amount of
networks here so you can start watch
them least an episode fringe get your
Mythbusters on Real Housewives of
somewhere in the world the boy who cried
werewolf there's a ton of different
choices here gonna go through and
explore it music search pack will - you
can now really use your Xbox 360 to be
more music central hub in your home so
you can stream all kinds of music you
can download whatever you want to the
Zune Marketplace if you don't know it's
a subscription service so you pay a
monthly fee you can download anything
that you want search pretty obvious and
you also have access to movie trailers
some independent videos you can have a
Zune party if you want kind of lame but
you have the option and access to your
whole video library here you can sort of
hook it up to your computer and pull in
your Zune content you have on your home
PC so that is Zune will go ahead and egg
Daddy here it's actually is a pretty
cool new feature that really didn't have
all that functionality before you could
sort of do it but you didn't get all
that zoom plug-in this one of the ones
that I'm most excited about as a sports
guy is ESPN let me show you what this
looks like
now why you would use this supposed to
just watching someone's content on your
TV a little bit unsure I guess they
pulling up pretty heavily the social
networks you can sort of watch with your
avatars and watch with friends and
sports and see the blue guys interact I
prefer to pick up the phone and sir talk
to people or watching the game they can
see all these guys here this is live on
dn-3 there's some tennis going on you
can go ahead and sort of selected over
you want awkward Tigers Mississippi
rebels events highlight some more so
this is all life to go ahead and play it
and it will start playing live
you can watch SportsCenter right now
just kind of neat and it'll buffer it
and sort of start playing quality not
fantastic
and then she'll start talking if you
leave it here she'll start playing see a
little avatar jumping up and down
because they're super excited for it
ducks at USC Trojans this is a replay
and letting you know that it is indeed a
replay let's go ahead and check out what
you're gonna get here with the events
highlights and more so if you want to
catch up on your Lakers highlights for
example you can go ahead and do it
they've got some on-demand stuff here if
you want to watch you know whatever it
might be you go ahead and see if what
you want to watch it here just kind of
neat things you don't necessarily get
over standard ESPN online and it looks
like it's powered by cops Oh Adam I find
kind of funny
upcoming events you can see what's
coming feature highlights we check out
some highlights from things your sports
if you go ahead and add a sport so of
course I'm gonna go ahead and add
basketball and of course I want to add
the NBA and then go ahead and pull
insert my NBA highlights on demand
upcoming events featured highlights my
sports browse all I'm sort of get those
options and see what the ESPN experience
on the Xbox research is going to look
like and this is once again the
downloaded apps you're gonna have to
download it on the Xbox 360 had Netflix
dream was discus so you didn't have to
put in a disc to do it but you're
missing a lot of the figures you have
another device in order to set your cue
you couldn't really search that well
with the application that was there so
you're gonna have to redownload this
again but you now get a refined Netflix
look and feel let me go and share what
that looks like here let the camera
focus on in Netflix and it's loading see
sir that's the new loading screen those
two little circles going around and now
most fancily and happily could see I was
watching Iron Man your search so you can
search for whatever you want
see how its set up there big grow
letters across the top you gotta find
the way you want and search and you're
good to go
let's go ahead and eggs thatis for these
features and there are some you like
tweaks in here there's a new boot up
screen when you turn on your xbox
there's some revine Avatar creations are
refined rather a little more GUI
intensive on say things just look a
little bit different getting ready for
Kinect and going to different options
are here so music marketplace here Zune
last.fm
and sort of the rest of stuff that is
all advertising - probably will never
look at my friends you can see sir where
your friends are again inside Xbox I
think really new here my community kind
of the same you get the video connect
channel getting ready to go Facebook
which I probably would never use
Twitter's here as well probably never
use as well down at a keyboard welcome
and that's about it
this is much more of an evolutionary
upgrade than revolutionary when we first
saw this tirely new interface and we got
rid of were the old blades it's welcome
certainly it adds new features with no
one's going to complain about that take
any way take away in the features you
might have liked I just have the option
rather not to use some of the new things
as well making Xbox 360 and even better
value than it already was so I'm curious
what you guys have to say you excited
about this update do you not care are
you pissed your for us to update and you
want to jailbreak this thing I want to
know what you guys have to say I'm John
Retton you're from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you in the next video I'm poet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
