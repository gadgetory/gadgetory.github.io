technobuffalo here with a full review
for you of the palm pre plus for AT&amp;amp;T
Wireless this is going to set you back
149 bucks after contract and mail-in
rebates it's a very similar to phone to
what we saw on verizon with their pre
plus and of course with sprint on theirs
so before we get to the full review turn
over some of the specs to refresh your
memory on what the palm pre plus offers
it's of course a quad-band 3g phone it
weighs about four point eight nine
ounces dimension one is its 2.3 inches
by three point nine five point six seven
of course it is a full touchscreen it's
a three point one inch capacitive
touchscreen the resolution of 320 x 480
i can show about 16.7 million colors the
screen is very bright and really is nice
for viewing all kinds of media of course
it has a slide out qwerty keyboard there
is not an on-screen keyboard option so
you're stuck with a physical qwerty
we'll talk about that later on in the
review keep it on with the specs it is
running thomas proprietary operating
system called web OS palm of course just
bought by HP so now it's HP's
proprietary operating system web OS it's
got 16 gigabytes of internal storage 15
of which are available to you does not
have a micro SD card case cube guys were
wondering battery life is brand now the
strong as i would have liked a tough
time they claim you get about five hours
standby time about 350 hours it's only
eleven hundred and fifty mili amp hour
battery and it goes very quickly through
one day you're definitely gonna have to
charge the same on a daily basis so
things i'm going to talk about it
probably reminiscent of other palm pre
reviews that i've done as the same
lingering issues both positive and
negative still apply first I'll of webos
for multitasking it is a complete and
utter powerhouse so let me give you an
example of how multitasking works here
you've probably seen this on other
demonstration so I'll go ahead open up
say the phone let's say I want to open
up the browser as well go ahead and tap
that home button right there open up the
browser and it keeps these things open
with called the deck of cards interface
i can keep open early as many as I'd
like and i can scroll through and launch
anyone I want
and when I want to close an application
I just swipe it up this is probably the
best implementation multitasking I've
ever seen I mean it's really just a very
very very impressive easy to use
intuitive and almost fun operating
system it's just very well done so the
browser I've shown you in multiple
videos it is does feature multi-touch
pinch-to-zoom the 3.1 inch screen is
bright shows text crippling crisply and
pages render very quickly so inputting
text has always been one of the issues
that I've had with the palm pre plus I
like having a physical keyboard however
the physical keyboard on the pre plus is
very small and really hard to type on if
you look at it by comparison with its
stablemate say the palm pixi the
keyboard is much easier to type on on
the pixi and let me tell you why on the
pre plus you have these ridges on the
side to that age so when you try and
type your fingers always end up hitting
that Ridge and the keys are very small
I've got pretty normal sized thumbs if I
put it right there see it covers up I'm
gonna have big percentage of the
keyboard even my forefinger covered up a
big percentage of the keyboard on
something like the pixi for example you
don't have that Ridge on the side so
your fingers can rest off the end and
it's much easier to hit the keys they
can be a bit more raised as well because
note has that good sliding mechanism
that goes on top of it so as far as
physical keyboards going txt enter it's
going to take a lot to get used to the
keyboard here on the pre plus and it
would be okay if there was a really
fully functional autocorrect built into
whether your word processing your typing
an email whatever you might be doing but
there isn't one so really you find
yourself making a lot of mistakes and
navigating back and forth to correct
those mistakes can be quite difficult
you have to always be very exact three
touch or you have to use the arrows to
go back it's just not the most elegant
of typing experience definitely
something that I was disappointed with
with the pre plus let me unlock the
phone here in the unlock students
actually kind of neat slide that up the
angle was been ok so let's sort of the
keyboard the cut copy and paste
functionalities bit squirrely as well
you have to sort it tap on one side of
the screen and drag text it's just not
very not a very elegant implementation
it doesn't really hold true to how
elegant the rest the operating system is
itself but cut copy and paste and no
auto correct or
two very killer features that are
missing from the phone so that being
said is this a viable alternative to
some of the other smartphones in a team
teas lineup moves notably if they're
looking at this ship probably looking at
the iphone as well I would say that most
definitely the pre plus is a fantastic
alternative to the iphone actually use
this in a primary phone for a few weeks
now is very happy with it picture some
really cool things for instance
something called synergy which pulls
down all of your contacts from the web
or your Facebook Twitter turn all your
contacts you have in the cloud into one
unified address book one unified
calendar and makes a lot easier to
manage your friend so if your friends
have facebook photo it'll pull down that
photo music as your caller ID if you
have a calendar with Gmail and a
calendar with your exchange it'll pull
it all into one subject in multiple
places get your information that's a
feature that I really liked about the
pre plus and it offers a lot of very
cool design features and it does a
decent amount actually more than I would
expect though if you're looking for a
smartphone this is not a bad way to go
it does have a camera now with video
recording on the back it's got a YouTube
resolution starts got a YouTube player
the camera is three megapixel the video
camera is vga resolution at 30 frames
per second it shoots an impact for it
see it right on the back does have a LED
flash speakers quite loud and all of the
pre pluses are actually shipping with
the inductive charging capable back
that'll work with the palm touchstone
wireless charger the sliding mechanism
has been improved actually from the
verizon version it's much more crisp I
don't feel like the phone's going to
break when I slide it which is nice I so
we've had some issues with the risin one
certainly the original palm or there's
no sprint one it quite works so well and
I always worried that was going to break
this seems to a bit fixed the keys are a
little bit better type on than they were
in previous iterations but as I
mentioned they're just not where I like
them to be so if you're can deal with
those limitations i recommend going to
an ATT store and trying out the pre plus
try out the keyboard make sure you can
use it and it's something that you're
okay with and you want the multitasking
powerhouse that is the pre this is going
to be a fantastic option certainly you
can wait until iphone OS 4.1 julissa
late around the summer and you can get
multitasking there as well though not at
elegant implementation as we see here
from calm and you guys hope you enjoyed
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
