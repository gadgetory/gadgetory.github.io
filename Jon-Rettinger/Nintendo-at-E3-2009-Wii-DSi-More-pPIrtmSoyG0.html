Tuesday June second the second day of
the e3 electronic entertainment expo and
Nintendo gave their keynote speech today
sort of like Microsoft did yesterday and
Sony is scheduled for later on in the
day so let me jump right into it you
recap all the cool stuff for that
nintendo announced please leave your
comments down below let me know what you
think about these the conference just
ended so I've had a chance to memorize
everything yet so I am looking down at
some notes here so please excuse me
while I'm doing that so the first thing
that nintendo announced so they jumped
right in was a new super mario brothers
game it's actually looked very cool it's
a side-scrolling 3d game oh it's always
a big fan of the side-scrolling
obviously super mario games but this one
kind of adds a new twist a little bit
lets you have put in multiplayer so you
can play as mario luigi toad or princess
and you can play with your friends at
the same time you can compete for coins
a Goomba stomping Koopa killing it
sounded very violent whatever it is now
there's a little bit of competition
within the game and you can switch
characters while you're playing as well
which is kind of cool it's a new mario
game Nintendo's kind of resting on their
laurels a little bit with what's been
successful but if you haven't we odds
are you're going to want to pick up the
new mario game so the next thing that
they went right into as we fit and
actually they said we fit as a gaming
platform which is a very interesting way
to to announce it meaning there's going
to be other add-ons to the wii fit so
they should do something called Wii Fit
Plus and Wii Fit Plus has improved aai
that helps you find the best workout for
you it also has 15 new balance board
games it's got stuff like skateboarding
and all kinds of other little mini wii
games to help you get in shape I'll be
out in the fall 2009 in both a bundled
version with the balance board or just
at a standalone game personally I never
got wii fit if you want exercise and get
in shape go outside or go to a gym but
people do lovely fit I recognize that so
if you're a fan of the franchise and
you've been looking to sort of augment
what you
or even look into a getaway and jump
into we fit least now you got something
else to look forward to the next thing
was they demoed the wii motionplus
add-on which essentially what this is a
plug-in plugs into the bottom of your
wii remote i'm making a hand gesture if
you guys can't see it plugs into the
bottom of your wii remote and it has
improved accuracy using the gyroscopic
sensors in the remote so you move just a
little bit to the left it'll actually
move just a little bit to lack if you've
ever used a Wii Remote you'll know it's
not so accurate this is hopefully going
to improve that and they showed it using
wii sports resort the ton of resort
games they show people jumping out of
airplanes playing archery all kinds of
other wii mini games that people have
kind of known and loved the next thing
to introduce was another new game this
was Mario and Luigi bowser's Inside
Story that's kind of a play on words the
whole game actually takes place inside a
Bowser digestive tract it's a little bit
gross it is a side-scrolling RPG which
is a role-playing game which is kind of
cool so you can do different things you
can set out to find tasks and rewards
stinks sort of like Zelda except Mario
and inside of a giant dinosaur stomach I
mean to say it out loud sounds a little
bit silly but I'm sure it's going to be
a lot of fun than tendo's first party
titles generally are a lot of fun and
they know what they're doing so as if
that wasn't enough on the software side
they started talking about new dsi games
via dsiware Mario vs. Donkey Kong for
example so this dsiware is downloadable
if you have a dsi so very cool look for
more dsiware games coming very soon some
of these games would even be available
starting friday so friday look at the
dsi store and see what is new the next
thing they announced is this summer
you're giving able to take photos with
your DSi which obviously you can do now
and upload that into facebook seems like
the Facebook Twitter and social
networking theme is really crossing over
everything so be able to take friend
photos of your friends stretch their
faces and blow up their heads and upload
to facebook if you like not the biggest
feature in the world don't know why it's
taking till summer to get that done but
it'll be a month or so before you can
actually do that so that next intento
guy on stage instead they want to make
the system more appealing to everyone I
kind of thought isn't though we already
sort of appealing to everyone and how
are they going to give it more mass
appeal without isolating sort of sort of
the hardcore we gamers about making the
games too easy and simple and here to
introduce some things that kind of lost
you on did you do something it's not a
joke here called the wii vitality sensor
you put your finger in it sort of like
those little of blood pressure things
you see at the drugstore is you put your
finger in and i'll tell you how relaxed
you are i'll take your pulse i assume
it'll have other in-game uses but that's
all it is it's got a little slip and you
just put your finger in it a little bit
weird i don't know who's going to use
their we as a blood pressure or
relaxation sensor but maybe they have
more so than story they just haven't
shared yet so the next thing that they
announced it was a very packed
conference with super mario galaxy 2 the
original Super Mario Galaxy was actually
one of the last week aims that I had
before I sold my week and I really love
that it was a lot of fun this looks to
be just an evolution of the game same
idea just new levels and the new
missions so if you like the first super
mario galaxy you are in luck next thing
hey now it's actually the last thing
they finally announced was a new metroid
game coming 2010 and it's not a
first-person shooter game like the
Metroid Prime series well it's actually
like the older Metroid you know the
whole ball rolling around and it's not
one percent side-scrolling but there's a
lot of side-scrolling levels it's so
kind of harken back to the old days like
I said earlier it seems like Nintendo's
really resting on what's been successful
in the past maybe instead of innovating
towards the future Microsoft yesterday
focused on sort of new innovations with
that project natal full motion sensing
controls Nintendo is really sticking
with a winning formula there's no doubt
the wii it's been a huge success and it
seems like Nintendo doesn't want to mess
with that they are bringing back some of
their biggest franchise name
and Mario Metroid and really a donkey
kong unit a whole bunch of others and I
can't say I blame them I know a lot of
people are going to match Nintendo for
not innovating more but they've been so
successful like the wii is out selling
the xbox and ps3 but so much that i
think they just don't want to risk it
they're also limited by a horse power of
do we as well if not the most powerful
of consoles so it is interesting to see
that intended to focus mostly on the
software side where Microsoft focus a
lot on hardware and sony's conference
later today you know we have yet to see
what they're going to do whether the
focus on software hardware stay or tune
though I will have a full review on
stoniest press conference as well so
what do you guys think about the
nintendo announced that very excited
about these games you think they
should've done more any disagree with me
or you don't really care one way or
another what do you think about this
vitality thing i really going to put
your finger in a sensor connected to
your game console i would have liked to
have seen DVD DVD playback in the US
shows and movies on demand would have
been very nice features anyway this is
