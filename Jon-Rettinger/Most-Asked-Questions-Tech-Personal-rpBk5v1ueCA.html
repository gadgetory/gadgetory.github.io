decent amount of email messages per day
and as I read through all of them I'm
noticing that there are a few questions
that I'm getting more than any other and
I'm getting these same questions day in
and day out how about instead of
replying to people individually I would
answer the series of questions for you
guys so everybody can see the answers
may range from computers and cameras and
gadgets to things about my personal life
so I've always been relatively honest
with you guys in my audience so let me
try and answer them for you the first
one is very easy to answer what camera
do used to record your video well it's
the camera i'm using right now and it is
a sony it's the HDR sr 11 it's a
fantastic camera records in full HD
actually just still pictures too i've
never used it but i think it's a
fantastic a hard-driving based camera
and I thoroughly recommend that you can
see the quality of the camera itself you
look at really all my videos the past I
believe six seven months of it filled
with this camera I love it I don't think
the YouTube even does it justice the the
native raw files that I see before i
upload are just such high quality you
know excluding what i put on it but the
the video quality itself is fantastic in
the camera especially for a consumer
camera it is really really top-notch so
the next question that i get all the
time you get keep all these gadgets that
you get well the answer is yes and no
some of the things i get and really some
things like cell phones and other things
i get just to review so i get them from
the companies are reviewing for a few
weeks and I send them back some I by
either out of personal me because I want
them or i buy them just to review for
you guys I know that there's an interest
for you in them so you know how do next
question always follows that is how do i
get these gadgets this is a question i
have answered a few times but the real
answer is there's no magic key
oftentimes they get questions saying is
there an email address and i need to
send
two companies to get these products or
can you send me companies contacts the
answer of course is no there's no magic
email and you know these are contacts
that that I've made and some of you come
even friends that you know you just
can't give out the best advice I can
give you can watch previous videos on
advice for aspiring youtubers that I've
done is just to try and build an
audience you don't have to go buy
products and build an audience you can
just talk about products can talk about
trends you talk about electronics you
don't have to be rich to be a tech
reviewer and that's a very big
misconception and that reckon it leads
me very nicely to my next question are
you rich and the answer is a very very
strong no but I can sort of see what a
misconception maybe a large portion of
my audience is a little bit on the
younger side my demographic sent the
fall into the you know 13 to 19 range
and I look young but I'm much older than
that demographic i'm a 29 year old guy
and I've been supporting myself
exclusively and on my own for the past
seven years since I finished college so
you know I work hard I've been indicated
marketing I've been in the legals feel
the things about a ton of jobs and I
work very hard to be able to to afford
some the things that that I do but if
you're young or sort of looking in you
can see that some of the chronics I
could give up the a misconception I am
far from rich you know I'm working very
hard to try and support myself and
leading to my next question that I get
all the time are you single working to
also support my new fiancee floozy that
may not know I just got engaged about a
month and a half ago to a beautiful
woman who we've been together for seven
years I think she's a saint in no matter
how days and I'm how bad my days get
talking to her and seeing her really the
only thing that that he stresses me and
they can you relax so you know I work
very very very hard just recently
actually despite the bad economy I left
my job i was in marketing i was running
a marketing department and i left to
focus on technology reviews and
TechnoBuffalo particular
and it's was taught there was a tough
decision to me especially at this point
in my life by something that I really
wanted to give give a shot too and I can
urge all you guys out there that if you
have a passion for something try it
afraid to point in your life where you
can give something to go you know do it
you don't want to look back with regret
and if you can do it without the
detriment of your family you know
without putting yourself in financial
hardships try it do it you definitely
got to follow your dreams and it doesn't
work out at least you know you tried but
the old expression goes it's better to
try and fail than to have not tried at
all so it's thinking about TechnoBuffalo
let me give you guys some updates on
technobuffalo as you guys know we sort
of did a launch about a week and a half
ago and the launch didn't go as well as
you would have planned our servers were
slammed and we've been trying to
troubleshoot the problems for for quite
a while with drew more servers at it you
know we hired server experts and there's
been a lot of behind-the-scenes things
that you guys haven't seen and i gotta
tell you just again in all honesty it's
proven to be very difficult to get this
running the way i want it and the way
Brandon wants it we're both
perfectionist and we don't want to
launch a half working site we want to
launch a site that's going to be be
functional it's going to be fast and
it's going to deliver on what we
promised I mean I've told you guys what
the site is going to be and I promise
you what it's going to become and I
don't want to break that promise to you
and it's very hard to get things the way
we like and it's taking a lot more time
than we expected in retrospect you know
we should done things a little bit
differently with the launch but we are
getting to where we want to be and we're
getting there quickly so the site will
be launching I promise and I'll share
the information with you as soon as I
know it you know I get a lot of
questions asking what the launch dates
going to be and I wish I could share
that with you right now does that would
mean that you know we were on the right
path and the end was very near but we
are on the right path and the end is
coming fortunately and we will have the
site up and running you will have these
fantastic giveaways and be able to share
fantastic content from our video
producers from our authors and from a
ton of others so I thank you guys for
your patience this has been a little bit
of a deflating we
or so for me and it's it's been
stressful it's been tough but you know I
know that we're going to get the site up
and running soon and I hope that you
guys like it and like I said it's better
to try something you know and give it
your all and never have any regrets so
this is this is what I'm trying this is
what I want to do with my life and my
career is a technology reviewing so you
know I'm trying and I will keep you guys
up to date as to what's going on so
those are the six or so questions that I
get most often i wanted to share them
with you know no gadgets really in this
video no reviews just sort of an honest
dialogue so you guys are always free to
ask me questions I'm pretty honest and
relatively up front you know it's a
little bit strange for me to talk about
my personal life with people I've never
met but and I want to see I feel like I
know a lot of you guys a lot of people
that watch the videos and I know that by
by filming myself I'm also sort of
putting my my life out there a little
bit and to deny that sort of put up a
wall uh isn't fair so trying to be
honest and give you guys all the
information so if you have any other
questions leave a video response leave a
message down below you know or or email
me on youtube whatever you guys like
anyway this is jon rettinger if you want
to check me on on Twitter hit me up at
twitter com so that's John for lakers
and obviously if you want to learn more
about TechnoBuffalo TechnoBuffalo com
I'll see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
