the TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to
host for this week shawnee
editor-in-chief of the site and i'm
joined by executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton hey everybody for those of you
wondering where Joey is Joey's computer
his has gone up to the great computer
heaven in the sky and he said yes he
said to the farm to fly with the other
computers uh so he will be he will be
coming back just unfortunately he was
not able to technologically do the show
this week so but that being said there's
actually a ton to talk about this week
there's a lot so tablets dead yeah so
that was crazy I mean well what we saw
um earlier this month or I guess just a
couple days ago not too long ago is
apples and I'm just starting with Apple
because it's a great example because the
ipad sort of like a tablet you think of
your telling tablets right you can go to
android but there's so many so tablet
sales are down from apple ipad sales
were down again and it's this big chunk
me starting to wonder like why are they
down and I wrote a little bit on it in
an article saying is it time for Samsung
and Apple to start worrying about not
only that but the smartphone market but
there's this this question I have is is
how often do you have to upgrade your
tablet right is that why sales are down
and a couple of other reports I saw two
we're asking the same question so if i
have like right now i have the ipad mini
with retina display there's no reason
aside from gadget lesson i'm going to
buy a new one with touch ID this year
right like probably not because I don't
need to and so you have to look then at
the tablet saturation point and at what
point do people need to upgrade and are
there enough innovations being made the
tablet space to force people to want to
upgrade and I think the answer sort of
is in the numbers know which has been
interesting yeah I telly Gracie I unlike
phones you everyone has a two-year
contract so when they get to the end of
that two-year contract they immediately
go oh man i really want to upgrade
but yeah if you're just buying a Wi-Fi
tablet there's nothing there to motivate
you I mean look at televisions you don't
buy a new television unless your old one
is dying yeah right you don't just run
out and buy a new television because the
new models out and that's probably gonna
be the same thing with tablets we have
this initial boom and now it's going to
slow down as we wait for people need to
upgrade right and yesterday recode had
an interview with best buy CEO Hubert
Joly and he was saying that they noticed
that's why I notice and their tablet
sales are crashing quote unquote and
that he's seeing a reinvigoration the pc
market which is really interesting
because i think a lot of a sort of look
at windows in those crazy flipping
tablet computer things or like but but
they I guess they're selling really well
right and people are still upgrading
their computers especially he said
there's a driving force from Windows XP
up to the new windows 8 machine so just
so actually Microsoft killing off XP
which we all love was a good thing for
PC sales at least from bestbuy
standpoint and Jolie said this is the
best point that's by CEO he says the
issue has been that once you have a
tablet of a certain generation it's not
clear that you have to move on to the
next generation which is what I was
arguing too you don't need to move up he
says it's going to depend on what
innovation comes next but you need a
reason to replace your tablet which is
exactly right and I think that's the
biggest obstacle that you know Apple for
example is going to face with these
declining ipad sales yeah I totally
agree with what he was saying you know
it's yes we're in a unique position in
that you and I pretty much upgrade our
iPads or some form of tablet every year
yeah I mean right now I've got three
tablets within eyesight and the nice
thing is they have a great resale value
right yeah exactly so you know yeah
we're we're unique use case but most
people are just gonna buy one tablet
they're gonna get i would estimate three
to four years out of them easily hmm you
know so it's going to be a while before
people and absolutely positively need to
upgrade their tablets yeah all right I
agree yet the ink
some pc sales has me curious that I I
yeah right I'm sorry say again yeah I
was kind of baffled by that as well yeah
I mean I get what he was trying to say
but I really don't think you know Oh
windows XP is dead time to buy a new
computer no I know yeah I mean yes we
reach the end of support life but how
many people your general consumers
actually know that yeah and who I mean I
feel like most people are probably on
windows 7 at that point maybe if they
had an older laptop on vista but i think
it is kind of cool that an Intel had
been promising it's for a long time that
these pc prices really are dropping and
there i think they're still kind of
pretty pretty decent quality i mean for
300 for pops you can get it an ok laptop
right i mean you're not spending a
boatload of money and i think that's
what's sort of probably driving a lot of
these sales because when you look at
apple's range right starting a thousand
dollars then windows has this huge
market microsoft us and all of their
archers below that and i'm sure that's
where best buy seen sales and when you
go into best buy and you see an ipad
that can do this or a full-fledged
laptop that can do this and in some
cases also kind of act like an ipad well
then that's really a compelling use case
and probably why seals row that's my yes
yeah I agreed you but you know I I saw a
lot of the headlines yesterday tablet
market crashing no it's it's not it's
fining it's it's true path right market
direction for all fee yeah I super
popular and now you know everybody sort
of everybody has them and God you have
to sort of gauge like where you sit now
this middle ground that's always been
one of my biggest problems yeah like
when i had my comic book store i always
knew there was a saturation point there
was a point where I could not grow
anymore because there are only so many
people that are interested in what I had
the cell right it's the same with every
other market you know and so I always
laugh when well you know Walmart only
had one point two percent growth this
quarter
they're everywhere where else can they
go yeah yeah it's true and I think
that's why I mean great topic that we
saw what was their new coupon saving
something at the interview yesterday
like you start having to do price
matching things and other ways to
promote growth the exact necessarily
just change of others yeah so with
tablets it's going to be a situation
where we are going to see a replacement
and cycle but it probably hasn't started
yet I mean iPad ones are still running
right yo and my mom still has it I
didn't give him second yeah I mean all
the the android tablet well the majority
of Android tablets I'm sure there's some
that of me he'll some of those ones you
picked up for fifty dollars on black
friday from a company you've never heard
of or probably probably wouldn't mind
but it generates it yeah go ahead that
kind of brings up something that we also
saw a report recently and you know I
don't know how true this is but a
Harvard student was doing research and
then found that the searches for iphone
slow spike every year round the time of
you iPhone comes out and i think it's
not a conspiracy i think it's simply
just that you know maybe the new
software is there or they're seeing
their friends iphone that seems super
fast with brand new and that that's why
there seems slow but the article raises
the question is there a conspiracy that
these are built to slow down and
obviously i don't think so because apple
is great it like so we're providing the
new software older but that's what makes
it so compelling to own an apple product
some fun so gotta get those guaranteed
updates someone by now would have
figured out if there was some sort of
magical signal that goes out yeah or
orbit was somewhere in the cut no I
don't think there I don't think apple is
building iPhones to slow down because
it's not no I have a laundry list of
reasons why this is not happening yeah
if it was true and it was ever found out
it would be the end of Apple
oh yes sir I mean yeah I don't think
they would be sued into oblivion here
and I just know now I have never heard
of Apple doing it on any other product
it's just it's gadget lust its people oh
wow you know I saw my friends knew it
like you were just saying I saw my
friends new iphone it was so much faster
yeah what else that's all it is it's no
it's just nice try though yeah thumbs up
I mean it was interesting research right
because it did show that they there were
spikes in that search every time around
a new iphone so I think that's sort of
just take away here now something we
mentioned briefly about the the
off-brand phones you wrote an article
this week about ill and you're very
reference to a little bit about Samsung
and Apple do they need to be worried and
there is this growing up swell of you
know these smaller companies from China
like you know well I say smaller but
they're not all that smaller who a
lenovo yeah awesome no mo and Jo me xiao
mi show me they're also coming up now to
another report so the first report you
referencing what's from IDC earlier this
week had said a Samsung and Apple both
lost market share to lenovo in huawei
which are jumping up the ranks to big
Chinese vendors and then LG was in fifth
place there but another report today
that came out from Strategy Analytics
actually put Joe me at the bottom
they're replacing LG and had them
growing from I don't know one point
something percent market share last year
25 points of a percent market share this
year and like 15 point 1 million phones
sold and sort of just like rocketing up
there and then you have to look at other
companies i think one plus one is
probably not heard the oneplus company
it's probably not too much of a danger
right now is it we're not really
shipping their hands that's everybody
but is there a couple you need a code to
get it right but i think that's sort of
the idea here what Joe me sort of market
model is and Huawei to is you sort of
higher-end and sets at lower end prices
that really don't break
okay and I know the United States these
aren't going to be household names
particularly unless you're shopping sort
of on a prepaid carrier or something but
they are I think going to be especially
if these models continue and and I think
Apple and Samsung you need to be worried
in some respects because their market
sugar is dropping at a pace that cannot
be sustained so they need to adjust in
some way and I think that's why we're
going to see Apple interviews the 5.5
inch iphone this year obviously a form
factor that's pretty tunisia a lot and
very popular there and there's rumors
that samsung sort of rushing the Galaxy
Note 4 out the same time but I think
eventually price is going to be a
concern especially an OP contract prices
before we we just got an interest in
common from a listener from brezin
franco a galaxy tab 10.1 OG owner have
been trying to replace it for the last
two year not even seijin mod made it
snappier but see there's a great point
you you've tried different things but
you have not actually gone out and
replaced it hmm you know if you're
actually having problems with it that
that to me is even more interesting
you're having problems I understand yo
finances and all that sort of stuff but
you know there's a use case right there
yeah he's having problems with it but
not so much oh he's actually gone out
and purchased a new one right right
which is exactly some of the best buys
things that you already own a tablet but
you haven't necessarily gone out and
replacing the galaxy tab 10.1 already
several years old now right so yeah so
that that upgrade length time or
whatever is already longer than it would
be for phone just two years standard
unites each other yeah exactly but yes
speaking of one plus one I did bite the
bullet i was able to get an invite i
went for the 64 gigabyte version nice um
lot in the g3 these days i really love
this phone not entirely because of the
greater size i really love the textured
back
that's a gamer on that by the way I have
not actually I don't take many photos
with my phone so I have not played with
it that much Brandon said that's a
little wonky and low light but in bright
daylight it was great cool so yeah it
just varies on lighting condition but I
I tried a bunch of different phones when
i was on irvine last week and I was
really really happy with the one plus so
I by agree until they get out of this
whole invite thing yeah I mean you're
sort of constricting themselves in that
in that regard right like you they have
this great product everybody loves it
but they can't I guess they can't make
enough of them right now otherwise they
would have the words yeah bake 350 bucks
for 64 gigabyte phone yeah yeah kind of
an integrator I need contracts yeah yeah
absolute insanity let me roll through
we've got a ton of questions here coming
in so let me get into some of the
related to tablets from Sasha Mahal do
you think we will see a nexus 7 2014
edition why I don't know oops oh right i
don't know if it's getting the nexus 7
most rumors are saying what eight or
nine it is this year yeah i mean i i'm
i've got nexus 7 2013 and which I love
it's a great tablet but crack the screen
are mine hey I did I don't know what's
happening I we still haven't heard
anything about nexus 6 I mean we started
hearing little rumors here and there
we've heard rumors of a new Nexus tablet
via 89 inches whatever it may be um I
really I don't know what's going to
happen with the Nexus line I don't know
either i'd like to see it continue
especially i mean if we're iterating all
coming up you will get something you
with that but from what I've seen I mean
I haven't put it on my Nexus 7 again
that I practice your next alley but
Android L on the Nexus 5's been great so
I don't know that that a new hardware is
necessarily heated but google has said
that new that's his hardware is coming
i'm sorry i'm just reading the email
that you sent while we've been sitting
here yeah you do with no hands yeah I go
ahead suburbs like how is he emailing me
while we're on the Shelly but that was
impressing of multitasking uh from
President Franklin oh I'm sorry we do
not have any extra 1 plus invites right
now yeah you later we wish it Todd yeah
one that we have a giveaway yeah we do
have to give away running so you can go
register for them as for a 64 gigabyte
version I'm just a 0 for once I have
touched a phone before Todd yeah that's
right i have not played with one foot
one year yeah so crossing that off the
bucket lid one of me yeah that's tratado
fo oh good grief not have to play oh
let's see hey guys i would like a one
plus one do you know how you get invited
yes and that's from Javier Perez just go
to their site and sign up and some point
they might send you an invite yeah it's
otherwise trying to find somebody who
owns one because they get an invite
right you buy one you get a well we
asked the company for an extra invite
because they're like our editor-in-chief
really wants to buy one so they just get
it they just sent me one extra invite
but um so I didn't have any invites to
give out otherwise I would have given
them out to some kind soul but yeah but
we are giving one away on the site too
yes go go and register you still I
believe there's almost a whole nother
week left so yeah I think I'm not
positively not my brain is fried after
last week in irvine I don't know what
day of the week it is yeah we should
talk about comic-con yeah oh not saying
that to me because I also understand
like the idea of comic con amor of like
I've only been to two attack Trey chose
like ctia at CES knows
okay well comic-con is not a trade show
so it's it's open to the public it's I
think now attendance is up around
150,000 for the four days Wow and it was
really interesting because when I went
back in the 90s it was there were comic
dealers everywhere and there was like a
charity auction of comic artists up on
our stage you know doing artwork right
in front of you and then you could bid
on it later in the show cool and now
this year I go and I could probably list
all the comic dealers I saw because
there was only like maybe 12 Wow so now
it's guy I mean it seems like it was
really focused around movies a lot this
year and then I know there was some
gaming that we actually the gaming
section was off on the far right wall
and it was the hardest section of the
show floor to walk through Wow there
were so many people over there and so
now ya there you know Warner Brothers
had a huge booth marblehead a giant
booth which was focused far more on
their movies in their comics then you
had like the CW had a booth ABC The
Walking Dead had its own booth it was a
pusson AMC altogether booth and then you
had like the toy companies like Hasbro
which makes all the Star Wars toys and
all that they had a gigantic booth Hot
Wheels had a huge booth so it's a lot
more just general pop culture now mm-hmm
and what's really interesting is that is
spilled out of the Convention Center and
like I went over to one press event that
was over in the parking lot of petco
park the home in San Diego Padres yeah
there's another street called the gas
lamp district which pretty much every
building on that street was doing
something the hard rock cafe or hard
rock hotel had the galaxy samsung galaxy
event with the premiere of the trailer
for hunger games mockingjay mmm hey it
was everywhere it is taken over the
entire city
and so yeah it's not so much more it's
not so much about comics anymore it's
just kind of a general pop culture thing
now in comics though it was interesting
because I mean I saw I've seen a lot of
these books before but like I saw a
Marvel Comics number one I haven't seen
one of those in years I saw some action
comics number one which are the first
appearance of Superman I saw detective
27 a couple Batman number ones die
detective 27 being the first appearance
of Batman Wow where do these where do
they have them in like glass well yeah
they have one most people now take the
really expensive books instance or a
company called cgc and what cgc does is
they rated and then they put it in a
sonically sealed slab of lucite and it's
given a number grade from on a scale of
10 so now when you walk up and you see a
CGC rated Bucky oh and it says 9.05 you
know it's been rated by cgc and you know
that you know it's a steel quality Wow
what's uh oh yeah so well know it how
much it costs to get this done is
ridiculous it's based on how much you
feel the book is worth and they take on
three percent of that book value Wow so
if you're sitting in a
ten-thousand-dollar book it's going to
cost you three hundred dollars to get it
slammed Wow yeah exactly so yeah the
really expensive books were either like
in glass cases are up on a wall at the
back of the booth where you couldn't
touch them so uh yeah it was interesting
I mean great seeing all these these
various books and I was also nice i R
and a lot of old friends some I hadn't
seen since I last gone to comic-con in
96 I was amazed there was one guy I
walked up to I was like hi I don't know
if your memories like Sean you're kind
of hard to forget
that's awesome I was like it sweet okay
I sometimes forget that I stick out in a
crowd yeah but no so it was great you
know it was a lot of fun going with John
you know because John had never been and
Ralph we took Ralph with us and Ralph
knows nothing about the comic book
industry and so it was really fun
watching their reactions hey to every a
lot yeah it's like seeing everybody in
cost you and it's seeing books that you
were marked at 45 thousand dollars yeah
yeah yo heck we even showed one in the
video that was going up for auction that
had a pre-auction estimate of 175,000
well yo so yeah it was a lot of fun
watching how Ralph and John reacted to
everything but I was interesting was fun
you know I'm glad I got to go back we're
already luckily when you the to get
approved as press was quite the process
and luckily it they go ahead and approve
you for two years so we're already
appropriate for 2015 yeah so that's
awesome yeah we just have to reapply
every two years now and so next year
were already approved and John's re like
can we go back sure I guess yeah so no
it was fun and it was a lot of fun you
know being able to cover it as presion
and taking the photos and all that it we
couldn't get into any panels because if
you I get into the big panels like say
the marble panel that's in Hall H that's
a 6500 seat venue and basically you have
to line up the night before whoa that's
in see yeah so yeah none of us felt like
you know staying overnight on the
sidewalk and sandy although that gas in
the district gaslamp it spelled right
it's really fun yeah gaslamp district is
awesome before yeah no gas clip is
really really uh what a pub
hold on i just got an update from roy
about the one plus giveaway all right
okay some of them accidentally got sent
to spam it looks like so he if anyone
listening has entered the contest and
they have not their comment is not shown
up he is going through and hand
approving entries right now there we go
if by a chancellor if you've entered and
you do not see your comment it is coming
through and approving them right now it
spam filters are great but sometimes
they go a little wonky yeah so yes
comic-con awesome can't wait to go back
next year cool uh which answers a couple
of the questions coming in about should
an otaku go to go to comic-con from
brazen Franco for those of you that
don't know what toku is that's a it's
Japanese for essentially fanboy oh nice
night yeah they're there were a few
anime dealers there but it was nothing
like was back in the 90s anime is kind
of phased out there but you know I did
see like Funimation there and some of
the bigger anime dealers like Jay lyst
hobby like Japan and that stuff so I i
would i would say he'd be better served
going to a strictly anime convention
like otakon or a condom in dallas nan
desuka and Denver but San Diego and I I
wouldn't say if you're strictly there
for a anime okay let's see what we've
got a ton of questions so let's just
start piling through these and here's
one from Christopher miles do you think
apple will ever aggressively pursue the
low to mid-range market or will they be
content as a premium manufacturer with
five to seven percent market share based
on current trends that has a really good
question Christopher uh-oh parade i'm
confused with the five five to seven
percent market share sins um I think
he's talking about the i believe they
only have like five to seven percent of
the
pc market okay uh okay if we're going
for pcs no I mean I think no I think
Apple is going to try to remain a
premium manufacturer we sort of see I
mean the most are willing to do is what
drop the high-end macbook pro recently
macbook pro with retina by a hundred
bucks and they drop the macbook air by a
prayer cloths but I think they're
they're content in that market as for
phones we sort of saw the experiment
with the iphone 5c but it looks like
that sort of just happened this year and
while it happen again it's not next year
in this next round in september-october
as we heard today the iphone could
launch october and said but um yeah I
think I think Apple sort of very much
wants to be this premium player but
that's also why I think we're going to
see this market share slip as we have
seen and we have the huawei and ZTE
Shelvey and all these other companies
coming up because they are low-cost
players and for example I've spoken to
Motorola right the Moto G i believe it
was was the best selling Android her
best-selling phone in every market they
introduced it in in Latin America so
Apple will it seems like lose market
share to these companies if it doesn't
go lower and I don't see it going well
we're that's sort of i mean i
think they like their brand being known
as absolutely all right my apologies
everyone i apparently i forgot to
silence every phone in the world so my
apologies for the text messages and
actual phone calls coming through that's
no i agree i think apple's very happy
with where they are i mean you look at
their war chest and I why rock the boat
yeah oh so like I mean they haven't
really done that that low and ever
before and I mean to be frank you're
really you're really okay buying a
refurbished laptop it's a couple years
old too from Apple I mean I'm still on
the 2012 macbook air the entry level one
and I'm running you 70 perfect
on these days only I have issues with my
trackpad now but I mean and that's a two
year old laptop which are pretty solid
so yeah that is their low and right for
Apple it's just an older product pretty
much uh here's a question from taj mahal
what do you think of the pricing for the
playstation now beta Todd you and I were
discussing this right before we jumped
on the show and yeah Joey had some
comments us worry about wait what yeah
we'll go over them real quick I brought
up Joey's post for people who aren't
familiar with the PlayStation now beta
that was announced this morning you can
what is it sort of like you could rent a
game almost right for let's see
Darksiders for example was 299 for four
hours of play which silly you can double
that for seven days for seven days is
599 uh and then 30 days is 799 and 90
days 1499 no no the sweet spot there for
me looks like 30 days so wait is that
per game uh i mean yeah this has just
Darksiders up but i don't know i mean
this is joey's market i'm just repeating
his post under right no I I get it now
yeah that is per game that's right they
said it was gonna be oh oh yeah and then
actually Joey brought up a great point
here too if you have a PlayStation free
you can get the full version of
darksiders for just four dollars which
is cheaper than seven days yeah um and
then Joey also mentioned that a whole
batch of games will come starting at a
dollar ninety-nine seem too so there's
some other stuff I racing seems weird to
make up joey is listening he just
confirmed per game yeah thanks thanks
Joey for learning right now yeah that is
wow yeah that's I mean I feel like it's
it's like i enjoy i might disagree with
me but for somebody like me where i'm
kinda like i don't know if i want to
play this game maybe i'll just try it or
like
I don't get I don't feel like I have a
lot of time to gain these days so I'm
not going to go out and spend 60 bucks a
game but i want to see sort of what
everybody's talking about then maybe i
would pay you know four bucks five bucks
just to play it for a couple hours and
then whatever sort of like renting a
movie right but i think for like serious
game you're specifically making seven
yeah I don't know I I don't think this
is going to be quite the the savior of
pocket books like some people thought it
was going to be but it's interesting i'm
sure there will be some shake out as as
it develops I mean true this is
currently beta huh right you know how it
works yeah but no it's an interesting
concept we'll just have to see where the
guy thought the EA 14 xbox one was
really cool though right right and
actually we have a question about that
from Chris for miles what do you think
of Sony's decision to not carry ii a
subscription service do you think
PlayStation now can make up for it as it
will have a larger selection of games
yeah is pricing a lot more compelling
yeah it was but and hold on rich area
joint saying why don't people just go
out and buy used games instead of using
PlayStation now he does have somewhat of
a computer folks he just doesn't have a
camera that was the problem so um i
think ii a subscription services
interesting especially the what was a
thirty dollar thirty dollars a year that
could be interesting you know because I
let's have the price of a brand new game
and you're going to get access to
several games so in theory it could save
you some money as for sony not going
with it I can see why I mean they've got
the PlayStation service that they give
you a couple free games a month you know
for sixty dollars a year I can see why
Sony wasn't as interested but that being
said I'm going to look at the EA a
little bit closer it intrigues me
intrigues me too because I wouldn't go
out and buy like fifa for examples I'm
just
unlike q sean and brandon i'm not a huge
soccer fan we're football fan however i
would probably play it with this because
then I'd be like Oh what everybody
raving about sort of like in the video
because it seems like everybody I know
if HP but what's it so then I would you
know certainly I just put it up going on
right free font or whatever maybe it's
not for me Ariane mad enough yeah
exactly uh from besos mecco Sean what's
behind the white sheet would you like to
know all his bodies from comic-con just
some just some unorganized shelves that
I just don't your needs to bother
looking at UH also from from brezin
Franco do you think iOS 8 will be the
last for a 4s last major update ye Emily
probably and let's say unless unless
Apple you know moves forward with
something like Google's 58 with android
4.4 and sort of making it really low
power I don't I don't think so if
Apple's trans stories stay up i would
guess this is the last night yeah now by
yeah i think the poor ass is about done
here with iOS a very interesting
question from christopher miles in
relation to the tablets do you think any
android manufacturer could ever achieve
apple levels of mass-market appeal by
means other than heavy advertising yeah
i think i think one plus one and even
Joe me is a great example of this
because neither I don't think are using
heavy advertising like you don't see
commercials for your phone but instead
it sort of passed around enthusiast
circles in the android community and
that's what's making them so compelling
and why smartphone enthusiasts have
heard of them so I think I mean they're
gonna get market appeal I don't know
about mass market right like I my mom's
never going to be like Koch about his +1
she heard of it and I don't think she
ever would because she's not going to
stumble on an Android for something like
that but you know what's ever I mean
ever seen ever really some of these
brands in
he come out of nowhere I agree i think
at some point they could I think there's
a lot of things they need to look at I
don't think it's just with heavy
advertising I this is gonna sound
incredibly silly I think some of it is
really poor naming you know it's the
fact that ah that's my father everybody
uh there's really poor naming you know
you look at a lot of the the various
ones and they all have incredibly silly
names I mean some of the ones you and I
have written about Todd it's like okay
this is a name that somebody's supposed
to remember when they go into a store
yeah especially when you look at like a
sir Todd we we've lost your audio Todd
testing testing test their your back
okay oh yes i was thinking like like a
sir yeah he's got some weird names i'm
pretty sure and I think Lenovo's
sometimes come in pretty weird games but
yeah I mean it's one thing because it
doesn't sort it's not snappy you weren't
gonna be like oh I need that right here
I'm just bringing up lenovo for example
they have s30 here a series the lenovo
a850 9 like I write them out phones for
a living and I don't know the difference
between the a59 8 a 5 to 6 a-6 808 269 I
like that come on I mean obviously the
processors are changing in there and the
screen size is probably but that's
that's one way you're not going to get
mass-market appeal you can say a series
right and that's what Lenovo sort of has
start page there but yeah I think to
your point that really does make five
cents right now yeah I think naming is
actually a lot of it I know that sounds
incredibly silly to a lot of people but
it's part of your marketing program and
if someone can't remember the name of
your product when they walk into a best
buy or they see it on a sign and they
can't remember it by the time they get
home to look it up on amazon then you're
already lost yeah and I
I should correct myself slightly like
Lenovo is a bad example on the naming
because their market share is growing
and they are a very attractive vendor in
parts of the world but I'm just saying
to your point versus i'd say like an
iphone or galaxy s5 an a a 59 is a a
model number you can think about it
right well let me see what else we've
got here and the questions all what will
you have one from joey davidson how much
pressure should Apple currently feel
from the likes of HTC Samsung LG etc um
well HTC uh is not even in the top five
right now so i wouldn't say real
pressure from them samsung also losing
market share but i'd say his largest
competitor LG remain flat in the quarter
so really I wouldn't say pressure from
any of them it's pressure from Lenovo
huawei show me and these others ET equal
bad China these other brands that are
sort of coming from the bottom and
seeping in and grabbing market share I
mean each of those guys gains a four
percent market choice porter and slowly
chewed away at both Apple and Samsung so
while there are the biggest competitors
they do have to worry about these other
brands and Samsung still major player in
China but obviously you know I think
consumers are starting to see from these
other companies that a high-quality
handset at a lower price is really it's
possible and they're attracted to it but
I don't know what these firms are making
in terms of margins off you phones
either like one plus one can hardly get
them out the door and my guess is and I
think they said right they're not on
making any money off the school so I
don't know yeah but yeah I don't hate
last yeah but you look at the price that
a lot of these companies charge and I
mean hey I've been in business I
understand everyone has to make a profit
but you know you look at the war chests
that yo Apple and Samsung you have and
you just have to go do you really have
to be charging that much and what could
they do to the market if they did lower
their prices a little bit I guess they
get you a lot with investors or so they
want to see those
huge profit margins and they want to see
out yeah all that cash that they have
that's like the beets acquisition was
nothing it was like pennies for Apple
drop in the bucket because they have so
much cash and so much cash coming in
even largely because they have these
huge product markets that are doing
really well for Apple so it n versus
these low-cost manufacturers that are
maybe selling phones in gaining market
share but not making any money so again
maybe maybe Apple and Samsung don't have
to worry that much because how long can
ease companies possibly keep doing it
right right well I I don't know it's I I
think that at some point they'll feel
pressure I'm actually wondering though
if we are gonna have more of a fight for
third going on for a while before we
move up to five per second and first
yeah I think that's where it's coming
right now I mean if you look at least
bring up the figures real quick sorry no
problem orchids we can boil all your I
had a while you're looking that up out
I'll take this next question here do you
think android has reached its zenith
with a reported eighty-five percent
market share of the most recent quarter
or can continue to rise doesn't have a
whole lot of room left to rise unless
they completely kill Apple so I I think
probably you're looking at the zenith of
androids popularity which is hey anyone
that has eighty five percent marketer
should be thrilled yeah it's pretty
solid it really depends on where Android
moves from here but ok so here are the
latest figures in a second quarter of
this year samsung had a 25-point two
percent market share Apple followed
behind that with 11.9 percent and sort
of right on his heels if you look at
growth here is Huawei at six point nine
percent and that's up from 4.3 percent
last in the year-ago quarter behind
Huawei you have lenovo at five point
four percent and then LG at 4.9 but LG
sort of a strategy analytics set today
they had jovi as the the top five in the
world so it looks like it's a battle t2
and in others at forty five point eight
percent that's word HTC and all these
other companies of volume
but you have to I mean look at apple
fell from thirteen percent to 11.9
pretend Samsung fell from 32.3 purse
that's 25 points to so those are big
chunks yeah here's an interesting
question from the mosh 91 what do you
guys think of the oneplus one customer
service and defective phones I think
it's really the growing pains of a brand
new company and from what I've heard and
I haven't dealt with our customer
service before I've heard they're
they're trying very hard to make sure
that every customer is satisfied right
and so yeah it's it's very much a
company that jumped in head first and
didn't have everything planned out I
think that's fairly obvious right by the
way this is a Pellegrino not a beard you
can bleep I realize I'm so much look
like beer yeah girl Todd's in the ball
today one o'clock drink my pellegrina
its hide a good time I'm just kind of
glad you pointed that out so we did i'll
just go oh my god he drinks Heineken
yeah I think that would have been the
bigger offense to bring a bigger than
half man oh good lord well let's take
one or two quick questions because we've
got a bunch of them and I know Todd
you're going to sit there going huh
who's upcoming movie line up in guys
most excited for DC's our marbles um
Marvel we don't know that many more in
the lineup right now beyond yo captain
america 333 avengers age of ultron
ant-man Doctor Strange and guardians of
the galaxy 2 over on DC I'm interested
to see where they go the footage they
showed of Batman vs Superman looked
awesome i think the Wonder Woman costume
looks awesome I'm very interested to see
where they go with the Justice League
so I'm excited for both marble has the
track record DC still has to prove
itself just just not an agreement time
yes uh who's your favorite superhero
that's like asking me to choose my
favorite child sorry not going to do it
from Sasha Mahal first what do you think
of snapchat as an app and how much do
you think the company is worth is it
worth 10 billion or just a few billion
all of these days I okay let me let me
play devil's advocate here for a moment
I have a hard time with any of these
companies being worth billions yeah I
know it's insane I don't see it and I
and also we should save the little
background for listeners the rumor came
out yesterday from New York Times and
several other places it said Ali Baba
was interesting and interested in
investing in snapchat which would give
it a value of ten billion dollars then
the rumor was shot Business Insider shot
that rumor down so they spoke to four
people so I don't know who's right and I
made a joke on Twitter that maybe the
offer came in the form of the snapchat
and it disappeared them why but i don't
know i don't think i mean i don't think
any of these companies are worth that
much money i mean who knows you have i
mean even the fed like janet yellen was
saying none of these social networks are
worth anything and it's like a bubble in
itself which is kind of scary but then
you look at Facebook's earnings this
week and they're actually doing really
well in the space especially with mobile
advertising and hand a lot of growth
facebook now has 1.3 billion monthly
active users so a company like that it's
probably worth a lot of money but then
you see snapchat and it's so young that
I just can't see it but no obviously if
people are willing to spend that much
money investment i'm somebody blues just
female bodies moving it's a picture app
yeah that's easily recreated right like
everybody has her own now yeah how's
that work 10 billion dollars I don't
know
and I don't even use it like so I'll
never once used it never once used it I
have zero interest in ever using it
right I just I don't get it but popular
with the kids though follow those wacky
kids teenagers well well folks I think
