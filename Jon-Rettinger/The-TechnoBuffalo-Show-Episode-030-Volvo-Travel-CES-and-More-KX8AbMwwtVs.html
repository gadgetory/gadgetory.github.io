TechnoBuffalo show I am unfortunately
one of your to us for today Sean ani
editor-in-chief of the site and I'm
unfortunately joined by the executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton everybody
for those that don't know why I keep
saying unfortunately a fan of the site
made a two-and-a-half minute video of
all the times we've said the word
unfortunately in videos and it was
pretty impressive it's incredible looks
like a long time it might tip of my hat
to him for I think that's the same guy
i'm not sure but i was looking through i
think it might be the same guy that
counted 200,000 on youtube I don't know
it was like in that list so i don't know
but okay this is just as wacky takes a
long time yeah buddy look uh oh we're
just gonna go ahead and get one question
out of the way real quick from sasha
Mahal is this the last TV show for 2014
No we'll have probably two more I think
and then will we will skip see this week
there's right that's just no way but no
not the last show the area so yes we are
back Todd his back from Sweden i am back
from England we were just you know
jet-setting all over the place that's
right all over the world and i really i
have not had time to talk to you since
we both got back how was Sweden it was
amazing um probably one of my favorite
European countries I've ever been to we
were in Gothenburg that's the English
pronunciation I'm not sure hey satan
swedish but uh oh so pretty i sent you a
couple pictures i think and then uh but
I was there with Volvo checking out
their testing facility they have a 12
year contract with a place called astha
0 which is really really cool were there
testing autonomous driving and we also
saw a crash test of the new xc90 and
they were talking about the t8
twin-engine to which is the hybrid model
so it has like a 40-kilometer I think
like 25 miles range on a lecture
Rick and then gasps and then hybrid
votes you so that was really cool but we
went all over the city with Volvo it was
just a really really pretty place a good
time nice yeah I'm fascinated by the
idea of self-driving cars because I hate
driving so see that's what they were
saying though they were saying look you
know a lot of people like to drive
obviously you know it's a sport and we
don't want to take that away but for
people that don't want to drive I mean
here the futures but really they were
highlighting what they write like I
don't like driving either um but really
they were highlighting what they call
vision 2020 and that is by the year
twenty twenty Volvo says no he's going
to get seriously injured or died in a
Volvo car which is pretty insane promise
and so this is like the xc90 is sort of
like a you know like a mile marker along
the way getting there and it has a lot
of autonomous features i guess so like
auto breaking for example you're coming
up on a car or taking a left or right
hand turn and it's a blind spot and you
look but somebody comes out of the blue
your car will automatically stop so lot
of cool features like that I was really
impressed so and I know other people are
getting into but ya know it's
fascinating to me and yeah having driven
the night before Thanksgiving on a road
that's generally quiet and I saw more
traffic on it than I think I've ever
seen on it you know i'm all for anything
you know that could possibly a yo cut
down on accent syed when i was leaving
Kansas City last weekend after I had
flown back in you know I had some guys
if between me and another car and you
know massively cut me off and you know
anything that would cut down on that
sort of stuff I'm all for yeah hey Dad
yeah so here's hoping it works now I
would love to see it work via the only
tech thing that I did I finally got like
30 seconds to play with one of Tesco's
huddle tablets oh did you do what did
you do one right yeah yeah the hustle to
neither and I can see why it's as cheap
as it is oh really
it was sluggish oh it was sluggish oh I
liked all the colors when they announced
it oh yeah but I for the second year
running they've sold out so hmm i could
buy covers for the huddle to i could not
buy a huddle too interesting yeah i
wasn't it was it retailing for it was
like 70 bucks or something like that
it's like 99 pounds i think okay so yeah
it's yeah it's just under that you know
the magic which and US dollars works out
to like 140 yeah so a dozen still has to
be I thought for some reason this was
like one of the cheapest out there it's
it's pretty cheap but it man was it
sluggish well you hey you know at first
your average consumer it might be fine
but you know as someone that works with
tablets all the time I was like you're
moving a little slow your tiny bit slow
but yeah otherwise I I kind of turned
off her we can loved it yeah except we
are some football matches in right yeah
I guess who manages a I call soccer yep
got two matches in United Manchester you
and I had won both of them so it was
well worth it and made some friends of
MMA fighters boats tree yeah that was
good friends to have uh yeah they were
interesting but no it was a good time
and but no I take that back i didn't
completely turn off because you and i
were discussing that i introduced myself
to the world of cereal oh that's right
we can talk about cereal a little bit
right let us not go into our theories on
yeah actual case but man is that show
riveting yeah it's really if you haven't
listened to it's really good it for
those of you that may not have heard
about it yet it's a new show from the
same people that do this american life
on NPR and it's a we just discovered
it's only going to be 12 episodes which
i'm completely bummed about yeah so next
week's the last one but it is an
in-depth study of a murder case in 1999
in baltimore
is unbelievably riveting I I couldn't
stop listening I started taking longer
routes back to my hotel just so I can
finish episodes yeah i binge listens you
have one weekend yeah i ah so awesome so
if you haven't listened to serial listen
to it after listening to the
TechnoBuffalo show but and you will
quickly find yourself just totally
enraptured but moving along at one
update for everyone just today the nexus
7 got the funk pop up today we're going
to talk about that and then Sean got the
update this morning so yeah I thought
okay well yeah I had to check it this
morning since we were going to discuss
it and yes I finally got you know for
those of you watching on video yes you
can see the the new buttons down there
so yes I am running lollipop but uh yeah
Ives man that took forever but you know
what so we can still talk about it I'm
blown away that the nexus 6 is still so
hard to find um you know not only just
from google or motorola but even carrier
stores i was calling around yesterday
cuz i have an upgrade on ATT but i was
also as i was telling you i'm thinking
about t-mobile for the international
trip so i can do the free roaming with
the data which is wonderful by the way
yeah cuz i just had to long story but I
just had to pay for data with AT&amp;amp;T when
I went abroad um and so anyway I'm
calling around all the stores t-mobile
AT&amp;amp;T best buys like nobody has the Nexus
6 in stock in New York City or like
around me in New Jersey it's insane and
and you know I've reached out to google
to and it doesn't seem to be like any
news on when that's coming out so I mean
you know fresh bulk and I thought it was
going to be like every Wednesday right
but I didn't see any in stock yesterday
they're just things about UK orders yeah
they had said every Wednesday so I'm not
sure what's going on yeah I agree it's
really weird that that phone still so
hard to find yeah it's not I mean
typically you know the phones are hard
to find and or it's like two to three
weeks
you know for your delivery but this is
just like out of stock nothing I don't
know why it's coming to you I I don't
know it's very odd and you know you and
I have said on the show before if Apple
have these sort of supply problems with
an iphone release there would be bloody
murder yeah yeah so I I mean yes the
Nexus line is supposedly more for the
developers and all that but you know now
like you know this week we got the
notice that US cellular was gonna start
carrying the Nexus 6 this is no longer
just a developer phone yeah now it's
totally consumer when you have every
exactly right pretty much yeah so I I
don't know I'm very confused by it very
confused by it frustrating speaking of
lollipop though the Android wear update
yesterday it's rolling out now and I
don't have it yet on my Moto 360 which
is kind of a bummer but looks good
there's a bunch of custom watch faces
already in google play now so i think
it's starting to pick up steam where I
in the past you know we both said that
inferred where it's not boring and no
fun yeah yeah I I need to update my LG G
watch and give it another go which as a
boo this one will show battery life and
stuff like that in on your phone and
like what's eating away at the battery a
lot more management features so like you
can see your storage because now you can
use the local storage with google play
music and then all the watch faces and
obviously i guess if you have gps like
on the Sony SmartWatch 3 that's taken
advantage of but that was the last
update anyway it's getting there at
finally yeah I it's certainly taken long
enough but I iona ID I would like to
have seen Android wear a little bit more
polished before they released it but in
the 0 for whatever reason they decided
to release it when they when they did
but I I don't know i'll give it another
shot now that they've updated it i I
said I would do that in there yeah I'll
keep giving it a try until I finally go
okay now I finally like it might take
some new hardware
she'd watch isn't very good sorry
everybody on so I spent money on it too
yeah but uh moving along we also our
course are approaching rapidly see yes
yes I cannot believe how quickly CES is
coming up on us and we actually have a
question from Sasha and the hall about
that what can we expect from CES 2015
will it just be smart watches upon sperm
arches and what are you hoping to see it
the show I think it embodies upon TVs
sees you it you really have no clue how
many TVs are released in a year until
you see them all on display at CES it's
just unbelievable I think you and I
discussed after CES 2014 that last year
was just really about iteration there
was nothing that really leapt out and
grabbed us except for maybe like
PlayStation now yeah you're right last
year was kind of boring in terms of like
big new announcements and something from
like we saw huge tvs the curved TVs i
mean that i think that blew us all away
oh yeah I mean we thought like the
toshiba chromebook because that was like
one of the best Chromebooks at the time
I think so yeah but you know yeah I me
like the 8k television that I saw and I
was for me I was blown away by it you
know wasn't ready for consumer release
but yeah that's the thing CES is a very
odd show in some ways it's a lot of
times it's talking about stuff that we
won't see for 8 to 12 months it's
talking about stuff that we may not see
for a couple years but it compared to
previous years last year was just very
yeah but as for this year yeah I do
think we are I think we're gonna say a
ton of wearables yeah probably a lot of
fitness trackers from brands we've never
heard of 21 HTC's even said that they're
going to introduce their wearable yeah
right it's not gonna be a watch
apparently gingers but it will still
have something to do with your wrist
right
yeah so I don't know what's going on
there but I I'm hoping for some more
excitement this year I mean I it's
always fun being there but you just you
hope for something that really knocks
your socks off yeah and it's tough to
because we're coming off the heels sort
of the heels i mean ii foolishness in
September where we had man a boatload of
announcements right and then January and
then come March it's usually late
februari but March this year's Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona so the
mobile people have sort of I mean they
save it free either nwca I've already
announced it Eva you know but there's
companies like Samsung that are always
going to now something I think there's
rumors we might see something new from
Sony like Xperia z4 at CES and you know
for some of these companies it's a good
place to do that too because when you're
at Mobile World Congress or Eva it's
easy one used to be a little smaller but
now it's easy to get lost in the shuffle
and if you're a mobile guy making an
announcement at CES now I mean you're
gonna get noticed like what a was
tmobile last year was at Z one of the
Xperia z3 s now that's new that's from
verizon this year huh there's III I
figured it was e to something it was t
mobile's iterations of the experience I
think was the ZTA compact if i remember
correctly yeah but like so that made a
huge splash there because there wasn't
much else to like see and in terms of
like the mobile news i mean there was
tons of stuff to see book yeah so yeah
energy comes into play yeah and just so
everyone knows our plans we're actually
taking the largest crew we've ever taken
to this year's show we're taking ten
people altogether we're even taking Joey
D this year which is the first time
we've ever taken lily and because and
I'm not going to reveal yet what he's
covering we we have a master plan for
what Joey would it's something we've
never really had time to cover before at
CES but uh Joey will be in attendance
this year but yeah there's gonna be 10
of us at which I hope we have a slightly
larger workroom than we did last year
but that thing was great about yes
yeah yeah it's awesome when yo you're
able to secure a work crew but with
eight of us it was crap it was gonna be
10 of us shoulder to shoulder I'll be
sitting a lot of people out on
assignments yeah that's right get out of
here yeah opening I'll be rotating you
guys a lot more than sugar that's the
other thing for those of you that if
you're curious about how CES works I
actually hardly ever see the show yep
controller I am an air traffic
controller I sit in our command center
and I send everyone where they need to
go on Thursday of last year I got out
for one hour on the show for one hour
secure i remember it yep Ashley and I
went it luckily she'd seen most of this
show so she's like okay now come here
I'll show you this okay come here I'll
show you this usually need to see now
exactly which it was mostly televisions
and that's good to you I mean later
because finally everything's unveiled
you know because earlier in the week
some stuffs like just not right fully
out there until yeah so like monday is
pressed day which is nothing but press
conferences and then on Tuesday the show
floor opens and more announcements are
made that day and then like Wednesday
Thursday and Friday it's more
everything's been announced now you can
just get around see the stuff you've
missed right but it will be a will be a
fun week and I'm keeping you in town
till Saturday that's right I'm there for
a week yeah you're stuck with me but but
not yeah CES should be a good show where
is see everybody to we don't get to see
him you know each other in personal all
your most of us exactly exactly well
this will be actually my first time in
person meeting Jacob it'll be my first
time in person meeting Joey yeah I'm not
the alien person yeah it's in I've been
working with Joey for like three and a
half years and we've never met a person
that's funny yeah I it's going to be
kind of an odd experience to finally see
him in person like oh that's you okay
oh you look like I'm yeah we see each
other on died yeah yeah yeah but yeah so
moving along we have a lot of questions
coming in uh this is kind of a follow-up
to the last episode from Sean the man 34
what tech do you travel with and we kind
of covered that in the last episode but
was there anything you know honestly
when I I got to the UK this time most of
our devices the plugins as long as you
yo can plug them into a UK outlet built
they'll take the wattage there right
without any problem nintendo 3ds will
not really i could not charge it all
week huh and I I travel with mine as
well yeah obvious it though yeah well
and I'm not gonna travel with the
converter just for that because the
converters are so bulky and heavy yeah
you know and the by otherwise everything
you know I used my power strip you know
plugged it into an adapter and all that
everything else charged with no problems
but yeah my 3ds when charged at all ha I
did discover I took too many adapters
this time I i love yellen's yeah I took
like five adapters I ended up using like
to the entire week I was like okay I
next year you know if I ever come back
you know I which I probably will cut
down on the number of adapters yeah but
I guess definitely the answer though the
tech we travel with I think we were both
saying is that power strip is like the
must-have so yeah but we have so many
things to charge a lot of people each
day see it well we even travel with the
power strips at CES you know because we
get in those press rooms where there's a
limited number of outlets and I can't
remember the very first year we ever did
CES it was just John and myself and I'd
already started traveling with my power
strip we found one outlet in a hotel
hallway and we both needed to charge
things amber oh and I pulled out that
power stripping's like that is the
greatest thing anyone could ever travel
so funny CES to you see people just
camped by the power outlets everywhere
yeah owns tablets their laptops and
charger everything yeah cuz press day is
held in a hotel so yo you will see
you'll walk down the hallway I like to
go the restroom or whatever and there's
people at every outlet along the hallway
you know charging up laptops or cameras
or what I have you so yeah it's the
Paris trip really it's such a simple
idea but it's definitely the most
important piece of equipment I devil
what agreed how sad is that very
exciting no no it's not very exciting
but moving along here from another
question from Sean the man 34 what
college did you guys go to and what
degree well I'll start off I went to
Truman State University because it's
here in my town I lasted two semesters
before I went no I'm done and and I was
going for a business degree which is a
long sordid story about why that was not
the best idea for me but uh yeah I I did
not finish college now Todd you did
where did you go what degree I went to
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania
originally for computer science and I
graduated as an English major which is
funny change of change of things that I
loved computer science i was i was
taking c++ and all that in high school
so i knew it i was getting into um but
then I'm like as I was spending like the
late nights doing the coding homework
and stuff I was like you know what like
I love technology and I and I was always
gonna minor in English um but I love
like writing and reading what if I wrote
about technology and that was sort of my
strategy back then I mean I went right
into freelance then for some tech
magazines and stuff and that's just what
got me here yay yeah actually I tried
business for a little bit too but that
was now that was not for me new no I i
I'll quickly fill everyone and I already
had a business
at the point I went to college and I
couldn't deal with the theoretical
scenarios where nothing ever went wrong
no supplier ever shipped you late no
supplier be shorted you you know and if
you've ever seen the running Dangerfield
movie back to school there's a scene
where he takes a business class any
trips arguing at the professor about you
know you didn't cover the kickbacks you
didn't cover those who think that was me
in business class and yeah it just it
didn't work out follow-up question from
Dominique Weber about ces how do you
choose what crew covers what the crew
covers at CES that's that's an excellent
question in the past it has been a
matter of limited resources each year
we've increased the number of people
that go with us and so you know we we
try to focus technobuffalo is mainly
known for its mobile coverage so phones
and tablets are always the first
priority last year we added wearables to
that as a first priority and then after
we cover phones tablets and wearables
then we go see okay what do we have time
for what's the most interesting is it
innovative in its pace so on and so
forth hmm now this year with two extra
writers going you know and and I'm
keeping a secret what joey is going to
be covering um yeah I know Joey knows Oh
Joe easy thank you but but in case
things change for some reason I don't
want everyone to expect that coverage
limits then it's not there I thought
you're just not joking no no Joey and I
actually pedal Joe and I have had a long
conversation about what he's covering
he's actually started reaching out to
those relevant press I know you're gonna
just be like and now no Jojo is actually
very excited about covering what we've
discussed but so for this year you know
I'm going to have more writers at my
disposal than I've ever had so
so do our first line stuff will do the
phones to tablets the wearables but due
to the number of writers we have we
should get through that coverage farm
more quickly and then I'll be able to
tell them go out Explorer find me things
and that's that to me is a lot of the
fun of CES because there are small
companies there that no one's heard of
yet or they're just you know they've
been around for a year or two you know
let's see what they're doing you know
like there's a great accessories maker
that I love cut named blue lounge and
it's my company you hear about very
often but they make some great products
we all love the anchor company for your
power devices you know so we'll check
out anchor so it's definitely you know
phones tablets wearables first and then
whatever really we think is intriguing
anyway a lot you know if the guys come
back in they go hey I just saw this i'm
like five if you've got your other stuff
done right it up go i think last year
brandon i saw like a children's potty
with an ipad stand built in her maybe
it's too here to get work I think that
kind of stuff yeah I especially we good
over into the ieee lounge area yeah
which is all the stuff related to like
iOS devices there are some weird stuff
over there there's some stuff that
you're like really you bought a booth
it's yes to show us this and all the
companies that like you haven't heard of
that are just like complete I'm not
saying like oh that's a knockoff of the
ipad I'm saying like complete iPad
knockoffs and stuff like that you see
like what but running Android there's a
lot of that too yeah uh from sasha bus
the hall how would you describe CES um
that's a really good question tiring a
tiring definitely controlled chaos yes
you know and that's one thing that
always amazes
I don't think you and I have ever
discussed his dad you know yeah its
course he s is not about the press it's
about the industry right if you ever
wondered who all these buyers are I
think I'm full now yakin question I mean
a lot of my thinker it's like best buy
right Graham's honor but but I guess
you're right like there's not that many
retail stores anymore every time I see a
buyer badge I'm like who are you yeah
you know because you just you there are
not that many mom-and-pop electrics
attract stores anymore right so you know
likes a Walmart Walmart does not attend
any trade show if you want to sell
walmart you have to come to them right
yeah you know I would assume it's like
amazon and best buy yeah so maybe let's
make a game of that this year if you see
some with a buyer bad you trying to have
can get back in the fourth because I
really want to know who I mean yes there
are mom and pop electronic stores there
are smaller retailers online and all
that but concerning the mass of humanity
that's at CES you really go are there
this many electronics retailers love ya
and these days like you they need to be
here to see it I don't know four press
it makes sense I guess I just don't
understand that side the industry but I
guess you do from your comic days right
yeah yeah and so that's what puzzles me
even more is I just I know what the
electronics industry is like retail wise
and I just cannot yeah I do here yo
foreign languages as I walk around so
you know I'm sure there's people there
from South America and Europe and all
that right but still it just it boggles
me that there's that many buyers still
right yeah so but it's it's a massive
humanity traveling down very narrow
aisles and lots of loud noises sometimes
not traveling either people just like to
stand in the aisles which is the worst
yeah
meeting to get sued yeah very crowded
New York City yeah yeah oh no I love it
when they stand in the aisle to have a
conversation yeah Oh or is particularly
when they you're at intersection and
they've all congregated in the
intersection yep yeah so there's they're
blocking you know for directions at once
yeah I know if we have time this year
we'll see if we can't shoot some video
of like walking down an aisle or
something it's it's an experience well
this year actually with all of our
social network accounts if you follow us
on Instagram and everything Facebook
will put little video clips up to that
should be fun we'll have to make any
other yeah we can try to do that job
from area aerial palette Nick I hope
what can we expect to be announced in
the CEOs ah that's a good question i
wait they've been kind of quiet about
what we're going to see yeah like I said
I think part of the trouble is too with
Eva in September and Mobile World
Congress and in March I'm not sure we're
going to be mobile heavy samsung
typically does have announcements I'm
sure LG will have some and Sony i think
is rumored to have some as well so you
know we'll see but i think in general
it's going to be a lot of it mean for a
little while there was mobile heavy and
then we kind of went back into the name
you know consumer electronics so i think
we'll see a lot of things for the house
connected car stuff i think we'll see a
lot of tvs obviously you know not really
blu-ray players and stuff anymore not
really home stereos were big last year
you know and that's one thing like the
area where our work area is we have to
walk through the car parts right you
know and we see all sorts of things you
know like car lighting systems and you
know so the CES is not just about phones
and tablets and televisions and all that
there's all these
odd little areas there are pavilions as
they call them and yeah so there's a lot
of stuff there that is very niche as
well so they're always fun to walk
through it just you know we don't always
have time to cover all of it I really
don't know if our readers want to know
about car lighting systems sure why not
but if we find a cool refrigerator what
you know that's always we say that every
year interesting question here from
shashwat Punjabi how did you become so
successful I have a web site known as
droid fanboy calm and I have a little
views it's there's no one thing it's a
mixture of your search engine
optimization it's the amount of content
you do publish is a quality content are
you social promoting there are so many
aspects to how you get big it's it's
really unbelievable but there's a lot of
websites out there that will give you
some good advice just search geo growing
your blog advice to grow your blog
there's a ton of great websites out
there and you know while you may never
get up to the size of TechnoBuffalo
there there's a lot of space out there
yeah so I just do some homework and and
but definitely look into your search
engine optimization make sure your
writing qualities up to snuff and how
often you can publish those would be my
three big things yeah I was just gonna
say content to cuz if people come back
and don't see anything yeah I guess
there's nothing new here exactly one
coming back yep from Sasha and behold
hey Sean you have the nexus player right
how is it and how does it compare to the
Amazon fire TV Roku and Apple TV and you
have them off
I have them all um I'm now I'm trying to
be polite see I'm still excited for it
but I guess I don't want to be I've
tried the nexus player it's probably my
least favorite player Wow yeah even
under the fire TV which I was not
ecstatic over hi I'm i'm going to
revisit it in a month or two once it get
some more apps you know just as a
barometer for everyone the Roku is my
favorite player hands down followed by
the apple TV and then i would say the
fire TV all the fire TV is definitely
improving and the nexus player just at
once again it felt like it wasn't quite
ready for release I think that's the big
thing see I saw it in a demo with google
and it was with google so it worked
really well on everything i was like wow
this is really good but no i actually
use connected I mean I own a roku I own
an apple TV I had a chromecast but the
little thingy broke off on the back of
my TV hdmi port actually and I usually
just use my playstation 4 like if I'm
going for videos now now I it just it
felt very half-baked yeah well it is
supposed to be I think also a reference
design for other people that want to
build Android TV products so yeah
exactly exactly so now not a huge fan of
the the Nexus three up uh here's one for
you Todd I'd I don't know if you've
actually played with this handset from a
CID hot Gotama your views on galaxy
grand three have we gotten to play with
the galaxy grand three I don't know is
that even out I don't know I haven't
played with it it's not a u.s. handset
so the soonest I'd be able to see it's
probably Mobile World Congress yeah
which and yeah Mobile World Congress is
an early March this year isn't it yeah
and great confuse it nothing like
confusing us in general I think my
favorite product from Samsung right now
is the note for its great phone and I do
like big phones but I don't know that I
want to go as huge as you know I like
big phones that I cannot from brazen
Franco how do all the media players
r-okla fire TV etc compared to an old
laptop plugged and screwed to the TV is
actually this well this is a legitimate
question allows a lot of people have
slept Mac minis onto the backs of their
televisions with a computer you're going
to get absolutely everything but my big
problem with a computer setup is that
it's a lot more power drain its can be
conservatively noisier it's also a lot
more cumbersome you know so if you
really want to watch a lot of other file
formats if you want to you know do more
like screen sharing and all that sort of
stuff then yeah that's a fine solution
but for your average consumer that I
always recommend a media streamer even
over the built-in apps and televisions
because I've yet the television company
get that right those are bed other units
he is exactly what my brother I I've not
gotten a chance to play really with LG's
webos integration I really want to try
that out and see how that works I forget
who i was talking to you and they said
it was terrible but I don't know really
yeah but I mean I maybe I dreamt adore I
don't know but we'll see you drum
something else this week that we had to
get it haha that's hey we'll just leave
that there Mercury's oh no comment from
Dominique Weber do you have a favorite
app of 2014 Oh
um well I let's first say that what why
don't we do this I well I think
Dominique probably means released in
2014 I I I say let what app have you not
been able to live without this year uh
no I gotta say like feedly cuz i use it
for work dark sky i think on the iphone
it's really great weather out never go
pretty here I've not usually oh it's
really good it's premium I think it's
like two bucks but uh two or three
dollars but it shows you the weather in
a really nice format and then I'm trying
to get it right here there you go uh and
then like so there's a world map to then
it shows all the wetter weather patterns
is really good oh that's cool it's
probably 10 hearing about here's the
world map oh that's not really nazia and
it interplays you can this is everybody
that can't see it's an animated world
map it shows the weather patterns moving
it's really nice not on android yet but
I hope so soon I I will have to look
into that way I love a good weather amp
yeah I'm really boring I love a lot of
travel apps I I would say and yes i know
some people have problems with them but
we're just going to talk about as a
service uber was just the best thing
ever when I was in Manchester this year
while there are taxis available you know
like when you're leaving a football
match of 76,000 people and you can't
find a cab you know being able to just
hit a button on my phone and of car
shows up amazing well I love the fact
that I could see where the car was and I
know Uber's not a new thing but I live
in a small town I don't get to use uber
that often it was just it was amazing
that there was one instance where i went
to a museum and i knew it was not taxi
heavy area as i walked to a side street
so i'd be easier to spot by the uber
driver pulled it up some in the BIR
turned
he was like 30 seconds down the street I
was like score didn't have to hardly
wait yeah and none of the times i summon
a new bride i took an uber from the
hotel back to the airport when i was
leaving way cheaper than a cab I've done
that run before and with the Cabot's
like 25 pounds with uber it was I think
1750 or something like that it way
cheaper so I found a cheaper too
everywhere I am yeah yeah it's just it's
amazing uh oh good question here from
Sean the man 34 from something we
haven't thought about for weeks amazon
echo why is it still available yet I
requested an invite to order one on day
one and yet to receive an invitation to
order see I request a day one no invite
yet yep I saw somebody at cnet reviewed
it and had tweeted that ZDNet I'm sorry
that he had bought it you know through
the invite system which is interesting
so I guess some people are getting him
but the you know that comes back to our
theory I was saying I think you know it
could have been testing the waters
before you know releasing this major
product that's a bomb which you know the
fire phone was which by the way is now a
1 99 unlocked at about one did you ever
hear yeah i got it at 199 with a free
year of amazon prime i was like done
yeah that's right so it's really 99
bucks sorry it's really 99 bucks and my
galaxy mega was acting up my beloved
galaxy mega was acting up in the UK it
kept rebooting every day like three to
four times per day so yeah I was like a
hundred nine bucks with a free year of
amazon prime that's a little too good to
pass up for you like it is 200 our phone
I've unboxed it I have not even just in
case yeah I I'm going to try it out soon
I just haven't had a chance yeah but uh
ya know it's interesting
another good question from Sean the man
34g you guys cover connected home
products for CES really want things in
my house like Hugh and nest but for less
money every single year I say guys if we
have the time let's get to connected
home products we've not had the manpower
in years past I am really really hopeful
that this year we're going to get two
connected home products I've got two
extra writers this year or so I'm cross
at every body part that we're going to
get two connected home products this
year so it's definitely on the table
it's just a matter of time and resources
and hopefully there's some new brands
there it's I think it would be nice for
them to be and in the past they've been
there especially ones that like you know
would monitor your whole power
consumption stuff like that before this
is way back before nest so I mean it's
it's the place where they could make
debuts and Honeywell's over he's always
there so yeah I you know as we hear the
term more and more the you know the
Internet of Things you know I I think
that's that probably is one trend we're
going to see a lot of this year I I
expect to see it i was joking with
somebody their day i would give a body
part for a washing machine that could
ping my phone and tell me the loads done
I think LG makes that don't they they do
it's it's horribly expensive right now
the I I know this is a first world
problem hashtag first world problem
folks my washer and dryer in the
basement I'm hardly ever in the basement
so I try to figure out you know okay the
cycle should take this long so I don't
go down I hate it when I go down the
base when I'm like great you know yep
stand there for three minutes for the
cycle so much so a washing machine that
could go ping my iphone and go hey I'm
done done and also somebody to finally
come up with a washer and dryer that
have the exact same length of cycle
yeah seriously depending i think i know
i know it's always like the dryers like
23 minutes longer than the washer you're
like I can't get this coordinated you
know it would be a really easy invention
some kind of like beacon that he just
put on your washer did like senses
vibration and then when it's done it
would ping your phone and you don't have
to buy a whole new watch a guy did that
he hacked his his washer to tweet him on
it stopped but it was way above my
experience yeah like how you do that
yeah exactly well I cannot believe it
but has been 45 minutes already I'm
looking real quick to see if there's
anything that we absolutely must address
will we pick a favorite smartphone of
the year yes we are we just started
working on that yesterday will be an
apple keynote before the apple watcher
will it just be released I would say
there probably will be a keynote
hopefully I mean I don't know they get
it shows that easy right again yeah
