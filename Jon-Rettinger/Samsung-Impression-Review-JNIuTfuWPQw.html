review for you of the samsung impression
for 18 g wireless this phone will run
you at least as of this filming 199
after a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate and
the obligatory two-year contract so
before i get into my review let me give
you some pros and cons of device first
let's go over the pros and the biggest
probe the samsung impression is it's
gorgeous 3.2 inch am OLEDs play and
that's just fancy talk for a really
gorgeous low-power non back light
display and really does work as
advertised it's bright its vibrant and
really just sips power because doesn't
doesn't use a backlight you really can
get that full backlit effect without the
unfortunate battery drain that that you
should collegiately comes with it so
please i'm going to keep in mind this
phone also features a full on screen
qwerty keyboard as well as a full slide
out qwerty keyboard which makes text
input very nice and easy it also has a
built-in proximity sensor so when you
hold it up to your head it'll sense that
it's up to your head and it won't won't
dial random people you won't call an
ex-girlfriend or whatever you're not
going to do anything when it's up to
your face it also has a very responsive
accelerometer so you can type or view
web pages in landscape mode and taking
over web pages it also has a relatively
rudimentary HTML browser you can't view
pages in HTML format but there's a lot
of finger scrolling through it and as
your finger scrolling you will be using
a resistive touchscreen meaning it makes
its point of contact using two layers of
films so when you push down on that it
registers where the contacts coming from
and that's how it registers a touch as
opposed to a capacitive touch screen
like those found on the iPhone or the
t-mobile g1 for comparison purposes most
windows mobile touchscreen phones
actually all windows mobile touchscreen
phones use resistive you can get a sense
of what those look like you've ever
played with a windows mobile phone I'm
not the biggest banner resistive but it
does actually work relatively well on
this device this uses a TouchWiz
interface that I've reviewed a few times
then that Samsung
devices use this a row of wickets along
the side unlock the phone enjoy what
that looks like uses a row of widgets
across the side that you can customize
and drag on to the home screen actually
is a very nice interface and as you're
touching these widgets and dragging them
along you're taking advantage of haptic
feedback meaning it has a little bit of
vibration as you're touching different
buttons generally I find app√©tit
feedback to be quite annoying in the
case of the Samsung in these TouchWiz
devices actually invited to be a benefit
really enhances the experience you
really know that you've pushed something
as opposed to just touching a screen and
waiting to see what happens so this is a
phone and as the phone first and
foremost has to make good phone calls
I'm happy to report that it certainly
does that in spades reception of mind
was fantastic and so is called quality
on the other ends people reported know
what Noah is no buzzing they could
hardly tell i was on a cell phone so
kudos to samsung at AT&amp;amp;T for that
obviously your signal strength is going
to vary where you're at where I am I get
full bars of 3g even when a drop down to
edge on occasion reception was still
very strong something to keep in mind
and as I just said this is a full 3g
enabled device as well as quad band edge
for global roaming not so bad battery
life on this really is strong it's not
doesn't have the biggest battery but the
display which generally is a big battery
drain isn't the case anymore so I was
able to get two days piece of cake
probably could have gone three days but
i charged it what typical use now we're
two of talk time some text messaging i
didn't sent an email I look from web
pages nothing terribly intensive but
just general usage you won't have any
trouble with it the keyboard on the
device the actual physical keyboard
rather it's actually very nice easy to
use does have a lot of tactile field
feedback and you can push the buttons
and you really know that you've put
something as with most slide out
keyboards an unfortunate side effect is
the top row of key that generally hard
to express what your fingers because
you're always hitting the top it's not
bad but it is something to keep in mind
i was able to get used to this keyboard
very very very quickly and i think you
will too it's also as I mentioned
earlier has an on-screen keyboard and
I've been a big fan the same
on screen keyboards I think they're
probably third best to the iphone g1's
and that's actually really big
compliments I've been a fan of the
iphone in the g1's on-screen keyboard
I'm speaking about the cupcake built by
the way of the g1 something I had a
chance to play around with fortunately
and as it comes out you guys will see
it's fantastic and the Samsung interface
you know really takes advantage of that
and it does a great job of it don't be
something to keep in mind now some of
the cons of device this is going to run
you 199 and that 199 price point is
exactly the same as a gigabyte iphone so
I'm not really sure who samsung is
targeting with this it's not a
smartphone per se oh they do get some
smartphone desk features it kind of
straddle a line you get calendar where
you can add calendar reminders and set
alerts and such you get an email client
butta job of base so you're not going to
get HTML email you're not going to get
set reminders you have to open the
application open the email do a sudden
receive and wait and then close it back
up again and if you want to check
another email after you've exited you
have to go back into email application
wait for it to load up and then go you
can't easily sync with your outlook or
entourage I can go to hook up to an
exchange server so you really don't get
the full smartphone features that you
will get with a blackberry and iphone
symbian or other smartphone OS is like
windows mobile but you do get some of
those sort of smartphone features but
the same price point as the iphone I'd
be hard-pressed to find someone who
would pick this up instead of the iphone
if say the $30 limited data plan for the
iphone is a problem for you then
something like this would be great or if
you're just looking for a feature phone
you don't really care about full
internet you don't really care about the
email you just want something that looks
good that you can text on and that you
can fit in your pocket then the
impression probably is for you and is a
relative value of 199 even though there
are other phones sort of at that price
point so one of the other big gripes
have with the device this is actually a
really big negative is the lock button
unlock the phone you have to hold this
button on the side and is so far inlaid
that it's extremely
to push I'm going to zoom in and show
you guys what that looks like here so
you can get a sense of kind of difficult
it actually is so zoom in on my big
space right there you've got that on
lock button you have to really kind of
push it almost with your fingernail to
hold it in as I'm doing it right now I'm
still not activating it there we go on
the second try I finally got it to work
so it's definitely something to keep in
mind and it's gonna take a lot of
getting used to it took me quite a
little bit to really get a chance to use
it correctly and even then I still
wasn't that accurate with it so it
definitely is a little bit of a negative
overall I came away very impressed with
the phone well I'm not not say fair to
compare with other devices in 18th he's
line up on its own merits it does stand
very strong it's got a great keyboard
it's got a decent internet browser you
can do everything that you want to do
mms take advantage of the three
megapixel camera on the back you can
record video it's got a rudimentary mp3
player it can play youtube videos so it
does do a lot of very cool things that
are quickly becoming essential so
definitely something that you might want
to look at as you're walking to your
local AT&amp;amp;T store anyway guys if I have
to give this a phone a kind of a
one-to-five scale I give it a really
solid three and three-quarters it's just
kind of missing out on a few key
features and that button on the side is
a big negative but if you have small
fingers and won't be a concern for you
guys for exclusive content sure to
follow me on twitter twitter.com / john
for lakers and i will see you guys in
the next video hope you enjoyed bye bye
