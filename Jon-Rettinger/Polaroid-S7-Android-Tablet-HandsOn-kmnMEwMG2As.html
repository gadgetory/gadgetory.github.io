their booth at CES 2013 how's it going
guys I'm Aaron Baker from TechnoBuffalo
we're covering the latest and greatest
in technology at CES 2013 in Las Vegas
Nevada day one of the show for being
open and here's another mobile right
tablet 7.0 inch mobile internet tablet
also known as the s7 this isn't it
finished of tablets but really nice
design with the read I happen to like it
quite a bit I'm a sucker for dark red
that's always been one of my favorite
colors and you can see the Pollard logo
that my girlfriend will tell you blue is
actually my favorite color even though
green is my real favorite color she says
I buy a lot of blue shirts but you know
what that's beside the point
let's talk about specs on this tablet
I've got a 1.6 gigahertz dual-core
cortex a9 CPU in this device it you've
got these shortcuts which I've covered
in some of the other boring videos I
really like this because I think this
opens up a new demographic for these
tablets if you get your hands on one not
only are they relatively inexpensive and
comparison to the competition HTC and
their one tablet Apple Samsung etc price
points good and things like this really
will make these tablets a build a first
time tablet owners stock Android 4.1
configuration here jellybean out of the
box you got Wi-Fi connectivity one
gigabyte of ram 1024 by 600 pixels on
the screen eight gigabytes of internal
memory SD card slot lithium ion battery
the usual when it comes to this but you
can see of course your settings here
nothing too exciting in terms of the
look and feel no rapollo roi
customizations the actual interface
itself you've got two standalone
dedicated menu button in addition to
your typical back home and recent
application buttons on android 4.1
you clean a good-looking tablet you got
a front-facing camera as well like I
said 0.3 megapixels on the front pacer 2
megapixels on the rear face err keep it
locked on TechnoBuffalo for continuing
coverage of CES 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada
