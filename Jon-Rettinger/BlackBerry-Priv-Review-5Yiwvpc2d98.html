to do force you to look at your
successes your failures what worked what
didn't work and when your backs against
the wall to make changes the blackberry
probe is answering some questions that
I'm not showing people are still asking
this blackberry of any juice left in
their metaphorical berry the pairing of
Google's OS and blackberry hardware
seems like a match made in heaven
what is it a dream to have any more
metaphors left I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo this is my very dramatic
review of the blackberry print at the
end of this review I'm answering the
question would I buy this and more
importantly should you thought it a bit
of different experiences of blackberry
print than I did I definitely encourage
you to hit the link down below and check
out the written article it'll also have
more cameras galleries and kind of go
into more detail about what I'm going to
talk about he had some software's which
a lot of people are talking about
turns out he's running an earlier build
than what blackberry sent us for view
models and I had none of those problems
at all so if you're worried about the
print padding some software bugs I
wouldn't worry too much about it they
can be fixed over the air and in fact in
my model they all work as I do with all
my reviews that begin with a disclaimer
I use this as my daily driver for seven
days and in conjunction with another
phone for three days so ten days total
Tata zoltan's who did the written
portion used his for seven days he is an
ATT brand new model
mine was unlocked - both were tested
with AT&amp;amp;T service when I first took the
probe out of the box I was really
impressed nine point four millimeters my
modern smartphone standards might sound
on the chunkier side it feels really
slim in the hand it might be due to the
curved edge screen the phone screams
premium from the nice soft touch back to
the beautiful qHD screen everything
about this phone feels nice and in fact
I would you give this phone to a
stranger probably won't even know it's
got a little secret there's a full
QWERTY keyboard under there and I was
kind of excited about it
the more I use the phone the less
actually I use the keyboards type and
where is it just to stroll the keys are
all touch n sitive use it almost like a
trackpad and scroll up and down are
websites that have you to put your
finger actually on the screen and cover
text keep to be really nice
the bottom of this thing is almost all
sticker girls we probably expect like I
did it to be really loud it is not if
you're lying to keep your phone for
meetings or in the car
and be a little bit so point in here
just looking at the software this phone
you might think you're running a Nexus
device it looks like stock Android it's
based on 5.1.1 the BlackBerry is said
and assured us that marshmallow will be
coming pretty students 2016 we covered a
lot more on the software tweaks in our
top 5 things to know about the
BlackBerry perfect if you want to watch
that link right here but things we
didn't talk about the really nice
additions things like pop-up widgets
things like and redesign multitasking
window and it's blackberry it's got to
be secure blackberry included there DTEC
software and there are other
applications that do something similar
but give you a score let you know how
secure devices let you know if after
using your location so if you find a
random game that's maybe tracking where
you're at you might want to delete it or
at least change permissions can't really
talk about software on the block brave
wrote about mentioning a little bit of
hardware and that's a curve display so I
pin from the right or the left black
grey lets you choose is your really
useful interactive set of icons want to
check out your calendar maybe add a new
one you can do that check out your
blackberry hub really quickly do that to
maybe up to your to-do list again get
what I'm saying you can do that as well
or just access your quick dials black
way gives you options it really makes
that curved screen surprisingly useful
the AMOLED screen on the blackberry
pretty good 5.4 inches in qHD there's
plenty of pixels to show all of your
content colors look rich and bright
blacks look really black Todd had some
issues though with it not being bright
enough but for me 8 to 10 brightness
that was absolutely funny it's not the
best screen on the market that Krantz to
go to Samsung but it's definitely one of
the better screens to despite the phone
getting uncomfortably worn matter what I
did a bit especially while charging
battery life was really good I was able
to get through a full day in about 40 50
percent battery life keeping the
brightness around 780 success I was like
1080 guys want to a performance I never
had a single slow and got multitask like
a dream going through pages with fast no
performance issues at all but the best
camera is always one you have on au inch
it desire your phones always in your
pocket black we set up the camera game
with the prism so again if you want to
see camera samples spilling down below
and check out Todd's written review but
boils down to this pretty good camera if
you're in low-light they're going to be
passable if you're outdoors the great
sunlight if you're going to look great
colors going to look true to form the
cameras definitely upper echelon of
sensors that we've tested Dockery
disappointed with the sensor on the
blackberry every review I do I try
answer the question would I buy this the
answer I think should be pretty clear
yeah I would buy this this is a tough
device to review the one's a bit
polarizing for a lot of people every
phone tablet that I go in to look at I
try and leave all baggage aside any
experience I've had a blackberry in the
past doesn't count for this review this
phone stands on its own merit and on its
own merits is a modern Android phone the
beautiful screen a great camera a
slide-out keyboard is also a trackpad
curry solid build quality and expandable
storage it offers a lot even for the
already expensive price for about 700
bucks looking for a moment's given do
all of those things give you a close
Nexus experience and also give you added
security that really only Blackberry can
do right now think the probe is a really
solid by foe do you guys think you still
asking the question would you still want
Android on a blackberry update your
thoughts on even the comments down below
and again check out the written review
that Tadros get more than tea on
anything I talked about until next time
I'm John register TechnoBuffalo I will
look whistling to distance I'll see you
guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
