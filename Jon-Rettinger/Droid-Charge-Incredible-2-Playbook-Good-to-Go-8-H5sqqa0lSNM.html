week away we're back we're ready we're
good to go I'm Noah Kravitz from
TechnoBuffalo and I'm James kinder from
ZDNet mobile news and I didn't go
anywhere you didn't go anywhere it was
all on me I was on the road last week so
we took took the week off and you know
what there are a couple people out there
who said hey what's up we missed you you
coming back this week so yeah I heard it
to the dealer looking for good stuff did
you uh did you get the mass flood of
gadgets over the past week or so that I
for John deal with on his own I probably
I've been flooded I've had both the ups
and the FedEx guy here repeatedly in the
last week so I so lots to talk about I
am this is I feel I feel like I'm left
out this is all I have I haven't even
had time to open it up yet today the
droid incredible 2 ah you'll like it
what I so there's that this is a very
nice phone it really is there's what
else there's the droid charge the the
playbooks have been out for a little
while after a chore pick pick one tell
me tell me about something what are you
what are you hot on well the doy droid
charge I mean this this arrived here
yesterday right in the middle of the big
verizon 4g outage right so this was
basically a paperweight yesterday
because there was no network could
connect to and it didn't it didn't
automatically down great couldn't pick
up 3g right well that's some testing
I've done with four different verizon 4g
devices on finding very few if any of
them will do that properly i I don't
know verizon needs to really step up and
either owned up to what was going on if
it was more serious than they said right
because nothing was downgrading reliably
yeah I had the same thing I was trying
to use I was at a conference all day
yesterday I was trying to use the 4g
modem with my laptop and it could not it
sort of weary us we USU a modem you have
the pantech see that's the first one
that I
heard of that was non-wireless that had
that problem so I'm thinking something
about their networks horn identifying
themselves properly yea networks because
I heard a lot of people say you know
I've got 3g equipment out the wazoo and
if some of it said I see it but I can't
get there that's what I always have any
other so I can't see it either right
yeah yeah but anyway detroit charged
what would made this such a a nice phone
is because you know it's the second
phone from verizon for the 4g for the 4g
for the 4g network but what was more
impressive about it to me is because i
like the 4.3 inch screen the big
displays and phones and this is the
first one from Samsung right right and
it's the super amo LED plus display
right I tell you this is probably the
best screen on any phone I've ever seen
young the iphone 4i I would believe it I
believe it I I got to see the galaxy s2
in ya bein and then I remember being
really impressive display and that I
actually saw yesterday's samsung had a
little simple mobile head a little stand
it at this app nation conference I was
that he and when I went by they had an
s2 but it wasn't charged it was first
thing in the morning but they had the
galaxy players to four and five and I
was looking at the five and that one's
not even the super amoled plus it's just
it's an LCD display but even that
they're making some really nice displays
though all their screens are nice but
this display this is the first super amo
LED plus display I've seen this big 4.3
yeah it's like brilliant I mean it's
it's really awesome and what I'm finding
so far I mean I've only had it for about
a day and a half now is that the display
doesn't hit the battery that hard see
that's a that's a big that is that's it
I think that's a big deal for somebody
on it and then of course the 4g we
already know each
batteries for lunch this one's actually
doing pretty good in my testing so far
today so we'll just have to see it this
phone is so you know some people don't
like the the galaxy the same some phones
because they're plastic he dado you're
right and granted it doesn't feel
anywhere near as solid as the droid
incredible 2 uh-huh it's but because of
that plastic construction it is much
much like let even on this smaller phone
yep yep so I'm not particularly hard on
my phone I mean I don't run around
bashing them in like right like I'm red
white my wife you can tear a phone up
quicker than anybody I know yeah but I
I'm impressed with this phone yeah yeah
as this phone is sweet I would say but
it's expensive you know this one is the
2009 with a contract geez that's a
hundred dollars more than any other
smartphone with a with a contract I'm
not sure why that is how much but how
library is on it this thing has got well
that may have something to do with it
the way it it's verizon is including a
32 gigabyte microSD card card oh ok ok
so that's that's i mean that's that's i
stumble what what everybody else has the
right and that's that's iphone 32 gig
pricing right 299 yeah yeah so and we i
should also point out this was actually
supposed to go live or be released today
right right verizon is actually
confirmed to me that they delayed the
launch this and they won't admit it but
it's because the 4g network was down I
mean they were right now like I said
yesterday while when the network was
down I couldn't even get 3g connection
so it's like right right how are you
gonna sell somebody a
three-hundred-dollar with a contract in
Ekta connect to anything you know I can
hear that the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone jokes lining
up in the back of my head already yeah
but I'll tell you what I was wrong
making the high spot that's the
punchline James
yeah that's right i should point out
that verizon did confirm to me also that
when this does go why that mobile
hotspot is going to be free for a while
like it was on oh no a thunder Brett Rae
and so I actually used that because I
mean 4g is we know we talked out on past
shows is just an incredible yeah way
into it when it's working apparently
well they only yesterday was the only
time you know it since they want right
right right for me I mean yeah I
actually have a mobile hotspot of my own
and I use it all the time and this was
great i was seeing 22 megabytes per
second down and over 6 megabytes per
second up Wow yeah as a hotspot right
ready running other laptops out ain't
great wow that's awesome you had you
happen to connect blackberry playbook to
it over tell ya ya ya so what sure I
have not actually you know John has John
has our playbook loner yeah amidst a ton
of other tablets III got the g slate and
then i hit the road and i FedExed end
the g slate and he was just in tablet
heaven last week but yeah yeah when I
was playbook well I'll tell you I didn't
like it before it cain't at all I
thought this thing was probably the one
of the biggest follies we were going to
see in a long time right but I have to
admit I really impressed with a hardware
I mean rim has made a solid piece of kit
here and i'm also very impressed with
the user interface you know we talked on
past show now critical that is on a
tablet yep and i think they've done a
really good job fast i mean they
borrowed some of the best parts of webos
they just found out stole it it's it's
in here and so I mean more power to them
i mean that's makes what makes the
interface so good I
right right right drum of course no apps
yeah so they're like a lot of negative
reviews you know saying it's just it's
not finished its it and those are all
apps pretty much I'll tell you I enjoy
this and find this to be this is going
to create a big flap I find this to be a
much better tablet than the motorola
xoom honeycomb just didn't float my boat
at all and this if this had any apps at
all this thing would be killer I really
I really believe that right I so that's
a 7 inch screen right seven ice cream
it's that I like 7-inch tablets I used
to galaxy tab yeah I do too I am I
updated the nookcolor this week to it
sort of i'm still real high on that but
as a consumer product you know more than
that's a nice tablet and they just got
an update yeah you bite it I have yeah
how does it work with that ah it allows
me to be just as bad at angry birds as I
am on any other platform so you know
that's that's that's just you know it
works pretty well it's um a little
little peek at james's blog there the i
think the webcam couldn't deal with the
present browser is awesome is it they
nailed the browser is probably the best
mobile browser I've used really yeah why
because it anals virtually every site
right doesn't matter what kind of you
know whether what kind of JavaScript
it's God or what kind of flash it's got
this thing is just like a desktop
browser right right and and that's one
thing that I kind of took took you know
a lot of the reviewers have said well
with no native email app you can't do
email on it that's not true i mean i do
right you desktop gmail right fine right
oops whoa oh no it's at the rim CEO oh
man he's ticked again bae anyway that's
i am pretty impressed with the hardware
i just would like to see some better
software yeah it affect yeah the yet
answer real quick the the nut color
update is uh you know it's not what i
really like about it is the user
interface is still very clean very
simple to use the email app is you know
it's basically a slaw it looks a lot
like you know on and it's not the native
android app but it looks a lot like it
but in again a very sort of clean
mannered does HTML email and whatnot and
the browser you know it's it's fine and
and for the audience that you know for
250 tablet for an e-reader that can now
do some extra stuff you know the browser
works well enough it supports flash
it'll handle flash it's not you know up
playing playing low bandwidth games at
my friend Doug's website perfect
watching videos on espn.com the ones
that weren't optimized for mobile you
know look like stuttery slideshows but
that's kind of you know that that's not
limited to just that that device but but
what I like about it I actually really
like that they are ah barnes and nobles
app store for nook you have to follow
their guidelines to optimize the app for
the device I think that's very smart on
their part and you know that the
audience the consumer is looking at that
tablet and people who have it are not to
generalize but I don't think they're the
kind of people who are going to even bat
an eyelash eyelash thinking about what
version of Android do I have what are
the specs of my device can this support
it or not they just want things that are
made what custom rom can I lashawn right
yeah but I think yeah I think you you
hit it very appropriately it is an
e-reader that does tablet stuff right
and that makes I think it's very good at
that ya know you too and and same year
that 7 inch size I really like
yeah well I'm guessing we are here at
time running over already but they go we
missed a week we had to make up some
ground I guess exactly so droid charge
big thumbs up incredible two thumbs up
no no 4g on that one but it's a world
phone no but that's important a lot of
people because they're not in 4G areas
so right i would highly recommend this
for those guys and playbook sounds like
playbook it's a qualified guns up i
would buy one now but I'm gonna really
seriously watch them down the room got
you all right well next week who knows I
who knows what good is the fedex and UPS
