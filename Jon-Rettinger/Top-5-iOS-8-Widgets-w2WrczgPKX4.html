to you by godaddy what's going on guys
the mark on Sanger from TechnoBuffalo
and one of the best new features of iOS
8 is the ability to add widgets in
Notification Center we're here to show
you guys our top 5 Notification Center
widgets in no particular order so let's
go ahead and jump into the video the
first one on our list is SportsCenter I
like to keep up with my favorite sports
team hashtag DC rising but sometimes I
don't want notifications popping up on
my iPhone every minute for score updates
and or injury reports I can turn off
notifications for the app and just
simply swipe down from my lock screen or
home screen and check out the scores
that way if I ever need more of an in
depth look at scores or highlights i can
always launch a Sports Center out the
sports center widget only allows for two
teams to be displayed at once and if you
happen to have more than two teams
selected as your favorite team then it
will constantly rotate every five
seconds it'll display your team score by
the minute and your team's upcoming game
schedule if you're a sports fanatic ESPN
Sports Center is an awesome app it's
available via the app store for free so
make sure to go check that out the next
one on my list is a pretty special one
it's like one of those retro gaming
cartridges back in a day where you
bought one game and there's like five
games in a cartridge that's basically
what this next app is which is a free
all in one widget for your notification
center and it includes a bunch of handy
widgets you can add a calculator a
calendar currency converter a photo
frame and the ability to check the time
zones now for 99 cents you can unlock
three more widgets battery widget memory
and disk network monitor and more of the
premium features for the standard
widgets now whether you buy this premium
version or not which is a well worth it
look if you don't like the stock iOS
weather app and want something new to
look at the community powered weather
app weather underground has a pretty
cool Notification Center widget that
provides a lot of helpful information
it'll show your current location the
date the time and current temperature
the highs and lows for today and a
timeline that shows the temperature in
three hour intervals if for example
there were weather warnings around the
area you'll see the hazard icon in your
notification center as well and that
will directly straight to the app and
give you all the
information you need there aren't any
settings to customize unfortunately but
the app is free and it's probably one of
the best weather apps and widgets for
iOS is of now let's take a quick break
from this video and thank our friends
over at GoDaddy it's go time and go
daddy's here to help you kick butt on
lines start your website today with just
a dollar 99.com and visit godaddy.com
and enter the promo code 199 techno to
get your calm for just a dollar
ninety-nine cents some limitations apply
see website for details now if you've
ever used Evernote the productivity app
now supports Notification Center widgets
by letting you create new notes
reminders and listen a single tap
through the Notification Center Evernote
can display five buttons in the today
view and it'll let you create a text
note a reminder a checklist or notes
with photos from the camera or your
library it's very basic but handy and I
use it every now and then if I need to
quickly drop down text notes or photo
notes and there's not a whole lot to
this widget other than showing your
recent notes and the five different
buttons but if you rely on using
Evernote using the widget could save you
some time when writing notes on the go
and everything actually syncs
automatically so when you're using
Evernote on another device or a computer
you'll see your notes automatically in
your account now the last one is quick
tap there was a pretty awesome widget
app called launcher which was pulled by
apple recently and was looking for an
alternative than found quick tap the
widget essentially gives you one tap
access to your contacts which means
you'll be able to call a friend email or
FaceTime them play tracks from your
music library get directions home using
Apple maps or google maps and the best
thing about it is it's free you beba dad
three contacts three music tracks three
apps and if you want to add more you can
pay two dollars to get the premium
edition the ability to quickly call or
email someone by just tapping a button
in Notification Center is a pretty nifty
idea and I'm glad to see something like
this make its way onto iOS anyways
that's it for this video guys if you
have any other app suggestions or want
to see anything else in particular just
