unboxing for you of the new Samsung
mythic for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless this foam is
gonna run you $1.99 after a $50 mail-in
rebate it is a 3g full touchscreen phone
from Samsung running their TouchWiz
interface that we've seen in the past
the impression and a few other Samsung
devices let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing and I was also I'll tell you
about it as we go so it's got a camera
of course 3.2 megapixels with a three
time zoom it's got your music players
supposed to a full HTML browser it also
has a mobile TV let's go ahead and of
course use the obligatory big ol knife
for this and I'm also doing this
unboxing on a live Ustream show so close
you guys that are watching this later
thank you for tuning in let's go ahead
and cut this open and I believe this
follower was just released so it's still
relatively new see where we go go ahead
and rip open the package nothing else
inside so here we have the Samsung
mythic looks like the Box got a little
dinged up in transit so your typical
AT&amp;amp;T box just with the tray down below
you've got a picture of the mythic on
the front how much it looks to be a
pretty slick device I'm a fan of the
TouchWiz interface it's a widget based
so you can actually pick these widgets
from the side and drag them off to the
home screen I'll show you what that
looks like in a later video well it's
got TV it's got your three megapixel
camera believe that icon is for the
a-list and of course it's got email and
a lesser sort of your att's version of
my faves with t-mobile's been doing some
more about the device through megapixel
camera actually stands for social
networking it's a social networking
phone email and I am let's go ahead and
dig in its take out the tray and see
what we got inside push the box off to
the side we've got your Quick Start
Guide which I don't know anybody who
looks at these things but if you're the
kind of person that does there you go
seeing is believing
all right I've got a disc for your
disking needs and here we've got the
device itself
go ahead and push it off the side for
just one minute we'll see what else we
get in the box
we've got your Samsung 2 USB cable and
look at this it's the first time Samsung
actually hasn't used a proprietary
charging port it appears to be micro USB
nope that's proprietary not micro USB
that was a micro USB cheese so we've got
your your wall charger and that's really
all you're gonna get in the box let's
take a look at the phone it's got a nice
feel to it this one looks sick it's got
sort of a reddish crimson look on the
back so let's take a look at the phone
and see we have we've got what appears
to be an optical d-pad we've got a I
soon will be your sending end buttons on
the front I'm gonna peel off this
plastic - and we'll keep doing our tour
of the device I will do that in a minute
a little hard to get off you've got your
volume rocker up and down on the left
hand side of the phone on the right
looks like you've got your a camera
button the zoom button and you've got a
lock button as well let's power this
thing on and see what the OS looks like
especially if it's got a SIM card in
there I assume that we hold down the
power button we do on top you've got a
3.5 millimeter headset jack and looks
like your charging port on the top which
despite my previous assertions actually
is microUSB so that's quite nice I'm
gonna see if we can get this plastic off
the front there you don't see we get
this satisfying whooshing noise we did
get the whooshing noise so I'll zoom in
a little bit you guys can check out the
device and while that's loading I'll do
a comparisons for you have some other
devices that you might be familiar with
here is the iPhone 3GS
as far as size comparison goes here is
also the Motorola Droid for Verizon
Wireless get sort of a sense on how big
the screen is here on the mythic it does
have haptic feedback and this feel to be
very responsive as well it is a
resistive touchscreen unlike these two
devices so
the touch is made by a pushing down of
two layers of film as opposed to a
transfer of electrons so I'll push this
off to the side and take a quick gander
through so you've got your menu options
this looks to be very reminiscent of
other Samsung touchscreen phones but it
is responsive and you know definitely
useful it does not have a slide-out
QWERTY keyboard that is done via an
on-screen keyboard so guys I'll be doing
a few more videos on device so I'll walk
you through the operating system as I've
done in the past in case there is a
interest and definitely I'll be doing a
full review as well so for exclusive
