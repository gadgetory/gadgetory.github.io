lupine office like what I've done with
the place moving on are you down with
OMD ask yourself that one question are
you down with OMD stay tuned to find out
if I'm down with OMD
hi everyone this is the olympus om-d
e-m1 so excited about this camera it
warrants a little history lesson the
year 2012 marks the 40th anniversary of
the introduction of the om family the OM
one was the first member back in 1972 I
actually shot with an om and one a
decade ago in high school so with that
said the new om de my biz the leader of
the new digital OM revolution instead of
a mirror box in a film spool we now have
a brand new 16 megapixel sensor of the
micro 4/3 persuasion in addition the
camera is spackled with all types of new
technology but the big question is can
the OM d trump Olympus's pen cameras
well without waiting any further let's
start out with design the Olympus om-d
e-m1 a static reasons look at it stacked
up next to my om 1 n from 10 feet away
these cameras are almost identical so 10
rounds of applause go to Olympus for
retaining the om s aesthetic heritage
but upon closer examination you'll find
that these cameras are very different
we'll start with the OM de m
LCD screen in the back its 610 thousand
pixels and it's also a touchscreen so
there are various operations that could
be performed with this camera such as
using the live guide in auto mode
swiping and zooming in playback mode and
selecting options in the super control
panel but the more thrilling news in the
monitor Department is the fact that the
om de mi
has a 1.4 million pixel electronic
viewfinder with a 120 frame per second
for a fresh rate the viewfinder is also
intelligent with an eye sensor so when
you go to place the camera up to your
eye it transitions to the viewfinder
from the LCD screen and that is awesome
another thing about the new om de
emphatically with of course all of
Olympus's new micro four-thirds lenses
including the 12 to 50 millimeter easy
lens easy stands for electronic zoom
this lens actually has an electronic
motor built in and
seamlessly and silently you can also
switch to manual mode and there's a
designated macro mode as well I was a
little skeptical of the electronic zoom
at first but after using it I couldn't
stop
now the OM de my excess report up top as
well as a hot shoe this hosted the
included flash but it also hosted
Olympus's microphone that they offer as
an accessory now unfortunately in the
sound Department this camera lacks mic
and headphone jacks so if you're serious
about video that's gonna be something to
factor in on the plus side the battery
pack was larger than I expected and gave
me great life throughout the day one
note about the design is that the
buttons are fairly squishy it took a
while for me to get acclimated to them
but they're very responsive and they did
the job one of my favorite things about
the om-d e-m1 command dial duo Olympus
even salvaged some real estate by
wrapping one of them around the shutter
button but the most glorious thing about
the OM de-emphasize instant photography
street-cred
now as far as features and technologies
Olympus took out the giant butter knife
and slathered this thing from lens to
LCD screen for a manual mode we have a
shutter speed that goes from 60 seconds
all the way up to one for thousands of a
second I love that for long exposure
shooting
although the easy lens that I shot with
had a minimum F 3.5 aperture I was able
to stop it all the way down to an f-22
and thanks to the new sensor we had an
ISO range of 200 220 5600 so that's
currently the highest cap on one of
Olympus's Micro Four Thirds cameras some
advanced features that you'll find in
the DSLR market there's a live histogram
a vertical and horizontal level meter
all kinds of delicious bracketing like
Auto exposure white balance focal length
ISO and even art filters bracketing we
could do multiple exposure shooting we
could shoot at different aspect ratios
but one of the biggest introductions was
the shadow highlight grid I can actually
adjust the shadows and the highlights
natively in the camera which was
basically adjusting the dynamic range on
the fly
the OM de my false oh let me adjust
gradation saturation sharpness contrast
and other image parameters now Olympus
claims the Omni
m5 has the fastest autofocus in the
world I would have to agree with that
it is Roadrunner fast there's also a new
five axis image stabilization system and
I found it to perform very well in image
and video mode as far as continuous
shooting we could shoot at nine frames
per second at full resolution and what
would an Olympus camera be without the
plethora of art modes the om de mo that
could be bracketed all at once and I
blame this camera and Olympus for
turning me into a dramatic tone junkie
video mode also has a new feature
it's called multi echo and what that
does is blur the framerate a little bit
which makes it look like an unsolved
mysteries reenactment scene I loved the
fact that I could shoot PASM in video
mode and the continuous auto focus was
exceptionally quick and silent in video
mode now of course the Olympus om-d e-m1
of different scene modes however a
panorama sweep mode was missing from the
fold and you think that a camera with so
much technology would have one now
lastly if you shoot an intelligent auto
mode we have live guide that's a mode
for beginners and lets you adjust the
shutter speed the contrast the sharpness
things like that only it doesn't buy a
set of easy sliders so you don't have to
fool with all the manual controls the
great thing about the OM de my is that
paired with the touchscreen it works
flawlessly also about the touch screen
the sensitivity on this baby is amazing
it rivals my iPhones the menu system is
also highly responsive although I found
that some options got buried down in the
deep abyss at times but with all of the
different customization available on
this camera like the two function
buttons it was really easy to walk my
way around this camera in no time now
let's talk image quality the Olympus
om-d e-m1 4/3 ilk that means the sensor
is slightly smaller than an aps-c size
sensor found on a mid-range DSLR when it
came to still picture quality the
Olympus om-d e-m1 of the best Micro Four
Thirds performers I've seen to date I've
always been a big fan of Olympus image
quality and their higher tier camera
and the olympus om-d e-m1 I al was a bit
tricky anything at ISO 6400 or higher
was pretty noisy so I really had to
watch the higher ISO levels especially
twelve thousand eight hundred and twenty
five thousand six hundred now video mode
was an entirely different animal this
camera records 1920 by 1080 60 I videos
in the h.264 MOV format you can also
shoot in motion JPEG however if you
value image quality and compatibility
with nonlinear editing programs avoid
motion JPEG at all costs
from the get-go the thing that bummed me
out about the video mode on the OMD m5
was the fact that it lacked a native 24p
mode that's gonna be something for more
serious videographers to consider in
addition to the lack of the mic jack and
the lack of the headphone jack for the
most part quality was very good and
bright and low light however there were
some situations where I encountered some
strange compression artifacts while the
camera was doing auto exposure autofocus
and auto white balance so for the most
part video mode was good but I think
Olympus can do some improving on the
next iteration of the OM de m so now
it's time for the buffalo call with the
olympus om-d am 5 you down with om d
this guy's down with om d Olympus has
done a fantastic job with this camera
especially since the original om ones
shoes are so big to fill the OM d EMF is
a wonderful way to celebrate the om
family's 40th birthday and I salute this
guy as the leader of the digital om
revolution if you're in the market for a
Micro Four Thirds camera do not overlook
the Olympus om-d e-m1 calm until next
time I'm Mike Pearlman and I'm down with
Oh MD
one two three Oh get your woman on the
floor gotta gotta get up get down gotta
gotta get up get down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
