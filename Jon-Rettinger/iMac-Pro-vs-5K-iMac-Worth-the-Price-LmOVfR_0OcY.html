TechnoBuffalo and I'm mark on the
creative director and we make videos
here at TechnoBuffalo for the past few
weeks we've been testing the 27-inch 5k
iMac fully loaded and I've been testing
out the eight core I'm act Pro so just
like our previous flagship videos we're
going to split this verses video into
three different categories we're gonna
check out the IMAX design the
performance and the value and at the end
of the video we'll declare a winner and
see whether the 5k iMac or the iMac Pro
is a better computer for a concentrator
so we just picked up the base model iMac
Pro a few weeks ago since we made the
switch to Final Cut Pro 10 as our main
editing software however we're still
using After Effects to create our
graphics because that's just what we're
used to before we move into any
benchmarks and test though let's just
talk design now we haven't really seen a
major design overhaul on any of the iMac
since late 2012 when they remove the
optical drives and introduced a 21 and
27 inch iMac s' so here we are in 2018
the iMac and pro variant look exactly
the same other than a space great color
and accessories it comes with out of the
box it also comes with bigger vent in
the back and you'll also get two extra
USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports a faster 10
Gigabit Ethernet port and a 1080p
FaceTime camera so up front the display
on both imax are completely identical
with the same 5120 by 2880 resolution
the same 500 nits of brightness as well
as the same p3 color gamut for that
super accurate punchy colors now I
personally love the screen on the new
IMAX it's really vibrant it's really
bright and it's just perfect for
coloring in post one thing to note
though before moving onto benchmarks
speakers are so much louder on the iMac
Pro it's not the best speakers out there
but there's more base its more full than
the regular iMac and it sounds great out
of the box
so let's move on to performance our 5k
iMac is the top-of-the-line
27-inch model it has a four point two
gigahertz Intel Core i7 processor 40
gigabytes of RAM which we upgraded
ourselves something you can't really
easily do with the iMac Pro it has the
Radeon Pro 580 graphics with a gigabytes
of vram and 500 gigabytes of SSD storage
the iMac pro is the base model with the
3.2 gigahertz intel xeon w processor
with 8 cores as 32 gigabytes of RAM
built in a one terabyte SSD and it's got
the Radeon provegan
56 with a gigabytes of vram taking a
look at Geekbench we first see that the
iMac pro finished quicker at 1 min in 10
seconds with a single core score of 4372
and a multi-core score of 30 3719 the 5k
iMac finished just a couple minutes
later with a single core score of five
thousand 675 and a multi-core score of
19,000 806 so quite a bit lower
moving on to Blackmagic speed test you
can see the iMac pro blows the 5k iMac
out of the water with its three gigabyte
write speed and two gigabytes reads beat
the 5k iMac on the other hand is just
slightly behind the pro with a 1.8
gigabyte write speed and two gigabyte
read speed now in Cinebench the 5k iMac
and an OpenGL score of 120 frames per
second and a CPU score of 900 the iMac
pro got an OpenGL score of 118 frames
per second but a CPU score of 1641 now
moving on to some more realistic tests
we moved to Final Cut Pro 10 we
downloaded a six second 8k clip from red
and tried to add color correction and
effects to see how these two handled a
cave video and it turns out the iMac pro
can playback 8k videos just fine where
the 5k iMac has some trouble playing
back the files even after its rendered
so we then duplicated this ake a file
with its effects and colors into a
1-minute file and then exported it die
macro exported it in 11 minutes and 42
seconds while the 5k iMac took a decent
amount longer at 20 minutes and 45
seconds after our test finish we tried
playing back the exported 8k clip in
QuickTime and both IMAX were unable to
playback
video in real time which surprised us
moving on to After Effects we exported a
50 second clip that we made from scratch
with multiple elements and in 4k the
iMac Pro finished exporting in 13
minutes and 50 seconds while the 5k iMac
exported the same project in 15 minutes
and 11 seconds another thing to note
with these tests is besides the time
difference there's also a noise
difference with the fans in the time
we've been using the iMac Pro not once
have we heard the fans kick on or if
they are on we can't hear them whereas
with the 5k iMac it sounds like a
plane's about to take off so clearly the
iMac pro is the more beefier system but
it's also more expensive but how much
more is it the 5k iMac we bought with
the extra 32 gigabyte kit we installed
ourselves costs roughly around 3050
dollars and our base model iMac Pro
costs five thousand dollars so we're
looking at almost $2,000 price
difference between the two systems
obviously the 5k iMac is the better bang
for the buck but if you're looking for a
computer that will grow with you for the
next three four or five years the iMac
Pro starts to look appealing sure for
most of the tests we did the difference
may not seem worth the price difference
but for the tests that are a bit more
forward-thinking like editing a que
large After Effects files the iMac Pro
handles these way better so if you're
looking for a computer that will be able
to grow with you for the next few years
the iMac pro is the way to go especially
if you run a business or rely on a
computer to make a living it's a larger
investment up front that can help you
earn more in the long run as creative
professionals if you're in the market
for a new computer to edit or create
videos for YouTube or whatever else you
want to create the base model 8 core
iMac Pro is definitely worth the extra
two thousand dollars and it's the clear
winner here that extra boost in
performance will save you some time
rendering exporting and if you need even
more power you can upgrade to a ten core
or even an 18 core computer for way more
power than what we have here while on
the 5k iMac this is the best that you
can get I'm pretty much every front you
can't go wrong with the iMac Pro anyways
