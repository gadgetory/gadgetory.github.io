heart that I'm hoping one of the latest
from Google pixel phones can fill meets
the pixel and the pixel XL big and
little brother offering almost the same
specs aside from screen resolution and
battery life on paper there's a lot to
like about the phone so the first phone
with Android 7.1 first phones to launch
with Google's brand new assistance it
bring a lot of unique things to the fold
it feels more like a complete version of
Android but all is not wonderful in the
pixel world I'm John renders and
TechnoBuffalo I don't try to answer the
question should I and more importantly
should you buy a pixel phone
the pixel is an extremely polarizing
phone we did our hands on it from the
Google that may announce that we could
see and the big issues people had was
the look of it this is not a beautiful
foam and stretch the imagination it's
not gonna win Design Awards it is an
odd-looking device or some weird design
choices in fact it looks to me like a
mid to low range phone and that really
stems from that it's got a gigantic chin
on the bottom of it I can least wrap my
head around Chin's when there's a
fingerprint sensor whole button there
but this is on screen buttons it's a
really hard to understand why that's
there and sign language continues on to
the back we've got your aluminum and
then you've got a glass part on the top
which looks almost like a sticker
doesn't all go all the way around the
side of the device seems to stop I can
forgive the back though because signal
strength on this is absolutely
unbelievable
I tested with Verizon Wireless and at my
home when I had Verizon I had to get an
external cell tower just to get any sort
of service but with the pixel XL to be
able to get three bars of LTE so looks
ugly super functional for most I think
Google assistant is gonna be the reason
a lot of folks who want to pick up it
pixel or a pixel XL she's here you can
activate it with the old okay Google
that you could on any other phone or
simple holding down of the home button
agree to grant a new animation and she's
gonna ask you how she can help and she's
going to speak very naturally and you
have contextual conversations you could
ask about an actor and say what movie
was he I'm not having to say the name
she can tell you jokes you can sing
songs she can tell you about the weather
you can ask me to show you pictures of
your dog and she can do all of that for
me right now it seems marginally better
than the already awesome Google now but
with AI learning it's only going to get
better than where people use it as a
Google assistant stands right now it's
not the biggest compelling reason to buy
a new phone in fact you can act as most
of the features we download Google's
allo application or wait until hopefully
it's someday who will system comes to
other Android devices at least natively
Google is also chatting 24/7 service
right from the phone itself and you can
access it through the settings and I
wanted to test it before films
I was greeted with a 45-minute wait now
I'm filming this review before the
phone's actually released so hopefully
by the time the phone comes out that way
time will go way down similar to Amazon
from a date
so Google sent us the 32 gigabyte
versions of the pixel and the pixel
exile is a little worried about storage
but Google is touting unlimited cloud
storage for your photos so just so you
know when you go ahead and turn on the
phone from a clean boot you're gonna
have seven point to three gigabytes
taken up which means you're going to
have a little over 29 gigabytes free of
space and after I installed all my
applications at all my photos sync over
I still had over 11 gigs of free space I
was surprised I can actually make a 32
gig phone work for me with that cloud
storage any older pictures you have on
your phone or things that weren't taken
over the past 30 60 or 90 days if any of
how you set your phone up are not gonna
be on your device when you don't have
Wi-Fi or cellular please bear that in
mind one of the things that stood out
for me with the pixel XL was a qHD
screen that's absolutely incredible in
fact I would say it even rivals the best
screen in the market which belongs to
Samsung the screen looks really nice the
blacks look really dark the colors are
bright and vibrant and even works well
in direct sunlight on the pixel front it
drops resolution down to 1080 but it
still looks equally good practice any
sort of pixels and both of course will
work the Google's VR David the other
difference is battery the pixels got a
smaller 27 70 million power whereas the
pixel XL jumped it to 3450 when I first
set up new devices I almost always said
enter devices up from scratch and I'm
downloading all of my applications
phones tend to get incredibly warm the
pixel XL didn't get very warm at all
when I set up that was great
odd thing to feel the regular pixel
didn't get warm up by the top of strange
the pixel XL since I have really good
heat distribution so it's probably not
gonna smoke and maybe explode who was
with a good portion of their keynotes
talking about the cameras on a pickle
films they're the same sensor to twelve
point three megapixel sensor both was oh
is an def 2.0 apertures and the pictures
look really nice coming out of
especially we have normal light however
we get too low light despite the AF 2.0
aperture I did notice an artifacting and
the images just looked kind of mushy but
the OIS does work great overall the
camera seems to be very impressive I
would say it's still below what Samsung
offered on the now-defunct note 7
and the galaxy s7 but it's really one of
the better cameras that I've tested I
think it's on par what we have in the
iPhone 7 the new camera UI is really
nice - it has lens blur built in a
little bit slow to process I noticed
that it didn't do a very good job boring
the entire background it looked more
like an Instagram filter than it did
something else built into the camera
itself if you want to see more camera
samples or read more about the camera as
a whole hit the link down below and
check out the written review that Todd
ableton did will go way more in depth on
the camera some of the cool things found
that Android 7.1 or app shortcuts it
work similar to 3d touch on iOS devices
I felt like could be really handy and
the best thing about it you don't have
to determine how hard you're pressing
the screen if you go ahead and hold
settings for example you can see the
shortcuts pop up but you can also move
the icon right from there gonna have to
wait for it to start dancing it's a
really nice subtle thing that Google's
goes into 7.1 that I really like there's
a lot of things select about Android 7.1
I like the way folders look on here
actually got used to the new app tour I
liked having the extra icon in the dock
I like the extra space that Google gave
me by having just a little icon for
search now weather is built in but the
biggest question that I got on Twitter
after penetrate 7.1 that the Google now
panel is still there when you swipe to
the right it is there's a lot to like
about the pixel and pixel XL obviously
but there's an equal amount to not like
about it starting with a price at six
hundred and forty nine or seven hundred
and $69 for the pixel or the pixel XL
with only 32 gigabytes of storage they
are very expensive and with that really
premium price you're missing out on at
least one of I consider the four premium
features of most phones waterproofing a
lot of resistance really to speak of
you're not get expandable storage
there's no removable battery and there's
no wireless charging built in almost
every other premium smartphone out there
you can pick one of those four that's
going to have it even the iPhone now has
ip67 built in and for me that's almost
an excusable for a phone of this price
point the big question I asked the
beginning am I gonna buy this phone or
should you buy this phone I think you
should only buy this phone if you're an
Android purist at heart you're the ones
that bought every next device you want
the latest updates from Google then yes
by this but know what you're getting
into if that is not you and you want a
flagship phone you're going to play a
flagship price that you
better than the pixel and the pixel
excel kinda disappointed with it overall
so the pixel phone polarizer from the
beginning and polarizing to the end what
side of fence are you guys on are you
going to pick one up if you do you're
actually disappointed I think you could
probably do better for your smartphone
buying dollar let us know in the
comments down below to the video a
thumbs up it was appreciate it the next
time I'm John Ranger and TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
