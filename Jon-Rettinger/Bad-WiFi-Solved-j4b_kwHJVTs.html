are innocuous white looking disks that
are gonna create what's called a mesh
network assuming you buy more than one
and Google's happy to sell you a three
pack what this mesh network is gonna do
is supposedly eliminate dead spots in
your house the idea is if you put these
things you teach eclis around your house
they'll create a network free of dead
zones and it's also gonna let you bounce
around from router to router so as you
move through your house you're gonna
maintain a really strong connection and
not worry about a degraded signal we
need a graded Internet source of
interesting things about Google Wi-Fi
here's this short review of it it works
well we set it up in the office we set
up three in different points and the
network connection speed was consistent
what we had with our gigantic 19,000
antennas speed link router which is a
big testament to what Google is trying
to do here it's not all awesome I wish I
could set a separate 2g 5g network
instead Google's looking to sort of take
the complexity out of setting up a
router and they just do it all for you
there's one network name and they trust
your device they're gonna know which
one's connected whether it connect to a
2g or 5g we run separate networks in the
office I would have liked to have had
that capability or at least giving me
the option to set that up and choose but
something that I wanted that's kind of
the theme here Google is trying to make
things really easy for setting up a
router and they succeed incredibly the
app presenting this thing up can turn
anyone into an expert network admin so I
mentioned earlier a mesh network so if
you got a smaller home like 1,500 square
feet for example you can just use one of
these things and you'll be fine but
again Google offers a three pack tile
cover up to 4500 square feet which is
really big what Google Wi-Fi is doing
isn't anything new or revolutionary here
it looks eerily similar to the euro
routers creating mesh networks so here's
what boils down to at Google Wi-Fi if
you want a router that's really easy to
set up get it if you got an area in your
home with a ton of deadzone your nuke
your traditional router pick it up you
want a router that's gonna look
different and not look like gonna knock
you as black box or the antenna stick
out everywhere get Google Wi-Fi it looks
really nice do not get Google Wi-Fi if
you want to separate 2g or 5g networks
or if you are remotely pair
about what Google's watching you do
because you've got to have a gmail
account in order to set this thing up
one question I did get a lot though of
three summaries not enough for you like
if you live in a mansion Richie Rich you
can pick up another one you can add four
or more you can create a ginormous mesh
network without really having a loss of
Internet fidelity so when you guys think
Google Wi-Fi thumbs thumbs up you will
you wanna you want to get one you want
thumbs up this video which really
appreciate it
you've in the comments down below
something you picked up you want to pick
up you're interested in it works really
well and it works as advertised so I
give Google credit until next time I'm
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll talk to you guys next video and
now that you've got your brand-new mesh
network set up and rollin what better
way to enjoy it and to sit on the couch
with some Animal Planet go maybe you're
a project grizzly or an ocean warriors
person whatever Animal Planet's show you
want to watch you can take it with you
wherever you want to go with Animal
Planet go we'll link to it down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
