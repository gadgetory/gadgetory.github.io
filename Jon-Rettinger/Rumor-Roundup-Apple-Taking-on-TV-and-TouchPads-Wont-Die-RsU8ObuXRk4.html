to you by gamefly apples going to tackle
TV and what's the deal with the tablet
that just won't die hide the kids round
up the neighbors or maybe vice versa
it's techno Buffalo's rumor roundup
happy Labor Day weekend to you everybody
and welcome to the roundup for the week
ending today Friday September second
2011 man it's September already where
does the time go and I thought some rows
supposed to be quiet in the tech
industry anyway not this year this
episode of techno Buffalo's rumor
roundup is brought to you by our good
pals at gamefly I want to take a second
here to wish everybody a very happy
peaceful and you know mindful labor day
weekend whether you're in the United
States or not it's Labor Day weekend
this year in the US which traditionally
marks the end of summer at the beginning
of the back-to-school season but also
you know I implore you to take a minute
out of the front of festivities this
weekend and you know just be mindful
about what Labor Day means to you and
what you can do to make the world a
little bit of a better place this coming
fall and additionally to all of our
friends on the east coast of the United
States cleaning up after Hurricane Irene
on behalf of myself the entire
TechnoBuffalo crew and the entire herd
of TechnoBuffalo followers we wish you
nothing but the best hopefully whoever
you are wherever you are you're cleaning
up whatever was damaged or lost is
replaceable and please know that our
thoughts my thoughts are with you now
that onto the roundup the Apple Google
Wars get ready fanboys may be headed to
new territory your TV set we already
know Apple and Google Apple and
everybody going everybody going
toe-to-toe in the smartphone area as
well as the tablet desktop laptop
everything you can think of now the
focus may be shifting or at least
expanding to televisions we already know
google has launched the Google TV
platform and while the first version of
Google TV wasn't arousing success
the previews of the new version of
google TV set to launch very very soon
in fact I hear there's some demos going
on some preview demos over at IFA in
Germany where our own jon rettinger is
with a bunch of the revision three crews
to check out the rev3 IFA coverage on
techna Buffalo and elsewhere but anyway
I heard there are some demos of the new
version of google TV over at IFA and
apparently the rural is heated up again
that Apple is aiming to get into the
television business in a bigger way than
its so-called hobby the Apple TV set-top
box I love doing that it's just so much
fun Apple's got the apple TV right now
it's the second generation of the box
this generation 99 bucks there's a not
really a hard drive on board it's got a
little bit of local storage but mainly
it's a conduit for streaming stuff from
the iTunes Store and from YouTube
Netflix a few other online sources to
the TV you have it connected to in
addition to also being a receiver for
airplay stuff coming from an iOS device
well the new rumors are pointing to
Apple getting into the TV game in a much
bigger way somewhat similar to what they
did in totally disrupting the music
industry with iTunes apparently Apple
has been having talks for a long time
now with TV studios content distribution
partners you know the networks
everybody's NTV you name it to try to
get some kind of a subscription-based TV
service available through Apple the big
players on the other side have balked at
the whole thing they've seen what
Apple's done to digital music they're
not quite sure what to do what's gone
with cable satellite online video all
that stuff but you know Apple it's not
going to stop them the rumors that Apple
is actually now building a TV set that
would have functionality that's similar
to but greater than what's available in
the Apple TV product right now built
into it so some kind of an iTunes esque
thing for TV different but bigger than
what you can do now with buying shows
from Apple TV in the iTunes Store kind
of makes the head spin just thinking
about it and it's Apple so who knows you
know they have this way of reinventing
the wheel without actually reinventing
anything but then making you think they
totally reinvented it so again just the
rumors are dizzying but apparently Apple
hard at work on an actual TV set
just the Apple TV box one of the most
interesting spins on this rumor however
is that the first iteration of the
project is going to be a smaller screen
so they're not going to look to get in
to the very low margin highly
competitive world of making giant flat
panel TVs because I you know if you've
gone shopping and that you know in the
past couple of weeks little in the past
couple of years you know that the prices
on giant high-def panels have just been
falling falling falling falling falling
while functionality gets greater in
these things Smart TVs from all the
companies vizio Samsung LG everybody's
Sony everybody's got a smart TV out
there so if Apple is going to get into
this game they would make a premium
product most likely because that's what
Apple does but they might look to get in
to the bedroom as opposed to the living
room the kitchen the smaller set your
second set your third set so you could
have your Apple TV box hooked up your
giant flat panel that some other company
made and is suffering through the you
know the price wars and the low margins
but then Apple would cook up a very high
quality smaller set 27-inch 23-inch
something like that with this new
functionality built in and get into your
kitchen get into your bedroom first kind
of makes a lot of sense especially when
you consider that Apple already makes
smaller high quality TV sets just
without the functionality they make the
cinema displace to make the imax for
that matter they make the iPad and the
macbook lines for that matter if you
want to go real small so it would be
pretty easy for them to take an iMac and
turn it into a 23 inch or a 27 inch
screen suitable for the bedroom suitable
for the den suitable for the kitchen
something like that but bake all this
new functionality into it as another way
to get their stuff get their itunes
store in your home very interesting it's
going to be an interesting fall
interesting next year I think in
particular in terms of the battle for
the future of online video at digital
television so stay tuned I keep saying
stay tuned but seriously stay tuned for

and last but certainly not least is the
curious case of the HP TouchPad as you
probably know by now HP announced that
they were killing off hardware support
for all web OS devices including the pre
three smartphone which still hasn't
shipped in the US and never will
apparently and the touch pad tablet not
long after they announced they were
killing off the touch pad tablet the
thing one on fire sale all over the
place the tablet that started out at 499
for the base model and then was cut to
399 was suddenly on sale for 99 bucks
with the higher up model with double the
internal storage going for 149 the thing
sold like hotcakes everywhere through HP
through amazon in stores you couldn't
get a touch pad because they all went
flying off the shelves suddenly the
touch pad was by some accounts the
second most popular tablet computer in
the world behind apple's ipad line all
of a sudden all this interest in the
touch pad now HP has come back and said
that they're going to do another limited
run of touch pads why maybe to meet
consumer demand maybe because they
already have a bunch of parts lying
around or a bunch of contracts with
suppliers for components and they
figured you know what may as well cut
our losses assemble the things ship them
out and sell them because there's demand
there or maybe it's some kind of weird
we don't quite know what we're doing but
we're going to just ride this thing out
sneaky sort of you know figuring things
out on the consumers dime plan to get
back into the hardware side of webos who
knows HP's taking a loss right now
selling these things at ninety-nine
bucks or 149 some reports say that it
costs HP around three hundred three
hundred eighteen dollars each to
actually produce the touch pads so
selling them in ninety-nine bucks
they're taking a loss for sure but at
least they're recouping some money as
opposed to just having these things
sitting around if you recall not you
know just a week or so ago there were
reports that there were some 270,000
touch pads sitting around best buy the
best buy wanted to give back now these
things flew off the shelves they're
going for upwards of 300 bucks on ebay
and suddenly HP might be thinking huh
people actually like the touchpad you
like us you really like us maybe we
should get back into the game
or maybe there are a ton of irate
investors who've been coming after HP
CEO and executive saying what are you
talking about you're getting out of
hardware what you're getting that
consumer computing no no that's not why
we invested in you we're big-time
institutional investors we put a lot of
money into HP stock you guys are making
computers you're making touch pads you
didn't buy palm for a billion dollars a
year ago just a cut and run so get back
in it however you have to we don't care
just do it I don't know it's all rumors
at this point we'll see it'll be
interesting to see how many more touch
pads HP makes and if they actually stick
to their guns and saying then I don't
know we just had the components lying
around to make a few more but we're
getting out of the business it's all
going to wind down q4 this year like we
said or if webos could rise from the
ashes I'll tell you what palm on the
brink HP buys them HP kills off webos if
HP comes back that would be like a
double Phoenix story I don't know if my
head could handle it my head is pretty
big and shiny it can handle a lot
interesting to see what happens in the
meantime like I said keep your eyes on
TechnoBuffalo and rev 3 for all the news
coming out of IFA over in berlin germany
not to mention the long awaited arrival
of the samsung galaxy s2 smartphone line
in the US are unlike perlman was at the
