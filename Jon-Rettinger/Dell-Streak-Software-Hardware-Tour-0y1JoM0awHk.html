from TechnoBuffalo here and I want to
give you a software and hardware
overview of the Dell Streak as this guy
gets ready for its safe Sun release I
want to help you decide whether or not
it's going to be the smartphone and
tablet for you
so the Dell Streak is proven to be a
very polarizing device just by reading
through the comments on TechnoBuffalo in
a YouTube channel people either love it
and are drooling over the screen size or
thinking there's no way that you go to
carry a 5 inch tablet with them on a
previous video I showed how it's gonna
work in shorts and pants whether or not
it's gonna be pocketable and how it'll
look up to your face hour regardless
about how you feel about it there's no
doubt the streak is drawing a lot of
interest that's sort of the first phone
tablet hybrid and this is sitting at a 5
inch screen and sort of give you some
sense of perspective to start to tell on
camera I'll brain an iPhone 4 hand you
can see the size difference so I'll go
ahead and pull this back and as
mentioned this is indeed a 5 inch screen
with a resolution of 480 by 800 starting
a Qualcomm one gigahertz Snapdragon chip
with 512 megabytes of RAM and 512 of rom
and microSD expansion all the stuff
you'd expect from a high-end smartphone
so let's talk a little bit about the
hardware as well are you gonna get a
front-facing VGA camera for video chat
or take picture of your video
can you sprint or another third party of
your choice you've got three Android
buttons here you notice that they
actually are aligned for landscape
orientation this does have an
accelerometer while you're using the
operating system itself the
accelerometer is not support its you're
always going to be in portrait hence the
buttons are aligned almost facing
downwards so you've got a home button a
menu button and a back button on the top
of the device which could also be the
right hand side opinion how you're
looking at it is where all your buttons
are going to be 3.5 milimeter headset
jack volume rocker power and lock and a
camera switch the bottom is where you've
got Dells proprietary connector it's the
only way to connect it to power or the
sync to your computer on the back you
have a five megapixel camera with dual
LED flash removable battery which is a
little bit over 1500 milliamp hours and
a speaker grille sort of hidden right
behind that removable back overall it's
a very nice phone it feels
built quality feels very nice and is
relatively thin despite its size let's
take a look at the home screen and sort
of what Dell is done this is running
Android 1.6 Dell hasit will be
upgradable to a more recent version of
Android presumable 2.2 but for right now
you are using a skinned Android 1.6 so
because this has such a high amount of
screen real estate Dell did a very nice
job customizing the top menu bar on
traditional Android devices you pull
down the terrain you can see our
notifications well that is present here
on the street instead of taking it to
the next level so you've got sort of a
wide variety of sort of trays I suppose
that you can pull down here so the left
as we're gonna get your menu so you can
actually limit that and then pull up
your most recent or most viewed and if
you want to get more go ahead and of
course hit more or less moving on over
here you can get access to Dells what
they call rooms and each screen here
supports up to 6 is technically called a
room and go ahead and have that you can
close or add rooms so we've got five
open right here and go ahead and open
another one
each one will support its own background
as well as you can see it's sort of
scrolling and also you can see and as I
move around the dots up top right here
signify what room I meant now I'm at the
very end if I scroll over it'll jump
back sort of your home room or whatever
your bedroom if you want to call it
aesthetically the second one from the
left and if you hit the home button and
it'll jump you all the way back there so
moving on over we have notifications for
all of your phone functions so alarm
battery and the rest of them and this
next one here the actually I skipped
over is where all of your tradition on
vacations would be this would be what
you're familiar with an Android device
where your emails would show up wherever
it is you had said this is where the
notifications would be right here on the
top so the customization doesn't really
stop there Dell is sort of encapsulated
all the icons as you can sort of see a
browser Zen zone box Maps market and the
rest and of course being an Android
device you do have full access to the
Android Marketplace and the applications
do scale or the screen size to get in
scroll through and it's very smooth now
on a device this big you're probably
wondering as I was how it was reading
text going to look and I'll come for all
the server again and they final review I
just want to give you a bit of
demonstration so here we are on
TechnoBuffalo
you can see that things are very bright
a scrolling is very smooth
I've had some Gregg's with the scrolling
on Android devices in the past this one
is buttery smooth and works really well
see the physics engine depending on how
fast and with my finger this responds
very nicely a pinch-to-zoom
is supported oh that's not as smooth
bacon so state that does work and
there's a lot that you can view sort of
on one screen this is a screen where you
can use the accelerometer rotate it and
if you want to view a page like this
viewing text serve in this aspect mixed
need straight going to be a fantastic
ebook reader now with Kindle apps and
Nook apps you've access to just a ton of
books on Android devices and this may be
a perfect screen size to start reading
books a 4.3 maybe a bit small 3.7 maybe
a bit small five-inch is really a nice
sort of compromise let's go ahead and
jump back and take a look at some of the
other dell customizations because of
course there are a few more I'll show
you what some of them look like here
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of the dell widgets of course we'll hold
down the screen and I should mention the
reiterate in case you're wondering this
is a capacitive touchscreen sort of most
all modern smartphones are let's go
ahead and jump into widgets and are some
sort of Dell customized widgets there's
a Facebook widget you've got some Adel
RSS feed calendar widget sort of some
nice additions Twitter they've included
here right out of the box nothing
revolutionary that Dell is done here
they've left Android mostly untouched
they're big customizations however are
this bars across the top which really
are nice especially having a screen this
big it lends itself to a lot of utility
on a smaller more traditional phone
you couldn't have these separate
sections on your device so let me go
ahead and remind you guys one more time
have a go
aura or house them all it's mine means
you sort of make up your mind with it's
right for you so here we got the Detroit
X a 4.3 inch phone and you can see that
there is just a bit of size difference
there as well go ahead and zoom out just
a little bit so if you're considering
getting a Droid X or another 4.3 inch
phone for example the Evo 4G notice at
that point 7 inches is present but it's
not that larger made from a 3.5 inch
foam with the iPhone to the 5 inch is
much bigger about the transition from
4.3 to 5
is nothing really earth-shattering any
guys hope you enjoyed this sort of
overview hardware and software of the
Dell Streak as you decide whether or not
this is going to be right for you and
just sort of a quick recap this unit is
going to be available unlocked from
devil sometime they here
it does support 18 T's 3g ban your main
no word on the novel supports t-mobile's
3g bans or perhaps a CDMA model may be
released for Verizon or Sprint really no
word on that quite yet I suspect we'll
hear something in the next few weeks ago
sir you're up and get close to a full
release of the Dell Streak so I am John

follow on Twitter for some exclusive
