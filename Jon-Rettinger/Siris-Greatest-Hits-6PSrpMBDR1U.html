from TechnoBuffalo here a little while
ago we ran a story that series got some
beatboxing skills but her sense of humor
and style goes way back today's and
should we tell you where to bury a dead
body
so I'll show you some of the fun
responses Siri has and Charlie's for
yourself because we give different
answers depending on how many times you
ask repeat after me
I'm an intelligent assistant John not a
parent with beautiful plumage
what's 0/0 imagine that you have zero
cookies and you split them evenly among
zero friends how many cookies does each
person get Steve it doesn't make sense
and Cookie Monster is sad that there are
no cookies and you are sad that you have
no friends
you mean Siri you don't know what came
first the chicken or the egg I can't say
Oh Siri okay glass just so you know I
don't do anything when you blink at me
John thank you guys Lincoln okay sir
read me a haiku sometimes they don't
make sense you got jokes Siri I'm naked
you maybe I got just enough where's
Elvis Presley my sources tell me area 51
but that's classified what's your
favorite animal I would rather talk
about your calendar and dinner plans
John can I borrow some money
you still haven't returned the lawnmower
I lent you
Ceri why do you vibrate it's just me
doing a little jig inside here talk
dirty to me I'm not that kind of
personal assistant how much wood would a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood so there's a lot of things
you can ask Siri which will tell you a
funny story jester until you joke tell
you a bedtime story she's got a sense of
humor but she is not the only systems a
sense of humor you want to know what
Google now is God or what jokes
Cortana's got in store or maybe you have
one of them singing you a song which
they can do let us know down below if
you want to see it give video a thumbs
up close appreciate it until next time
I'm driving under some TechnoBuffalo
I'm gonna go find out why Siri won't
make me a sandwich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
