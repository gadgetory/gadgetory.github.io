to you by the national campaign against
drunk driving hey guys it's ashley skele
welcome to ask the Buffalo where every
week we take your burning questions
about technology but we have something a
little bit different this week our
interns are here it's the end of their
five-week internship so we are going to
ask the Buffalo interns alright guys so
it's the end of your your five week
internship it was a pretty cool crazy
ride i know we worked too pretty hard
over here at the office yet a lot to do
but I gotta ask you first what was your
favorite part of your internship here at
technobuffalo by the way everybody if
you have not met our interns braden
Biermann and david taylor so you might
be familiar with David he's done a
couple of videos for us and we also saw
Braden in our meet the interns video so
Braden what was your favorite thing
about internship I know everybody's
trying to make you laugh back there do
not look at them um I like being of in a
professional environment the first time
for me stop where were you in a
professional environment that's my
question in an environment that was not
a hobby for that so actually being taken
having my work actually critiqued in a
way that was not just oh that was okay
or it was a this needs to go up on the
site this news of you this needs to be
perfect I really like that like the
pressure like that it bettered myself
and my attic skills awesome and what
about you David assembly different than
I'm normally recording videos in my
college apartment by myself so being
around a whole group of people doing the
same thing I am deaf I has helped me
cool and um so favorite moment like did
you have like a like a moment that you
really enjoyed or was there a time here
at the office where you were just like
okay this this was really cool I can't
say a favorite but I really like getting
all the new the new stuff like I have no
way of getting a stuff like the Nvidia
shield was really cool like even if
people find it like useless sir right
yeah at the office is probably within
like the first week we had a giant nerd
for that was pretty fun and then going
to the destruction derby was really fun
there's there are a lot of really good
moments here at TechnoBuffalo I know a
lot of people see what we do online i'm
so jealous right now if there was
anything
any advice that you could give to
somebody who is thinking like I'd really
like to intern at an office like
technobuffalo at a tech site like
TechnoBuffalo what advice would you give
them based on what they might want to do
as stupid as it sounds I would say don't
stop like if you're if you're getting
into it or if you're into it already
don't stop doing it the best of us i can
give is if for video stuff specifically
just keep making videos for youtube I
just keep posting them because when I
first started I you know didn't get a
lot of views and reach out to different
people just you know because the CES
contest kind of got me here and I just
reached out and made the video for you
guys and then I ended up being here for
an internship so it worked out in the
end did entering here change your
perception of what we do as technology
journalists and bloggers I don't think
so I mean I always have you guys were
always fun stuff which was not surprised
really just dancing to try and make me
laugh like I expect that stuff um but
it's like you can tell when the stories
that you really care about what you're
doing and I just think that's a really
good thing that's what I expected it's
not a lot more busy than I thought it
was gonna be I thought it was you know
it's never laid back but it's just the
amount of stuff that goes on during the
day is crazy especially to people behind
the camera ok we're watching the videos
they don't know how much stuff goes on
behind the scenes you guys put in a lot
of work you guys did I mean these guys
worked really hard for the office and
and it what was the biggest takeaway
that you guys got like what was the
biggest thing that you learned here
actually the advice I'd I just gave
because like I was getting kind of
courage guy really I always liked and
what got me into it was I entered a
festival thing and I didn't win but I
got in the top 16 out of 100 and some
and that was like okay cool but I'm like
what am I gonna do with this and they
was like hey mommy tasks damp Orion I
mean I was good enough for you guys so I
guess I think I learned not to stop so
that's awesome doing it keep doing it
sweet the best sailor or just the
experience of doing this and you know
being on camera more being in front of
people and I used to be in front of a
bunch of people or recording so it's the
stuff we helped me a lot sweet well
thanks guys and we'll we'll actually
really miss you here I think especially
of to say I think Lucy specifically is
gonna really miss Braden cuz they have a
very special bond she was very excited
to see you guys
and even even Roy's dog Ava was like she
doesn't usually take two people but she
just took right to you guys but yeah
well I think everybody here I'll really
miss you and I think you guys did a
great job I know I got to work really
closely with these guys cuz editing and
obviously hosting and on camera and also
you did you know some some
behind-the-scenes stuff as well and you
guys had a great job I think you guys
really killed it i think you really grew
over five weeks so there was some place
we could find you guys online after your
internship is over where would we find
you twitter or facebook facebook at
braden Biermann look me up I mean
there's not many Braden's or buurman SBI
ER and Twitter's ab2 can BTW ocan sweet
know what about you David my twitter
handle is at dt robo 13 and my youtube
channel i do tech videos and gaming
videos as well and that's just
youtube.com slash robo 13 I want to take
a second to thank our friends at the
national campaign against drunk driving
for sponsoring this episode today you
know it's shocking how many people die
from accidents caused by drunk drivers
every 51 minutes on average someone is
killed by a drunk driver that is
ridiculous if you drink a drive you're
not only putting your life in danger
you're putting everyone else's lives
around you in danger it's stupid it's
pointless and it can ruin your life or
the life of somebody else in the blink
of an eye August fourteenth through
September second is the drive sober or
get pulled over campaign there'll be
another drunk driving statistic holiday
weekends are especially dangerous so
don't be an idiot use a designated
driver call a cab or look up a program
like tipsy tow that will take your car
home if you're too drunk to drive know
what your options are and don't ever
drink and drive even though the last
resort please be safe we love you guys
keep your friends safe and respect the
people around you you can't enjoy using
fancy new technology that we have online
if you're dead or in jail don't be
stupid don't drink and drive that's it
for us the Buffalo make sure you check
out TechnoBuffalo com for all of your
tech news my name is david taylor and
i'll see you all in the next one thanks
