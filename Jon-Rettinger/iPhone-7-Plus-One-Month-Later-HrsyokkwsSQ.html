7 and 7 plus came out uh but using a
combination of both for that entire time
so wanted to share some new thoughts and
opinions maybe up you guys decide if you
want to get one or see if we mesh what
your pains been with the phones let's
start with the positives my favorite
feature of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus is
the black color I love matte black it
looks really nice not a big fan of the
jet black option the matte black is worn
extremely well I don't have any
scratches it hardly shows any sort of
fingerprints it's been very welcome the
other really nice features for the plus
has been battery life iphone value life
is always pretty solid for me I'm
generally getting about 15 to 20 percent
more on the 7 plus versus what I got on
the 6s plus which is awesome yeah I've
got about 60% of battery life but time I
plug in the end of the night so huge
huge huge deal for someone like me who's
travelling quite a bit isn't always near
a outlet the camera here certainly
improved but in all candor it still
looks like a phone picture to me it's
nice to have a better camera option but
nothing giant I've got the beta
installed on here so I've been trying to
port your mode pictures look fine it
looks kind of digitally processed to my
eyes but I'm sure it'll get better as it
comes out of beta and goes to mass
release there have been a few inches as
though where I definitely missed the
headphone jack ones on an uber ride you
bird driver tried to pass me an aux
cable the other was I was traveling and
my wireless headphones ran out of
battery I was stuck without any sort of
media entertainment so I still wish
there was a headphone jack plugged into
that guy - 67 it's also still really
nice but not without its flaws our own
Andrew Evers who's actually behind the
camera for this video for some unknown
reason maybe he can explain it took a 7
plus I went like this into a fish tank
everything to take his phone out and his
phone was totally borked did not work at
all to get back to Apple and I made him
pay in 50 bucks to get a new phone so it
is not waterproof
just reiterate that not waterproof 5b 67
so you supposedly can put it underwater
in fact when we tested our iPhone 7 I
threw it in the pool
we've dunked phones and jars of water
it's been fine but your mileage might
vary so don't think you can take the
same swim
you and have no issue or pull and Andrew
and putting a fish tank the taptic
engine on the home button the home
button doesn't depress anymore that was
a little bit strange took a while to get
used to I really enjoy it now when I use
an ordinary knife on the feel strange
head button actually go up and down I
really like that feature that's probably
one of the most welcomed changes it was
very subtle but something I've really
appreciated using it all has not been
incredibly awesome I've had some GPS
issues with my iPhone 7 and I had it
with the 7th plus as well takes a while
to lock in on a location sometimes when
it does lock in it is not even close to
accurate to where I'm at now things be a
known issue with this generation of
phones performance wise it seems fast
but any current gen iPhone never seemed
slow so I noticed a any giant difference
to your huge improvement from speed over
last gen 6s or 6s plus the phone feels
fast it's got actually Giga Ranbir's
what we had before
I've only noticed it I can run a ton of
benchmark give you a ton of scores for
me though user experience is what
matters it's quick phone and it's the
fastest iPhone app has ever done which
notion the most recent iPhone Apple's
ever done Apple talked a lot about the
color gamut on the screen and when I did
the full review I don't think it looked
at much better than last gen 6s plus
still the same resolution at 1080p but
the more I use the phone more I could
see the slight change in the color gamut
so the screen I like to amend that is
definitely better than the 6s plus but
it's not the best screen out there it is
however much better in direct sunlight
so bear that in mind what I've seen with
lash gemphones
stereo speakers sound loud that allowed
us i've tested from an iphone so if you
lie heavily on speakers you're gonna
appreciate that here on the 7 + 7 + I
usually carry my phone in a case i've
got naked degeneration but fortunate
enough to not drop it so I can't comment
on drop tests or anything but again no
scratches from going it out of my pocket
no smudges on the matte black if I
cleaned up the screen this thing would
look absolutely brand new I'm so unsure
how I feel about the iPhone and iOS 10
course and again
notion it's the best iPhone Apple's ever
made and it's an iPhone you know what
you're getting when you pick it up
you're getting the best version of what
you've ever used but you know exactly
where you get
a lot of people that is very comforting
they know how it works you know how
application you're gonna perform and
they know what the phone is going to do
day to day I'm not sure what camp I'm in
some days I load the iPhone some days I
wish it would do things differently I
would consider wireless charging I wish
it had fast charging I wish I had a lot
of things that other competition does
but the phone still works really well
and that's kind of the point of the
video it's the fastest iPhone my opinion
hasn't changed too much
since the review some things are
different a lot of you guys look for
follow ups a few weeks after review so I
wanted to share my opinions with you
have you guys had the GPS issues have
you had any other flaws with your phones
let me know in the comments down below I
want to hear it cuz video a thumbs up we
always appreciate it the next time
