to you by Linda calm gears of war goes
full Microsoft Michael Pachter gives
random guesses on the future of handheld
gaming and cat lateral damage gets a
green light also we played dr. Luigi and
discuss this week's hot new releases
let's get out of controller
hello and welcome out of control or the
weekly TechnoBuffalo show that covers
all your gaming news reviews demos and
new releases and it easy to digest
capsule form I'm your host Ashley Scott
that it's always a big vici gaming so
let's hit the news if anyone out there
was hoping to see the Gears of War
series go cross-platform for this
generation of consoles well don't hold
your breath Microsoft officially
purchased the past present and future of
the popular franchise from Epic Games
making it an official microsoft studios
title with black tusk studios taking
over developing future titles
microsoft's phil spencer said quote it
all comes back to our commitment to xbox
fans the Gears of War franchise has a
very strong passionate and valued fan
based on Xbox over 22 million units have
been sold across all gears of war titles
worldwide grossing over 1 billion
dollars on end quote and when I put that
through my magic translator machine that
quote turned into it looks getting kind
of old and we figured we'd hedge our
bets plus we really didn't want it to
show up on the ps4 you've probably heard
of Michael Pachter an analyst with
Wedbush Securities who loves to make
predictions about gaming he recently
made some handheld predictions and he
presented two very different futures for
Nintendo's 3ds and PlayStation Vita he
says the 3ds will survive because of its
appeal to core gamers although phones
will cut deeply into their sales for
more casual gamers now as for the Vita
pachter paints a far bleecker picture
saying it will die a slow painful death
this guy's a modern day Nostradamus and
by that I mean his rate of success on
predictions falls between a sack of
potatoes and a neighborhood cat so I'm
going to go ahead and predict the Vita
gets a nice boost from PlayStation now
and remote play on the ps4 while
Nintendo continues to crank out good
stuff on the 3ds indie game cat lateral
damage generated some serious buzz a few
weeks back and now it's going to be
official on Steam the first person house
cat destruction game is now headed to
the steam platform at some point after
getting enough attention and votes to
get a green light from valve creator
Chris Cheung surely has his work cut out
for him and we likely won't see the
official game any time in the immediate
future since it's still an alpha but
we're excited to see how the game
develops over time if you're interested
