technobuffalo here at three of you for
you of the nokia surge for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless
the suckers going to run you 7999 after
a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate and of
course on the two-year contract this is
running symbian s60 which surprising
you're not surprised I'm late depending
on where you're located is the most
popular mobile operating system in the
world and this was my first foray into
it so I was very excited to use it and
give you my Piggins on first off one
thing I have to mention about this phone
is the hardware design is bizarre you
guys saw out during the unboxing and
i'll put a link in the sidebar to the
unboxing that is just a very strange
design with this big lip it's got a nice
accelerometer that slides out to reveal
a really big keyboard when you turn it
but it's just a very strange design it's
a relatively thin phone but I've just
never seen anything like this it's
nothing that I would want to show off to
my friends but it is very functional so
speaking a functional let's talk about
the symbian s60 operating system for
those of you outside of the US odds are
you're familiar with it and you used it
for those of you inside the US you
probably haven't had that much
experience with it and i will say that
it's very very functional it's very
useable it's intuitive it was easy to
learn i was able to give it to other
people who had never used it before and
they are able to pick it up very quickly
so certainly kudos the symbian
foundation before putting together a
very intuitive operating system now this
is not the touch screen version that was
just released for the n97 this is sort
of the old-school non-touchscreen using
the d-pad to click around and navigate
this does come with a full HTML flash
capable browser so you can you flash
content right on your phone you can play
youtube videos right from the browser
and all kinds of other cool flash stuff
and it does work very well it displays
the website the if we like it what I'm a
computer although the zoom controls and
navigations we're not so good i would
have liked sort of an easier zoom but i
can overlook that
to have flash capabilities something I
which devices like the iPhone would have
so moving right along to the symbian OS
I will say one thing that I do like
about this as well that displays your
calendar items right below the main row
of icons if you're like me you forget
things very easily and having to either
set reminders in your calendar or go
through open your calendar on a you know
once twice three times a day basis to
see when your meetings are can be a
little bit annoying often times you
might forget to do so on device like the
surge every time you turn on your phone
you see a list of what your calendar
items are for that day or week or
however you said it that's something i
really like i like that the blackberry
the old school black breakers had it
something i wish my current device the
iphone hand so definitely give the s60
credit for that so moving along to sort
of what it looks like it's definitely a
well old school looking user interface
it doesn't look as elegant as some of
the modern user interfaces so again like
the iPhone like Android even like the
n97 that they sort of refreshed the OS
it just looks antiquated it looks like a
phone you could have picked up five six
years ago you would have said well this
is looking a little bit old even then
but you know if you like Simeon and you
like the operating system it's going to
be very familiar to you however if
you're in the US and you've not use this
before you're definitely going to want
to play on it a little bit to make sure
that you like the way the operating
system works it's got a GPS and then
it's got a micro SD card slot it's got
all the goodies that you would expect
from a smartphone minus Wi-Fi so
something to keep in mind when you go to
your purchase so this is a phone and
it's got to make good phone calls and it
will say that the radio in this is very
very very strong I got a much better 3g
signal 19 with several devices I have
lined up including the iphone samsung
epix and the HTC touch pro all lines up
together this had the strongest 3g
signal and they were sitting right
to each other so definitely a plus to
nokia for that call quality was
fantastic i could hear people nice and
clearly they could hear me nice and
clearly with no white noise so if you
want to use this as a bone you're not
gonna have any problems and the
speakerphone was quite loud so on a
rating scale on a one-to-five scale will
you write this well it's going to be I'm
asking myself questions here it's going
to be hard to rank this and standing
alone on itself up looking at the
comparisons of other phones that are
available for the carrier it's a nice
phone it does a lot of things well
however I don't think I could get past
this atrocious design for a phone it is
really tragically ugly it does have a
nice feel on the hands but every time I
look at it wonder what the designers
were thinking the engineers were
thinking so for 79 bucks it's not a
steal of a phone it's not a free phone
when it's not one of those twenty dollar
phones 18t has I give it a 3 the
operating system is certainly functional
it looks old it doesn't have sort of the
fun and the flare that you get with some
of the newer devices that are coming out
but it is usable so if your first
stepping into the smartphone world when
you're looking for a calendar and a way
to send text messages you know then this
is going to be a decent way to go if you
looking for something more advanced and
it's really something with a touchscreen
this is not going to be for you so guys
