from TechnoBuffalo and it's a sunny
unreasonably I'm looking out the windows
I say this it's insanely warm today for
a winter so sorry to all you folks who
are suffering wheel real winter across
the globe but incredibly almost eerily
warm here but you can sit in for a
weather report a little update for you
I'm headed over the bridge across the
bane of San Francisco in a couple of
hours to check out the macworld 2011
media preview and then tomorrow thursday
i'll be on site at the moscone center in
san francisco for macworld all day long
I'll tell you macworld always been a
favorite show of mine in the past couple
years it's certainly changed since Apple
no longer attends the event it's really
turned into iPod world and then you know
iphone world and now ipad world as well
so you know we'll see what will see that
there is to see if there's not much to
see it won't spend a lot of time there
if there is you know we'll spend we'll
go back friday if I need to but whatever
there is I'll bring it to you cases
accessories apps looks like you know the
the dominant theme of the show from the
PR releases a PR blasts i've been
getting so far i should say but if
there's anything in particular you'd
like to like me to check out and report
on images video you know whatever it is
hands-on impressions let me know in the
comments here we're probably a better
way to get me is on twitter either my
account at NOAA Kravitz or the
TechnoBuffalo account at TechnoBuffalo
and of course you can always hit up
John's account as well at john for
lakers and i will try to get some
hands-on at least eyes on time with
whatever there is that might be catching
your interest coming out of backwards so
let me know since we're talking about
travel plans stay tuned also to
TechnoBuffalo we'll always but technica
flow and here on the channel youtube
facebook wherever you're watching this
video coming up soon februari 72 New
York City a big sprint event will be
there covering that they've got this
whole illusion theme lot servers about
maybe a 3d phone we'll see what it is
februari 9th here in San Francisco I
believe John's going to take the little
Southwest flight up to join me covering
the HP press event expecting some new
webos devices from HP palm or just
HP looks like they might be dropping the
palm name who knows but expecting some
phone some tablets who knows what sex
februari 9th will be covering that live
and then februari 12 I get on a plane go
halfway around the world to Barcelona
Spain to cover Mobile World Congress the
premier flagship event for the mobile
industry globally generally speaking we
see flagship phones coming out from you
know lots of the companies and i would
expect this year based on what happened
at CES and some of the early media and
my students seeing big stuff coming from
sony ericsson new Xperia phones maybe
the playstation phone big stuff coming
from samsung perhaps a dual-core phone
and or dual core tablet also expecting
stuff from HTC they're always big at
Mobile World Congress and then a couple
of devices at CES the Thunderbolt for
verizon but and their global portfolio
didn't see a whole lot and of course we
would expect some stuff from Nokia who
didn't show you know hasn't shown much
in the past few months since the na lots
of rumors of a Mego powered device who
knows what but expect some stuff from
Nokia as well as you know I mean it's a
huge huge show so you know we would hope
to see some new nvidia tegra 2 power
dual core stuff more stuff powered by
Qualcomm and TI some new google stuff
you know android stuff who knows but
i'll be there so again macworld this
week the sprint event the palm event and
Mobile World Congress all coming at you
in early February's so stay tuned to
technobuffalo the website the facebook
page the twitter accounts the youtube
channel you get the idea i'm gonna say
goodbye now and i head over to back
