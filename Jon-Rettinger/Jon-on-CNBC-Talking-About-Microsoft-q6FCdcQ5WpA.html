guys at hedge funds I'm favorite nine
for boosting is staking like I'm shocked
by watering sixty-three percent I know
it has been proven a very smart guy but
with Microsoft essentially been dead
money for five years we're really asking
what exactly does he see in this company
well joining us now is Richard Williams
Microsoft analyst at cross research and
jon rettinger president of TechnoBuffalo
rich i was reading your notes and it
said you're very bullish on Microsoft
there is so much to like where do I
start well make a crack at it well the
nice thing about Microsoft is that
you've got very strong cash flows and a
solid three-quarter streak of beating
expectations but we look forward into
the mobile space and because of what's
happening with Google and Android we
think it really adds a lot of value to
the windows phone 7 franchise as we go
into year-end so essentially they're
going to try and pick up a lot of what
Android is likely to lose because of
these patent wars and it's steve ballmer
smarter than people think and would you
poo-poo what all the calls to get him
replaced Richard what I think what we've
seen over the last few years in
retrospect really starts to paint a
different picture than I think most
investors are aware of it looked as if
Microsoft was mired and unable to move
but now when you look back and see how
all the sudden Microsoft went from being
under the Department of Justice and EU
antitrust commissions to suddenly now
Google is under that lens with some
Microsoft help behind the scenes same
thing with search I mean Microsoft is
the only company i'm aware of that was
able to take zero position in search for
example that's a monopoly owned by
Google and grow it to thirty percent
okay John John I hear what Richard is
saying and I definitely talking to
Richard for years and I respect his
position but at the same point listen
you know what we can make the same case
every year from Microsoft lots of cash
number one leader in you know office
program no more leader in Windows why
hasn't the stock reacted for five years
when it is fairly easy to at least on
paper make a bull case for Microsoft so
we're finally starting to see Microsoft
used some of those capital reserves
don't forget about that gigantic skype
app
in just a few months no matter what
Microsoft does in the mobile space
that's still a fringe business and
richer was just on skype but yet as far
as I know he didn't pay to be on skype
right they paid eight billion for a free
product but people what we're looking at
in the integration electron oh I was
looking at a potential integration with
that Windows Phone 7 platform they have
a new release code names deliciously
mango coming out very soon but you're
expecting to see skype integration
brought into that so why you might not
pay for the service the service is going
to be in front of you there's a
potential for ad space there an ad space
for searchers are a tremendous potential
revenue stream for Microsoft well you
know Richard Richard I was one of those
those early skype deal bashers and it
was a knee-jerk reaction it didn't you
know for whatever reason but as I'm
driving the work I've got skype on my
android phone I'm talking to my son in
Hong Kong it's all free of course at
this point I keep thinking to myself is
there some way Microsoft can somehow do
something with skype that would
integrate it in a way google has
integrated google maps to be so perfect
that it actually works because by the
way when i'm using the skype and i'm in
the car and I'm it's not quite that
great um well it is there something that
people are missing you have the
telecommunications for absolutely there
is i would agree as well i think that
the fact that facebook is free and
they're generating multi billion revenue
numbers and google searches free and
they're producing tens of billions in
revenues I think it's just a function of
monetizing it and in the end I look at
Microsoft Google as being searched it's
a search war and it's effectively
Microsoft's trying to transition from
its OS with the incredible gross margins
into new world and Google's trying to
fight back with maintaining its it's
great gross margin on the search side by
going into China and India we think as
part of this motorola deal okay retain
John thank you very much for joining us
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
