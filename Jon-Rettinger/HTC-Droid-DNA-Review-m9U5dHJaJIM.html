TechnoBuffalo at the full review for you
of Verizon's the latest flagship this is
the Droid DNA this guys packing a 1080p
display quad-core 2 gigs of RAM Android
4.1 jelly bean beats audio and so much
other goodness under its tiny little
thin package let's go ahead dig in see
if this is the super phone to grace your
pockets for the next two years as far as
Android phones go the Droid DNA's got it
all good looks and specs to match its
packing the same killer 8 megapixel
camera we saw on the HTC One X the
latest quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
processor from Qualcomm a wide-angle
front facing camera we saw on the HTC 8x
Beats Audio 2 gigs ram and so much more
but it also has two hardware specs one
good and one great which really stand
out first it's got a crazy sharp 1080p
HD display first of its kind on the US
market with a pixel per inch count of
440 that's sharper than any other
smartphone you can currently buy the
phone only comes to 16 gigs of storage
that's fine if you're a cloud-based kind
of person in the streets really moving
that way but it's not that much storage
that's especially true if you actually
wanted to advantage is that gorgeous
1080p display by storing Full HD videos
on your phone it seems really silly but
we learned that Verizon was the one who
didn't want additional storage so
whatever reason canting HTC for that
hardware mishap HTC's long built its
verizon android brand divisive to focus
on making them look somewhat like sports
cars and DNA it's really no different as
a red racing stripe mesh ring down both
sides don't let that mislead you those
are speaker grilles
for getting your jams on it's also a red
ring right Meg beetle camera a red power
button that's top of the phone and a
brushed aluminum volume buttons on the
right side there's also a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on top liking a small
mini sim port the microUSB charging port
is on the bottom and the phone has a
super annoying hatch protecting it the
device itself is built out of partly
carbonate plastic as unibody design
which means it feels absolutely solid
alright so back to at 1080p display for
a second it is stellar text is
noticeably much crisper than what I've
seen on any other smartphone especially
when reading websites or books it's also
really bright easy to read on a direct
sunlight since utilizes LCD 3 technology
instead of Super AMOLED viewing angles
totally rocked you can see the screen
from nearly every angle
total ease lastly there's a smaller
canoe on the back of the film that's
super hard to notice about looking for
it this is actually an LED indicator
hello it's basically completely useless
I'm not sure why I was put on the back
the phone instead of on the front it
lights up green but just barely bright
enough to see what a new message call or
email comes in again no anyway she
decided to put the LED notification
where it is but there you have it
I ran the full quadrant benchmark which
I usually do for all high-end Android
smartphones see how the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor stacked up
against the competition the Droid DNA
receiving the overall score of drumroll
please seven thousand four hundred and
sixty one which blew the HTC One X
totally out of the water bested the Asus
Transformer Prime TF 201 and several
other devices keep in mind though that
the quad-core processor has to be able
to render every single pixel on display
which really puts a toll at how well
it's X up against other quad-core phones
basically it looks like your
future-proofing yourself for the Droid
DNA when it comes to more power
intensive apps and games there no doubt
going to launch in the coming year
finally before I forget Droid DNA is a
global smartphone and ships unlocked
that means you can actually pop in an
AT&amp;amp;T SIM card news HSPA in the United
States or even t-mobile's edge network
probably won't want to especially if you
buy it on contract websites no device is
totally unlocked out of the box alright
so let's go ahead and jump over to
software stop worrying about the upgrade
from Ice Cream Sandwich to jellybean
droid DNA runs Android 4.1 right out of
the box which we need to get buttery
smooth performance amazing Google
announced support the option to use your
voice for Google is pretty awesome
Google search engine HTC also slathered
its own HTC Sense 4 plus user interface
which has a few design tweaks over since
4.0 skin.that launched on the One X the
keyboard have changed a bit but take
some getting used to if you're already
using HTC phone but so a breeze to type
on I love that there's a Settings button
right on the notifications chain which
makes it easier to jump in and turn off
GPS settings connect to Wi-Fi now Orkut
having to dig through menus to get to
him Sense has really been one of our
favorite Android skins TouchWiz is great
sometimes but it's too colorful for me
and seems too cartoonish I like how
since fourplus looks on this phone
obviously others do too is in this
weather widget has been widely copied on
a ton of third-party apps my big beef
though with the current you is set up is
that there's a small tab at the bottom
right-hand side the main menu for
Verizon apps oh this is good for Verizon
subscribers they're new to smart phones
that don't know where their phone is
capable of but it's loaded with tons of
bloatware including beezy navigator and
really
it's time to kill the navigator you can
get it for free with Google Maps MX
service my fries and mobile verizon
Tunes the Vindhya game a demo for rain
of a mere official voice but NFL mobile
and a ton other stuff you're probably
not gonna use since fourplus also allows
you to manage multiple photo galleries
across three party apps it's pretty cool
you can view the files stored on your
phone as well those from Microsoft
SkyDrive Dropbox Facebook Flickr and
Picasa similarly we also saw this in
sense for beach audio support is
integrated with third-party music
applications such as Spotify which
appear under the music menu alright
let's talk about camera HTC really put a
focus on camera quality introduced the
HTC One X which remains my favorite
mobile camera to date like that phone
the Droid DNA could snap photos in
rapid-fire and I mean crazy stupid
rapid-fire HTC said that it changed the
default settings to save 20 pictures
while snapping quickly instead of 99
because users were snapping so many
photos so quickly they're consuming
almost all their space but you could
always suggest that in settings however
I also love you can take pictures while
recording videos if you had a baseball
game trying to film a homerun you can
quickly snap the shutter button to grab
photos right as the batter swings
pictures were pretty much on par we saw
with HTC One X and the one x+ generally
think they're pretty close would I
receive on the iPhone 5 two colors the
great flash doesn't blow too much image
out and the images look fantastic on
that gorgeous 1080p screen likewise the
phone is capable of recording 1080p
video and for the first time you can
actually view it back in 1080p glory
right on your smart phone which is super
awesome alright next let's talked about
call quality data and battery life calls
on the Droid DNA we're solid and what
I've experienced other HTC smartphones I
wasn't really blown away but have any
issues either
it works it worked well no white noise
no drop calls let's gonna depend on
where you go hard but if looking for a
good phone this will definitely do it
for you data speeds on Verizon's 4G LTE
network we're pretty solid you fell
around 15 megabits per second on the
downside and close to 12 on the up those
are crazy fast written it's gonna vary
though again depending on where you are
to add DNA features a 2020 million power
battery which was able to get me to the
end of the day with about 25 or 30
percent charge which is pretty okay in
my book so you say charger to end the
day anyway again it's pretty surprising
considering the size of the screen
amount of power that's under the hood so
what's the final verdict on the Droid
DNA
we'd only got docked one point for lack
of storage me again we can't ding HTC
for that that
was on four rise ins and as they
dictated the storage size this phone is
almost near-perfect with its killer
specs 1080p screen you can finally view
back the content as you filmed it this
is it's expressed to me that it's kind
of like watching blu-ray on a laptop
yeah it looks great but still is a tiny
screen but you've got the option to view
it on there if you want to watch your
video on here you can it's gonna be in
1080p or you can just pop it on a TV or
any other format that you want to use it
it's a really solid foam I can
definitely recommend and gets a very
solid night on the TechnoBuffalo score
