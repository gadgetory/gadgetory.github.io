from TechnoBuffalo calm here it's summer
summer to drink time for games let me
show you one of the games that I've been
flying for the past week labyrinth 3d it
is a iphone or ipod touch wooden
labyrinth game it'll run you 399 in the
app store or there is a free version as
well but you don't get all the level
packs you don't get the updates and it
sort of just pick random levels in there
but if you just want to fool around and
try the game this is a great way to go
so first the idea behind a wooden
labyrinth is to move a metal ball turn
into a prescribed hole through a lot of
obstacles it's a simple contact but it's
relatively fun I actually grew up with a
wooden labyrinth in my parents home so I
kind of have a soft spot for these so
let me show you some of the options you
can turn the sound effects on and off
music on and off friction you can
control sensitivity endless mode holes
so that can make the level crazy
difficult 3d effects shake to jump or
tag to jump essentially what that means
you can shake the device and have the
ball jump on certain levels let me show
you what a level looks like so we'll
pick when the first one is easy
breathing no pressure so the goal is to
get there into that little checkered
hole and certainly just takes advantage
of the built-in accelerometer on here
and you'll see that as I'm moving this
around the barrier start to look
three-dimensional which is kind of needs
really get the feeling that you're not
just using a two-dimensional plane I
will try and navigate not successfully
trying to do it through the camera lens
let's see
and now but you guys get the idea of
what the wooden labyrinth game is it is
a lot of fun if you're just waiting for
a friend and you have five minutes to
kill you can go through and do two or
three levels not have to worry about
having to save your game at the end or
anything it just is a lot of fun and a
great way to just waste a few minutes so
