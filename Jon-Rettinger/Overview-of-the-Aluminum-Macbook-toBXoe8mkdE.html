calm had a couple requests to show the
macbook kind do a hardware overview of
the computer itself i did that kind of
briefly on my unboxing i'm going to show
you guys a little bit more go into it a
little bit more in depth so here is the
macbook it's the 2.4 stock configuration
model and as you guys can see first
little rounded edges very similar to the
macbook air can see on the ended slopes
off to the side there so that's the
first thing that you notice it's got a
very solid feel to it it definitely
feels more sturdy of these to me than
the old plastic models did I have more
confidence in the build quality all the
ports now are moved to the left side of
the device and starting off here with a
magsafe which appears to be the same
magsafe that is found in the last
generation macbook sand macbook pros
open on you've got the gigabit ethernet
2 USBS that new mini displayport audio
in audio out and a Kensington lock so
those are the only ports there and one
of the biggest concerns people have
about the new macbook is a lack of
firewire and I understand that but for
me Lakha firewire is not really an issue
I don't use this for any video editing I
don't even have a firewire camera so
that's not really a problem the bottom
of the device here's one thing I didn't
show during the unboxing and it does
look again similar to the macbook air
with your black rubber feet one nice
thing about this though is the slatch
right here you can pop out and get to
remove back any of access to your
battery and hard drive really very
quickly user-accessible a little rubber
feet make it feel very secure when
you're typing like it doesn't feel like
it's going to be moving around the back
there has got a black hinge and on the
right side device there's the eight-time
burning super Drive and that's it's very
clean look to it on the front there's a
magnetic latch right there on this side
here there's your IR port and that
blinking right there shows you that the
computer is in sleep mode let's go ahead
and open er up it can go ahead and see
the reflection here
the glossy screen is not a bother for me
I actually prefer glossy so I haven't
had any issues with the screen at all I
know that's one problem people are
having but I'm not having any clear
issues anything terribly bad any
different than I did on the macbook pro
or my external monitor that I used that
had a glare to it I'm gonna do a
separate video on the keyboard but the
keyboard there is backlit and the
speakers are actually quite loud i'll do
another video on those as well and the
speaker grill is right back here and
this is actually the loudest computer
speakers that I've had with the
exception of the macbook pro grab the
speaker ports here not quite as loud as
the old pros but it is much louder than
you old Mac books let's go ahead and
close this up again and of course the
apple logo glows when it's on overall
I've been very happy with the computer
really enjoyed it and I think it's been
a great addition and I've needed for the
mobile power that it can have some guys
just by request it's another real quick
hardware overview of a computer and spec
wise and other things I will won't ring
it gets all that in just a just a few
minutes so guys hope you enjoy the video
here check out the website at www on for
lakers calm and i will talk to you guys
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
