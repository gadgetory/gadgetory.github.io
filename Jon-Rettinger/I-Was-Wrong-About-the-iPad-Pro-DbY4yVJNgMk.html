University of Phoenix for sponsoring
this revisited video I'm actually going
back to school for a five-week course to
strengthen my self security game
University of Phoenix waived all fees
for the course I'm taking if you want to
learn more make sure to stay tuned until
the end so it's been a lot of talk in
rumors surrounding the iPad pro line
presumably it's gonna go bezel as with
the notch like the IFO intended but I
wanted to go back sort of look at the
iPad pro as it exists right now
pacifically a twelve point nine inch one
it's been over two years since I
reviewed it if you guys didn't see that
review link to it up here and down below
essentially I took it with me on a
European trip to essentially use it as
my only computer at the time Apple was
saying this could replace your computer
my conclusion spoiler it was it's nice
it's a big iPad and it's not worth the
price so now over two years later Apple
assorted to fulfill that vision of the
iPad being a computer despite my
internal hatred for that what's a
computer commercial so I wanted to
revisit the twelve point nine inch iPad
pro and this is the current gen version
so the iPad pro came out the biggest
limitation to what it could do wasn't
hardware specs it was iOS itself I was
nine just wasn't ready for what Apple
wanted the iPad to be iOS 11 brought a
lot of features to the iPad and a few
noticeable things made the experience
better overall so we've got things like
the files app you could finally use an
iPad like you could a laptop you could
go through and find where your files
were located but perhaps the biggest one
and one of the largest reasons that I
really couldn't recommend the first gen
giganto iPad pro it didn't really have
true multitasking you could sort of
multitask and pick different apps but I
was too loved him brought side-by-side
multitasking to the iPad line and that
brought really good functionality I
think you couldn't do before
if I had to live in just one app at a
time that it might as well just been a
gigantic iPhone pretty much what it was
so all the software stuff aside another
big knock with an iPad pro can't was
price it was breezy as expensive coming
in around a thousand bucks
Apple slashed a price now you can get a
brand new to 64 gig version for about
seven hundred ninety nine dollars so
that's alone is a much more appealing
reason to consider and
pad Pro I haven't bought one since that
first gen came out I didn't see your
reason so probably wondering why I've
got this one here sometimes we use a
teleprompter I'm in the office for four
videos for scripts and the smaller iPads
that we had weren't cut again so I
wanted to try the bigger iPad Brobee
zoom ibly a bigger screen to make a
teleprompter setup easier so we picked
it up to use as a prompt eraser to just
use it at home use it as I did my old
iPad it started to come to realization
that it's improved and my initial
thoughts were wrong or at least no
longer valid since the software has
changed quite a bit to the point where I
don't really want to give this away and
use it as a prompter although although I
probably will so a couple awesome things
here that have changed it's the first
gen obviously the hardware still looks
the same but the hundred twenty Hertz
screen is nice it's really not a
deal-breaker you turn the screen on you
realize that in to steal apples older
design language it's the iPhone 8 and
older design language here in fact it's
got a 77% screen to body ratio and if I
was a betting man I would say a surefire
bet is that it's gonna go the way of the
iPhone 10 like I said those bezels are
going to be gone as is the home button
but despite being an older design
language it's still a really elegant
tablet and one that I've absolutely
enjoyed using the last bit about the
iPad pro Apple talks a lot about the
pencil and I'm not an artist I don't
draw I see very little need for the
Apple pencil doesn't ridiculous to me
that to charge it you have to plug it in
it just it makes no sense there's no
place on the iPad to store it I've lost
two of them there was a long issue for a
while or if you missed a firmware update
on the iPad pencil essentially would
brick it I'm not a fan of it I think it
is unnecessary but it exists and if you
want it get it apples left forcing it on
you so I guess that's nice we'd have the
choice but the point of this video just
to say if you're opinio on the iPad pro
is based on the first gen like mine was
once I tried that first one then I sold
it I never even thought about the twelve
point nine inch iPad pro ever again you
might want to reconsider it it's a much
better experience than when iOS 12 hits
the mainstream and actually
I didn't get even better and that's
where the nice thing about Apple stop
birth dates it generally tend to get
better and we're closer to the vision of
the iPad as a PC we're not there yet
we're much closer than we were two years
ago so mentioned at the beginning of the
video that I'm going back to school it's
been now about seven years since I
graduated graduate school and things
have changed quite a bit TechnoBuffalo
has evolved
if you following the site are following
me for years you will know that our site
has been hacked there's multiple
attempts pretty regularly and I've tried
to work a lot of those but the problems
that I kept running into wasn't in all
candor my own ignorance I don't speak
the language of cybersecurity so how to
rely on others that knew it to try and
fix it for me and it's had a certain
hope that they were doing their job
putting up safeguards to make sure that
my information safe your information is
safe and that the site can't stay up and
everybody can keep working so University
of Phoenix reached out and see if I was
interested in working with them I said
yes but I really want it to be on
internet in cybersecurity since that is
paramount to running my business my
small business as an entrepreneur
keeping my site up and running is I
cannot stress the importance of that
alone so I'm embarking on a five-week
course I'm right now about a week or so
into it so still in the early stages but
I'm learning a lot it's my first time
taking an online course especially if
they're trying to learn how to use it
and try to simulate the classroom versus
a campus I've been really impressed with
the online platform that eCampus far as
the work that I'm doing feels very
similar to being on campus but I had the
flexibility to take the courses and do
the work on my own time so if you're
interested in the course that I'm taking
or any other courses will link to all
the stuffs down below those are my
revisited thoughts on the twelve point
nine inch iPad pro it's kind of a fun
exercise to relook at a product I
haven't really thought about in over two
years and I want to kind of keep this
going so if there's a product that you
want us to go back and look at even if
it's been updated since then let us know
in the comments down below we'll take a
look at and hopefully this will be the
first in a series of revisited style
videos like revisit a few years later
style video give the video a thumbs up
we appreciate it
until next time Jon render TechnoBuffalo
and you can't have my big iPad for under
sorry mark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
