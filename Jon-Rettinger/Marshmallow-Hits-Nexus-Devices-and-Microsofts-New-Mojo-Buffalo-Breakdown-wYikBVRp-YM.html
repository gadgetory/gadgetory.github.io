Verizon's grandfathered users are
getting a price hike and Microsoft's got
their mojo back I'm mark birth center
it's Saturday October 10th and this is
the Buffalo breakdown what's up
everybody great stuff to cover this week
so let's dive right in first up
Microsoft really really wowed us this
week with brand new devices across the
board the brand new Lumia look like they
finally make Windows on your mobile
device a serious contender the new
surfaces are also a step up from last
year's models and the brand new surface
book is Microsoft's first
honest-to-goodness flagship computer it
is a total power house on paper but it's
not just a laptop the screen also
detaches for a clipboard mode leaving
the GPU and extra battery in the face
and it can even reattach in Reverse for
a full power tablet mode check out my
recap of everything announced from
earlier this week right up here
marshmallow is now currently rolling out
to Nexus devices the killer feature here
is easily now on tap now on tap pays
attention to what's on your display to
give you contextual information so if
you're listening to music on rdio let's
say you can use now on tap to find more
information about the artist then you
can even say how old is he and it'll
know who you're asking about it's really
really cool stuff we have a great recap
video on it right here and if you're
looking to manually flash the stock
image what we do have a video on that to
you guessed it it's right here remember
that story about a week or so ago about
sag-aftra well the votes are in and the
video game voice actors have unanimously
voted to strike over ninety-six percent
of members are looking for better
compensation royalties and more
transparency in contracts and their
insurance some of the biggest names to
speak out in favor of the vote have been
david hayter the former voice of solid
snake and jennifer hale best known for
the role of fem shep in the Mass Effect
series she's also been in a ton of
animated series go check out her IMDB
you'll be a little surprised it's kind
of fun you can keep up with everything
that's happening on that front using the
hashtag performance matters over on
Twitter this week amazon launched amazon
handmade to challenge etsy in the craft
focused self-operated arena sellers are
going to be subject to a forty dollar
fee for
sales they make over 40 per month and
after august of next year they're also
going to be taking a twelve percent cut
out of each and every sale given
amazon's anticompetitive habits and
historically tenuous relationship with
sellers I don't really have high hopes
for the service but you can check it out
for yourself by applying for a seller
profile finally some bummertown news for
those of you on verizon's grandfathered
unlimited plans starting in november
your monthly rates are going to be going
up by about twenty dollars your new
total per month should rest somewhere
around sixty dollars for a line with
unlimited data truly unlimited data
without including voice and text that
said that's still a totally reasonable
price for a truly unlimited data plan
you could still sign up for these I'd
imagine they do very well that's all the
news that you need to know for the week
