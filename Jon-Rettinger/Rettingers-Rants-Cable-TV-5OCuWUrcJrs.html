to you by full sail university welcome
back to the episode of rettinger Francis
your rant and rave on something in the
world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside this week in my
crosshairs I've got cable TV and why oh
why don't we have some sort of ala carte
subscriptions I was scrolling through my
channels realized I've got 300 channels
and I probably watch 19 of them and it
became infuriating and then I saw the
news and Senator John McCain proposing a
bill to alleviate this so let's talk
about it this is rettinger France it's
go and get started all right so I'm
gonna make a confession to you guys cuz
you've known each other for years I'm
gonna be honest over the weekends I
wanted to watch the world series of
poker and I wanted to watch a marathon
of the show pawn stars and I said pondy
the show where they go through all the
pawn shops and they show what people are
buying and selling and all kinds of cool
stuff I learned about history that way
and I'm not ashamed to admit it I was
trying to find the channels and I'm
scrolling through and scrolling through
and scrolling through it i went through
page after page after page after page to
finally find the network and i realized
i'm paying for all those channels that i
never watch in my life i'm looking at
you homework channel I'm looking at you
Oprah's network looking at you all the
other stuff out there that I've never
even seen and of programming that I have
no interest in watching yet somehow I
have to pay for it for example if I want
to get the sports channels i love to
watch i canna subscribe to about 14
other channels that i am never going to
use in languages i don't even speak so
it got me thinking why can't we just cut
the cord and subscribe to the networks
that we want to watch you know a lot of
you have tried to cut the cord and bring
all your TV online to use hulu plus and
netflix and some streaming options but
it just doesn't work to get everything
you want and to watch stuff live at
least for me so I'm not the only one out
there that feels this way evidently
Senator John McCain yes that Senator
John McCain who ran for president few
years ago trying to make life easier
essentially set up an ala carte system
for TV so if you only want to watch ABC
and fox and ESPN they'd only pay for ABC
Fox ESPN I don't know why we don't
already have this actually rhetorical
question I absolutely know why greed
we've got an oligopoly here for the
cable
companies and the satellite companies
aren't that many choices and they all
kahoot in the back to set prices that
are pretty much universal that no one
can come in and undercut if you've got
cox if you've got comcast eighteen t
u-verse the rest of them you got direct
TV we've got Dish Network all the prices
except for promotions are always almost
identical so whichever way you go you're
still stuck paying for things that you
don't want now I understand that people
are playing with things they don't want
all the time when it comes to TV I think
it's time we should have some choice and
I'm hopeful that Senator McCain's bill
is going to go through he can finally
say I don't want that garbage I don't
need that garbage I don't know what the
stuff that I want to watch I know my
wife watches the Food Network and she
likes to watch them the wedding shows
that's fine we'll pay for those I like
to watch sport that's fine we'll pay for
those but why the other 280 channels do
we have to pay for it order to get that
and why they all bundled into packages
perhaps pick the package is even smaller
so you dont and dont laugh at that joke
perhaps you can make it even smaller so
you have to have all these crazy
channels you never watch it's just
absolutely infuriating I was going
through and it took me almost 17 page
presses to get to the movie channels why
why do we have all this stuff out there
why isn't there a way in some service
that can just give us the options to pay
for what we want I know there's backdoor
deals the networks and cable riders
that's probably never gonna happen but
I'm fingers crossed that good will
triumph over evil and that greed will
eventually not went out we can have only
what we need at least that's my hope
what do you guys think am I wrong do you
wish you could have this are you happy
with the way your systems work if you're
not in the United States what kind of
cable or satellite systems you have how
do you get your TV I love to hear from
you guys or if you're doing some sort of
weird online thing I want to know what
it is you're doing so maybe I can do it
