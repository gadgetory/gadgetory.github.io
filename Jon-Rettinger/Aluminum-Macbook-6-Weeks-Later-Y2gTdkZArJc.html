lakers calm kind of just woke up a
little while ago and wanted to give you
an update on my new macbook it's been
just about six weeks since i got it all
right i haven't really made a video on
it or talking about it terribly much so
I want to try and rectify that let you
know what I think about it in the time
that I've had it so first off I couldn't
be more thrilled with the computer build
quality has been fantastic the keyboard
has been great I even really enjoy the
new track man I've gotten used to it
very very quickly and I think that you
will too there's definitely a little bit
of a learning curve with it but the more
you use it I think that's the more used
to what you get for school I sometimes
have to use Windows Vista so it's nice
feel to have the option of boot camp be
able just to do a boot it really makes
it very quick and very easy to have the
best of both worlds the backlit screen
has been really nice I know people had
some issues with glossy you know but for
me it really hasn't been a problem I
like the way it makes a screen pop not
having firewire I haven't noticed an
issue wanna usually when I make my
videos I generally use my pad find it
here use a flip minnow which just has
USB 2.0 port anyway so not having
firewires not been a big deal and if I
need firewire I can use the UCI Mac that
I have in my office so not not that big
an issue for me I know it was for some
people I am so happy that I waited to
get the aluminum macbook think that if I
got in the plastic one I would have been
a little disappointed not to say the
plastic one is a bad computer I just
think the aluminum one as far as build
quality and processor speed you know
really makes up for it while the actual
processor speed I technically be a
little bit slower front side bus and cpu
really makes it a faster computer a
faster processor doesn't always
translate to faster computing so you
know those are some concerns people had
as far as the 2.4 versus the lower model
I am I think I would have been happy
with either Dylan reason I went for the
2.4 which is for the backlit keyboard
think they're both great computers I
haven't even had a need to upgrade the
ram 24 gigs even on to it just been
blistering fast
all the videos I make can I just go
ahead and use it the isight camera has
been fantastic speakers are great I
don't notice any sort of heat coming
from the computer at all gets a little
bit warm in the upper left-hand corner
but nothing that I noticed with a pair
of jeans on when I used to use my old
macbook pro before I sold it you know it
would fry my lap and having it on there
for 5-10 minutes the new one not an
issue at all battery life has been
fantastic I regularly get four or so
hours using a web browsing and that's
the bluetooth on wireless on and the
backlit at full strength so Apple really
did a fantastic job with the battery I
know the new ones have a little bit
smaller wattage or power rather than the
older generation but they've optimized
it much better so I've been quite happy
with the battery on the computer you
know it's not really much else to say
other than if you've been waiting to
pull the trigger go ahead and do it I
don't think you'll be disappointed you
really do get the best of everything
with a mac ability to run pc programs
and run windows natively i think windows
has a great place I enjoy using Windows
I prefer OS 10 but I have nothing
against Microsoft or the windows OS just
for me OS 10 is better I like the option
of being able to run both so guys jon
rettinger John for lakers calm which is
a real quick update on the macbook hope
you guys enjoyed be sure to check out
the website wwg on for lakers calm and
