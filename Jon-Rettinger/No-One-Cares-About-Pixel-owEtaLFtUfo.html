almost like a Hollywood movie it's got
executive backstab me introduce dr. Eric
Schmidt Google's CEO billions of dollars
being spent to acquire Motorola's mobile
handset business for about 12 and a half
billion dollars and despite all that
drama and money being spent still seems
like nobody cares about the Google pixel
so before we got the pixel phones its
its precursor its cousin its ancestor
was the Nexus line of phones it started
back at 2010 with the HTC made Nexus One
and it served the purpose of kind of
showing how Google thought Android
should look Google obviously was making
Android they're the ones that were
developing it but the products have got
the consumers hands with Samsung's take
on Android it was HTC's and LG's and
Sony's at the time so the Nexus One
represented what Android should look
like and what Android could be as
envisioned by Google so the original
Nexus the Nexus One it was made by HTC
was a crazy time for phones it was it
was 2010 the phone market was still
changing and moving everybody was still
trying to play catch-up to Apple and I
remember when the Nexus One hit had a
scroll ball for navigation and that was
sort of different but one of the coolest
things about it was actually the
wallpaper you could tap the wallpaper
and it was almost like a little snake
pattern wouldn't move around and that
seemed really cool and it seemed like
something very unappetizing tiny little
thing made the original Nexus phone the
original Nexus One seemed appealing and
that was a Google's vision of Android so
there's a couple Nexus phones that stand
out obviously the Nexus One I don't
weigh there the design of the Nexus 4
always sticks out in my head
and a shimmery shiny back wireless
charging we had the Nexus 5 that I think
was still like the flagship pinnacle of
Nexus phones the gigantic at the time
Nexus 6 made by Motorola these phones
brought with them Google's new operating
system you know that was where you saw
the next generation of what Google was
offering whether it was cupcake whether
it was doughnut Eclair Froyo whatever
came next that was where you saw it and
that was kind of the reference phone
this you could see what it could be from
Google's software team working nicely
with another manufacturers hardware team
so it seems like the Nexus line of
phones was totally an experiment for
something that was going to come bigger
it had been rumoured ever since original
Nexus 1 that like Google was going to
make their own phone and then for years
up until the Nexus 6p it was still
something that was going to happen it
was around the corner so it seemed like
a trial period for Google sort of learn
what people wanted and during that nexus
years of phones there wasn't like a one
killer flagship feature so today I'm
very excited to introduce you to a new
phone made by Google we call it pixel so
2016 comes around and Google made what
seemed like a crazy decision at the time
to sort of pivot away from the Nexus
line of phones and give us what became
the pixel in my fits of insomnia I've
often wondered this on say what I think
about it 3 in the morning why Google
abandoned the Nexus line of phones and
pivoted to the pixel and there's a few
reasons that I can come up with first
was to show what they could do as a
harvard manufacturer to show other OEMs
what Android could and should look like
and perform like and they did it with a
clean slate so to speak with the pixel
it was a new name it was fresh it was
something that was a unified form factor
in Android when you buy or consider
buying a pixel phone you're kind of
getting an unofficial pixel promise from
Google what you're going to be getting
I think paramount amongst that is
software support so you're getting at
least three years of timely OS and
secure
the updates so you know your Android
phone will have the latest and be as
secure as Android can be you're getting
as close to a pure Android experience as
can be so you're getting Android as a
Google envisions it and usually does
special features thrown in there to
getting things like nitesite top shot
and call screening things that are value
adds to the pixel line of phones and
perhaps the biggest pixel promise is one
of the best and getting better all the
time constantly learning camera
experience and I can't overstate enough
how amazing and awesome and sometimes
seeming like magic Google's learning
engine is with their cameras the
pictures get better as the phones age
and that's something that's very unique
to what Google is doing three they're
getting a phone that was made and
manufactured you know by Google or with
Google's oversight
they're probably expecting the phone to
age you know like the John Stamos get
better as it gets older but six months
in that phone has been more a Benjamin
Button style of aging it hasn't worked
and hasn't gotten better as it's gotten
older see famously the pixel 3 has been
plagued with memory management issues
which is almost unforgivable in the
phone world it has slowed down
incredibly and was until the phone had
been out for almost four months before
Google finally fixed the problems so
you're spending flagship money for phone
to get a degraded and user experience so
and don't misinterpret any of this is
saying the pixel is not a good phone
it's a very solid phone and people who
have them tend to fall in love with them
it's just not selling well and even
Google is admitting as such so it's
interesting too about the pixel sales
numbers as Google's bring in like the
word level Thunder for the advertising
campaigns I mean literally lower level
Thunder it was featured everywhere in
Avengers end game we've seen commercials
national campaigns everywhere there's
been a lot of dollars spent to push the
pixel which kind of losing to believe
that Google is in this game for the
longer haul and they're not just trying
to get people to see what
Android could be they want people to
actually buy their phones so kind of
begs a question with all the money that
Google is putting behind launching these
phones and promoting these phones and
advertising them why they're not selling
well and so the answer may be software
bugs I mean as far as the pixel to goes
there was OLED burnin the screen was
perhaps subpar to a lot of people's eyes
pixel three issues at launch with photos
not being saved to the camera roll and
then shortly after they had memory
management issues these are problems
that affect almost every user of the
phone and if they're not affecting every
user they're certainly changing that
perspective at least of the devices and
the big selling point for the pixel is
awesome camera and software updates are
sure the two giant selling points that
come with it but now the competition has
gotten so much better and you generally
get a lot more so comparing the Android
world to the Galaxy S ten you're getting
things like an in screen finger / reader
you're getting a wide-angle camera
you're getting a lot of things that
you're not getting with the pixel and
the Delta between how good the pixel
camera is versus the competition has
gotten smaller and smaller and smaller
so the reasons to want to get a pixel
have also gotten smaller with it so
obviously Google's had problems selling
the pixel phone you can see that just by
the sales numbers they might also have a
solution to this to get more pixel
phones and more people's hands
so Google's clearly had problems selling
the pixel phones despite them being a
really solid options in the smartphone
market and the problem might have been
the price and Google has perhaps solved
that with the new pixel 3s the 3a and
the three XL bringing I think the best
features of their Big Brother's the down
market at a price point where they
become much more affordable and also I
think more appealing to the mass market
so you're getting the amazing Cam Ranh
getting a pretty awesome build quality
despite it now being a polycarbonate
back you're losing some things like the
IP rating you're getting some things -
like a 3.5 millimeter headset jack the
price point that the a in the XL are at
right now my opinion should be where
rule is competing at that's the sweet
spot and at that price point
there's tolerance for perhaps some
software or memory issues there's
tolerance for maybe not the best screen
in the market but you're still getting
that flagship camera I think Google is
gonna move a lot of units and when you
look back at six months later on the 3a
and the 3x hey Excel thinks may be a
different story than the three and a 3x
over Brizzy a lot of phones that got
moved off shelves perhaps more
availability people will maybe look at
the pixel line again or reconsider
whatever might come next me Google
so I 399 now the pixel of 3a is a really
compelling phone you are getting that
amazing camera experience out having to
spend 700 bucks to get there I think it
was a brilliant decision by Google and I
would imagine they're still probably
gonna be losing money on each phone
right now but they may not for Gen 2 and
Gen 3 of the new a line I wouldn't be
surprised if those a and Axl version
phones just drop the and become the next
version of the pixel so since that video
was films have been rocking the pixel 3a
for about five days and the impressions
is still hold true it is a really solid
phone I don't mind the plastic build it
still feels premium and I'm more
convinced now than I was before that
this is the market Google should be
competing it I don't think they belong
competing with the flagship Samsung
flagship LG
and Apple this is a perfect space for
them to be in you get the best that
Google has to offer with the amazing
cameras at a price point that's more
affordable and I think will help Google
ultimately sell more phones which it
seems is the goal but certainly there's
a lot of competition here including that
guy right there behind me the oneplus 7
so I think the pixel 3 a-line is perfect
I still hope that this is where the
pixel line goes and don't interpret this
video as me not liking pixel foam that's
never what this has been about the pixel
line of phones have been very good
they've had a troubled past all the way
back to the Nexus line of phones but
their future for the first time it seems
promising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
