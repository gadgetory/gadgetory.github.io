TechnoBuffalo here the white iPhone is
the Sasquatch magical unicorn Loch Ness
monster of tech world there's been some
proof that it might exist there's a lot
of doubters but no one's really seen one
in the flesh so as of now the white
iPhone has been unreleased but you can
still get your hands on a white iPhone
like I hopefully have right here
the folks at I rescue calm do a full
black iPhone - white iPhone conversion
kit making it look like it came right
from Apple I've never seen one of these
in person yet so I'm really excited to
dig in and see what kind of job they did
let's get started alright so if you're
interested in doing this conversion it's
gonna cost you just about two hundred
and fifty dollars however if you let the
folks at I rescue keep your black iPhone
parts of me in there in good condition
they'll actually take off about 180
dollars meaning you can get your black
iPhone converted to white for just about
70 bucks which seems to be a pretty good
deal let's go ahead and dig into the box
of course we're gonna use a big ol knife
for this alright cut the tape off
there's still a bit of tape to be sawed
through go ahead and do that right now
alright so the seal has been broken it's
going to open this thing up and this is
the box that I rescue ships in so your
phone will actually come very nice and
protected and actually this box that's
meant just for the iPhone 4 nice foam
covering here so here is I rescue
essentially what these guys do in
addition to the black to white iPhone a
conversion they repair pretty much
anything that's portable so iPhones
iPods iPads whatever else you might have
I can break these guys can fix it so
your iPhone has been repaired and tested
for quality assurance this is a must
after all repairs save this box package
build especially for your product okie
dokie let's see what the product looks
like here
is my white iPhone take a look at that
in just a second let's see what else is
going to come in this box
business cards which maybe probably
won't get don't they do that all at once
but I shipped this off to them one day
shipped it off next day they did the
repairs the next day then shut up and
they shipped it out the same day meaning
it really was just about a day in
between and shipping it out and getting
it back so it was very nice and quick it
looks like I also got my black iphone
parts back kind of cool to see what
these look like go ahead and pull all
the stuff out and looks like the phone
was nicely protected here in that phone
box and go ahead hold onto that let's
take a look at this mythical unicorn and
see what she looks like there is a white
iPhone and it is beautiful let's go
ahead and pull this off so these are not
official Apple parts although supposedly
they are very very very close they are
sort of OAM stuff but it does look
really good often times with
replacements you can have some issues
with things not being aligned let's go
ahead and take a look and see how things
look here so the camera modules in there
perfectly
you've got these speaker and sensors are
all aligned we now have a white button
which is kind of cool looks uh looks
pretty good it blends in nicely with my
background say a camouflage phone the
button press actually feels a little
clicky err things on the back flash is
lined up perfectly cameras lined up
perfectly it says you know there's the
Apple logo iPhone all the FCC ID I mean
it really looks like this came right
from Apple it's going powered on make
sure everything works that's probably a
good idea
alright so we have an Apple logo that is
definitely a good sign and while that is
booting up we'll take a look at the
parts that came off of the phone kind of
curiously what this looks like so there
is the black back so you can sort of do
a quick comparison while that's booting
up all right so here is the black for
comparison purpose and you can see the
white one is pretty similar you almost
can't see the writing on that N move it
around so you can see it but it's all
exactly the same you can see how it went
looking from this sort of what we've
seen with most iPhones to look in like
this flip this over and see if it did
power
on it looks like it did power on and is
good to go screen looks speed looks
great everything seems to be everything
seems to be working quite nicely let's
go ahead and see what else is going to
come in the eye or rescue pack and they
send you your stuff back so here is the
front actually never seen one of these
looks like it's kind of neat it's like
there's the Wow the whole display is
right underneath that I can see right
where it plugs in and this doesn't
affect the display at all till it
retinas blind everything is the same
just the casing is different which is uh
kind of neat to see that and see what
else we have and it looks like that is
that is it to get the front in the back
and they also will replace the button
things look really nice here the folks
that I rescue appear to have done a
really good job build quality on the
side you can see looks pretty much like
it came right from Apple they really did
a a very fantastic job if you want to
check them out the website let go ahead
and throw this up here is eye rescue
ir esq they really looks like they did a
what they say they're going to do they
turned a black iPhone completely white
and it looks like it came right from the
guys at Apple you know I'm really
curious to go out there and use it and
see what people think about a white
iPhone no one's really seen one in
person sort of been again that mythical
beast it looks absolutely gorgeous today
guys i am john r Ettinger from
TechnoBuffalo i also want to mention
that if you're interested in getting a
conversion kit done from the folks i
rescue or you need your phone to be
repaired i've actually hooked my
audience up with a 10% discount code so
if you use the code buffalo at checkout
you'll get 10% off whatever it is you
want to use and it looks like they've
been very high-quality the folks are
very nice and easy to deal with I'm
gonna go try out my white iPhone any
questions let me know I can show you a
bit more about it I'm John Rhett enger'
from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you the
next video
buh-bye
let's take a look at what the black
iPhone looked like before the conversion
you can see it's got the black back
you've probably seen these things a
million times they become quite
ubiquitous good looking phone there's
the back of it one more time all the FCC
ID there's a front see it looks pretty
standard what happens when you pull it
off to the side it turns into this guy
looks like a white iPhone the exact
opposite of what we just saw
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
