you think Apple has in their App Store
just leave in the comments down below as
of this filming which is early September
2018 there are over 2 million apps in
the Apple App Store that's a lot of apps
that's a lot of games you can pay for
it's a lot of freemium apps it's a ton
of everything it's hard to sort of sort
through to find the best app in there so
I want to give you guys my favorite apps
for iOS Before we jump in I want to
thank the LastPass for sponsoring this
video and supporting the channel and
allowing us to make awesome content for
you guys
at this point you probably know what
password managers are it's a way to
store all of your passwords and keep
them secure so a couple reasons that I
like it so I really like that LastPass
has no access whatsoever to actually see
your password and being passwords you
want to make sure it's secure you also
have multi-factor authentication and
built in there it's got a pretty baller
desktop app with a chrome extensions
really good so you have a limited
password storage - it's not gonna like
run out of space it's also gonna sync
across devices so if you're adding a new
password on your phone and it also be
there on your desktop or your chrome app
whenever you need it so perhaps the best
reason to consider LastPass first
there's a free version that that
actually works and gives you a lot of
full-functioning features but if you
want to opt for the paid version either
individual business or family price -
started about 2 bucks I've worked with
LastPass actually now almost for four
years so yes they did sponsor this video
and I and I thank them for that
but it's nap that I've been using that I
regularly use when I can wholeheartedly
recommend and when I think you guys
should absolutely check out so again a
big THANK YOU to LastPass for sponsoring
this video if you want to learn more
about them we'll link to them down below
let's get to the apps so the first step
is kind of unique to me but I thought
it's really cool and I use it quite a
bit it's a test app so first it's a
portal to my car that's to control
things like summon let's B precondition
to cab unlock the car honk the horn all
that stuff you've probably seen
demonstrated in ton of times in other
videos well you might not have seen
those you little swipe over from the car
icon you can actually see a lot of the
solar things I have solar installed in
my house about a month and a half ago
lets me control the two power wall
battery backups I have let me control
when Tower is coming from the solar
array to my house
when I wanted to come from the battery
pack let's me see how much electricity
I've used that day how much I'm selling
back to the grid and generally makes me
happy that I am saving a ton of money by
not paying pretty Southern California
electric bills anymore if you guys want
to see a full video by the way on the
solar and how it works and how we set it
up and what's a pap our walls will look
like let us know in the comments down
below or just the video a thumbs up to
let us know so for the next one I want
to pour one out for movie pass may you
may you rest in peace
everybody at the office has migrated
over for movie pass to AMC's a-list you
pay twenty bucks a month and you get
three movies a week and it's not just
like regular theaters you can pick from
the premium AMC experience which is
awesome into the Dolby theaters or the
other stuff you might have at your
theater it's been really awesome it's
been a seamless experience the app works
well you can see any movie you want
regardless of time which is nice and if
you decide you want to cancel they
actually let you do that if you live in
one of those cool theaters where you can
actually reserved your seat you can do
that too inside the app and you're also
gonna get AMC snub rewards so you'll
work your way up to a free popcorn candy
shop I don't know if you guys have been
getting a ton of spam calls I've been
getting an insane amount almost four to
five a day it seems like it's half the
time it's some robots saying hi this is
an and it's got infuriating there's
trying to spoof my phone number they're
calling for my area code it's got the
point where I just don't answer the
phone if it's on a number that I
recognize I've tried a lot of apps to
try and block this I'm on t-mobile
they've got a free service that
supposedly does it it hasn't really
worked out well for me so you guys
actually recommended an app called Robo
killer asking for suggestions on Twitter
it's worked out really well now the
caveat here it's not cheap it's about
399 a month if you decide to pay for a
month but what it does it's pretty good
so first it's reduced my spam calls by
almost 90% I like you also record the
calls they communicate something that
maybe you might want to miss you get
personal block list which is nice to
have and also perhaps my favorite
feature you can kind of mess with the
spammers you can set things to
automatically reply without you talking
on the phone so they sort of start
talking to you and kind of waste their
time like they're wasting yours if
you're getting a lot of robo calls and
you got an extra four bucks to spend
I recommend it for the next app I cut
cable it must've been about ten months
ago and it's actually been a pretty
seamless transition I've tried every
streaming platform out there and my
favorite has been YouTube TV and I wish
they had more channels that's probably
been the biggest issue I've had with
them the channels they have and the UI
are absolutely incredible I love the
fact that again in the limited DVR I
don't have to worry about running out of
space I can DVR sports teams and
probably the best thing about it if
you're a sports fan start watching a
game and then maybe you turn the TV off
and you got to go put your kid down for
a nap or something and you come back
even if you've closed the app and it
turned off your TV when you go back to
that game it'll give you the option to
go back where you left off which I
absolutely love it's been an incredible
experience the app is really good it's
not that expensive about 40 bucks right
now if you sign up it also lets you add
five different Gmail addresses to a
family group which is awesome
I've just been in love with YouTube TV I
use it on my Roku I use my tablet use it
on whatever phone I'm using it's been
absolutely awesome if you're debating
cutting the cable I think YouTube TV is
absolutely the best way to go
so if you scroll through get your
Instagram feed your Twitter feed and you
sees beautiful outdoor shots you're
thinking I would like to try to do those
two they look absolutely incredible I
got an app that's gonna help you do it
meet Helios
so it's not a free app it's gonna cost
you 99 cents but essentially just helps
you find the best time place and weather
for your outdoor pictures it's pretty
cool it's kind of predictive as well it
can tell you when the light the sky and
the moon indexes from local weather
forecasts pretty much anywhere in the
world if you want to create a shot for
dramatic sky it can help you pick the
right time it's pretty full functional
and it lets you just take really nice
outdoor pictures it's got a pretty cool
AR feature built in to stick you know
the path of the Sun and the moon and
it's got a built-in light meter for
exposure it takes a lot of the guesswork
out of getting those really nice-looking
outdoor shots alright so talking about
photos and try to get things to look
good we've actually moved from editing
our pictures on mobile from visco to
lightroom we use the desktop app quite a
bit but the mobile app recently has
gotten really good the big caveat though
you gotta have a Creative Cloud
subscription to use it but if you do if
you get an app that's gonna really give
you a ton of features over your photos
so you get pro controls there's raw
support just filter support you can sync
across your desktop library it boils
down to you get almost the best features
you get from the desktop app on your
phone without making it like convoluted
and crazy Adobe did some wizardry here
to make it really easy to use a lot of
our photos that you see here edited
mostly on the go with Lightroom so this
next app might not be like the sexiest
in the world it's called Taylor but what
it does it does it really well didn't go
into screenshots on your phone I ended
up sending like three screenshots I
tried to show you know one long page
you're an open Taylor it's gonna stitch
all those together for you into one
image you can send it off right from the
app it's free it's simple to use and I
surprisingly use it more than I ever
thought I would so you send a lot of
screenshots from your mobile device
Taylor's and awesome apps gonna make
your life easier
so what are some of my favorite apps
that I'm using right now for various
reasons from keeping animation secured
to trying to get some sunshine on this
pale skin and everything in between so
some apps that we missed that you guys
want to see included next video let us
know in the comments down below I'll
have another video coming up during the
Android side of this equation the best
Android apps most fun apps we use on
that platform hope you guys enjoy please
give you a thumbs up we appreciate it
until next time
John Ranger detective Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
