to you by gamefly welcome back to the
episode of retina schrantz the show i
rant and rave on anything for the world
electronics and sometimes outside of it
I read a ton of online sites in physical
print media after you consider
electronic because I love it it's my
passion and I read all the reviews on
pretty much every phone that comes out
way more reading than I should and I'm
starting to see a very disconcerting
trend of lack of ethics that go into it
reviews so I want to talk to you about
it so do you think this is retinas rants
let's go ahead and it started so the
past few days there's been a ton of new
phones that have come at least embargoes
that has lifted on the phones we could
share I reviews with you I'm talking
about you galaxy s4 blackberry q10 and
some others and there's been a ton of
reviews and written post and video posts
that are coming out about it now I've
talked in the past about journalists not
being honest about how long they've used
devices we get device the same day they
have up in there when they've handed
them physically to other sites and then
they'll post review the next day
cleaning three days of battery life
that's just not honest so I've obviously
talked about what we're doing with our
pledge and how will tell you exactly how
long we use the phone I urge all the
commenters on every site that they're
reading to ask the journalists who wrote
that piece or did the video to disclose
how long they use the device I think you
guys have a right to know if Joe one
will use it for two days that's fine but
you should know how long that was so you
can base your opinions on reviews that
might be more valid to what you want
that's not the point to this video I was
reading a review on a particular phone
and I saw that the journalists who wrote
it was not only lying to the audience
was what beyond bias now listen I know
everybody likes to call ppl bias but I
think majority of commenters don't
really know what that means you know I
can say when I do a head-to-head I like
the whatever HTC One better the galaxy
s4 better that's not biased that's based
on opinion and those are two very
different things anybody who does this
for a living has an opinion going in now
you try and keep that as far removed
from as possible and see the positives
and see the negatives and keep yourself
sort of as level as you can with their
always opinions there what I'm talking
about bias those and view the device and
you claim that you can see pixels on a
screen that has a higher ppi in the
human eye
can see you are lying not only is that
not honest but your heart is completely
swaying a product that might be a decent
product because you don't like it or
perhaps your pockets are being lined
elsewhere now a lot of people say hey
you know company paid you to do a good
review and for the most part ninety-nine
point nine nine nine nine nine percent
of journalists would never do that
anybody with even a monic come of ethics
and a company with even a little bit of
ethics would never ask any journalist to
do that but i will say there are some
few that will do it and it's very easy
to find who those people are for example
if you go to particular site you see
their site is completely blanketed with
advertisements for particular company
and you check that review of that
product look at it for biases if they're
blanketed with ads for a company and
review another product from a competitor
read those reviews and read them very
very carefully something I've been
feeling for a really long time it's I
got a show called rants I want to rant
about now listen I'm not saying my
reviews are perfect they are far from it
you guys have a right to call me out on
things you disagree on and I appreciate
when you do especially when they are
valid for example when I did my first
impressions on the galaxy s4 I said that
didn't look like some of the features
worked very well turned out it wasn't
waved my hand over the sensor and
because that wasn't my full review and I
did the full review so I use the phone
for me I was able to correct to that I
appreciate that kind of thing so if you
guys go and read reviews and you're
seeing things that look a little fishy
and seem a little odd call people out in
the comments we can change the way
technology is being reviewed there's no
surprise that people don't view
traditional media as real media because
people haven't gone the extra mile to
make it real media I'm not saying that
video production has to be studio
quality I'm saying the words that are
coming out of the mouth and the words
that are written on the page or at least
the digital page need to have some sort
of ethics behind it so call me out you
are welcome to I am not immune from this
at all call out every site you read no
matter how big or how small on the BS
only way we can get things better we can
improve and there are a lot of unethical
people out then is infuriating because
it creates a very unlevel playing field
for those of us that play by the rules
have ethics with what you do in your
career fedex what you do and how you
comment that is what you do in general
people just don't have it and it's
really gotten me upset so I wanted to
rant about it get off my chest you guys
agree or disagree let me know and again
I'm not
saying I'm immune to any of this I make
mistakes I certainly sometimes can have
biases though I try to keep them as far
away as possible ask people the
questions you want to know ask me the
questions you want to know if I don't
disclose something that you want to see
ask me and keep asking it until I see it
it's only way we're gonna get an
improved quality and I think that's not
just true for technology but for
everything in general for all of media
ask the questions that need to be asked
get the answers don't take things at
face value you deserve better and we
should be giving you better and by we I
mean the entire industry let's hear what
you guys think so let me exhale take a
