the TechnoBuffalo show I'm on your to
host for this week shot on me
editor-in-chief of the site i'm joined
by Todd Hazleton executive editor mobile
everybody first off for those of you
that are wondering why I said take two
we did try doing the show last week
something went horribly wrong and we're
still not quite sure what the heck
happened so no idea yeah we have no idea
so we're back and we're going to try
this episode again we do have people
monitoring if there's any problems this
time yeah so hopefully we don't run the
issue it look like something between
hangouts and YouTube that was causing
the problem exactly exactly and I had
something else to tell them oh the
reason Joey's not here Joey does have a
new computer however he and I have tried
doing hangouts this week and it's not
been pretty uh so we're trying to figure
out a solution to get through though uh
you know I'm sorry two frames per second
just wasn't working it was like hi John
how are ya good real the scenery yeah
real jittery so Joey will be returning
to the show so we're going to go ahead
and go with the topic we had for last
week and that's the fact that follows
coming up and it looks like we are just
going to be inundated with new disease
hey I can rattle off the dates now I was
going through Merliah yeah well Todd
yeah we can't give away you know who all
you're seeing but how many means do you
have next week for pre briefings for
Aoife um well one days is pretty much
all day of meetings I mean running
around New York City so and then we also
have press conferences actually to HTC
has one on the 19th a sprint has one on
the 19th their edge event which I'm
still don't even know I'm not even sure
what to expect from that it could be you
know I guess they've announced are going
back to all edge yeah well they were
actually never an edge network because
they were cdna
that's right Eric so that their 3g was a
video for those that don't know what a
pre-brief is that means we actually go
to a meeting and we get to see what's
going to be announced you know we we
know the announcements coming and this
is just a chance for us to see the
device early take our pictures right up
our thoughts and so on and then we have
to release them at a set embargo time so
yeah is it all yeah next week is all
about Aoife pre briefings and for those
of you that aren't familiar with Aoife
it's kind of like the european version
of CES it which is over in berlin and
cod will be in attendance at Aoife this
year and it sounds like you're going to
have a very busy week yeah I've been in
in past years and sometimes you know
there's not much I remember one year was
just when samsung released their first
galaxy tab and then other years you know
it's insane so this year looks like an
insane year like here I'll rattle off
the dates I have them in front of me so
we have HTC and sprint on the 19th
that's next week then September third is
uh the galaxy note 4 event probably I
mean it I mean Samsung pretty much gave
it away the invite right it said like
knows to date that picture of their the
s-pen kind of stuff going on and then
sony's press conference is on the 3rd
also and I don't know what to expect
from that but i'm guessing xperia z3 on
there's been a lot of an z3 compact i
would say yeah yeah leaks to that and it
looked like um at least aspects that
we've heard about so far it sounds like
it's almost like really similar the
Xperia z2 just maybe with a new body
because like Snapdragon 801 and and
three gigs of ram and the 20.7 megapixel
camera all that stuff so I don't know um
what's going on there and then actually
I should say sometime between here and
there I think we might hear something
from Motorola to write like they should
have something going on because it's
coming to the end of the summer so
expect that and then let's see September
fourth HTC just announced that they're
holding a press conference in
berlin microsoft also on September
fourth lenovo also on September fourth
intel on the fifth and then I come right
back and the rumors say on the ninth is
the iphone 6 event why motorola has an
answer event remember it's September
fourth up in Chicago right right right
right okay yeah it would which Roy will
be attending that good that's brilliant
yo schedule an event in the United
States when everybody is uh busy right
yes so yeah it looks like it's going to
be a very very busy busy time coming up
here right so it's gonna be crazy fall
and a lot to look forward to I think the
note 4 looks like an awesome device um
and all these rumors are saying like new
sensors and you know what was the one
that UV sensor on the back slick you
know when they get sunburn or when you
might get sunburned or like the Sun
levels outside that's crazy that that's
nuts to me and then today we had the
galaxy alpha which was I mean it is the
first metal phone in recent memory that
samsung launched and they had promised
one was coming but it still leaves it
open like as the pictures of the leak
note for kind of looked like it had a
metal chasis too and I hope it does that
would be really nice yeah so i I just I
the thing is do you think it's smart for
all these companies to release all their
products in such a small window I mean
yes you can see there's brand loyalty I
if somebody's already on iphone they're
probably going to stay on iphone right
so they're going to ignore all this
other stuff going on but if you're an
Android user it almost feels like these
companies are cutting each other's
throats and their own yeah it does seem
like that for consumers hopefully it's a
good thing because I got to have you
know standout features for everything
note 4 is a good one and a good example
of this battle because especially
apparently Samsung's trying to get it
out to market like ASAP because of the
you know rumored iphone air the 5.5 inch
screen and so I think that we're going
to see a lot of distinguishing features
coming in the fall
all that without trying to give away
anything that's far they seem well the
distinguish you know the smartphone's
from each other more so that we have in
the past and to give consumers a reason
to stick with one product over another
just a small example of that is sort of
the world that you know samsung smart
watches only work with their products
and I'm curious to see how their VR
headset if that's announced with the
note for an ephah if that's only
supportive I stamps on products with the
the right APK files as we saw on some of
the week so we'll see well and we've got
that trademark filing that for what was
it called the note edge Yeah right will
do apparently the three second phone
reset greens note edge edge event haha I
think it's too soon though yeah those I
believe me I thought of that as I'm
sitting here I but that's really
interesting but I feel like if it's this
unique smartphone with three displays
you know it would be a global event but
I'm not so sure you're right because
what was the kyocera flip phone remember
that thing it was like a clamshell but
it was like almost like a 3ds and I'd
write to sprint um also they'll remember
the edge invitation showed diamonds huh
which has many facets in galaxy yeah
that's interesting hmm no not picking
stars well welcome folks to us thinking
on the run but no I I don't I don't tend
to believe that one human again even
though I thought of it simply because
the note 4 is so close to release I
don't think they're going to do anything
else with note that is closed up mm-hmm
take the edge off it says I wonder it
could just be like diamonds are strong
and sharp and can't scratch sapphire
mighty I this is the fun we folks you
should see when the iphone invitation
comes in and we all like well what does
this shadow mean here oh which remember
which device wasn't that we were
taking screenshots of our screens to
measure the distance between apps right
yeah I forgot about that yeah we were
sitting here like leo well ok notice
that the raindrop here is slightly high
what does this tell us about the
resolution oh good grill that that that
was a fun day but I don't know it's
gonna be an interesting fall it's it's
worrying in a lot of ways I mean great
you know we're gonna have a lot to cover
but as a consumer I just I wouldn't know
what to do right now yeah what do you
buy but I guess you know this is sort of
if you think about it they're announcing
these in September they might say i
think a lot of these companies might say
available in the next point once and
then sort of on the market ready for
holiday so this is sort of the holiday
buyers yeah I they need to have I think
we're due for a refresh in a lot of ways
from a lot of these companies so yeah
it's nuts so we we've got a couple
questions coming in here for stuff
related to the fall here and Sasha Mahal
asks way you think the iphone 6 will
have feature wise i think it will make
calls and I I think it will have some
web browsing and apps yeah I'm curious
to see what it had I mean feature wise i
think it'll have everything we you know
all the rumors have had that we've
written ten thousand times with it but i
think you know larger display with 4.7
inches improve touch ID it's apparently
going to be I guess able to recognize
your fingerprint quicker um what else
have we heard you know thinner body
hopefully more storage or I'd love to
see you like 128 gig iphone but I don't
know yeah you know and that's the thing
though you know okay finds the the 5 and
5s we're definitely seeing a body change
with the six but really what else can a
Polly do at this point to make their
phones that innovative anymore well I
think a lot I think what we're seeing is
sort of the software play
and with Yosemite and iOS 8 and the way
that they work together and you can you
know go back and forth between your
phone and your computer I think that
sort of makes you you know stick inside
the ecosystem say like well you know i'm
going to use an iphone now too but
speaking of that I mean looks like
Google is doing the same thing with
chrome OS and Chromebooks and talking
Android which would be really excited
see I actually can't wait that quick
quick for those that may have missed the
first few meds where is Joey Joey will
be back Joey's having computer problems
he's not off the show it's just a matter
of technology not being cooperative ok
so next up we have from a Drake carries
EV is Android L coming to the nexus 4 i
believe so not at least not officially
yet but i wouldn't be surprised to see
some improvement yeah it seems you even
if the nexus 6 releases that's only two
generations back it it seems likely that
it will get anger del but uh get
everything right now officially it's
just Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 yeah but mexis
for seems likely but yeah we do not know
official i'm sure there's sure there are
guides to get it on uh speaking also of
new devices in the fall Sasha Mahal asks
do you think that the Moto 360 will be
worth it when it eventually is released
and how much could it go for should you
and I go over our thoughts so far on
Android wear yeah I actually put it on I
I think the only time I put it on is
this podcast too slowly ok I'll word um
if there's nothing good about it waiting
I think there's potential I think
there's potential for Android wear but I
first thought we think the Moto 360 is
going to cost more than the the G watch
or the gear live yea I'm guessing like 3
350 right and this is not a condemnation
of the 360 this is a whole problem just
with Android wear and the fact is
Android wear was not
for the public yeah it just does nothing
it'll like it's delayed in a lot of ways
I'm gonna hang out you know 10 minutes
later I can put this on earlier and I
gotta hang out for like from this
morning like what that pebble is so much
better yeah I mean you do get the
colored screen which is cool naughty
could do anything with it hmm I'm trying
to like there we go xvid there's a lot
of swiping around yeah I don't waste
your money on it now yeah maybe maybe
they'll get some good app soon but like
right now I haven't found any app that
would make it worth it and I heard you
know I've read reports um bill good
friend of ours from Android Central I
guess was trying to check in to a flight
and I think he was using the tell to
happen like it just he was like yeah
just not made for your wrist like a
boarding pass so I mean that was the
only thing that kind of seemed cool
about it to me at first yeah I mean I
just I even those last trip I went on
after urban I just used my iphone for my
boarding pass as that's what I you these
days too now so nope sorry the 360 now
unless it's like let's like got great
battery life and is introduced I mean we
can't forget that Motorola is still
working with Google right like I think
they're still part of Google the deal
hasn't closed with Lenovo so I think you
still have some of that team there that
worked on the Moto X and those devices
and that's a fantastic device and if
they take some of that inspiration and
the cool stuff that they did there and
bring it over to the watch then maybe
there's just unique features to the Moto
360 that make it worth buying so that's
Rosie so we we've got a couple questions
here from and I'm going to apologize in
advance shashwat punjabi i I'm very
sorry if I mispronounced your name what
do you guys think about the samsung
galaxy alpha uh I'm just gonna say from
a physical look hey who put the samsung
logo on my iPhone yes
seriously that's crazy I mean it's cool
that Samsung's finally listening to
people in using metal and their phones
but it does look like an iPhone to me
except from not from the back but you
know sighs still get precisely from the
red screen right mm-hmm p i think it was
so not even 1080 p which is crazy and
then no expandable storage so no microSD
and I know that manufacturers have said
well it's hard when we have a body you
can't like you know add that well HTC
sort of proved everybody wrong with the
One m8 I mean it can be done so maybe
it's to keep costs down I'm even you
have the metal body it's a little more
expensive and you don't want to toss a
1080p screen on there i don't know but
again just HTC did it so i will say that
you know i keep meaning to ask you this
and this is the perfect time because I'm
sure I'm not the only one who does
another sigh I was responsible folks for
rang up the spec pages you see on the
product pages so I'm entering all the
sensors what in the world is a hall
sensor I have no idea hall sensor it is
samsung has been putting it on like
every phone now for all of here Oh
voltage I guess okay because everyone
needs that I don't know me no I mean
like maybe it's just so that the I have
no idea but maybe so that the power is
always well I'll say this they they
loaded the sucker with sensors I uh huh
it's swimming in sensors but yeah I just
you know for as long as we'd been
following this phone and everyone's like
you know oh it there's going to be an
all metal found on all that it's very
mid-range you know and it's freaky to me
to say that a 720p display is mid-range
you know when a year ago it wasn't but
you know when you've got 2k displays
coming out in 4k displays and just about
everybody's at 1080p you just if you're
trying to go in a new direction you
don't launch it with a lower tier
display right
yeah what's the point especially when
you're a company known for your screens
yeah exactly right Hall effect I looked
it up by I think it's for having a more
accurate compass gotcha okay so I every
time the samsung phone i write that up
I'm like what is this I you know does it
check your hall pass to make sure you're
allowed to go to the restroom yeah right
this is first time I've ever heard of
its that's interesting yeah from fayez
alum again folks I am sorry if I
mispronounced names is buying nexus 7
worth it not right now yeah I probably
just wait a little bit and see I mean
there's a lot of rumors about HTC and
Google and building this nexus 8 i'd
wait see what comes out when Nexus I
mean Google's promised next Android L
this fall for the final release and I'm
sure they're gonna have new products
that it with it so I believe even though
I mean you can be safe and knowing that
your nexus 7 will get it but again if
you just wait till the fall the price
will drop on that yeah well and let's be
very clear we are not in any way saying
that Nexus 7 is not a great tablet
actually is a great tablet yeah i love
the nexus 7 but we're so on the cusp of
so many tablets coming out at this point
i would just wait and at least until
after Eva yeah just see what you know
just you you know what's coming soon
yeah I cuz that there's so many I'm sure
there I'm sure there's a lot of the
tablets that Aoife that will be going
I'm sorry what was that mouthful of a
name oh yeah that that's Todd's of my
favorite game when he has to you know do
a video on the a 9700 dash two yeah FY
yeah and there's one but but this is the
one with the 13-megapixel camera because
the other one Fc model is launching
latin america with an 8 megapixel cam so
don't get them confused what was it was
it felt like two years ago you you would
run into like four or five tablets from
the same company that all had model
names like that
sleep I don't have any conversations you
and I had about wait that's the one wet
wait what Aoife stuff too cuz a lot of
the spec sheets and stuff and I'm the
feature guards are in German that's
crazy I mean they're hosting an
important out but it's hard for us as
you guys presently as things fall off
the top of my imac because I'm but you
know what it seemed yes and stuff they
frequently have don't they frequently
have like different language guides they
do do they get so yeah so be interesting
uh let's see here we've got a holy gotta
live questions thank you all everyone
for sending those in from Benjamin
MacDonald will the Moto G get Android L
yeah i think is affirmed right I think
my Moto G you confirm you have to don't
worry there we've got a couple questions
on this so what even though this is
gaming and joey is not here to comment
joey and i actually were talking about
this this morning from Drakkar zv what
do you think of the rise of the Tomb
Raider being Xbox exclusive I think it's
freaking stupid well first off ahead
look it was cleared up this morning that
is a timed exclusive right so it is
coming to the PlayStation 4 we just
don't know when yet that being said that
was a really stupid announcement
yesterday um wonder how many people like
ran out oh it what you should if you got
over to Crystal Dynamics blog and looked
at the comments basically plagues were
were wished upon Crystal Dynamics along
with Beth and everything else Wow tomb
raider was a dying franchise up until
the reboot and the fact that the
playstation 4 selling so many more
consoles right now than the xbox one
that's not us saying that it's better
than peer mathematical fact the fact
that the playstation 4 selling more
units than the xbox one right now it was
just not a wise move and you have to
wonder how much money microsoft threw at
them to get this but that being said now
that we know it's a time
exclusive a ya get something soon yeah
you know and there there's every chance
that the PlayStation version will come
with something extra because of the
extra delay that'd be nice day out worth
the wait yeah exactly so I wouldn't get
too worked up about it especially since
it's time to exclusive at this point hmm
oh well I i can tell todd i'll let you
answer this one from shashwat punjabi is
it worth buying a note 3 right now with
the note for being announced at Aoife ya
know same thing i believe especially
because there's rumors that samsung is
going to try to get to market really
quickly so it doesn't sound like there's
a big waiting period too well and
there's also a good chance that the note
3 will see a massive price reduction
yeah as soon as the note 4 is a noun so
if the note 4 isn't appealing to you and
you go oh I wish I could on three it
will stick around for a while and you'll
probably see a massive price drop on
that mm-hmm so very still a great phone
though I still low oh my oh heck my
mothers still using a note 2 and she
loves it yeah because EFA's in what
three weeks four weeks yeah it's creepin
up a lot of stuff I lied to him on the
first so so yeah if you can wait I'd
wait without question hmm from Benjamin
MacDonald will android TV kill ps4 and
xbox one no way yeah absolutely no way
it's somewhat like comparing apples and
oranges you're talking about a streaming
service / device compared to a gaming
console / streaming service and it's
going to have more power you know the
consoles are gonna have more power it's
now yeah it's just not possible uh oh
here's an interesting question from
Tehran Sorenson do you feel that there
are good wireless hdmi displayport
products for home computer users gamers
I've really I've known this way yeah me
neither
yeah I I don't know why I wireless hdmi
to me just sounds problematic yes I
remember reporting on it years ago um
when it was coming to fruition I don't
think I've really played with it since
then I thought I think I suppose yeah I
would love to try it too I just my
feeling has always been that you're
talking about high definition content I
can't imagine they're not being some lag
yeah and some loss iya ya so it's just
not been something that any of us have
ever tried you know yes believe me I
have spaghetti behind my television like
yeah how do you find towards see the
extenders now um ok so my television has
four ports I have two splitters ready
I'm looking at my gadgets i think i have
three things for things that's funny
taurus there oh yeah yeah super t-cell
like okay um so as the streaming guy
I've got yo name is on fire TV hooked up
a Roku hooked up I've got xbox one
playstation 4 the lead so between those
two devices uh that's another nine ports
so I have 11 hdmi ports that's crazy one
of my splitters though is kind of cool
because it has two outputs so we
actually we drilled a hole through the
floor of our family room we have drop
ceilings in our basement and we're an
HDMI one hdmi cable under the floor up
to the television in the kitchen so now
like if we're watching something on roku
it can show them both televisions oh
that's awesome yeah yes and it was a
interesting fun project yo wait wait I
can't find the hole ah yeah it's since
we have drop ceilings we were like yeah
why not yeah right
easier but makes it on the appletv so
yeah the appletv the broken and the fire
TV go through this those two splitter
babe yeah I've got just a few hdmi ports
so yes I I could understand the appeal
wireless HDMI but still I don't know I'm
not sure it really ever caught on mm-hmm
so like it I think like I think the only
place i've seen is in like high-end you
know houses where they have to it's just
like like a couple feet away from the
box and they hang the TV on the wall is
you know nephrotoxic troll hole but I've
never really seen how it works yeah and
well it works whether I definitely could
understand if you want to hang your
television you know I I can get that but
I I just I don't know I still think
there has to be some sort of signal loss
yeah like one intra review and didn't
examine that like I said I haven't even
heard it mentioned I mean you can walk
his I'm yeah you mentioned you wrote
about years ago and I remember writing
about as well but I really i can't
remember last time I saw anyone even
talk about it yeah we have a mystery to
solve now yeah let's look at you now we
just need a talking dog and yeah we got
away with it two of you have been for
you meddling kids from Julian Stevens
when do you think the Moto 360 will be
released I I think any time now yeah it
seems like it's coming up they're coming
free Todd like in here the fleece yep
that's 29 stories away Wow from the 29
yeah yeah I'm Way up here its last time
my my dad's father was the captain of a
fire department in Phoenix and he
drilled into me never ever stay above
the sixth floor of a building up dream
and live up here yeah because that is as
high as hook and ladders go yeah I'm
dude so even when I stay at hotel
I'm like first floor first floor yeah I
can't like that hotels too but I don't
know yeah i just i prefer first floor
thanks Nick you've been Hatton right
here yeah I know uh let's see Oh
interesting question from Benjamin
McDonald I have a moto g I have a lot of
scratches on it I hate cases what is the
best way to fix scratches I really don't
know yeah I don't know either yeah I
don't talk to me about scratches I'm the
guy that tried boiling his call of duty
game and rubbing peanut butter and
toothpaste on it I was trying to get the
scratches half f it and I would read
like every guide online and by the time
i was done it was just scratched to
smithereens ya gotta love it yeah
unfortunately benjamin that's the
majority of the the TechnoBuffalo crew
or case people yeah actually hear your
case too yeah I all all my phones are in
kit well not all my phones like because
oddly enough no one's making a case for
the moto one herb for the oneplus one
yet even on amazon not that I've seen ah
i'll have to look some more but I mean
that feel like people on Amazon of cases
for phones don't exist yet like yeah the
thing is there's like 10,000 people i
have the one plus one right yeah yeah
who's gonna make a case fat and no we're
not going to discuss the contest yeah no
uh from oh I'm going to apologize in
advance again damad har fota I am so
sorry when do you think the mac mini
will be refreshed um I don't know wasn't
there rumors about that happening soon
yeah what let me see anything we'll
check that lets people yeah i'm i'm
pulling up when was the last time the
mac mini was refreshed um it was
recently mentioned on apple's website
amid
2014 model it doesn't exist yet so right
so it's been six hundred fifty nine days
since the last refresh Thank You
macrumors uh and the average is distance
yeah it's the average is three hundred
seventy three days so it's way overdue
but yeah that you're sort of see what
they do with the next one yeah there
there was a mention though however in a
recent device guide published by apple
of the mention of a mac mini 2014 so I
would assume it's coming this fall yeah
it is referred to as the mid-2014 so i
would say any day now my guess is there
it won't be announced at an event though
it'll just appear on apple site unless
it has like a unique new body I mean
approaching seven hundred days seems
like they could give plenty of time to
do something no yeah uh I would assume
very soon so uh from oh my from siddhant
Gotama is Moto X a goodbye yes but I
would wait since we're probably seeing
the Moto X plus one soon yeah that's why
the title of the show is bitty busy fall
because all these products are getting
refreshed but yeah moto X is a great buy
actually Joey on our staff still uses
one else's daily driver dad Joey loves
his moto x and and Joey's not a phone
guy right uh Sasha I know you've been
asking us from last week hey Sean any
thoughts on guardians of the galaxy
haven't seen it yet really doc I'm so
when do I have time to go out to the
field yeah and my prime movie watching
time is their airplane flights yep
that's the only time i watch movies yeah
i know i believe me my iPad is loaded to
the gills and the second i sit down that
seat i'm watching catching up on uh-huh
from shush wat punjabi what do you think
about the Amazon fire phone um well I
obviously haven't had a lot of time with
it but I did play with it
before it was released that wasn't I was
not impressed and I are guys in the
office you have it or not impressed
either yeah I played with it when I was
out in irvine yeah no not even at all
first try the problem is to like okay
the Firefly feature is neat right like
you can scan objects and you can buy it
from the Amazon but you can do that in
Android and iOS apps with it's called
flow it just it just doesn't like
recognize TV shows and music which
Firefly does but like I feel like that
was like one of the big standout
features right aside from the what a
dynamic perspective display which seems
kind of pointless to me oh no yeah as
well and they blew it with the pricing
yeah I really think they should have
done and I think you agreed and we
talked about this on one episode like a
moto x style sale 350 bucks I'd have one
on my desk yeah that was pretty much
what all does set if he'd come in at a
lower price most of us would about it
and also the fact that they went carrier
exclusive and that's not a slam on 18t
whatsoever right but limiting yeah it if
they got exclusive with verizon
exclusive with tmobile exclusive of
spring any of them I was at the same
thing I just think carrier exclusivity
was not a bright idea yeah and now I'm
saying I'd have it on my desk because I
probably would have bought it the day it
was announced I'm not sure I pocket now
even at 350 box same here same here I
you and I both have a bad addiction to
buying edges buying gadgets I in I'm
although i will say probably the biggest
regret I've ever had is that lasted
g-watch yep but Sir Tom what you're
gonna do yeah but hey i bought a
Chromebook yesterday so yeah see that's
what i need to get in mine
Chromebook it I used one when i was on
irvine i liked it and for the price that
deal yesterday on amazon him is really
hard to say no to especially since
they'll work on t-mobile's free data
system right i kind of want to check out
the tiger k 1 powered was easier that
just they just announced to yeah because
that seems like a pretty powerful chip
we saw it in the shield tablet and that
thing a thing cruises through games so
I'm interested to see um if there's any
way that I can edit video on a
Chromebook then I probably use one like
all the time yeah looks really chose and
stuff I don't know if it's a battery
that's fight you sent me to four
alternatives to audacity mm-hmm listen
some alternatives to video editing ooh
yeah very interest you mean why I
bookmark that site it's been better
that's really interesting yeah cuz i
love my macbook air but i just i don't
know there's something about the
Chromebook the battery life in just the
simplicity of it all you know it's just
the web right now where we spend that's
where we spend ninety nine percent of
our time you know any time my internets
gone down i'm like now what now what I'm
here it's like I guess I could go into
word and edit a document yeah what's the
plan we do that yeah well you're easy
from taj mahal good question with back
to school going on which would be better
for college the regular 13-inch macbook
pro or the retina macbook pro the
program requires game macbook pro the
program is journalism um mmm you Greta
seems pretty sweet it's expensive though
depends what your budget is you'll be
totally fine with a 13-inch MacBook Pro
ya BA if you're not doing video editing
or heavy graphics editing I think you
could go away without doing the retina
um I'm curious with journalism why they
don't allow macbook air I mean you go to
the precedence oh I've almost all of us
happen with carys yeah that's a good
question actually that that's an
excellent question why when they allow
an error um
I think you could live without retina I
it would be nice but if you're on a
budget I think you could definitely live
without it yeah but if you can afford it
and look at it why not yeah totally if
you have the budget I totally go retina
do we get some lag here oh um okay let's
see what else did we got here and again
thank you all for all these great
questions it's loaded and we appreciate
that also from sasha balan that this is
an interesting quotient samsung and
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook thoughts interesting
so they have oh yeah that's another
press conference coming right yeah I
think so uh it's interesting I think for
for the note business hardware just
wasn't working out for them I think
developing and selling their own so I
think it's a wise business move to go
with Samsung to build these tablets and
I think that's what we'll see next right
last time it was the tab for a point oh
I'm trying to remember what which one
they launched together recently um this
one sounds like more of a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
yeah product we'll see I mean right now
amazon seems to be really killing that
market so they're gonna have to do
something again distinguish themselves
from amazon yeah and the thing is the
nukes were nice devices hmm you know it
just amazon was everywhere right the
kindle had just couldn't survive so i
wouldn't be surprised to see like galaxy
tab s used with Barnes &amp;amp; Noble because
when Barnes &amp;amp; Noble sold their nook HD
tablets they very much focused on the
display quality and how nice it was to
read magazines and books and the galaxy
tab s has that really really great
display super high quality so i'm gonna
guess it's a galaxy tab s with some
barnes noble branding special features
super interesting question from Benjamin
McDonald
I have an xbox 360 but i only use it for
streaming netflix etcetera should i bike
well i think we lost you sure where I
did I'm crass and stop
I don't know if we lost Shawn anybody
okay Sean might be frozen here he's
talking about we're talking about the
xbox 360 but only use it for streaming
netflix etc should i buy a chromecast
and stop paying for xbox live gold yeah
if you're using it only for netflix i'd
go with the xbox live gold because I
mean I go with the chrome past because
otherwise you're paying for something
you're not really using right and and
for chromecast we're spending about $35
and was just on sale for I think 2999 on
Amazon so look out for the sales um
definitely goodbye there I'll go through
the questions cuz it looks like Sean's
frozen here what features you think the
Nexus 6 will have from Sasha Mahal I'm
really not sure what we're going to see
from features let's see what Sean such
thing yeah this system decided to do a
backup right now I'm not sure what
features will see what the Nexus 6 um it
depends who builds it right i think if
rumors say she sees involved hopefully
we see some metal and if if L choose
involved to get I'd love to see
something based on the g3 which i think
is a fantastic phone um let's see HTC
One m8 and ii eight comparison we
actually just ran that on the site and I
guess you're trying to figure out what
the differences are the e8 sort of the
plastic version of the MA but they did
make some changes so it doesn't have the
duo camera and i believe the boomsound
speakers are the same and the software
should be relatively the same so really
just plastic first metal body hopefully
the lower costs but in terms of United
States we haven't heard much about that
coming here what features are most
important for you for the iphone 6 from
see benfey um for me i'd like to see
battery life improved drastically right
because my current iPhone 5s is just
always dying on
almost all the time and and I think
androids progress to the point where you
see the g3 HTC One m8 galaxy s5 got all
these great power saving features and
really really do get anything through a
full day of use but the iphone still
it's dead about like three or four
o'clock so I'd like to see advancements
their screen technology has been
actually like fine for me on the iphone
5s I really don't feel like it's um you
know pixelated or anything like that but
I'd like to see it advance further with
with the 4.7 inch display and even the
5.5 inch display get a little sharp or
quad HD like i was saying i love lychee
three right now that would be awesome
i'm not so sure that will see it and
then things like mobile payments i want
to see Apple sort of take that off so
far mobile payments have kind of you
know fluttered we have Isis here in the
United States and we have google wallet
you can use it in some places but not
others and requires NFC and Apple has
been reluctant to include NFC but I
think we'll see some approach to mobile
payments from Apple that hopefully
actually pushes the industry so we can
use our phones as well it's moving
forward but I think I'm gonna think I'm
going to wrap this up for us today
because Sean seems to have a time
machine running in the background right
now so he's completely frozen but thank
you everybody for joining the show and
we'll see you next week bye
