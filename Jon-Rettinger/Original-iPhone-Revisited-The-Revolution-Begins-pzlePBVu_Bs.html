blackberry Windows Mobile and Symbian
they were big they were clunky and they
were not full-featured well that changed
on January 9 2007 when Steve Jobs walked
into the Macworld stage to announce
three new products widescreen iPod with
touch controls a revolutionary mobile
phone and a breakthrough internet device
by this point you should know he was
talking about just one phone the
original iPhone and as the iPhone 7 is
upon us that was a good time to look
back at the original iPhone how that
changed a mobile landscape what that
meant for Android and what that meant
for how our lives you're going to change
the iPhones never been about specs and
that was definitely true back in 2007
nothing here is going to blow you away
then or now 3.5 inch LCD screen with
resolution of 320 by 480 163 PPI
it was quad-band 2g edge only and at 802
11 only B&amp;amp;G and a 2 megapixel camera and
perhaps the most important feature of
the iPhone is that it could be charged
and synced your computer with iTunes
using the same 30 pin connector found in
iPods the original iPhone was a lot of
things one thing it wasn't though with
CDMA which meant no verizon Sprint's and
it was locked not even t-mobile choose
the same GSM technology could use it the
og iPhone would with singular or bust
the despite being announced in January
the phone wasn't shipped until June 28
2007 initially priced at 499 and $5.99
for a 4 gigabyte an 8 gigabyte model
respectively and those prices well they
might seem reasonable now were unheard
of at the time but in 600 bucks for a
phone seemed out of this world for a lot
of consumers so despite the marketing
hype and then reality distortion field
around the phone the price kept the
phone from getting to a lot of consumers
hands so in September 5th 2007 at the
beat goes on music event Steve Jobs not
only introduced the first ipod touch he
doubts they were dropping the 4 gig
phone completely they were going to drop
the price the aching model to $399
who said purchased the iPhone and the
14-day period before that event we're
eligible for $200 price protection
rebate Apple or AT&amp;amp;T so yeah people were
pissed a few months after the
announcement Apple goes and drops a
model and cuts the price responds to
customer complaints a day out for the
beat goes on events of September 6th
Steve Jobs and open lettered iPhone
customers every one who purchased an
iPhone at the high
price is not receiving a rebate or other
consideration would get $100 credit
redeemed in stores or online history has
been really kind to the iPhone and I
think it should be but at the time of
its announcement the phone was equally
known for what it lacked as for what it
revolutionized there was no hardware
keyboard here no stylus the iPhone
wasn't rocking a pretty common removable
use replaceable battery or even some
sort of expandable storage support none
of that made the power users happy nor
the absence of any sort of file system
cut copy and paste video recording not
to mention that insane recessed
headphone jack and me plugging in most
on Apple headphones
next to impossible seems like Apple's
had have been dead against a headphone
jack since the first day it's hard to
think of the iPhone now without the App
Store but that was not parley virginal
iPhones plans in fact Steve Jobs headed
web apps as the future the original
software in the iPhone dubbed iPhone OS
one set the stage for current iOS 10
looks like if you look back with that
original OS look like versus now say for
being able to change the background and
some icons being modified things still
look very familiar the design the iPhone
think it's held up pretty well it
doesn't look as modern as it once did
I'm so not the biggest fan of the black
plastic bit at the bottom so with the RF
through the aluminum still feels nice in
the hand and the phone is oddly still
zippy despite all the drama at the
iPhone there's no doubt it changed who
we are and how we use electronics how we
perceive electronics not to mention
Capote shook up how phones were bought
and took power away from the carriers
with the motors and manufacturers now my
allegiances may have changed and swayed
over the years but I'll always remember
with the iPhone meant to me and how it
changed my life and my career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
