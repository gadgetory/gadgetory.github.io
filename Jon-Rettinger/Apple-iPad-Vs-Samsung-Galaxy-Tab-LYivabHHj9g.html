from TechnoBuffalo here tablets are
bound to be the hot item this holiday
season and two tablets currently reign
supreme in one corner we have the Apple
iPad and the other we have the contender
the Samsung Galaxy Tab with wrens
playbook looming large least two are
really top of mind I'm gonna put these
two head-to-head in an eighth round
tablet smackdown and see who comes out
on top these types of comparisons are
bound to enrage fans on either side
I think the Comets will be fun to watch
the eight rounds are gonna break down
into display operate system wireless
storage camera browser performance and
battery life we will declare a winner
there obviously a myriad of other topics
we could choose from we had to pick
eight than I thought semis the strengths
weaknesses and server brought these two
tablets best head-to-head let's go ahead
and jump right in with the displace and
say our tablets it's what you're gonna
be looking at while you're doing
everything with both of these devices
the iPad has a nine point seven inch IPS
display with the resolution of 768 by
1024 Galaxy Tab is a little bit smaller
at 7 inches with a resolution of 600 by
1024 Galaxy Tab is a little bit of a
higher pixel density than the iPad but
the scree on the iPad just looks
beautiful for watching video and
pictures and it seems to just pop a
little bit more than the Galaxy Tab does
trying to see what video looks like on
the Galaxy Tab or the iPad I'm sure to
check out previous videos I'll put links
down below but suffice to say the screen
on the iPad just looks better we're not
talking about the size or anything just
a quality of the display a one nice
thing where the Galaxy Tab does shine
over the iPad and display skin point is
in the e-book section text looks very
very very nice with a higher pixel
density and there's a little bit less
layer while reading books than you get
with the iPad but if it takes sort of
the view overall when you look at video
pictures books web browsing everything
that you would do at a screen the iPad
definitely takes this round alright so
next we're going to
into operating system the galaxy tab is
running a customized version of Android
2.2 samsung put a lot of tweaks into
sort of optimize it for a tablet and is
by no means an tablet operating system
it certainly meant for mobile phones but
Samsung has done a very nice job of sort
of using some of the things they learned
with the Galaxy S series of devices and
their TouchWiz tweaks to make it this
will work very well as tablet operating
system jump into applications scrolling
is very smoothy sort of see the icons
are encapsulated they both look very
very similar they jump into the e-book
reader now looks very similar to what
we've seen on other devices they've done
a nice job taking what wasn't meant to
be a tablet operating system really sort
of tableting it up and making it work
quite well if you want to see a full
software overview again there'll be a
link down below to that on the Galaxy
Tab one of the nice thing about the
Galaxy Tab as well is that it's running
Android and it is of course open so one
of the things you can look forward to is
people probably rooting the device and
getting access to sort of customize it
and make it suit you the best I like to
make the potential for custom roms on
the other side of the fence the iPad is
not brick system that was modified for
the tablet and it's apples very
vertically integrated me and they
control the software they control the
hardware so the operating system was
made for this tablet device certainly
was modified from the iPhone if you used
an iPad you know you're gonna get a
little bit of a walk down scenario but
with that lockdown missed you're gonna
get access to the iTunes Store which
will let you rent movies rent TV shows
and certainly the app store as well as
opposed to the Android Marketplace they
didn't get on the galaxy tab sorry the
Android versus iOS is the baked me to
talk about for quite some time then
today this is gonna come down to
personal preference whether or not you
prefer Android whether that you prefer
iOS my big worry was not how Android
performs as operating system about
Spirit perform as a tablet operating
system and I've seen in drinks how it's
not perform all that well but Samsung
has done a really nice job about making
Android work very nicely on a tablet
device so this round personal preference
definitely has to be a drop next let's
talk about wireless
these things don't have e to network so
they got to rely on wireless signals to
get all their network information the
iPad of course comes with Wi-Fi you can
get an AT&amp;amp;T 3G version the Galaxy Tab of
course is Wi-Fi as well but will be
available on every carrier in the US and
myriad of carriers abroad as well so you
can pick the best network service off
for you and you can choose pay-as-you-go
plans for each of the carrier sure
you're not limited to just one you can
choose whether or not you want even
access that Wireless information so
because you can pick your carrier you're
not limited to one if you don't get good
AT&amp;amp;T service you can go with Verizon you
go with Sprint or t-mobile depending on
where you're gonna be they're all going
to offer a flavor of the Galaxy Tab so
that definitely gives the Galaxy Tab a
very nice edge in a wireless department
this is a categorical II important to
some people if you're not near Wi-Fi and
you want to have a signal and sort of
use this as a media device or use it for
business device you need to have a
signal rubber you are and being able to
pick the network of your choice really
is a nice boon for the Galaxy Tab so
next let's talk about storage gotta
store some things on these devices I
kind of even be able to get 16 and 32
gigabyte configurations at this point
let me jump in and say I'm not
mentioning price on purpose these videos
sort of are viewed over a long period of
time and price values devices change
expectedly pretty regularly stiffly the
Galaxy Tab apples prices are pretty
solid starting at $4.99 the galaxy cab
prices are bound to fluctuate from
carrier to carrier in from region to
region so the iPad from the two
configuration 16 or 32 I just heard of
limited at bat you can't expand or
contract depending on your needs the
galaxy tab the base one comes in to 16
gigabytes but it does feature on the
side a micro SD card slot where you can
go and edit and put in rather pick a
card as you want sort of make this
customized a little bit better for you
and I'm not really going through and
showing all these things gothic system
that I'm talking about there's some time
I want to just give you a general
overview and talk about them so because
the galaxy tab lets you pick as much
storage as you want or 32 is not enough
you can certainly keep going up you can
add a 32 gigabyte card
in fact that on-chip 16-gig internal
storage you have again a bit more
flexibility at the galaxy tab which
probably ties into the openness of
android so for a storage standpoint the
galaxy tab is also going to take this
round and I would be remiss to not talk
about cameras when dealing with to
tablets and that's one area really where
the galaxy tab is definitely a winner
just the fact it has a camera and it
does actually have two cameras it's got
a 1.3 megapixel sensor on the top and
it's got a 3 megapixel camera with
autofocus and flash on the back the iPad
clearly leads without any sort of camera
and that's important to a lot of people
I thought it was one of the big
determining factors and there is
separate of differences between these
two I've never seen a trend here the
Galaxy Tab is also going to take this
round so I've done a lot of overviews on
the browser's and sort of what each of
them look like and sort of the nuances
of each I will say that Android Browser
is Andrew browser you've seen on really
every other Android phone and the iOS
browser and Mobile Safari actually what
you've seen on the iPhone and the iPad
many times before main difference here
just has been tweaked a little bit for
the tablet miss I would say you get a
little more graphical niceness
I would say but you also get full flash
10.1 support which may not be important
to you or it may be essential to you
again it gives you the option to whether
or not you want to have flash support
whether that you want it to be there if
it's essential then you're going to have
that choice if you don't need it you
want to save battery you can go ahead
and turn that off and I've sort of done
these head tech comparison with browsers
with Android and iOS devices quite a bit
and the flash support that Android gives
almost always gives it an edge so if
you're looking for a really solid
browser with nice pinch to zoom this is
going to be a great way to go here we've
got Google loaded up Galaxy Tab is once
again going to take the browser around
next let's talk about performance this
is sort of another area where that
vertical integration really comes into
play again the fact that Apple controls
the software controls the hardware and
also really relates itself to better
performance these two tab
distant cousins apples a4 chip and
Samsung's hummingbird both clocked at 1
gigahertz and really sort of share a lot
of similar architecture however the
performance on the iPad is a bit
snappier the spikes are the same clock
speed so when you sort of come down to
multitasking we're sort of the iPad does
iffy with iOS 4.2 service using general
things like iBooks and other devices
it's just a little bit faster viewing
video loaded a little bit quicker video
looked a little bit smoother the iPad is
just noticeably a little bit quicker
something you have to really use both
devices through and get a sense than
nuances but suffice it to say the iPad
is definitely going to take this round
alright next let's talk about battery
you probably want to use these things
for a little while the iPad is sort of
very easy category to judge the iPads a
bit larger it's got a bigger battery
clocking in about ten hours of usage
whereas the 7-inch
Galaxy Tab has a seven hour of battery
life that's er how those are going to
break down so we put these two through
eight rounds I can already hear the
comments going crazy down below I try to
be as objective as possible and sort of
leave personal opinions out of it and
look at these like someone who didn't
know much about either device so we have
an 8 rounds total a sort of running
three again display went to the iPad OS
was a draw Wireless went to the Galaxy
Tab which I also should have mentioned
that's the European version has the
ability to make phone calls as well
storage went to the Galaxy Tab camera of
course with the Galaxy Tab browser went
to the galaxy tab for flash coming back
across the board and the iPad took
performance and the iPad took battery
life which gives us a total of iPad 3
Galaxy Tab 4 tae-won now that is not to
say the iPad is not a better overall
device personally I love the iPad think
it's a fantastic tablet it's probably my
tablet of choice but that's a personal
opinion
coming in objectively the Galaxy Tab
offers a bit more flexibility for the
user if you need more storage you have
that option if you need different
carriers to pretty give you bare network
support
punana where you are you have that
option if you're in Europe you'd want to
use it as a phone with the Bluetooth
headset you have that option if you want
to customize it because it's Android and
it's open you have that option you have
a lot of options with the Galaxy Tab
that you don't have with the iPad if
you're like to live within Apple's
limitations it's like a lot of people
obviously are you're going to get a
fantastic tablet in the iPad this is not
to say that the iPad is a bad buy or a
bad value it's just very different than
the Galaxy Tab hope this guy's helped
and hope to sort of shed some light on
which device might be better for you hi
