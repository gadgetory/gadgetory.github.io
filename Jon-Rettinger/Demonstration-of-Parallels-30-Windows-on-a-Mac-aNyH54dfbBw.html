better demonstration of parallels
desktop three point 0 which is right
here and what that does it lets you run
windows XP or Windows Vista and I
believe Linux to in your Mac environment
and all parallels does it gives you the
ability to run Windows it does not
install windows for you to do that you
need to buy parallels and also need a
full install of service pack 2 for XP or
a full install disk for vista so once
once again parallels does not give you
windows just gives you the ability to
run Windows you have to provide the
install disks on your own let's open up
parallels here thought this would be a
little easier for you guys to see with
the screen capture program then a while
back when I just had the video camera
and again the little red clicks that
show up when I click my mouse is just
from my screen capture program called
screen iam it's not from anything that
happens on my desktop normally so it
opens up microsoft windows XP I have
this particular drive title back up you
can partition as big a hard drive space
as you want believe I gave this 12 gigs
and partition how much RAM you wanted to
use my computer has two gigs so I gave
this a full one gig to use and then all
you do is you hit play right here start
a virtual machine will hit it and you'll
see you're very familiar windows boot up
screen because three years know what
that looks like this runs very smoothly
I've been extremely happy with parallel
everything I needed to do in it I've
been able to actually hardly ever even
use bootcamp anymore because I can do
everything in parallels
very handy so here it is here's my
windows environment here move my mouse
around and if I move it out then my
mouth right here is in Mac OS 10 and
right now it's back in back for windows
so it looks just like your regular
windows computer you know you can click
start close it start close it the nice
thing about is you can actually drag
files back and forth so I could take
this folder and I can drag it right out
see that and now it'll be in my mac
environment or vice versa to make it a
lot easier very nice i can drag stuff
you know right in and it'll be right
there in windows which is extremely
handy something i didn't even know that
i could do it so I played round of it so
you know like I said just your standard
windows environment and start up Firefox
you know just like you would on any
other windows computer or you can
install Word Excel or whatever if you
guys want there's Firefox updates um
haven't used this in a couple days and
you also have the ability to go full
screen which is nice I'll show you guys
that
um file really short cut for i forgot
the shortcut is though so when I find
out for you you
there is full screen pretty cool I think
um now I've got just a full on Windows
environment just like i'm running
windows on my mac which is some little
strange you know but it works looks nice
you know i can still get my taskbar down
here if I want to which makes it very
handy if I want need to open up a
program as well let me move my single
window here and there's also a really
cool there's Firefox of them cool thing
that parallels has called coherence
which allows you to run both
simultaneously pretty neat so let me
show you that go to view and click
coherence or you'll disappear for a
minute now i have my standard Windows
Start bar in addition to my doc down at
the bottom so i can open up any program
from right here no open up the windows
at the same time let's say i want it
open up the program games to open up
parts so now here's hearts looks like
it's running right in windows and if
want it open up what's a mac program i
can put up for you um i want to open up
my system preferences you know they are
running simultaneously side by side it's
really handy parallels is a great
program highly recommended you know i
think that it's a great compromise for
sometimes we have to run windows which
I'm finding is less and less frequently
less and less frequent so just real
quick overview for you guys on parallels
desktop three point out how do you
recommend it with that you guys that's
it you know parallels is a nice solid
program works well and highly
recommended so also few more things I
want to show you guys well I got a
couple new videos coming up so I'll save
all that for another video anyway guys
here is parallels hope you enjoyed talk
to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
