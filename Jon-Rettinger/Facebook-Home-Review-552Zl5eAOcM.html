technobuffalo here at the 4 review for
you of Facebook home as demonstrated on
the HTC first this is the launch version
of facebook home on the very first
device shipping with the software right
out of the box so Facebook has promised
monthly update so as it improves and if
you just get added be sure to augment
this review let's go and get started all
right so let's go ahead and get started
so this is my experience with facebook
home on the HTC first this was the
launch version and a very first version
of facebook home facebook has said that
they'll improve it on a monthly basis
all update this review as new features
come out and certainly as facebook homme
qui download and other devices the
experience might vary a little bit so to
give you guys a full disclaimer this was
used for a little over four and a half
days facebook home on the HTC first
alright so let's start with the you i
will say the UI is really really clean
facebook engineers did a really
wonderful job with it so the basic idea
is that your lock screen is your home
screen so if you unlock the phone you
don't have a password on it what you're
going to see is essentially your home
feed that you can scroll through on a
very cool sort of looking way so you can
do a few things here if you want to see
the image that's sort of scrolling
behind the status update if you long
press you can see what that looks like
if you want to like something you can
double tap it if you want a comment you
can hit that little comment button down
there you can also like via that thumbs
up so if you tap the screen you can get
a little picture of your facebook icon
if you hold that down sort of the basic
UI is going to happen so on the left to
go jump right into facebook Messenger it
looks pretty similar to facebook
Messenger on facebook or iOS if you
swipe up you're going to go to apps and
if you go over to the right you're going
to go to your most recently used app or
action I just go and jump into apps real
quickly things look a little bit
different here so you've got sort of
shortcuts or favorites here in apps
these aren't all the apps you have you
continue to scroll over to the left this
is we're going to get your traditional
android list of applications it's going
to show you what everything is on your
phone notifications here I really slick
as well reminds me kind of like what
webos used to be you can just throw them
away and slap them off
green you can stack up and throw them
away they're a little bit obtrusive
right in the middle but I found myself
really enjoying it actually probably one
of my favorite features a facebook home
they did a really nice job with it
another cool feature is chat heads and
this is one that's making its way to a
ton of other devices including even iOS
so you can be used even when Facebook
home is turned off and at least on the
HTC first or fully integrated with SMS
it's kind of a cool way to see who
you're chatting with you can open up
both the applications and still have
that chat head there you can click it
and go right into that message and reply
when you're done with that you could
swipe it right down on the screen into
that act it just looks very cool doesn't
add any more functionality than a
traditional SMS app would but it really
does look very nice alright so we've
talked about the way you I look sound
performance in what you can do but there
are a few problems so Facebook set out
to make Facebook experience right on
your phone it certainly succeeded with
that but the problem for me is that this
is also a phone so dialing a number
should take so many steps want to make a
phone call for example I got to take
this I got to go up to the top and Fitz
is over there I got to go and select
phone then I can go ahead and a dial
it's too many steps to do basic phone
functions for me and for being a phone
that's meant for facebook uploading a
picture also takes many steps so I want
to access the camera button I got to
drag this good facebook i can fly camera
from here or there and then select it
and also multitasking is pretty much
removed with facebook home so know what
you're getting into if you want to
experience that it's just going to be
facebook central and not using your
phone for much else in yeah that's also
you just fine if use your phone for a
lot of other things anything that's not
facebook takes a lot of additional steps
i can be a tad on the annoying side so
the verdict here it's very visually
appealing facebook engineers in a really
nice job making us look gorgeous and
they certainly succeeded there but for
me I don't need my whole phone to do
what an app can do now certainly the
facebook app isn't as beautiful as what
it looks like here but i can still
scroll through my home field i can still
like photos and then i can close it when
i'm done and do it ever else I want to
do on my phone chat heads is a very nice
feature and I like the fact that i can
use it even when facebook home is turned
off it's a very novel new way to
approach SMS and i get facebook credit
for trying something new I also liked it
to doing
monthly updates but we'll see what those
updates are going to be permeate
commitments to continue to improve the
experience something that should
absolutely be applauded for me though
it's not overly useful other novelty
faded very quickly and i realized i have
to do other things with my phone so for
me facebook home at least as it stands
right now gets a 5 that's for mostly
everything non-facebook is a pain this
is not an experience for everybody now
you can try and download a multiple
devices and see if it's for you but if
you want something that's again just
going to put Facebook front and center
you're going to really enjoy this if you
want to do other things on your phone
you have to make sure you can live with
those extra steps to do the things that
you're used to doing on a regular device
so love to hear your thoughts guys do
you agree with my review of facebook
home is a 5 too high to low or fair
leave your comments down below give the
video a thumbs up most definitely
appreciate it i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo i'll see you next video
