brought to you by domain.com what's up
everyone
Jon render from TechnoBuffalo here so
despite having the awesome opportunity
to play with all the tech that I can get
my hands on I'm still a tech consumer
and I'm prone to making impulse
purchases and I did I made one I thought
I'd share the experience with you so
it's got to at the Apple watch which is
arguably of varying utility if you
didn't see my review of it I essentially
said I was like a step above ambivalent
towards it at least with its first
iteration for software duration I didn't
think it did that much but I was out and
about I saw somebody wearing a leather
loop actually the brown leather loop
band I thought it looked really nice
my up watch we saw the unboxing in the
review I got the classic leather buckles
black it looks nice sort of a classic
watch look but I saw a leather loop I'm
like you know what I'm going to
foolishly probably spend hundred fifty
bucks and I'm going to buy one I think
it looks really nice so I did and it
showed up and I made a big mistake I was
a dummy dummy dummy head face and you
should not be a dummy dummy head face so
let me tell you about it and I in
retrospect it seemed silly to spend more
money on something that was already
expensive they didn't need in the first
place but I did it and I figured instead
of just like bowing my head in shame and
returning it
I would man up and I'd share my story
and hopefully save you guys a few bucks
all right so here's the deal two leather
loop first you guys haven't seen it's
magnetic it's got part of the band you
go ahead and put it around and it just
sticks on with magnets sounds pretty
good right so a few problems with it my
use case might be a bit different than
yours but I got a toddler at home that's
grabbing at things all the time and he's
grabbed it this all the time so there's
been a lot of instances where this thing
has been like dangling off my wrist or
falling off altogether because it's just
magnets so it's not you know on there
all the time
and also before you start lecturing me
on the price of rare earth metals and
where they come from
I understand matters are expensive like
I get it but $950 expensive so so put
that argument down for a minute
we can debate the cost of minerals
coming from Asia later all right so that
was problem number one with it number
two hundred fifty bucks for a band I
expect it to look nice
this thing is littered with plastic bits
and pieces the side of the band that
holds the magnets it looks
like plastic on it it's maybe is maybe
easy just looks cheap there's a plastic
bit around the top of the clasp here
it just doesn't scream quality
especially 450 bucks for a freaking band
you can get a whole moto 360 for that
cost so not impressed with the quality
not impressed with how will it sit on my
wrist
the only thing it's got going for it it
does look nice it's also really hard to
put on with one hand there we go so got
that sucker on got it done and it's
clasp it's not all terribly horrible
though if you've got a big wrist or baby
wrist duct enough matter you can adjust
the size regardless you have to worry
about what size band you're gonna get
that's nice you've got an idea for next
great website domain com has you covered
they won't hook you up with a great
offer save 20% on domain names and web
hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domain coms check out I
think domain names think domain.com the
moral being it just looks cheap it feels
cheap as I mention I got a toddler so
I'm I'll be I'll put it nicely I am
changing diapers often and I got my
hands and gross things often which means
I'm washing my hands often and I've got
my watch on I'm not taking my watch off
every time I have to wash my hands and
there are going to be little spots where
water has shown up on the leather you
can wipe them off most of the time but
I'm worried I kept this for weeks and
months that it would you would just get
worse so if you wash your hands a lot
what you should because gross gross
wash your hands more your mother would
not be happy with you you might want to
look elsewhere so here's the moral
expensive not high quality doesn't
really say on that well but looks nice
so I'm not flicking you off this is my
ring finger but looks nice so you can
decide what's important to you I made a
mistake I'm owning up to it I would love
to hear your thoughts on it comment down
below and you can debate me on the cost
of rare earth metals if you'd like
because I know you guys are going to I
just wanted to share my story with you
I've got a platform to do so and I
thought that you know what I'd share
something that I bought but my own
on and I made a mistake buying so if
you're looking to buy an Apple watch for
the classic buckle that was a much nicer
band it held up well stayed on my wrist
I liked the way it looked and I will
definitely be changing back and I guys
thank you for watching hope you enjoyed
the big subscribe button I'll be back
with actually more product reviews and
not just yelling at stupid things that I
did the next one
till then though I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo dr. guys the next video
