a lot of folks it is the iPhone that
they've been waiting for full bezel this
display the phone looks beautiful the
screen is awesome finally high
resolution and face ID and with that new
way to unlock your phone came a ton of
questions especially from me when it
comes to security and also real world
usage how's it gonna work in direct
sunlight what if I grow a beer what if I
change my hair Apple made some security
claims on stage and it wouldn't work
with masks we wanted to test all of
these things and some more to see how
face ID actually would perform out in
the real world this is JB JB does most
of our motion graphics and JB also can
grow a pretty sweet man beard which he
volunteered to do for the past two weeks
as dudes our facial hair can change so
we're gonna setup face ID with JB with
with beard and then we're gonna shave it
and see if it see if it works
Hey
so JB's clean clean shave JB embarrasses
easily it's a big it's a big deal for
him
so first beer JB for shave JB leave in
the comments down below most importantly
let's try face ID and it's the first
time we've tried it since he shaved
unlock your foam it works so polarized
sunglasses face ID if you're driving
you're probably gonna have these suckers
on and you're in a car see how it works
unlocked so what about bizarre Matt
looking polarized sunglasses let's see
how these work that worked - so what
about spider-man's wildered glasses
alrights gonna shop nope
I guess these crazy goggles keeping
things keep my eyes out of it or it's
not letting the dot see my face but if
you're if you're a welder face that he
is not gonna be a friend so one of the
biggest security concerns I had with
face ID was can somebody unlock your
phone while you're sleeping let's let's
test it
doesn't work no dice your information
safe and sneaky bag so like what if
you're a really sound sleeper or maybe
they took a sleeping pill no didn't work
thank goodness house creepy so Apple
made a point in their keynote to say
face ID will not be fooled by a mask am
I talking like Halloween mask I mean
like a nightmare fuel mask that looks
just like your face this one was made
using only three stills you could get
those stills from any video you might
have of somebody so let's go ahead and
see if this will work creepy Jabberwocky
nope
no dice so in another scenario we wanted
to see a face ID could unlock in like
the middle of a night if you're laying
in bed and complete darkness unlocked no
problem so a concern I know a lot of
people had was what if you change
hairstyles if you're a lady and you can
grow bangs you grow your hair out your
phone still gonna be able to unlock so
we wanted to test it with some wigs
alright I have not tried these on yet so
we'll see how they look
yeah does it work for me see if it works
No
No
does not like this wig did not unlock
wig number two my long flowing locks all
right see this one works
that unlock to the second try did not
work the first time Georgie
how about Pennywise
Oh loves Pennywise I'm like no problem
so a more likely scenario is that you go
from long hip to short
so we're gonna set up face ID with the
wig on and then take it off and see how
it works it's complete so let's just
check to make sure it works lock no
problem
all right I'm having having a midlife
crisis want to shave my head weight
comes off get worried unlock no problem
so earlier face unlocking technologies
could sometimes be fooled by a picture
or a video of the face so let's see how
face ID does picture of my face
not unlocking so direct sunlight
obviously another use case let's see-oh
face ID does unlock no problem
and since we're outside a more likely
use case for sunglasses let's try that
again
regular polarized unlock no problems
weird and matte polarized lenses
I'm locked no problem spider-man's
goggles
still doesn't work so overall I came
away pretty impressed with phase ID
aside from the notch stealing my
hairline it worked
about as well as I could expect I was
surprised that it didn't work with that
one wig but overall with almost
everything else it worked well I had a
bit of concern that direct sunlight and
unlocked really fast when JB shaved his
beard I don't you guys could see it but
it unlocked almost instantaneously it
seems like it takes a little bit longer
than when you used to put your thumb on
touch ID but there's at the time of you
having to move your hand to put it on
top of there so it seems like it's about
a one-to-one came across at least
initially pretty impressed with base I
mean we'll use our iPhone 10 in there
for to let you know if that changes but
in almost every scenario where you
expected it to work it did and Serio's
where we hoped it wouldn't work it
didn't perform so so far so good
for face ID but if your expenses been
with face ideas it worked for you not
work from you I'd like to know leave in
the comments down below
so JB was choice number two for the
beard this has been happening for a long
time we tried to get Jesse to shave it
for the video but it wasn't being a team
player but I'm saying it on camera if we
get 30,000 likes on this video Jesse's
gonna shave his beard so like the video
cuz I wonder what that face looks like
without that happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
