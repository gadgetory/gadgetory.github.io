warships I usually love Apple products
generally have an iPhone in my pocket
most of the year I've got an Apple watch
on I love my air pods
I use my iPad every single day they're
far from perfect and generally they have
issues and I usually get over them but
there's one Apple product that I refuse
to use I hate the Apple TV and it might
sound ridiculous but my reason is about
to matter more than ever before so I
should probably be more specific it's
not the Apple TV itself the box is fine
the UI is fine and my issue it's the
stupid remote and I took out a few good
reasons for it first I have lost this
thing about three different times
between couch cushions it is the perfect
size to fall between said cushions and
should you drop it the glass track right
here is gonna make this almost 60 bucks
to replace all of that aside it's not
economic it feels weird in the hand I
still have a hard time telling which
ways up and down despite the menu button
finally getting a ring around it there's
slight TV controls it's minimalistic and
a few buttons so I could probably do a
whole video ranting on the remote but
I'm gonna save you the rage and assume
that like you get the point I I don't
like it and switching away from Apple TV
has made me move away from things I
really like about the Apple TV and it
hasn't been a big deal in the past I
found ways to get around airplay and I
can get my movies on movies anywhere but
I'm losing a lot of the stuff that makes
the Apple TV amazing and that's going to
matter a lot more now before we continue
I want to give a big thank you to this
video sponsor world of warships if you
guys been following gaming for a while
then world of warships probably sounds
familiar it's kind of a similar gameplay
to World of Tanks or World of Warplanes
except now you know it's ships and again
it's totally free to play it's an online
strategy game
do it on a PC or a Mac done by the folks
at wargaming it features millions of
players are kind of fighting to upgrade
the army of ships weapons and armor and
again there are a lot of games but I
like this one because it's kind of a bit
more thought that goes into it it's more
of a strategy base game the more you
play the more stuff you can unlock and
you can sort of fight these battles out
on the seas with over 30 million players
worldwide the game sounds fun and you
like games that are strategic and also
totally free to play use a code play
Langley 2019 you get a bunch of awesome
stuff but the highlight for me is at
least you get the USS langley warship
which is kind of cool to see another
bunch of awesome stuff going to it down
below in case you want to learn more
again a big thank you to world of
warships so we've now got music TV shows
audiobooks and movies and all sorts of
great digital content on the iTunes
Store what about that big-screen flat TV
you just bought last weekend you'd love
to be able to say watch your movies on
that right you got to go out and somehow
get a little iTunes player here to play
this stuff let's talk about this box
this is the missing piece well here it
is this is what it looks like and
internally we call it I TV it's going to
let you enjoy your media on your
big-screen flat TV so the Apple TV in
the iPhone and actually were born in the
same year but the Apple TV actually came
out in January of 2007 and it was a
hobby as Steve Jobs said and that a
hobby kind of made little sense in
practice it was kind of like an iPod for
your TV it was kind of a convoluted mess
but that really didn't stop me from
wanting one I really wanted one just to
try it and I had a pretty awesome
girlfriend at the time who is now my
wife actually bought me the Apple TV is
about 300 bucks when it came out I
thought I was gonna use it all the time
and if you go back to the early days of
the YouTube channel it actually was the
seventh video I ever uploaded on the
John four Lakers channel was an unboxing
of
exact first-gen Apple TV over all I
really like the Apple TV does everything
I needed to do everything I wanted it to
do but we've got one more thing
actually it's one more hobby but over
the years Apple continued to develop
their hobby but there's still the knock
on the first Apple TV was it was
expensive and they also started facing
mounting competition in this hobby space
from companies like Roku that releasing
really low price options and during the
second gen which got totally redesigned
it's thin its small and most importantly
they dropped the price down to 99 bucks
and also now you had a portal to get
into the recently launched Netflix
streaming service so the second and
third gen Apple TVs looked pretty much
the same the revised internal specs the
next big change that we saw was from
third to fourth gen where it got extra
thick and it's still the same that we
have right now with the Apple TV 4k it
looks pretty much identical but the big
one that the Apple TV 4th gen brought
was the App Store so now you can
actually download the apps that you
wanted it also brought the iconic remote
if you even want to call it that to play
here so now Apple was allowing people to
actually pick what apps they want to
distribute from iTunes is still the
preferred one for Apple but it gave
choice to consumer to pick whatever they
wanted to watch their shows or movies on
you could now do it on the Apple TV
so at the Apple TV right now I think has
a few key advantages so first you get
access to the iTunes library right out
of the box and that's huge you've got
first-run movies rentals you probably
have the best way to access movies
especially new releases out there of any
platform airplay is huge as well being
airplay your own videos from your phone
build your screen mirroring outside of
those sort of key benefits Apple TV
doesn't really offer anything else it
seems to me that Apple is very clearly
at a fork in the road are they gonna go
all-in on hardware or are they gonna
sort of veer toward maybe they haven't
gone before and focus on Apple TV as an
experience more software based
things are changing apples gotten events
it's a few days as of this filming maybe
already happened by the time you watch
this and it's gonna be all about that
streaming service they're gonna square
up we're gonna put their guns up to
Netflix they're gonna say we got
original content too we want your eyes
come watch your Apple shows but this is
like the start of Apple Studios I'm not
talking like the Beatles this is where
like Apple starts making TV shows and
movies that's clearly like a new Apple
so I don't know if you guys remember
your history of books but like any time
you follow it in war history an invasion
takes time and the invasion takes
planning and Apple has been planning
their invasion and their war with
Netflix and Hulu and Amazon for a really
long time they've got shows that are
already wrapped seasons already done
directors already hired for upcoming
content scripts that are finalized they
are ready for this and they're committed
and they started preparing years ago for
this announcement so I know what they're
gonna do for pricing the rumor is that
some stuff will be free some stuff of
behind a paywall but at least all those
folks with some sort of Apple products
have the opportunity to see the content
they're not requiring people necessarily
go and download an app from another app
store the idea is that's already going
to mathematically show up with your next
software update right on your home
screen or just you know right on your
phone the kind of the elephant in the
room if you've ever read the Walter
Isaacson biography on Steve Jobs
evidently Jobs Friends of his life said
he cracked TV he cracked how to do it
and maybe this is job's vision that
we're going to be seeing everybody
thought it was gonna be a physical TV
set but maybe some intuitive UI maybe
that wasn't what he cracked all along
maybe the jobs had some sort of
foresight that the Netflix model was
going to work maybe his cracking of TV
was get in front of as many people as
possible and I couldn't imagine a more
unjabi in approach to something but if
you could say anything about Steve Jobs
he was definitely not conventional so if
there's one thing I think tech giant's
have learned since the iPhone
is don't underestimate Apple when
they're committed say what you will
about Apple their war chest is rivaling
some nations they've got money and they
clearly seem committed to this so if I
were Netflix if I were Reed Hastings I
would be worried if I'm Amazon I would
be worried it's only a certain amount of
hours in a day and certain ton of
eyeballs that are watching content if
Apple comes with the next Game of
Thrones the next must-have show it's
going to snowball from there and they
certainly seem confident that they've
got the next must watch TV show or movie
and if they hit that home run early the
Apple TV service is going to be huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
