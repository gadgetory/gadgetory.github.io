technobuffalo here I want to talk to you
about the rumored third generation ipod
touch and whether or not you should buy
an ipod touch right now those are two
questions that I get quite a bit so I'm
going to try and answer both of them for
you the first one that I'm going to
tackle is whether or not you should buy
an ipod touch right now and the answer
is a resounding no you should not if you
can hold out wait until mid-september
there are rumors have been running
rampant that Apple is going to schedule
an ipod announcement each September and
if history has been any sort of
indicator that's probably going to be
true as last few years every September
they've refreshed the ipod lines and
more recently in the past two years
refresh the ipod touch lines so if you
don't need the device right now if not
going on a long vacation or if you can
wait i definitely recommend waiting
until that mid-september time frame at
least to see if Apple does announce
anything buying apple products and
sometimes be a little bit tricky because
you never know when they're going to get
refreshed and it seems to happen almost
at random the one exception to that
seems to be this ipod refresh in
September it seems to be quite reliable
that it's going to happen so definitely
my advice you're looking to buy a second
generation ipod touch hold off on it or
if you just bought one you're still
within your return policy you may want
to take it back and just wait a little
bit so what would you be waiting for
let's talk about some of the rumored
features on this new third generation
ipod touch that certainly is coming my
speculation is in September but at some
point the ipod touch is going to get
refreshed so what i believe is going to
happen and what we've seen sort of
indicated by some of the case
manufacturers is first you're going to
see a camera on the ipod touch so if
that means obviously a picture of taking
a building but that also leads you to
believe that you're going to have the
capability to take video as well so sort
of similar interface to what you find on
the iphone 3gs you'll be able to edit
crop and upload directly to YouTube
certainly be a welcome feature also I'm
hearing a lot of rumors and reading a
lot of rumors that we're going to see
some sort of built-in microphone on the
ipod touch so make a sort of a mobile
skype device
your mobile voice over IP device which
would be quite nice all I would imagine
that my chap 18 T's skyed just a little
bit essentially the ipod touch is going
to turn into a full-featured iphone
minus the phone part still get
everything that you can get on an iphone
3gs just without the phone and that also
means without the two-year commitment i
think that should be quite a nice thing
will also see an increase in storage
maybe from 32 to possibly even 64 on the
higher end all I think that 32 is
probably a sweet spot as far as price
and storage is concerned I think it's 64
would probably add a little bit to the
price they're also heard some rumors of
an o LED screamed essentially as a
little bit higher resolution screen it
makes the blacks with blacker and the
colors looking for vibrant something
we're starting to see on a lot more
mobile devices all I wouldn't expect
actually see that on a third generation
ipod touch I'd expect apple to sort of
hold that for a relaunch of the iphone
next year probably next June I don't
think we'll see any really big design
changes in what the ipod touch looks
like I think it'll look almost identical
with a little camera lens on the back
probably in the middle as opposed to
sort of the left side where the iphone's
camera is other than that I don't think
we're going to see drastic changes
certainly some increase in speaker
volume I don't think we're going to see
color devices like we've seen on the
other ipod lines like the nano for
example i think it's going to look
mostly the same just with the exception
of that camera lens on the back that
being said in the realm of possibility
you could possibly see a front facing
camera for use over Wi-Fi and a sort of
mobile i chat that's always sort of been
in a rumor mill you know something like
that could show up you could see a
complete refresh of the ipod touch liner
the new design that maybe will carry
over to the iphone although i don't
think it's very likely so what do you
guys think are you looking forward to
night a new ipod touch are you waiting
for a new ipod touch do you care about
it do you want a camera do not want a
camera what features do you want would
you even want 64 gigabytes of storage if
you had to pay a little bit extra for it
just kind of curious and i hope you
