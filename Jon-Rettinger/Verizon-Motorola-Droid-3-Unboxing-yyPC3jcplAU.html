TechnoBuffalo let's find out
all right in the box is it right it's
the Droid three the newest droid in a
never-ending line of droids from Verizon
this time with Motorola Android powered
phone the third in the Droid line the
the actual Droid is opposed to the
dragon credible or the Droid X or all
those on the Droid marked by the touch
screen with the slide-out QWERTY
keyboard made by Motorola this is the
newest one available right now from
Verizon for one $99.99 on contract one
$99.99 here's the phone itself we'll
turn it on and while it's booting up
they're gonna boot up go Speed Racer
usually they have enough juice on them
to boot up this one might not
interesting we'll take a look in the box
anyway
also in the Box you get the AC adapter
that plugs into the USB cord USB cable
and then you get your manuals and all
that stuff but the phone itself
interesting that it wouldn't have the
enough power to to at least start out
for a little little show-and-tell
alright so thanks to a nearby power
strip we will plug the phone in for the
unboxing here but you can see dual core
technology it's got a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor inside 4 inch
display it's qHD 960 by 540 s for very
high res display your 4 capacitive
buttons down there at the bottom
front-facing camera five row keyboard
500 QWERTY keyboard you got a very kind
of a narrow or thin if you will row of
numerical keys up top and then your four
row keyboard as well you've got
dedicated voice command button dedicated
at key which is nice your then your all
buttons and you've got a a d-pad as well
down here a cursor keys I should say not
a d-pad cursor keys as well down
they're so a pretty nice-looking
keyboard it feels pretty good just sort
of off the bat
Chiclets style but a little bit of
action to it that first drug keyboard I
could not stand droid - I thought was
much better droid 3 so far so good on
the back 8 megapixel camera with full
1080p HD video capture I've got an LED
flash autofocus as well on the right
spine there's a rocker switch that
doubles is zoom when you're using the
camera on the other spine you've got
your mini your micro USB port and then
also a mini HDMI port this phone can do
HDMI out it can also do your HDI
mirroring as well on top 3 9 millimeter
audio jack and your power lock button
alright so now we're cooking with bacon
here we got the Detroit 3 powered up
here and according to Motorola and
Verizon it's the slimmest full QWERTY
smartphone in the world weighs five
point nine ounces you've got that four
inch display like I said qHD so 960 by
540 very high-rez front-facing camera
for video chatting the rear camera the
whole thing 16 gigs of internal storage
micro SD slot and of course it's it's 3G
compatible not 4G LTE if it's 3G
compatible and then it also has the
Wi-Fi hotspot capability up to five
users at a time device is built on
Android 2.3 Gingerbread you can see some
add-on to your favorite contacts widget
and some other stuff kind of the D blur
5 motoblur just some widgets now did a
usage widget kind of nice to have your
Google search with voice here's the
camera and it's got touch to focus it's
got geo-locating obviously they they all
do these days we'll leave that off for
now
just want to get back so you've got
touch to focus it's got a panorama mode
and then it's got when you're in video
here's got the front-facing camera hello
and then when you're in video mode it's
also got
load this up here
something Motorola came out with a
little while ago several devices back
now it's been well I think on the the
original the original tried X the first
had it kind of a cool thing audio scenes
so you can set the audio to use the
microphones and focus the directionality
of the microphones depending on what
kind of scene you're doing so this kind
of thing if you're narrating from behind
the camera you would have the microphone
that's facing towards you pick up the
pick up the the sound or subject
obviously the microphone away from you
and it does help a little bit I haven't
used it on this phone yet but Motorola
always been known for good voice quality
and audio technology in their phones
their noise cancellation has always been
really good and now the audio seems kind
of a neat little feature if you're using
your smartphone as a camcorder which you
know the 1080p camcorder why not the
phone also has some business-business
centric features on it if we go into
apps Citrix 6 tricks GoToMeeting
pre-installed
there's the GoToMeeting app it's a
web-based virtual conferencing app that
you don't know what it is then you know
you know don't worry about it
but a lot of people in the business
world use it it's pretty handy so kind
of cool to have that on the device Skype
mobile built-in as well and then you
know it's not all all play all work and
no play makes junior dull boy so NFL
mobile Nova you know some games built in
the whole thing let's golf 2 and then
all of the vcast apps that people love
or love to hate or what-have-you
but there you go quick first look
unboxing at the newest Troy at the Droid
3 from Verizon again resin says it's the
slimmest full-court II smartphone in the
world I happen to have another full
QWERTY smartphone just launched the
t-mobile mytouch 4G slide and if we put
these side by side yeah Troy this is
very unscientific petroi just look just
a hair slimmer feel slimmer because it's
a it's a larger phone 4-inch as opposed
to 3.7 inch display so you know
stretching the phone out footprint wise
makes it feel a little bit
and then this you know this thin lip
here on the bottom I think also a visual
trick Talbot a peer thinner than that
really is but it's a nice got a nice
heft to it I like the kind of dark
silver grey chrome on black finish with
the the matte back there a nice easy
grip and the keyboard of course actually
before we go let's do a real quick
keyboard test just to see
yeah I like the keyboard it's a the
action is true the keys are pretty
they're pretty small to help keep the
device thin but they have pretty good
Chiclets action they're separated just a
little bit and offset just a little bit
which is nice make some blue a little
easier to find without looking a slight
dome to the keys as well
and they've got a nice surface to them
nice kind of grippy surface there so
first reaction thumbs up on the keyboard
and I always like the spacebar that's a
little wider this one is four keys wide
which is pretty cool so thumbs up first
impression for sure in the drawer three
if you're looking for a you know an
Android smartphone with a full-on
keyboard with a super high res display
we'll have more on this one we'll have
more on the my attention more to all the
new phones lots of new phones coming out
this order came out this week launched
this week coming out soon that kind of
thing the the status as your honor wrote
an article asking if you could rock the
status as a business phone who knows man
you can do it ever you want these days
it's a it's the wild wild west of the
internet and we're here to cover it for
you on TechnoBuffalo comm much much more
on the site again available now $1.99 99
on contract thanks to the folks at
Verizon for lending us this one we'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
