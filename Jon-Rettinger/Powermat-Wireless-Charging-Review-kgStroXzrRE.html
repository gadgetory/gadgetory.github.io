here they for you for you of the power
Matt wireless charging system before I
get into the nuts and bolts of what this
thing does let me show you exactly how
it works so it's got a single cord that
plugs into a wall outlet and it's got
three charging ports on the front now
when they say wireless charging the
first thing you're gonna think of is
wireless charging you can take your
device and put it right on top but
that's not the case we actually have to
put something else on top of the device
to charge your phone or your iPod or
whatever it is it might be and there are
three ways you can do it when you buy a
Power Max wireless charging system and
you comes in the standard desk charger
or a portable charger that folds they
both are the same idea you get this
charging cube and this cord rolls around
and it goes in for storage and it's got
a ton of different tips at the end and
you can swap tips to charge to plug in
to any device you like so you take this
it's got a little circle on the bottom
and it matches up with the little circle
on the device and you can take your
phone your PSP whatever it might be and
plug it right in so certainly your phone
for example won't have any wires since
the wall we still have to plug it in
with something now for $30 extra you can
get if we're talking about an iPhone or
an iPod Touch or an iPod a dot and that
goes on one of the three available slots
and you can take your phone put it right
in and you'll be charging but again it's
not completely wireless and the third
option again for just around $30 is this
case and it's a decent case it's made of
sort of a soft touch rubber feel but on
the back it's got a really large
charging mat you put your phone in there
and you can place it on there and charge
you can charge three at a time so a
little bit of note about each of these
first this is not something that I would
use on a regular basis especially not
leave on the phone and keep in my pocket
and just Park it down on here all the
time it's very big and has a lot of
weight something that I don't think
would be the most conducive for for
pocket or general care and use I'm not
sure who this is applying to when you
have to use the phone for example gotta
open it up slide your phone in
push it down the top part down and put
it back on the charger that's a lot of
work as opposed to just plugging in
cording so I'm not so sure that this
option would be what I'd recommend so
secondary you've got this sort of dock
which is quite handy just as you would
charge any other phone or iPod and one
of the apples docks so just go ahead and
push it down and you'll be charging it
really works as you'd expect it to the
third option this little cord is
actually more handy than you expected
ton of different tips really make it
useful for for a lot of different things
that it comes with really a tip that'll
fit most phones Samsung Nokia I really
whatever else you have a mini USB
microUSB iPod or iPhone there are a lot
of different choices so what this does
it works very well um and it works
exactly as advertised they're not
claiming that it's completely wireless
charging i'm although if you joined by
the commercials didn't really see any
wires but if you're okay with having to
plug your device still in or put it in a
dock this does work exactly as you'd
expect it charge the device it charges
it almost as quickly as it would into a
wall and it does save on outlets so I
can charge three devices right here if
that happened to plug three cords into a
wall so what I recommend this well yes
and no if you want to maybe save some
space on your outlets or you don't want
to mess a cords is this sort of a nice
option and it does have a little bit of
a cool effect to it because you are
still getting that sort of pseudo
wireless charging even though this still
does have a wire that plugs in no I
wouldn't recommend it in the sense that
it's not really true wireless charger
you're not getting any advantage other
than sort of a cool factor in less cords
than just charging three devices and
certainly for $100 which is what this
device costs it's gonna be a hard
proposition to justify the drop down to
around fifty it'd probably be a much
easier recommendation but you know the
final decision is going to be up to you
if you're okay with what this thing does
it does do it very well and it works
like I said just as advertised but
really gonna be your decision if you
want to spend a hundred dollars on
something that's actually cost you more
if you buy this for a hundred bucks all
you're going to get is one of these
little cute
you only charge one device if you want
to charge your iPhone or another phone
and to plunk down another 20 or 30 bucks
for these other sort of adapters so this
is gonna get more expensive if you want
to charge 3 so many hundred bucks
becomes 160 dollars with the two
accessories so the city is going to be
yours and what you want to spend your
money on if it was me I don't think I
could recommend this I'm sure they don't
think I would buy one anyway guys hope
