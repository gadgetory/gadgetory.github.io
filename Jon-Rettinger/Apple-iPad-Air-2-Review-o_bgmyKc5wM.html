TechnoBuffalo here the full review for
you of the iPad air 2 it is the sequel
to the thinnest tablet Apple has ever
made there is an incredibly crowded
tablet market out there let's see if
this one should grab your hard earned
tablet buying buck so as I do with all
our reviews I want to give a disclaimer
I uses this device as my only tablet for
seven days in about three and a half to
four days using a conjunction with
another tablet if you want to hear
anything additional about what I'm
talking about see more pictures teeth
gallery or just sort of get more
granular hit the link down below to go
to the full written review and check
that out as well let's go ahead and jump
into the review so 2014 Apple's mantra
seems to be thin thin and thinner the
original iPad air it was already pretty
svelte this guy though gets even thinner
it's 6.1 millimeters which you can do
quick math is 18% less than the original
iPad air 7.5 millimeters
the cool thing though it feels just as
sturdy while weighing under a pound and
no I'm not going to see if I can bend it
it feels pretty stable secure despite
that really diminutive profile design
wise though it's still really close to
the last gen and pretty much every iPad
for the past few years say for the gold
color and that little gold ring around
the home button which is hiding touch ID
Eston usually tends to do though it does
come in a bit of a cost the battery has
dropped a bit from 30 2.41 hours to 27
point 3 watt hours when the big
emissions firm either with this tablet
is it seems kind of strange is removal
of the profile switch on the side or the
mute switch however you want to use it
simple thing it just became very
annoying now if you want to put the
volume all the way down you got to sort
of hit the button and hold it all the
way down or just call up control center
not a giant deal by tricked imagination
just annoying to have it not here in its
place now you've got a mic which means
there's no break on the back of a
cellular model for Michael if that's a
big issue for you then hey no break
there it's a tiny aesthetic improvement
that went through four really big
hardware changes that one I had a hard
time understanding as I mentioned
earlier touch ID is here in networks as
well in the iPhone 6 and 6 plus it's
only for in-app perk
it's a nice and very obvious addition if
you got issues with touch ID on the
iPhone 5s and we're worried about how it
might perform here don't worry it works
really well I had some accuracy issues
with the 5s but on 6 6 plus and now the
iPad line I'm batting almost a thousand
with hatch idea working processor was
this one's gotten a lot faster it's
clocked up at 1.5 gigahertz versus 1.4
from the last gen l2 cache is double
from 1 to 2 megabytes ram is also
doubled now with 2 gigabytes onboard
here apple's also claiming a 40% boost
in cpu performance and improved graphic
prowess which you'd expect from a new
processor because i'd like to see what
scores are i ran this through the
Geekbench 3 multi-core test and the
score came back at 4400 89 which is up
from about 2700 on the first gen so they
improvement there
so obviously yeah this thing is really
fast games and apps not only open very
quickly the performances now superb and
right now though the big caveat here
developers haven't had much time to code
the new hardware I'd wager that we start
to see a big difference once all the RAM
starts getting used which does having a
bit worried about how older models might
perform for right now though I can see a
giant difference but you know 16 months
down the road you might really start to
see the discrepancy between a past gen
and the current gen so I wanted to test
some games so I asked the office where I
should play and brightness I should play
a quiet little game called five nights
at freddys while doing my test and I did
but also nearly peed myself so if you
haven't tried that game don't try it
alone it is super scary if you get the
Democratic geyser coming out trying to
kill you but I probably shouldn't
embarrass myself publicly but it's true
and while I was getting scared out of my
big boy pants everything did performing
really really well
graphics look great the sound was
awesome everything just worked as you'd
expect another nice addition here in the
iPad air 2 is also 802 11 AC so fast to
wipe out but you wipe out eleven folks
we talked a lot about hardware but this
is a tablet and you're pretty much
staring at this thing the whole time
that's the display I would get the spec
sheet you might not think much has
changed you got the same 2048 1536
resolution no retina HD here at all but
Apple was still able to slim down the
display by using a laminated optically
bonded no gap display similar the ones
we have in the iPhone
that's just fancy talk what does it do
safe space for sure but also is now we
we less reflective you don't notice it
much indoors but outdoors it is a
ridiculous difference I almost said
redonkulous but I'm not gonna make up
words it's a big difference I can now
read my Marvel Civil War books not
having to turn the brightness all the
way up when I'm outside and sort of
touring the screen to avoid the Sun you
can use this outside now which is a
giant plus also though something about
the color seems a little bit off to me
there's kind of a little hint of a pink
hue obviously no pixels can be seen here
text looks awesome movies and games all
look really really good as it expect so
one thing I usually don't talk about in
tablets cuz I never so much used about
it is the cameras but I'd be remiss to
not talk about here on the iPad air 2 if
you want to see sample galleries and
stuff again hit the link down below to
review of a ton of pictures up there so
now it's got any major pixel sensor it
actually takes decent pics I have some
iPhone like tricks like burst mode
slo-mo and time lapse I'm obviously not
a giant fan of using this thing is just
a huge viewfinder but if you like that
you know you might want to give it a
shot I usually lo taking pics to the
tablet but you know that your cup of tea
is pretty good so the big kind of
elephant in the room monkey in the room
elephant monkey hybrid in the room is
battery and it's probably the big reason
we don't have a retina HD display here
though as I mentioned batteries drop
from 32 watt hours 27.3 watt hours but
Apple still promises the same 10 hours
of battery life evidently the a8x is a
little bit more power efficient case
you're wondering how they pulled off
that voodoo on one hand Apple was right
we got about 10 and a half hours on 50%
brightness with Wi-Fi off while just HD
videos played so actually surpassed
apples mark on the other hand we ran the
same test on the iPad air 1 and got
about an hour more so it's not as bad as
I originally thought it would be on
battery life but snot of giant
improvement either but I guess holding
par is a nice dish and when you're
looking at tablet that's this thin so
what's the conclusion on the iPad air 2
not surprisingly it's the best iPad
Apple's ever made as kind of you'd
expect so nice to features here a touch
ID in particular is really nice to have
and all honestly when I was using this
thing it felt like I was just holding a
screen which I guess is what the iPad
was always meant to feel like I
definitely traded a few millimeters
though to get better battery life but
the trend nowadays thin is in higher ed
skrein have definitely made this feel
more future-proof as well but some
things that we saved I guess for the
iPad air 3 iOS 8.1 work so you'd expect
we've covered that sort of ad nauseam if
you have the first generation iPad air
I'd probably think twice before
upgrading if you have anything older
than that though this is a great tablet
and a worthwhile upgrade the iPad light
used to be the king of the tablet world
back when all Android head was the zoom
but as I tend to do times have changed
now the iPad is just one of many very
very good tablets out there it's a very
solid 8.5 on TechnoBuffalo skin thank
