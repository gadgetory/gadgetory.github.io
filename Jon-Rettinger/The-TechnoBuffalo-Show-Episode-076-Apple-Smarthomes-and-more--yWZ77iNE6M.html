Buffalo show I'm lime your to host for
this week Shaun ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
are you doing this week Todd I'm good
it's an interesting week it is an
interesting weekend one quick bit of
housekeeping news to those of you that
join us on the Google Hangouts
especially keep an eye out next week
because we may be moving homes we're not
sure yet so we will put it out on
Twitter and we will put it in the post
for next week but just in terms of what
our this video goes yeah exactly so just
just keep an eye out you know they're
there may be some changes coming up
nothing bad we're not going away the
TechnoBuffalo shows continuing so a
couple things we wanted to discuss this
week I know that's a surprise you
because normally we don't want to
discuss anything ah silence first off so
Apple really adds financial reports and
iphone sales were down and everyone's
acting like this is the epochal their
sales are up it was a record quarter for
sales growth is starting to stagnate
that's the thing it has everybody
worried okay so growth is stagnant I
folks this is something I've always
wondered about even from back when I had
a business and when I used to play the
stock market a little bit you know
everyone's like oh well sales aren't
growing like they should folks there is
a law of diminishing returns yeah there
are a finite number of people that will
buy these devices right any and Apple
had some you know quarters where it was
going you know year-over-year from 50
million sales to 70 million and you're
like wow that's crazy and this this year
I think year-over-year it was a like a
300,000 unit increase which shows the
plateau there and you have to I mean
look Apple you know you know we have a
colonnaded Mars Apple can't go up there
and start selling phones to you know a
whole new bunch of people that and in
the past what it did was in enter China
which was a big growth market and now
there's there's a lot of concerns right
so ipad sales are down again
and continuing to show that trend
because people are like why we upgrade
and there are other reports of saying
look average selling price of the iphone
is decreasing to you know whether that
says people are buying older models
which some analysts think like so they
would buy the iphone 6 and 6 plus this
year instead of the 6s and 6s plus or
they're just buying the cheapest models
so like the 16 gig iphone 6s and so
there's like a concern that they're not
spending as much in so Tim Cook sort of
hinted yesterday perhaps the iphones are
a little too expensive I don't think
that are going to change anything but i
think you know when you look at rumors
about the iPhone 5se that could be a low
cost or a relatively low cost forage
phone then maybe that's sort of a
strategy shift I think we're still going
to see though the you know super
expensive iphone 7s although yeah no I
agree you know and they also announced
that there's now over 1 billion active
iOS devices there are only seven billion
people in the world which is pretty
incredible now mind you yes sir people
like Todd and I who have multiple iOS
devices you know I I have an ipad i have
an iphone oh and my family alone my
mother has an ipad my father has an
iphone you know so yes there there are
people that are have more than one iOS
devices we're not saying that there are
1 billion people in the world using an
iOS device but that's still the
equivalent of one seventh of the
population yeah it's pretty incredible
that that's insane yeah I know androids
up there to Google's published in the
past one point something I think billion
um but it's crazy I think it's funny
though like you said there's just this
confusion that seems to populate at
least on Twitter I mean people are like
but they sold record number of iphones
how can people be so upset about this
and it's just that when you start to see
that slowing growth you wonder like okay
the iphone for example is apple's most
profitable device i think in terms of
like margins and it had record profits i
think for any company ever i guess for
the quarter it's like very healthy right
there sitting on a ton of cash question
is like how long can they keep that up
you know if iphone sales start
to go down and always obviously so do
profits and stuff like that so they're
just wondering you know investors are
looking for long-term growth they're not
saying like you know a lot of these apps
your people online or like buying and
selling stocks like you know today and
tomorrow just saw all the time is it
when you look at a company that's long
term it's like well what's app I'm going
to be doing ten years from now and if it
can't keep up these sales like where is
it going to look next a lot people are
looking like to the cars Apple car
rumors and stuff like that which
apparently jony ive is not happy with
the design yeah that was in the news
this week too it's like I guess the
progress of it you know apparently the
head of the Apple car is out whoever was
leading it and um you know I've I guess
was upset and we were talking about this
briefly but you know what can he get
upset about he's sort of like the head
of design at Apple right so like he
didn't like the way the car looked or
like what does that mean isn't to me and
maybe I'm wrong here but does it mean
like he designed something awesome the
engineers can't get it to that that
state you know like other progress
boundaries like they just can't
physically do it or or they just don't
like the looks a bit like I have no idea
what that you know what he would be
upset about mind you this is the same
man that approved the new magic mouse
with the charging port on the bottom and
apparently the Apple pencil in all those
countries yeah so we'll we'll take this
with a grain of salt for now yeah but
Jeff k asks interesting question here
speaking of the number of iOS devices do
you think it's more impressive than the
number of Windows devices on the market
I think history is against Apple i think
they are destined to fall when though
and that's the thing every company that
reaches these sorts of heights which
actually no company has ever reached
these heights every company that gets
huge will events mm-hmm try to say the
word eventually every company that
reaches these sorts of heights
eventually does face a contraction it's
just the way the market works and yes
Apple will fall they will not collapse
they will not go back to the non Steve
Jobs error where they almost completely
went bankrupt and he had to write in and
save them
but yes they will fall it's just a
question of how far they will fall and
as to win i don't know i think you know
from the rumors were hearing about the
iphone 7 and even the iphone 8 i do
think they have some tricks up their
sleeves that could you know put them
back at the top could keep them from
falling you know too soon but we won't
know until we see them hmm I think enter
your other question do you think it's
more impressive than the number of
Windows device on the market I think
Microsoft has said we Windows 10 rolled
out anyway that there were like a
billion people using it so to me it
sounds sort of equally impressive but
obviously Windows is totally different
sort of you know Apple was talking about
iOS devices so we're talking about
what's in our pockets and Windows has
been I mean relatively we're not talking
about Windows Phone so much but
relatively just on our computers so it
seems to me like very different markets
but obviously that's going to change so
Apple if computers are going into our
pockets more it seems like well the nap
will sort of has a leg up in that
industry right because more people are
carrying iPhones but I don't know that's
again like I think part of the
importance here is where is Apple going
to go next and matter of fact everybody
you know and you look at these markets
like virtual reality Tim Cook sort of
SETI's it was cool and interesting
yesterday so you can see Apple going
into that space and there's been a lot
of hints that it will and into cars with
the Apple car so I think really it's
going to be about how well it executes
on these new ideas and historically
Apple has been very good at doing that
but can it continue to to do that well
well again here's my question you know
all these companies are excited about
virtual reality but as anyone asks the
consumers yet yeah well I'm still
waiting for that phone right but yeah
and so that reminds me of sort of the
smartphone game where it was like
consumers were starting to get
interested in smartphones but really
weren't you know addicted to them until
Apple came into it and it just it's
gonna be a matter can Apple really put
its magic into things and I hate the
word magic an apple but you know what
I'm saying click
can it can it do that again and it did
so with tablets right but it would need
to do it with virtual reality and I
think right now a key point would be to
you know comment a lower cost and sort
of do what Samsung's been doing because
you need to show consumers what it's all
about like you and I up into CES we've
put on these happen you know
thousand-dollar exits probably cost way
more than that hook them up to
multi-thousand dollar computers and
didn't really impressed but you know I
think at the end of the day most
consumers aren't going to have that
chance and so there needs to be a
cheaper way to show consumers how
awesome virtual reality is and Samsung
send a good job of that and so Apple
could potentially do something along
those lines too it's sort of like the
you know the Apple watch like people
have been doing smartwatches but nobody
was really paying attention until the
Apple watch came out and you start to
wonder like well what can happen make
that popular too mmhmm yeah well I mean
there's no question Apple still has a
halo effect around it you know they may
be late to a party but once they come to
the party everybody goes oh wait there's
been other devices like this yeah
exactly yeah so I don't know it will
we'll see where Apple ends up going but
one thing the Apple is working on and
actually has made it out of the market
already is with some smart home stuff
and that was another topic we wanted to
touch on this week yeah that I I have
finally dived into the world of smart
homes just dipped my toe in I'm not as
deep into it as you are yet I don't have
light bulbs in all that but I did pick
up an Amazon echo finally and here's the
interesting thing I wrote an article
during CES about how it was starting to
dawn on me that smart homes were going
to be more for the elderly how it could
change the way they live how could do
more things for them it could make their
lives better let them live more
independently so as some people you know
that listen to the show no I live with
my elderly parents you know I help them
out and so I got the Amazon echo they
have used the echo far more than I have
they are like obsessed with it the echo
is awesome when it listens yeah I
shouldn't previous just it doesn't
listen
why it listens to all three of us with
no problem what I found hilarious
yesterday Todd was when I said Alexa
over your speakers and your echo listen
to me but listen to your wife yeah well
funny thing today i was playing speaking
of the echo we have a post i don't know
if it went live yet but it's about
Amazon's superbowl commercial and scotty
moreno and out baldwin it's pretty funny
it's like it's easier for it and in it
there like like Alexa what say oh crap
yeah I just like it's like she's gonna
listen so she responds all time in like
you know they're talking to her and
asking her what something was and she
responded while I'm typing up the story
watching the video and so I have to be
careful about like when we were talking
or when I'm playing a video because then
she starts doing stuff and scares me
like all right no I mean it's a
fascinating product and what my family
has been using it for mostly is to
listening music and because my they were
never much into yo Oh going over the CD
player and changing out CDs they never
really got into mp3s but for them to be
able to just sit there and go you know
Alexa play piano man by billy joel
they're loving it they are absolutely
thrilled with it and so i am going to be
getting some light bulbs i am going to
be getting some other smart home
products ill and so it's going to be
really interesting to see watch how they
interact especially with it because you
i I've had elderly people in my life
firs long as I can remember and my
grandmother especially on my maternal
grandmother she was afraid of technology
like you wouldn't believe I mean she
even on her DirecTV remote she took a
piece of paper and she put it over the
remote and she cut holes for the only
buttons she should touch Halima yeah
exactly because she she got tired of
having to call me to come over and fix
it for when she would screw something up
so she made herself like a dubby guy
that she lay over the remote that's
funny but she is someone that a
unfortunately she's passed but I could
see her using the echo like crazy yeah
because it unlike all these other
gadgets and you're right we were talking
about this a little bit especially at
CES is like for the elderly and stuff
because unlike these what previously
were complicated gadgets amusing quotes
here like remotes the voice control is a
totally different you know area for for
the elderly where they don't have to be
afraid just because they're like oh like
I don't get the menus and I don't get
all you know all they have to do is say
what they want and it works you know for
the most part and I think that's what's
what's so compelling and it opens it up
for more people than ever before exactly
you know and I I love asking you know
her what the forecast is I love although
i have discovered one weird thing as
listeners of the show know i'm a fan of
manchester united she does not
understand manchester united it seems
like she can only give scores for us
teams and can only you know tell you
when the next game is for us team she
cannot grasp have you gone through he
likes it happen seen if there's like a
third-party plugin i did and i haven't
found anything yet but i'm still doing
her kind of junky yeah I could tell by
the reviews yeah it was like one star
although I did that I did have to laugh
when I found a bingo app oh yeah yeah
like were those games you can play with
her I haven't done any of those yeah
well apparently it's like a bingo caller
just made me laugh for some reason yeah
I guess you could just sit here by your
silly with a bingo mark it was a bingo
card at a Vigo marker and Alexa will
call out that you know that's just like
that that's like the ultimate cat lady
sir yeah you can say that I mean hey you
take that into like an old person home
and they go nuts for that day they a lot
yeah they good I IOUs I think smart
homes you know we always look at
technology as for the young and I think
the smart home market is
going to eventually find that I I think
the reason my parents are able to use is
because it's just more natural to them
to speak I agree and so if smart homes
continue down this particular Road I
think that they could find that there's
going to be a much larger market for
this the only problem is of course is
the you know cost for entry into the
market and of course also deciding on
which platform because there's multiple
platforms that's the hard thing to I
found like you know and when you start
to think about which one links up with
which and you're like oh well if it
doesn't do that like I was talking about
in a previous episode I have the Philips
hue bulbs don't really work with my
version of Philips hue bulbs don't work
with home kit which is annoying cuz I'm
like oh you know and that gets
frustrating cuz again like we've talked
about it gets expensive to you know I'm
not gonna go out buy a whole new set of
Philips hue bulbs exactly but exam one
of the interesting things too and we
were talking I don't want to say they're
elderly but my mother and father-in-law
you know they're actually pretty
tech-savvy and they recently we had the
winter storm Jonas coming through here
with the blizzard and they were able to
set you know the temperature at their
beach house which was down the Jersey
Shore which had some flooding and was
right in the path of storm to 270
degrees just in case just in case the
power went out and like that's super
warm why would you do that but nobody's
there but just kiss power went out so
that it could still you know keep the
house relatively warm / longer and I
thought that was a cool idea and it's
something you know when I bought them
the nest that they used to do that I
thought oh this will be great to can
turn on the air conditioner on their way
down there the summer and stuff but I
hadn't really thought about the winter
keeping the house warm remotely no of
course they did they thought about it
that's a fabulous use case story right
there yeah I ain't and that's I'm going
to be getting a smart thermostat for
here in my office so because I me I'm at
night there's nobody in here yo so why
should I keep the heat up well I would
like it warmed up before I get to you
know over here in the morning so I'll
get a smart thermostat and you know be
able to control all that but I mean
that's a granny how far r l 20
generally do they live from the sonic an
hour and a half so that's fantastic yeah
I need that right there is a it's a very
specific use case but it's very
interesting use case right ill why thing
I ever really thought about furnesto yes
yeah yeah well I mean how many people
would but I mean that's that right there
shows to me you know they're there are a
lot of use cases for smart homes i think
a lot of people have gone yo oh that's
silly and like i said after CES you know
I thought the refrigerator with the
cameras in it was silly until I did find
out that yes you could look at the
pictures from your phone when you're at
the grocery store right and that I mean
look I'm not going to go out and buy a
refrigerator just because it has cameras
but when I was in you know and down the
road when I'm in the market for a new
refrigerator I might consider it yeah
especially if it just becomes like a
standard feature you don't how can't
cost much to add a little camera yeah
exactly exactly also my god that's
pretty easily oh I hadn't heard the
update to apples war chest it's up to
two hundred sixteen billion Wow good
grief has a lot of cash well let's dive
into some of the questions we have here
from such a Mahal do you guys believe
the rumors of the iphone 5s II I think
that if Apple was going to make another
4-inch iphone that would use the mini or
nano name for it oh that's that's a good
point yeah I don't know if there's been
so many names for this very Marino's
iphone 6c it was iphone 5 ye yeah i was
19 5 SD now I don't know I yeah I
believe it because the person reporting
on its mark Gurman at 9to5 mac and he's
you know pretty dead-on with this stuff
for usually so it's hard to say like I
don't believe it when he's reporting on
it unless you think like I saw somebody
on Twitter say are they trying to smoke
out like whoever is leaking it so you
know like today make up the name and see
where it surfaces and see like oh that's
where it's coming from because I agree
like those other names sound better but
you know Apple's own in the past we saw
the iphone 5s
5c so I think you know se would probably
work to me the funny thing is though
it's like it sounds like second edition
right so that wouldn't that have been
the iphone 5s and now we're like iphone
5s SE well I think as he I my gut
feeling is as he actually stands for
special edition yeah something like that
right now so I don't know well we'll see
but yeah I do think the iPhone 5se does
exist I think so too i'm actually pretty
interested i mean like i haven't used a
four-inch for a long time but i would i
I've been helping my dad yet uses iphone
5s which is four inch and I'm just like
oh my god something again it is kinda
but I don't I didn't I think there's
another question about i'm using a 6p
and it's a big phone and same with my 6s
plus ly they're both big phones and
sometimes I'm again from I'm gonna try
to pronounce this Don bogus i I don't I
I'm so sorry if I think of ER I think
about gaming but what do you think VR
can do for our daily lives see this is
where I start to have problems with VR
i'm not sure what VR can do and the
everyday life you know I I went to some
demos at CES and they were like oh look
at this concert oh look at this movie
those were interesting but I couldn't
see myself using them on a daily basis
right i think that i think on a daily
situation we're looking more like
augmented reality like it we have this
post from Jacob who finally got to try
the hololens you know I think the
hololens has a lot of interesting
applications via firm like the demo
where they showed the woman trying to
fix her sink and her father was able to
draw you know turned that and all that I
think that sort of use cases very
interesting but with virtual reality I
think the problem with VR in everyday
life situations is that closes you off
too much to the outside world and I like
the idea of augmented reality if
somebody could ever come up with a way
that you could wear it on the street but
the idea of augmented reality being a
heads-up display you know I I thought
about the situation imagine if you had
access to your contacts because who
hasn't walked
so on you know somebody walks up to you
at a conference or something and you
completely cannot remember their name
that'd be awesome like facial
recognition Lee yeah just little facial
recognition your glass good i'm sad like
a third party like non official app that
did something like that yeah I that that
would be cool but I I don't know I in
everyday life I just don't know what
they can do was virtual reality that's
going to make it compelling to use it
all the time but i think i think for
classrooms and stuff like we saw
Buckingham Palace 4mm was one of
Google's expeditions or something for
cardboard I feel like that kind of stuff
could be fun especially for students or
like you know you're like reading about
something a book you're like oh I want
to see that he's put on like like that
could be sort of daily use case or um I
think it was Netflix CEO Reed Hastings I
think he was talking to Andreessen
Horowitz one of those venture capitalist
firms and uh he was saying they were
saying like where do you see Netflix in
the coming like 10 20 years like where
what happens wouldn't you know movies
and TV shows aren't that great anymore
and he was sort of referring to virtual
reality early what is this next
experience for movies like sitting on
your couch and watching a movie is just
old you know like nobody does that more
and he was saying like maybe it's for
reality and stuff like that so like
what's the next form of entertainment
and obviously that would be daily I
think gaming will be a big part of that
I know the answer is like what else can
it do so it's like how do you consume
you know TV shows and movies that way
versus I mean I don't think it's like if
you put on the gear VR right now you can
sit in front of a huge movie screen but
I don't think that's like something
everybody's going to do every day and
the idea though bringing vr to two films
or television yeah I I don't know how
much you know people are familiar with
the Oh everything that's going on behind
the camera I filming a movie in 360 is
going to be next to impossible oh look
there's the boom mic oh look there's the
video village where the director sitting
watching renders it's nice to me yeah I
don't even think I want to be like in
the movie like I mean I guess like if
they if they could do it
need I guess but I don't know whenever I
put on VR and this is right now and I've
used a lot of them you it there's
something like being transferred into
that other world is really fun and
exciting especially for gaming but when
you're trying to focus on something like
sit still and watch a movie it feels
very weird right now I don't know how
they're gonna get around those
boundaries because part of you is like
why don't I just do this in real life
you know like when you're sitting in a
fake movie theater or like sitting in a
fake couch watching Netflix on a fake
big-screen TV it's just kind of strange
you like the natural something about VR
makes you want to move around and
interact and you can't really do that
with it movie screen so it's very bright
and also you have to think about movie
directors they're trying to frame the
the frame of this picture is as much a
part of the story as what's being spoken
right and so letting you go willy-nilly
into this world would take away a lot of
the art of the film mm-hmm so yeah it's
like a movies like you know it's like
look at this and this is you know that's
part of the art right and instead you're
like oh I can look at everything and I
guess who just be very different yeah
look at the child extra over in the
corner picking his nose yeah unless you
write like I'm just thinking about it
like if you think about it like a
Western and you know you're riding on a
horse and the main characters on this
horse you really kind of like in the
film with them and watching this one
person I don't know that can be coming
it'll just be strange it'd be very
strange be very strange from brazen
Franco with the iphone 6 starting at 549
and the iphone 6s starting at five
ninety-nine where do you think the
iphone 5s will fit price point wise what
do you think is more plausible iphone 5s
e with a 9 or 5 iPhone 5se with a 8 all
I know is it's really hard to say five
sec yeah i think i think a nine should
beware apple goes and rumor has it they
would it would just replace the iphone 6
you know because they're going to move
the 6s and 6s plus down a notch
put the 5se and at the bottom and put
the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus at the top so
I'd like to see with a nine because
obviously you're going to have the new
one in the the new phones in the iphone
7s and it brings it more on a par with
the iphone 6s and 6s plus which is what
we're expecting I don't know I think it
makes sense and I don't know about the
price but you you'd hope it goes
somewhere like around you know I'd say
499 or lower if Apple really wants to
cater to that market yeah it's gonna be
interesting to see what happens with
that huh let's see here from Jeff k are
there any Android phones you guys are
wanting I know your daily drivers are
Apple phones but what would it take for
you to switch well our primary daily
phones are Apple phones i think both of
us carry androids azhar secondaries yeah
I guess technically so i said this
couple weeks you i reactivated my
project fly line in advance of why it
was never on act but i put it back in
the phone so that's in the 6p ahead of
Mobile World Congress and then i have
the a9 because i had their red one which
I just think looks cool and that has one
line on it so that's two android phones
and then my iphone so i guess
technically excu android well okay i
carry the iphone 6 plus and an LG g3 and
then i have my nexus 6 which has my UK
sim in it but i use it as a Wi-Fi device
just because i really like the screen um
but the upcoming android phones hmm i
don't know i'm interested in the galaxy
s7 i love i love the s6 I just always
wished it sort of had better battery
life and expandable storage and sounds
like Lisi expandable storage will be
included um I don't know I really like
the blackberry prive still too I just
sort of I can't carry around three
massive phones by tossing six because I
hadn't used it until just recently just
got it so it's yes I'm up probably go
back to that scene I am intrigued by the
g5 yeah I want to see what the heck
they're doing with the g5 and the latest
rumors suggest they have that special
accessory slot or something
and I won't have maybe vs reality stuff
oh and a court project area i'm super
interested in never ever happened though
like google brought that up a little bit
last year they said we're gonna do the
demos and emporio i think right yeah
yeah and I was like I killed that and I
think maybe Google needs to stop
speaking quite so much until they're
sure of things yeah excuse me off of
that yeah right off of it but yeah maybe
not announce things until you're a
hundred percent sure well they showed
that it worked with hot swappable
components and then it sort of just went
think they were going to demo it
somewhere and start selling them an inch
never had so I guess we gotta wait until
google announces one of those it wasn't
it's like what was it their project was
like their project x kind of press
conference or Google X press conference
kind of stuff it wasn't really Google
and now that's a separate arm inside
alphabet i think so i don't know 00
though we don't know what it's going to
happen Jeff your comment your question
about why is it so hard for us to block
a certain commenter I see it I
acknowledge it I do not want say why
it's so difficult out loud because that
would give other people the idea of how
to do it but we do work on trying to
pacquiao so I just didn't want Jeff to
think that I was ignoring his question
or dodging I just that's not something I
would rather say why it's so difficult
because then we would have 20 fake man's
anyway moving on down the road here we
just uh ah okay dotted actually da i was
having more trouble figuring out how to
pronounce your first name okay i
pronounced realizing like voice got it i
always appreciate when people tell me
how to pronounce their names okay so let
me just jump through here i'm getting a
lot of one person things here uh from
such a mahal what do you guys think of
smart things especially since they're
owned by samsung
um I got no problem with them I I think
it's the the same thing with you know
what Todd and I were already saying
though it's going to be you know okay
what works with us what works with that
right which platform you choose and I I
don't own any smart things gadgets that
I know of but you know but I mean I know
I guess I guess echo Bravo works with
smart things probably uh huh Ivan tried
it I'd be surprised you never know I
just noticed a horrible coffee stain on
my cup that looks really bad on camera
hey how did coffee ah how can't be out
of coffee from Jeff k I wonder what it'd
be like to switch facial hairs with you
two oh man if I had a beard I uh which
leads me to my next point are you guys
going to grab a nexus phone with the
price drop I have no idea how those two
things connected and that's why I had to
ask which agreed in my last question a
beard Nexus it was such a seamless
transition I probably won't buy one side
I have this one from Huawei at the press
conference at CES it's the gold 6p that
I put the case but um the 5x is super
tempting i was thinking about getting
one my wife's going to come with me to
barcelona for mobile world congress and
i was thinking like oh it'd be really
convenient if i could have her on
project phi 2 and get her 5x but you
can't you like a project 5 family plan
and i get like so it's kind of i'd have
to tell her to go sign up for project
fine i was just like forget it let's get
her sim card there but that's added my
eye on it I was looking at getting the
5x to butt in yeah I did find it
interesting I did you notice in the
vegas airport that there was a machine
selling sim cards by baggage claim yes
that's not something you see a lot
around in the US yeah yeah you see in
money some of the New York airports I
think Gavin but yeah a lot of airports
you don't I know it's probably because
they have all your national charlie yeah
I found that really interest because
that's some time used to seem like in
Japan or England right like the major
yeah but uh yeah that surprised me when
I spotted that in vegas at baggage claim
oh how i love
and when your bags came up how long did
it take them I think he came out right
away over a half hour um in after we
landed our bags finally start coming up
around the carousel wow I was like any
time now hey any old time that's all
uh-uh it sucked I am a but did you fly
with priority on delta I fly with
priority and I think that yeah dad's
gonna clean they they put the orange
priority tag on my bag bad the baggage
handlers never pay attention of those
things huh I I think what's your choice
first bag now I think exactly yeah I
know that the American Airlines is real
good about putting the other orange
priority tag on at me and my bag should
come up you know in the first batch and
now the baggage handlers don't ever pay
attention from mr. Sean Todd what have
you returned lately oh shoot I think I
did something I remember I have to
return things to companies before they
kill me I wasn't kings yeah I know I
didn't buy them um not I don't think I
return anything I had my eye on some
razor keyboards and I probably would
have kept that though like the chroma
they had a big sale and I missed it so I
had really wanted to buy and then
they're like 170 bucks though no ouch
yeah yeah I can't picture paying that
much for a keyboard Jeff k is asking
Shawn why have you returned lately um
does it count if I traded it in yeah
okay though I finally traded my one plus
one huh so that's it I I'm not big on
returning things basically once it
arrives it stays here for life uh but i
like it cuz you know you can go to Best
Buy and I like the Apple new TV and play
with it and be like yeah that's what I
did I think it's a good way to play with
gadgets when you can't like I don't know
you check him out and see what it's all
about but I unfortunately I returned it
now I kind of wanted again now that the
beta is live
support something like that which is a
couple of things I said I wanted right
from the get-go yeah I know you you know
your grand up buying one again probably
but not for a bit because i have so many
of these things first i gotta cancel
cable which is you know my next thing to
do now that football is basically over
i'm gonna watch the superbowl at a
friend's house so i actually i did a
cost analysis the other day so when I
left directv I was paying 150 dollars a
month so I figured okay I have a hundred
fifty dollars a month to play with you
know and after you know my cable company
getting me for overages and all that and
increasing my package having to
subscribe to another couple services i'm
down to i'm saving sixty dollars a month
so 85 of it though was by freaking cable
company yeah but uh I saw yeah I'm not
why will like to have been saving a
hundred fifty dollars a month i'm still
pretty happy with saving sixty dollars a
month yeah that's pretty good yeah and
it on I don't know other things speaking
of like returns though I'm excited I can
super excited about the next bit Robin
that's coming and I hope I don't want to
return it but oh yeah i forgot about
that your smartphone and search the
shipment middle the next month i'm
hoping it comes before memorial congress
uh mr. Shawn's asking what I'm wearing
on my wrist it's the under armour what
they call it you a band made by HTC I
hold it up it's just it's pretty simple
it's just you comes in the Under Armour
workout box it's got a small screen I
like it because it automatically tracks
sleep hearts go out to you that cool
though and I found if I don't get my
eight hours it's you know I'm feeling
tired I can't remember the last time I
got eight hours yeah I got a bit early
from such a baja will there ever be one
true smart home platform to rule them
all I think eventually it's just a
question of how long it's going to take
to get there that's the race right now I
think it'll end up being something like
Samsung and somebody on you
enter google and apple or whatever but
that's sort of you know the iOS android
thing where it will probably be a couple
but right now they're all trying to
figure it out there's just so much going
on it's all kind of a mess so somebody
needs to come in you know almost like
like the uber of taxis like and just say
like here's how it's going to work and
this and everybody's can do the go you
know you start to wonder if it's going
to be amazon just because the way i mean
they don't have a lot of things besides
the echo but it works so well that it
needs to be a product like that where
people are just like oh that's yeah
that's what a smart home is I get it
yeah yeah from bond voice you guys
review a lot of products on your YouTube
channel what do you do with these
products after reviewing them the vast
majority of them go back to the
companies that send them to us it varies
by company some companies are like no we
don't want that back you know what are
we going to do with it but the vast
majority of them do and a as Todd was
just saying you know he has some
products to return to companies before
they kill them so yeah the vast majority
of them do go back to the companies or
they go they a lot of them will end up
in Oregon and we have a closet and they
come out for like comparisons you know
so the g4 when the g5 comes out we'll
probably bring the g4 over to Barcelona
with us take pictures of them side by
side you know compare them and then
maybe when the review is done we'll put
them together to you it's sort of like a
lot of comparisons I mean it it sounds
awesome to have all these products and
I'd never complain about it but there
becomes a point where like you're like
there's just so many that you don't want
them all anyway you send them back
because you're like you're not using
them is just like collecting dust and we
can't give them away sometimes you can
give them a charity or something like it
they're old and the company gives you
permission to do that but you can't sell
them or anything so right there usually
it's just usually passes in the back
okay then you end up my dilemma sort of
it's like why we always talk that I
return things like you also end up
wanting a product that's yours even
though you know it's a company and they
might not want it back as a journalist
you're kind of like I just I want
something that like I own
no and I want it to be all mine and I
don't have to worry about sending it
back or anything like that so I end up
you know eventually just buying it if I
like it a lot anyhow in some form ya
know I generally I I end up buying the
stuff i really like as well because like
they prove we got the company purchased
by my own iphones by my own lots of
things tablets light bulbs come amazon i
go for mr. Sean have you guys considered
moving to California I have I almost did
it's sort of always an option I guess
it's always an option die just hey I
have nothing against California I just I
really like where I live yeah my wife my
family are all here on the East Coast
and I my wife works in city new york
city so it's just easier for us to be
here no well we are running out of time
and we still have a lot of questions but
i'm gonna i like closing out on a really
geeky question here so from brazen
Franco finished watching all 121
episodes of clone wars is it ok for me
to say that it was a lot better than
episode 7 um I gone on record before I
loved Clone Wars I thought it was
fantastic it was what the prequels
should have been really um yeah I would
say was better than episode 7 but you
also gotta remember you had 60 hours to
know those characters yeah you had a
like close to two and a half hours for
episode 7 and you had 60 hours to get to
know the the Clone Wars characters but
no the clone wars cartoon for anyone
that hasn't watched it it's really
really good at it makes the prequels
better it doesn't save them but it makes
them better well as always we appreciate
