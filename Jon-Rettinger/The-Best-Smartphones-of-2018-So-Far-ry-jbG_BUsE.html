by university of phoenix i took myself
back to school to learn how to make my
internet usage safer to keep my kids
safer and generally keep TechnoBuffalo
safer you ever see a phoenix waived all
fees for the course I'm taking if I want
to learn more be sure to stay tuned to
the end of the video we are already
halfway through 2018-2019 starting to
peak around the corner and by my math
and took a long time 832 phones have
been released this year we've reviewed a
lot of them it could be tough to find
the best phone if you Quagmire a
quandary you don't know which phone is
the best so I'm gonna break it down for
you we're gonna give our smartphone
awards mid 2018 and much like our vs.
videos so that can be a cop-out where we
give you a runner up there's one winner
so get your rage fingers ready for the
comments down below
so before we get started the one
disclaimer these are just phones that
we've already reviewed and tested here
at TechnoBuffalo we'll do another video
towards the end of the year with phones
that we haven't taken a look at and
phones that haven't come out yet things
like the note 9 pixel 3 Excel 2018
iPhones and whatever else might come out
between now and then let's our screen
this should come as no surprise to
anyone who follows a smartphone world
the best screen that was released in
2018 thus far Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9
plus they are bright they're beautiful
they're vibrant color reproduction is
incredible it's good in direct sunlight
surprisingly it's beautiful indoors I
challenge you to find a better quality
screen out there I'm seriously I dare
you fight me in the comments the next
category is the best value what phone
out there is gonna give you the biggest
bang for your buck that's a pretty
obvious one too it's a 1 plus 6 and it's
especially the $529 variant you're gonna
get 6 gigs of ram it snapdragon 845
getting a beautiful screen you're
getting dual cameras you're getting
almost everything that you could want
save for some some wireless charging and
significant IP protection from water but
this is an incredible value if you don't
know what phone to get and gonna make
sure that your dollar is going as far as
it can go just go to one plus comm and
pick out a phone they got one in red now
next this category I know is important
to a lot of you best camera no surprise
here pixel 2 and pixel to excel in fact
most phone manufacturers have had almost
a year to catch up to what Google did
this one came out at the end of 2017
and still nothing has beat it it is
absolutely incredible you combine
awesome optics and Google's machine
learning you got a recipe for the best
camera setup I have ever seen and it
does it all with a single sensor on the
back it's up to you Samsung an apple
so this next category is something new
to our smartphone Awards it's the most
unique phone there's been a lot of
really interesting designs that have
come out especially over the past few
weeks but the first phone that I saw
that had a mechanized camera that would
pop up the vivo necks taking this cake
and there's certainly been other phones
that have mechanical parts that have
popped up the people next me the first
time that I saw it was absolutely
incredible you all take that coupled
with an in screen fingerprint that
actually works you got a recipe for a
really unique phone it's not perfect
though I'm not sure I even recommend
that you buy it I wouldn't trust it if
it drop the UI is a mess you gotta jump
through 30,000 hoops put your own
launcher on and have it actually stay
when it comes to a unique feature set if
you absolutely nailed this one
with so many phones coming out in 2018
the flagships tend to get a lot of the
press but there are a lot of phones and
went under the radar the most underrated
phone of 2018 is one we just reviewed
and that is a moto g6 it used to be if
you spent 250 bucks or less on a phone
you got an absolute garbage pile of
diarrhea that wasn't gonna perform well
it's gonna break and not last not true
anymore you're getting an incredible
device and a lot of people see the spec
sheet and then go Snapdragon 450 I don't
want any part of it but do the homework
for you it compares really favorable in
a 2015 Snapdragon 810 and almost every
category except for Ram speed that was a
processor that was in things like the
Nexus 6p phones people are still using
you're getting three gigs of ram we're
getting a really beefy battery you're
getting a phone that you can actually
use more importantly one that I can
actually recommend without breaking your
bank you can actually buy four of these
for the cost of an iPhone 10
so I mentioned flag just get a lot of
the press and certainly there were a lot
of flying ships that came out but the
best flagship of 2018 and thus far is a
Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s9 plus there's a
little warm spot in my heart for the
note but I think what Samsung did with
the s9 was perfect what they did with
the note 8 the camera sensor is
absolutely incredible their screens are
absolutely beautiful a checks the boxes
of almost every single flagship feature
you could want
we've got Samsung pay you've got ip68
you've got wireless charging snapdragon
a 45 six degrees of RAM anything that
you could want from a modern phone
samsung has in there and they made it
customisable they took a huge step back
on TouchWiz or modern UI and made the
features that are in there really usable
I like the UI if you gotta buy the best
flagship out there look no farther than
the samsung galaxy s 9 NS 9 plus so that
was the best flagship what about my
favorite phone what phone pulls at my
heartstrings and maybe makes me
irrationally or rationally love it
my favorite phone the phone that I've
carried with me more than any other
device thus far in 2018 for me was
surprising is the iPhone 10 I've
actually carried this more than any
other iPhone in previous years it is
almost always in my pocket that's my
primary phone or secondary phone I was
reticent when it came to face ID and I
know I'm alone in the office here but I
really like face ID using it to unlock
apps has been awesome use against
unlocked my phone has been easy it's
worked well the camera well maybe not
being the best has been good enough I
love having wireless charging on and the
battery life has been surprisingly good
really like the iPhone 10 taking out the
whole iPhone versus Android debate it's
made my life the easiest thus far my
family uses iMessage my parents use
iPhones be able to share photos make
things a lot easier and made my life a
lot simpler which is why is my favorite
phone of 2018 they're obviously a lot of
smart phones to pick from you also have
a lot of choices when it comes to
education and where you're gonna get
your learn on there was a big gap in my
knowledge but it came to Internet
I run an online business that's been
hacked and taken down it was something
that I wanted to learn I was necessarily
working towards the degree I just had a
gap in my knowledge that I wanted to
fill so the past five weeks I took a
course on internet security and learns
how to keep a TechnoBuffalo safer and
also as my kids get older try to keep
them safer and keep them away from from
bad folks a lot of things I didn't know
I was surprised first at how easy the
eCampus was to use when I went to
undergraduate school and graduate school
I went to a physical campus so I wasn't
quite sure how the experience is gonna
go but they made it pretty seamless I
was able to take the course on my own
time which was a huge I generally only
get like two hours with my kids when I
come home from work so I didn't have to
give up at that time once they were
asleep I could allocate 45 to an hour
per night I can go through the course
material I was able to interact with the
instructor pretty easily and it got
answers back to questions in a pretty
seamless way so that was one hurdle I
was able to get past pretty easily and
beyond that when I work with my
developer now on implementing new
services TechnoBuffalo updating
WordPress I now speak the language with
what he's doing I think more importantly
I know the questions to ask as to how we
are keeping the website safer that's
been a big thing that I needed to know
so being able to ask the right questions
be able to understand the answers I
think is gonna help me keep the website
safer keep people that come to the
website safer keep that information safe
and generally just keep the website a
safer place to be I said safer a lot
because that was the theme that's what I
really wanted to fill University of
Phoenix helped me do that there's a ton
of courses that there's a topic you want
to learn you can learn those topics you
want to work towards a degree can work
towards degree all the way up to even
doctoral degrees me though I just wanted
to fill in the knowledge that I didn't
have and I do want to thank you versi
Phoenix for making this a really cool
experience I haven't gone back to school
in a long time and I was a little
nervous to give a bunch time to our
five-week course but it was fun it was
interesting most importantly I learned
something new if what I've said sounds
interesting you want to know the class
that I took hit the link in the
description to learn
more so you guys are probably rage in
the comments or maybe some of you guys
agree with my choices even the comments
down below and let me know and if you're
going to yell at me at least tell me
what phone you would pick for each
category and tell me why I'm wrong I'd
like to hear it maybe you could change
my mind when we do our best phones at
the end of 2018 whether you love me or
hate me now please give the video a
thumbs up and really appreciate of
course all that stuff that YouTube makes
us do because you don't see
notifications anymore subscribe hit the
bell I got a lot more videos coming up
we got a brand new series with Robert
Roosevelt it just launched called the
lowdown where you run down the top three
texts or it's gonna be going up every
Tuesday and Thursday definitely check
that out I'm gonna exhale I'm John Rhett
