technobuffalo and we are out here in
beautiful Oakland in this naturally
overcast day with the two gentlemen who
made this gigantic creation behind me
her name is the mark 2 and this is G
Cavalcanti CEO co-founder of megawatts
and of course we've also got Matt or
line the other co-founder well we have
three co-founders so I'm no screw the
other guy screw the other guy I'm the
second one that is here we're not gonna
deal with that guy at all so you guys
may have noticed there is a gigantic
robot right here right behind us and
believe it or not you can actually ride
in this thing shoot stuff hurt things if
you haven't heard of mega BOTS the goal
correct me if I'm wrong is to create a
giant robot fighting League and this is
the first entry in such an endeavor tell
us all about where you guys got started
how you wound up working on a giant
robot and you know all that fun stuff
that we need to know yeah so I actually
played battletech and mech warrior all
throughout middle school and high school
got hooked on robotics got a robotics
engineering degree went to work at this
place called Boston Dynamics making
legged robots and I was like oh wow I
could just make really big versions of
these that'll be awesome and then took a
little break started a space where I
could make any project I wanted it's
called a makerspace artisan's asylum in
boston met Matt through that and then we
kind of found this angel investor who
was looking to make his first big
investment in a robotics project he said
have we got a project for you and that
was the start of megawatts autodesk
called us up they said hey you've been
using auto to software we really want
will love your vision we want to work
with you why don't you come out to the
bay area let's get your robot finished
for maker faire out here and then you
know we'll see what you can do with it
yeah and then we had a giant robot and
we got drunk and we said what can we do
with it now and then we said let's
challenge a pan to a fight so you guys
did actually challenge Japan to a fight
via youtube if I understand correctly
and Japan responded and said yes
absolutely they said with the caveat
that there is melee combat so you must
be prepared for melee combat yes so
where are you in terms of
each other where are you in terms of
getting prepared for melee comment how
close are you so we have are just
finishing up a Kickstarter campaign to
outfit this robot for melee combat so we
have a bunch of partners that were
bringing on board to like replace the
tracks replace the arms with like melee
systems and reloading weapon systems and
basically just get it ready over the
next year for a giant fight against
Japan probably like later part of next
year so you can imagine this thing with
like chainsaws and fists and like a
jackhammer and stuff like that and maybe
even a flamethrower maybe maybe don't
want to go to America depth art has a
cigar flamethrower so it actually like
that's that sounds beautiful i also did
see the concept art if i'm not mistaken
there was a bald eagle wearing
sunglasses somewhere on each each
pauldron is a is an open mouth bald
eagle with a chain gun inside would I be
correct in guessing that a pauldron is
some sort of a shoulder-mounted cannon
receptacle it's I think it's just a
shoulder-mounted armor piece ok ok
understood understood really was a
cannon guys we're learning so much here
art wait so since we are a consumer
electronics site we do a lot with phones
I know they're gonna want to know the
viewers are gonna want to know what is
in each of your pockets so we'll start
up for it he's answer is hilarious so
I'm gonna be the boring normal person ok
ah apple iphone 6 pretty boring um
binbin an Apple user since the iphone
3gs so i have like the second or third
terrible nexus 4 yeah the second or
third one ever made no the second or
third to me because they've got it so
you could have gone with that first one
that would have been way cooler wouldn't
it yeah yeah so so it's like I I don't
replace or upgrade hardware all that
frequently so like the microphones died
I can only use it on speakerphone so any
call that I take is either with a heads
it in or on speakerphone the
speakerphone starting to die to
everything's clipped so usually at this
point I'll ask that kind of how using
your phone has changed the way you work
but I feel like maybe for you it's been
detrimental so
basically all of the meeting requests
have to be taken through my phone
because it's the only reliable one that
we have on the team so he will set up
meetings he'll be like yeah but you have
to call Matt's phone because basically
mine just doesn't work I'm the CEO of
mega box by the way and I don't have a
working phone listen man I feel you
diehards totally fine so given that i'm
about to enter my buttocks into this
machine where are we in terms of the
safety level is this threat level
midnight are we somewhere a little bit
below that yeah we're pretty close to
the close to the top so basically you're
sitting on top of probably like four ish
five ish gallons of gasoline running
through a internal combustion engine
with that's pumping hydraulic lines full
of boiling hot hydraulic oil pressurized
at 2,500 psi and they're running up
through houses that will pretty much go
up through your crotch and if one of
those hoses bursts off what happens is
something called hydraulic ution where
the hydraulic oil will spray into your
skin it'll get into your bloodstream and
kill you you know I swore to myself the
last time I was hydraulic alized that it
would that's what I said that it would
never happen again and I and here we are
I think by definition it means you die
like electrocuted implies death I think
I think the doctors told me that was a
very light electrolyte electrolyze ation
yeah it could be hi Rory station
ignoring the fact that it's a 12,000
pound robot with like multi thousand
pound arms and light cannons would fire
off at 120 miles an hour you'll be 15
feet mere this thing stands up this is
it's like lowest possible setting
excellent cool well I understand that
we've got a few pieces of wood nothing
nothing fleshy to shoot at but I
understand we're gonna get to dress and
stuff on it and draw on it so one of you
get to do it doing that yeah yeah let's
paint it up and shoot it I like shooting
things let's do it
so do you want to keep your face as
close to the paint as possible all right
inhale deeply okay cool okay okay you
couldn't you just let go straight in
okay nevermind okay
you
what can I make it can you just make it
pop identity smart park Matthew
ideas anything else on this one here
yeah okay no I mean that's a totally
reasonable request all right so let's
start with black on this one do buffalo
set horns right yeah okay cool oh that's
a great question he's good he's got a
he's got an extra sport you know you're
done with this right we could just leave
this here and stick it right up on the
wall you can still use it it be fine
it's a little bit of screen issue okay
how do we look you ready to blow
wholeness well hold it cool if you stand
in front of the cannon pass like 10 15
psi could play take your head off cool
with what cannonball so so you're about
to pressurize we're about to pressurize
the cannon about to get it ready to fire
hopefully take the Buffaloes head off
Pablo but we're just gonna be very safe
holy the Buffaloes had not are right
cool so the original concepts for the
game that we wanted to play before we
challenged a pan to a duel was we wanted
this to be like a giant game of papal
you fire these cannonballs on these
missiles full of paint and if you hit
parts of the robot the arm would break
off so this is very lightweight foam
armor look super cool payment go
everywhere and then when they hit the
canopy the reason the canopy has a great
so that it breaks up the paintballs and
like slimes you like Nickelodeon style
so you're in there wearing a paid ball
mask and like doing all that kind of
stuff we actually shot Matt a couple
times it was a terrible experience
terrible experience but Matt actually
had probably where we were back in
Boston at the time in like this super
cold warehouse in my late October
or something like that shooting a video
for it he had like put GoPros and crap
all over this thing and like gotten in
for the first time and we didn't really
do any testing so we didn't know it was
gonna happen and I like sat in there
with a paintball mask on and like pulls
the trigger and covers meaning it's
horrible it comes out you're like a fire
hose right 130
an hour and just like covers me it's
burning my eyes because we made it out
of dish soap for some reason like made
our own paint that's another story and
so I get covered I'm cold Boston
freezing warehouse and the camera crews
like oh the batteries are out on the
GoPro we have to just do that all it
says recording I think we're rolling now
cool so I'm gonna get inside this thing
with my trusty go pro what do you
suggest okay okay I'm a driver's seat
okay can get in the Gunners seat okay
what you go through in and then we'll
stand okay cool cool let's go like
you'll press the button it won't do
anything I'll just have to come in and
like tight little thing on the laptop we
said it whatever also don't touch don't
touch anything that's not the fire
button don't move a joystick don't move
anything only touch the button i'm told
to touch got it okay so i'm waiting for
you to get in right okay all right here
we go okay
and am I good to get any now okay do you
mind taking that for me excellent Thank
You Can I grab that all right I'm gonna
flip that up and push the crosshairs but
underneath it but only when you tell me
you okay only money only when you tell
me to okay this is so cool ready
oh my god
all right okay the safety flip up the
safety 32
it's a way to put look over there
oh my god I'm gonna pop in one more time
for a shoe bomber but we are not going
to go in front of this what is it's a
canon this cannon right here because
it's already pressurized so follow me
we're going to go around the back so
this is no big deal now I've done this
once before so I'm just gonna pop in
here the old Mark too okay he's getting
first okay No Go Pro this time he'll go
for to worry about here we go alrighty
and then close the cockpit okay don't
touch the sticks don't touch the six
alright no don't do it yet right don't
touch the six still touch the sticks
alright so I'm ready when you are okay
that was a blast hey that's all right
and I see the explosion also equipped
you both with very nice aviators yeah
just somehow it blew them right onto our
faces the mark 2 is just that American
that's really really impressive so as
you guys can see this is one of the
holes that we punched this is the first
hole that we punched and it's I went
clean through and that's not normal
correct is the first time we've shot big
with the boxes so maybe it is normal ok
cool so just as far as the wooden boxes
shooting career of the mark to we're
still we're still discovering things I
also I found this I found these little
happy little bits I got you guys gifts I
got you guys yeah we get we could send
this to a viewer we can ship that down
one lucky viewer can get a piece box
just a little bit of the box comment
below sorry yeah I guess it's happening
here we go Matt just owns technobuffalo
now here we go what I got a channel now
I gotta thank you guys so much for
having us I also wanted just really
quickly so this what you have here will
show it to the camera really quick but
this is the expandable foam what that
the balls are made out of right right so
basically we have these molds we have
two parts to them make the foam expands
into them and it creates this kind of
like rigid big shell that splinters
abacus it breaks off into pieces yeah
and then on the inside we've got a
splattering of your favorite 9020 yeah
so this is like buble
cornstarch and very cool well thank you
guys so so much for having us out here
was an absolute blast kind of a dream
come true if I'm being honest with you
is there anything else that you guys
kind of want to say thank you and if you
