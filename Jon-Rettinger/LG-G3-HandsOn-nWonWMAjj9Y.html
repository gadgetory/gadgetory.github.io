to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
john wrencher from TechnoBuffalo here
i've been checking out this guy LG's
latest iteration of a GG lineup this is
the appropriately named the g3 I
wouldn't get a chance to an unboxing
because it didn't come in a box but I
want to share my thoughts and
impressions give you guys a hardware
tour let's show you could expect when
you pick up your phone alright so here
is the g3 all dressed up in a very
attractive business suit we didn't get a
chance to an unboxing the phone because
it didn't come in a box I want to give
you guys a hardware tour an overview and
give you guys some very first
impressions somebody do a real quick
spec overview for you're looking at a
5.5 inch 2560 by 1440 pixels bleh that's
got a whopping 534 PPI meaning you did
the math it is quad HD which is damn
impressive
Android 4.4.2 at launch powering this
beast is a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 801 chip kind of oddly 2 or 3
gigs of ram depending on a region
available in storage size of 16 or 32
but you can expand that with microSD up
to 128gb 13 megapixel camera on the back
with laser focus and a 2.1 megapixel
sensor it lives here on the front res of
stuff you'd expect from a super phone
802 11 ABG and a co Bluetooth 4.0 and a
3000 milliamp hour battery all wrapped
up with a nice NFC bow so let's like
talk about the design here first for I
do a tour everything around it this
phone is gorgeous to look at and sort of
a slew of Android phones to kind of look
the same I think this one really stands
out the white here I think it's a really
nice touch well I think it would've
looked cool totally all done in black
you could be looking at what's an early
version I guess if it's going to be the
Nexus 6 and if true I think all of the
Android peers are going to be really
excited LG knocked this one so far out
of the park it is a beautiful phone to
look at and to hold
so this 5.5 inch screen we'll talk about
that in just a minute
you've got on-screen navigation so no
for physical capacitive button you turn
the phone on you could figure how you
want these to look either
black or white and when they not you
want multitasking on left or right it's
kind of a nice touch
so LG left the back and volume buttons
here on the back of the device I wasn't
the biggest fan of it on the g2 I didn't
think it added much but it's much easier
to find here on the g3 instead of a more
pronounced home button so way way way
easier but the reason I thought it
didn't really matter all that much
because LG's got the awesome NOC
features you DoubleTap it's on something
if you double tap on the home screen
turn it off double tap again turn it
back on so they don't have to even use
those home button if you don't want to
all that often it works really really
well here so obviously no volume buttons
or anything on the left or right side
you've almost totally bezel as
experience it's kind of crazy to see a
phone it actually has that on the bottom
you've got your charger and 3.5
millimeter headset jack with some
microphones out on the top saying more
microphones who got a the SK Telecom
which is Korean they've got sort of
antennas built in for some TV streaming
certainly US versions are not going to
have that so ignore that and know that
it's just not a stylus want to point
that out in case people would is that in
the corner so the back is plastic with
that kind of metal coating on it it
still feels plastic it feels a little
bit better than normal plastic but not a
giant around if you rub your finger over
it and you can serve hear that noise
it's very obviously plastic it's plastic
dressed up in metal clothing I don't got
the nice little speaker grille right
down there below so LG's done a really
nice job with their software and I was
sort of liked what LG did this Korean
version forever it's worth has crazy
carrier bloatware on it I mean look at
that
hopefully the US versions are not going
to come even close to that but that is a
whole ton of apps and if you're like oh
hey John just remove them no big deal
let's go ahead and try one we'll remove
it and see LG's UI and there it is it
came back you can't really remove it you
get to sort of remove it for like three
seconds before it pops back up on your
app tray so a bit disappointing
obviously go through the settings and
remove the apps that way but it's
definitely a bit of a convoluted process
we've got Universal search built in here
which is really nice to have and they
did a really clean job with it as well I
want to do chrome for example and go
ahead to search and it all pops up and
pops up really fast that's the theme of
the phone everything on here is just
fast but probably what you want to know
most about is this here screen the
screen looks really wee
nice obviously with quad-hd I don't
think at least my national testing
what's all that much better though then
there's a really nice 1080p display it
looks clear look crisp text looks
awesome images look great but I don't
really notice a difference so right now
it's sort of a I'm not calling it a
gimmick it's nice to have and sort of
makes it a little more future-proof but
divided at Pipitea mr. 1080 screen it
really wouldn't factor that much into my
decision which was a bit on the
disappointing side take a quick second
to thank our friends sponsors in general

that's ly n da comm slash TechnoBuffalo
back to this game nothing else about
this phone that is disappointing
so LG does your multi-window stuff kind
of interesting only if you hold down the
back button you can tap an icon and drag
up so let's say we want to do Chrome and
YouTube serve tap it drag it up there
Chrome's gonna launch take YouTube for
example and drag it back down there and
then you're going to get serve both
those applications running on top of
each other it's fine it works it's a
little bit clunky but it is there go
back home I'm multitasking sir they
retweet that UI a little bit as well you
can try and swipe them up they're not
gonna go anywhere if you want to get rid
of them you swipe them off to the left
bit of learning curve not a giant eel
but a very nice-looking I reminds me of
what HTC is done with sense overall
though they let Android for the most
part be tender they didn't throw a ton
of stuff at you I think what they add is
relatively useful
I love the knock feature you can now use
the knock to lock it not kinds of other
stuff but it's a really nice phone I
will do a separate video showing the
camera we
video showing the four capabilities the
laser focus looks really nice so I have
a whole gallery of images coming up -
when do the reviews to be able to check
that out first impression of the camera
are really good my first impressions of
the phone in general though are awesome
probably one of the better phones that
I've test enough test some pretty
awesome phones and so speaking of
awesome films I've tested it's bring
those in here is the HTC One m8 go and
lock the screen so you look like they
look sort of similar actually but you
see the boom sound speakers and sort of
not found here on the g3 here is
complete the trifecta a galaxy s5 and
just for fun let's throw an iPhone 5s on
in there as well
you can see what all those suckers look
like next to each other and here is just
the iPhone 5s with the g3 it looks like
a kid brother that wants to hang along
by certainly way smaller a very thin
device - out of g3 so overall again
really impressed looking forward to keep
testing it made my opinion on the
screens gonna change that use a bit more
here I like use my devices for usually
at least 10 days before I do a full
review so look for that coming up and
you know a little over a week and we'll
have that out for you guys I think we
figured oh you want to see me cover in
the review leave it in the comments or
right down below I'll tear your thoughts
on it until next time I'm done reading
from TechnoBuffalo see you guys the next
video bye bye
thank you guys for watching please
subscribe right here to be the first
ones to know whenever new videos get
uploaded we got a ton of stuff we do
phones tablets cars anything has to do
with consumer electronics has to be
