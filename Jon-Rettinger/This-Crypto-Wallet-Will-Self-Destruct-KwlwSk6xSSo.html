a wallet in the video it was just one
that had like a battery pack this time
though we're going military-grade and
yeah it's kind of a battery pack also so
I've talked in social media but I've
been trying to learn and invest in
crypto for the better part of the last
like two years and like a market itself
it's been ups and more recently weighed
down I've tried to share my life
experiences on this channel and I
haven't had the best luck
it's also been crazy confusing keeping
track of where my money is I have money
in coin base hit BTC I've got like four
different chrome plugins all with the
same job of keeping my money secure I've
got security keys and passwords that are
sometimes like 15 plus characters long
all the name of security so investing in
crypto is daunting enough just for a
novice to figure out but keeping that
money secure can be a security nightmare
so since I've been talking about my
struggles pretty publicly the folks at
Cobo reached out and asked if they could
sponsor a video since they've got a
solution or so they claim so thanks to
them for sponsoring this video but is it
any good
let's find out so I did a bit of
research on Kobo before I agreed to do
this video and put my trust and money in
its vault it was founded by a former
Facebook engineer and Kobo wallet the
first products pretty well respected and
it's got around half a million users you
also picked up around 13 million in
funding to get to vault to market
alright so what is it it's essentially a
physical wallet for holding your
cryptocurrency but it feels more like a
portable safe to me think of like it's a
regular you know back pocket wallet
prevention is the big thing here
preventing any one of the various
intentions from just getting at your
money so Kobo vault was crafted with
security in mind there's security from
every access point any ingress that
people could get to your money they've
protected so doing research their press
release says they have what I quote a
trifecta of security by offering
preventative hardware security features
and they removed all like the physical
points of attack they also give you
physical durability with a military
standard design and a crazy advanced
software features so reason I was
interested though it's the first durable
military-grade cold storage wallet that
is water-resistant impact resistant
protective accidental drops and icy
conditions and even from vibrations it
does other stuff to look support QR code
transactions and text tampering it will
freaking self-destruct it doesn't yet
all tokens but the main ones you'd
expect are here if you check out the
IndieGoGo link down below there's a full
list they're set this thing up is a long
sometimes frustrating process but it's
all in the name of security so inside
you're gonna get a 24 word pneumonic oh
it's gonna come with a bunch of small
letters to kind of play your own little
game of Scrabble to put that code inside
to make sure you keep it secure it's
obviously you don't want to like take a
picture of it and keep it in your phone
so in this really dust really looking
case you can fit in your hardware wallet
and the battery to make sure everything
is safe and secure really no matter what
security is a big question mark you
don't know how secure something is going
to be until somebody tries to get at it
but I will say I feel more secure with
something physical than I do having a
set of passwords stored in a password
manager on my laptop
if fact attacked or their servers go
down and some get access to it all my
money is vulnerable have something
physical that I can control that I could
put in a drawer I could put in a safe
like it physically hold in my hand does
me feel a little bit better about where
my money is keeping my money secure so
the retail price on this guy is gonna be
479 bucks we've decided to back it on
IndieGoGo it'll be two hundred and
ninety-nine dollars if you're investing
in crypto you might want to consider one
again we'll link to the crypto wallet
down below but I feel more secure with
my money there and again I wasn't a
typical TechnoBuffalo video but it is
something I've been experiencing in my
kind of personal life my personal
investing life investing crypto is not
gonna really well for me so this is
something I think I can control you can
hold my passwords better here and hope
that bitcoins TaleSpin reverses sometime
at any point something you guys are
interested in do you want to see us do
more in the cryptocurrency world
something I've got interests in but only
do it if you guys want to see it please
give the video a thumbs up we appreciate
it again thank you to Cobo for
sponsoring this video till next time
