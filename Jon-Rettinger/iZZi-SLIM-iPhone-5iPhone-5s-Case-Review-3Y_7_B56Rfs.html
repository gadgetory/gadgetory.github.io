TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be taking
a look at the easy gadgets easiest limb
for in one case for the iPhone 5 and 5s
if you love shooting with your iPhone
this is definitely an accessory you
don't want to miss out on so let's take
a look and see what it's all about the
is the slim case from easy gadgets is
one of their newest all-in-one cameras
solutions for the iPhone which includes
three physical lenses that revolves
around the back of the case if you want
to elevate your iPhone shots this is a
great accessory designed to make your
device even more powerful from the
get-go I was surprised on how great
these optics were the case itself with
these three revolving lenses may have
looked cheap but they don't disappoint
at all with the fisheye lens you get
this beautiful 180 degree field of view
and it's so wide that when you take a
photo your arms might show up in a shot
that's how wide it is in video mode
that's no problem whatsoever since it
zooms in quite a bit you'll still have
that fisheye look but not as drastic as
with a photo the next lens is the two x
telephoto lens which I don't really use
it all that often but it basically
magnifies your shot by two times and the
results I got were pretty good I did
notice that the specific lens is very
prone to lens flares and there's still a
little bit of distortion around the
edges of the photos but other than that
the optics are great and having that
extra reach for photos is always good to
have the last physical lens is actually
a two-in-one lens that sports a
wide-angle that gives you an extra point
67 x field of view compared to the
regular lens on your iphone and if you
unscrew the wide angle this is where
you'll get the macro lens so you can get
up close and personal with your subject
now talking about the wide angle first
it's not as crazy as a fisheye but it
gives you just the right amount of field
of view in a photo for a beautiful
landscape photos it's not too wide and
the image quality superb with little to
no loss in quality and I could say the
same for the video when it comes to the
macro lens I'm really impressed with all
the shots I've taken
I'm a huge fan of achieving that shallow
depth of field look and with the macro
lens it does a pretty respectable job
it's obviously not up to par with
standalone enthusiast camera but the
results I got were pretty good for what
it is you can achieve macro shots like
this and this but the only downside with
this is you will have to be super close
to your subject about a millimeter or so
a way to get that sharp
and Chris photo now talking about the
case itself it's not the best it's made
out of plastic but it is twice as small
as the older Izzy lens case the orbit
pro which is great but it's not the
easiest to use the openings for the
buttons and ports are too deep and
recess which makes it super hard to
access your ring vibrate switch volume
buttons and the sleep awake button the
LED flash is also covered up so if
you're thinking of shooting at night
don't even bother to shoot so to wrap
things up for you guys I'm giving an
Izzy slim case a TechnoBuffalo score of
8.5 out of 10 why because it offers four
amazing lenses at a pretty reasonable
price at just $100 and even though I'm
not a big fan of the case itself the
optics alone makes the Izzy slim case
worth it anyways that's it for this
video guys if you guys have any
questions just let us know in the
comments down below and as always a
Marklin second from TechnoBuffalo
