sets so for right now you just you just
get blue this is kind of another public
service announcement we did another one
a few weeks back where I told you now is
a really bad time to buy a phone this is
a product that I reviewed a while back
and liked my three inch worth that has
totally changed do not buy Google Wi-Fi
let me let me tell you why so my house
is not that big but 1800 square feet
it's a few bedrooms I picked up Google
Wi-Fi X I want to have a mesh network to
essentially extend my Wi-Fi network
throughout my whole house so I'm really
hard time getting reception with my
pretty awesome Netgear nighthawk up in
my bedroom and I couldn't move the
router a bit of background I've got 18
cheese Giga blasts Internet in my home
so I should theoretically be getting a
thousand up and a thousand I never saw
any close to that when I was standing
next to the nighthawk generally I got
about 700 up or down on Wi-Fi no they
plugged in directly I'd get that full
thousand speed crazy fast so I set up
Google Wi-Fi on my house I've testing at
the office and I'm super excited and my
speed drop instantly about 300 up and
200 so I reset everything did it again
speed take consistent I just kind of
dealt with it because those speeds are
still pretty fast and I get that those
speeds are still really quick but
they're not what I'm paying for
so Google Wi-Fi has 100 number on the
back called it their service was great
they answered the phone right away tried
to walk them through what's going on
they had no idea that having run
Diagnostics and diagnostics back to
Google and it came back with a big like
we don't know what's going on
so I'm paying for fast speeds but I'm
not getting fast speeds and beyond that
the mesh capabilities with Google Wi-Fi
have not been that good I'm still barely
getting more service than I had with
just the single Nighthawk router before
so I was bumped and I figured I want to
be the voice of consumer I want to tell
you guys my experiences I get a lot of
questions when you gotta buy products to
buy and I recommend a lot of products
but I feel like I should probably not
recommend some as well when I get one
that does not work for me but I'm going
to be testing a few other options I'm
going to test amplify I'm going to test
gyro
I'm going to test or be as well to find
one that works if you guys are looking
for a mesh network hopefully you'll find
one out of those that should work for
you if you've used one you've got an
option
down below and let me know which one you
guys used cuz I'm really looking for
something good I'm moving in about two
months and I want some it's gonna be
able to cover my whole home and I really
be hardware that's going to function
properly and I want to get at least
close to those full of theoretical
speeds so thank you guys for watching
once a quick second to give you the
comment of the day the comment today
comes from our tech to save you money
video and it comes from double-a IV who
asks you could have gone slightly in
more depth with each product such as why
LED bulbs are the best option so if you
want to follow him link to it down below
into your question I say it was more of
a kind of a teaser style video here's
some general tech that can save you
money fund know more details about it we
can definitely do that in upcoming
videos and if you want to be featured in
an upcoming comment the day it's pretty
obvious just leave a comment down below
a bit of a different kind of video I'm
done in the past more of a tbh new style
PSA don't buy Google Wi-Fi just say
yourself the money wait till software
updates comment maybe gets improved but
for right now I cannot recommend Google
Wi-Fi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
