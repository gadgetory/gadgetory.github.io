to you by the national campaign against
drunk driving what's up everyone walk
about their pursuit of Rhett endures
ransoms John Rangers to show where most
weeks I rant and rave on something
that's got me all mad and hot under the
collar last week though I was pretty
happy and I gave the advice for things
you should do for success on YouTube
this week I'm sticking with that theme
I'm gonna talk about things you should
not do he's successful on YouTube this
right just rants let's get started if
you didn't watch last week's video go
ahead and give that video watch first I
talk about everything you should do to
setting up cameras what camera equipment
you should or maybe you shouldn't use
what topic you should talk about if you
want to be a tech reviewer where our
products come from and all kinds of
other questions that I get asked pretty
regularly so check that video out you
can annotate it right here click on
otherwise a link will be right down
below but now I want to share things you
should not do there's a lot of things
that are just giant fat no nose for
success on YouTube let's start with one
that I see quite a bit in almost all of
my videos in every video pretty much on
all the internet don't spam channels ask
me for people to check you out that is
never a good way to gain an audience
don't leave comments on their Channel
don't leave comments on their video
don't spam people on Twitter everything
do don't don't do that
don't say check me out I make cool
videos I make awesome videos you should
click me link here check me out here all
that kind of stuff just don't do that
also don't leave eight full comments on
other channels I can't tell you how many
times I see us and it seems like just
common sense if you want me taken
seriously as a tech youtuber don't go to
other people's channels and call them
crazy awful names don't call them every
hateful word you can think of and still
expects for you and your challenge be
taken seriously whatever somebody leaves
me a hateful comment the first thing I
do is I go back and look at their
channel and I see what else they've
commented on if all I see is just
hateful comments I will ban those
suckers quickly and it seems like such
obvious common sense of course don't do
that
but sometimes common sense just doesn't
go for everybody so just don't do that
you don't necessarily treat everybody
with giant
rainbow wings and be nice to everyone
but just don't be mean to but you can
disagree that's not a problem but just
don't be hateful if you wouldn't take
somebody's face the general rule is
don't say it in the comments let's talk
about you you personally don't forget
that you are a brand what you say online
what you put up on the internet you are
a brand you want people to maybe send
you products you're gonna look at your
videos nip your comment history never
ever forget that you are a brand you are
what you represent for a long time
before TechnoBuffalo became a real
company I was the brand of John for
Lakers not only I was the brand of
TechnoBuffalo I recognized that from
very early on tried to conduct myself
you know in that manner I wouldn't go
out and I would necessarily get heavy
political cuz I didn't know place in
what I was doing I just want to keep the
tech channel about technology and that
sort of what our brand is don't forget
you can show your personality kind of
fun with it that's what you are but if
you make your videos and you're very dry
to talk about specs you don't put any
personality anything into it that's also
going to be your brand just be very
conscious of everything you say every
word that comes out of your mouth video
you upload represents you and make sure
that it's you at your best
don't use heavy slang so I understand
that if you're a younger youtuber or
that's the audience you're going for
have you slang it's certainly the
vernacular of your people and I get that
no no problems there up if you want to
go for more mainstream audience be very
careful using slang words and also slang
typing as well I see this all the time
so avoid you know all kinds of other
slang and swear words I'm kind of
qualifying those under the same umbrella
but try to be very very very conscious
of those when you use it you're sending
emails to people asking for products or
other youtubers to check you out
whatever it might be
don't spell things that should end with
an S in a Z don't put smiley faces in
emails read things very very carefully
and make sure they look professional
next this is one I struggle with so
regularly and all the time I try to be
really conscious after I do my videos
but try to avoid um as in likes the
likes have kind of gotten rid of but
took me a while to do that but the us
NIAMS really really hard most my videos
are totally unscripted and just me
talking to a camera without any notes in
front of me so everything's coming out
of my mouth has to
through my head first and shoot on out
sometimes my brain doesn't always work
that quickly and they're bound to be
owns and us and that's okay but don't
let them be the entire lengthier video
try and get out a point or two points
without doing any us or um and what
worked for me that I serve got me a
little better than I was when I would
talk to friends I talk to anybody I
tried to be very conscious of not saying
us um and so they've got my brain tuned
to avoid that when I go on TV and do
news because I try and be very conscious
that as well to try exercises at home
try and avoid that in your speech and
you'll find that eventually they'll
almost be totally gone but of course
always crop up just a little bit I want
to take a minute for my advice for just
a minute to give you guys a really
really important message do not drink
and drive and you think that this is
just common sense at this point don't do
it doesn't matter where you are how good
you think you are or how okay I am to
drive never ever ever get behind the
wheel if you're inebriated moderately
inebriated or even have had even a
single drink I promise you it is never
worth it a car is a several tongue
killing machine it could ruin lives in
the blink of an eye it is absolutely
just never ever worth I can't tell you
how many times and I was out and a
friend had a drink and tried to get in a
car and fortunately someone's always
been there to stop them be that person
be that person that stopped your friend
from driving you could save their life
or somebody else's it's super easy to
find it is need a driver as well call a
taxi or just stay put if you've been
drinking law enforcement is cracking
down like crazy and now throughout the
year if you're caught driving while
impaired you will be arrested this is
legit
arrest this isn't just you know minorly
hey you shouldn't do that
this arrested in jail no warnings no
excuses just don't risk it it is never
ever ever worth it get behind the wheel
of a car when you've been drinking or to
get in a car when you know somebody has
been drinking I guarantee you wait call
a taxi call your parents call a friend
whoever it is I might be mad at you they
will appreciate that you called them
because I can't emphasize that enough
please don't do it
the world is full of people who make
mistakes don't be one of them hope you
