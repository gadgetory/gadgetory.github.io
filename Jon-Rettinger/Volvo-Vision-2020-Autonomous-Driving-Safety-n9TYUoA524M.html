Hazleton from technobuffalo I'm here in
Sweden checking out the brand new Volvo
xc90 t8 twin engine and I also spent a
lot of time with Volvo checking out
their testing facilities and a crash
test and a lot of this is behind the
scenes work on what Volvo is calling
vision 2020 part of Volvo's vision 2020
involves the ass 20 track which we
visited they have active safety measures
there so you can actually get to see
cars stop with automatic braking and
autonomous features inside of the cars
then we also saw a crash test at the
xc90 it hits a ditch and then rolls a
little bit and the car itself is pretty
much totaled but the passengers are safe
and that's really cool too I'm here in
Sweden at the Astra zero test facility
where Volvo and hopefully in the future
other manufacturers are testing cars and
it's Astro which stands for active
safety test area so as opposed to
reactive these cars can actually start
to learn through autonomous abilities to
avoid accidents before they actually
happen and Volvo says that each year 1.2
million people around the world die in
car accidents and 20 to 50 million
people get seriously injured in by 2020
they want to prevent all serious
accidents okay so here we are in the
downtown area of the Astros 0 testing
facility and this is an entire city
that's actually it's a fake city it's
got four buildings and right here you
can see behind us one of the buildings
is coated in a facade from Harlem
actually such as a picture pasted on the
building and now this whole area here
and I'm standing right in front of a
four-way intersection can be used to
test anything that you would want to
test for a car driving a downtown
situation so say Volvo wants to come
here and test you know construction
scenarios so how does a driver safely
get through this construction zone when
all of a sudden of pedestrian pops out
and so that's what they have here at
this facility they have these robots and
and dummies so a pedestrian will pop out
at any moment and then they'll teach the
car and actually the car can learn while
it's on these courses in in areas like
this this is a really cool downtown part
of
the Astros 0 facility okay so you just
saw how Volvo Tessa's cars for
autonomous driving at the Astra zero
track now we're here at headquarters and
we're going to watch how it actually
tests is xc90 for safety when it rolls
into a ditch or actually hits a ditch
and you're going to see the cars behind
me right here it's going to hit 50 miles
an hour run into the ditch behind me and
then crash pretty much right where I'm
standing so we just saw was the xc90
coming through 50 miles an hour hit the
ditch jumped out of the ditch as you saw
and then settle behind me right now
against another embankment and I spoke
with one of the engineers and what
happened basically is looks like the car
might be total he's not completely sure
but something probably the insurance
company's going to want to take care of
thankfully though everybody inside he
thinks would probably have walked away
from that accident entirely so I looked
at the car you had both airbags deployed
you also had the curtain side airbag
deployed and then the infant in the back
seat the 18 month old was protected with
the rear-facing seat and it seems like
everybody would walk away from this that
this was a real-world test ok so the
xc90 is the first xc90 model that
Volvo's completely redesigned in the
last 12 years it's got improved tech
that includes vehicle cyclists and
pedestrians avoidance systems which
means the car will alert you and
automatically avoid those kind of
obstacles and all of these things in the
xc90 t a twin engine comes standard
they're not an option comes with
everybody's and it's also the world's
first car with a new intersection
avoidance system so if you're taking a
left turn out of a parking lot there's
an incoming car it'll slam the brakes
automatically for you so that that car
will avoid you so the volvo xc90 has
three modes including pure hybrid and
power the pyramids all electric and you
get about 40 kilometers of range the
hybrid mode features a 320 horsepower
engine in addition to an 82 horsepower
electric motor that's what Volvo says
they'll give you the best performance
and then finally there's also a power
mode that gives you priority on
performance and response and you can
expect 0 to 100 about 5.9 seconds
the xc90 also includes a lot of safety
features that Volvo worked on that
includes brand new seats with and put a
new focus on occupant posture so while
you're sitting the idea is that when you
get an accident and the car hits the air
or lands really hard your postures right
so you avoid spinal injuries at the end
of the crash okay so that was a quick
look at the ass 20 track the xc90 crash
test and the xc90 t8 twin-engine hope
