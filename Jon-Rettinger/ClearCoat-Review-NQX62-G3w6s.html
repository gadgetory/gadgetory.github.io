you of the clear coat scratch protector
for your electronics in this case for
the iPhone 3G before I get started
though I wanted to give a quick
shout-out to my friend I Harrison 30 and
his son Jude who I know watches all of
the videos so clearcoat is one of those
rare products that actually does work
better than advertised you can get this
for a myriad of electronics most phones
your computers they have these four
MacBooks and such and what it is is a
very very very thick plastic almost
adhesive that sticks onto your phone so
before I get to actually more details
about what it is let me show you what
comes in the box I'll put a link in the
sidebar case you guys are interested
these things run about 25 bucks so when
you open up the box you get some
instructions and I'll get to the
instructions again in a minute cuz it's
the only part of the product that's a
little bit squirrely you get your kind
of clear coat stickers here and you
can't really see how thick they are but
you'd be demonstration of what they do
in just a minute you get one for these
for the iPhones case for the front
protect the screen and then one for the
back and the sides you get a squeegee
here for pulling out air bubbles which
is actually pretty handy and this fluid
which you need to put on the case you
spray it all of your phone it's a little
unnerving so essentially what you do is
you peel these things off come right off
nice and easily
and you follow these installation
instructions essentially what you have
to do is you peel it off make sure it's
on a lint-free back and you carefully
remove the adhesive and you spray this
fluid all over your phone then you put
the adhesive on you let it dry you spray
again needs to squeegee for the bubbles
and repeat that process for the back and
oh you're thinking just a plastic case
you sell these at the Apple store well
that's what I thought too but let me
show you a little bit about what this
does close you guys that kind of
followed me with my cases on the iPhone
I've had a few but I stopped using em
fed like the bulk that created in my
pocket I wasn't so worried about
dropping my phone oh it's more weight
about protecting it from scratches from
keys and such and this thing is
absolutely amazing so I have it on the
front of the phone and the back of the
phone you can't even see it actually all
you can see is a little more shine the
only way to even tell it it's there
so I protect my iPhone and all my
electronics very carefully let's say I
keep them in closet with some keys
ordinarily I would not keep my keys
anywhere near my iPhone but and this is
the screen of the phone so let's say
they're in the pocket got the keys all
over them let's say one of the keys for
example happens to rub up all the way
against the screen all the way along the
back you'll notice there's nothing there
brush off the dust and that's it not
scratch not a mark not anything and that
was just with some light contact what if
I take the ridiculously big knife I use
for my unboxings and it's not something
I recommend to take the back of it put
it on the phone on the back of the phone
that metal part that scratches all the
time nothing not a mark on it it is
really really impressive it doesn't add
any heft any bulk and you get the real
distinct feeling that your phone is very
well protected and I like knowing that I
like knowing now that I can throw my
keys in the pocket with my phone
something I can never do before I never
have to worry about damaging my iPhone
if I'm testing another phone I can keep
that in my pocket and I have to worry
about scratching the iPhone it really is
just a fantastic product and I'm shocked
the only downside of the thing I don't
like about it is putting it on putting
it on can be a little bit difficult
putting on the front case cover is
relatively straightforward you follow
directions
we're putting on the back and getting it
to wrap around the sides a little bit
difficult doesn't stick at first you
have to keep playing with it takes about
15 minutes effeminate doing it on the
sides to make sure it sticks down but
evidently the folks at clearcoat know
the Hat and the back of the box here
they tell ya don't worry if you mess up
the installation we'll give you another
clear code to try again which is kind of
nice it does come with a lifetime
guarantee so guys just a nice short
video here but I had to share this with
you because I think it's such a
fantastic product and I don't say that
very often I review a lot of cases a lot
of electronics and some of them I
recommend some I don't this one I can
hold hardly recommend it absolutely
as advertised and it's fantastic I wish
I had it when I first got my iPhone 3G
and I wouldn't prevent it all scratches
from it I have one now for my Mac a book
that I'm gonna put on I'll clearcoat
anything that I have I think it really
is fantastic I did a little bit of
research actually I think the stuff they
use for the plastic on the front it's
the same things that they use for
coating helicopter blades to keep them
from scratching and denting obviously so
guys just a real quick review of the
clear coat protection for the iPhone 3G
or any electronics go ahead and check
them out in the sidebar and for
exclusive content be sure to follow me
