brilliance if you want to see one of the
coolest bits of smart home tech be sure
to stay tuned welcome to my house
Internet so as you look around my house
know that this is where anything
wireless comes to die
for some reason I get no cell service
here on any carrier when I step outside
it's fine and any Wi-Fi systems I've
tried to setup has not worked very well
I use 18 T u-verse I'm supposed to be
getting gigabit speeds but I don't get
anything close to that so we're going to
try to find a solution today we're gonna
use two different options we're going to
use an enterprise solution and we're
gonna try out and consider kind of the
leading mesh system with arrow and see
what's going to be you know the easiest
to install and also give us a best
combination of speed and also just
simplicity so let's give it a shot
hopefully find a solution
got to get my stream on so meshes
generally up my alley because it's
pretty easy and seamless to set up there
a bunch of mesh options I've tried most
of them but I wanted to give what we
thought was the best representation of
mesh so we took wire cutters example of
what they recommended they recommended
or V and ear which we have here and we
went with arrow for the test cuz it's
three axes points instead of two that
comes with or B so this stuff is for the
enterprise it's by ubiquity I don't
really know what any of it does so we
brought in Robert a networking guy to
kind of explain it and hold my hand
through it all alright so what we've got
here are some products from ubiquity
they are a company that provide
basically access points for stadiums and
super large office buildings and more
and more people are starting to take
like this Pro and gear and put it in
their homes because they find that it
actually works really well I've been
offending Vic woody for a while
so I decided the John needed a little
ubiquity in his home so what we're using
our two different products the first is
kind of this massive unify AC HD these
are like actually made for like super
big office buildings or stadiums very
high dense places and then to kind of
fill in where these two can't are going
to be these we have three of these
little in wall access point and they can
kind of fill in kind of
the dead zones in spare bedrooms just to
kind of fill in the gap and provide him
with really fair even and fast coverage
so like water and air price matters and
ero is way less expensive you can start
getting into ero for about a hundred and
forty nine bucks and then build up from
there depending on how many mesh points
you want and what you want to add in
also of note Amazon actually just
gobbled up euro like it's a delicious
snack treat so there might be some
privacy concerns with what Amazon can do
with your data and what they can see
Amazon is trying to say like don't sweat
it we're not looking at your stuff but
you guys can make the final judgement
but I wanted you to least know about it
so like euro the unify is also modular
you can inspect it out as high as you
want if you want to match what we have
here though it's definitely not on the
cheap side with the access points the
PIO we switch and the cloud key is gonna
cost you well over a thousand dollars so
one of the reasons that I wanted to get
my internet working at pretty consistent
speeds I wanted to step up my smart home
game and one product I've been taking a
look at looking at for a while is this
guy brilliant which is brilliant does a
ton of awesome things and I do want to
give them a shout out and thank you for
sponsoring this video so this beautiful
looking screen is actually a smart light
switch check it out so yeah in turn
lights on and off I could give them
it'll turn pretty much any dumb bulb
into a smart bulb but it does way more
than just that go and tap the screen and
get a lot more controls here so me show
you something cool hey Alexa what's the
weather tomorrow
it also interfaces a bunch of other
smart home stuff here so I've got it set
up with my nest thermostat if I hit
climate I can see both of my thermostats
right here I can control them you know
like I could if I was standing at the
nest which is pretty cool it's pretty
cool integrates a lot of other smart
home options as well so nose hue if you
got a ring doorbell who's ever ringing
your doorbell will show up here
obviously it works with Amazon's slew of
products so it was also really simple if
you ever installed a light switch it's
pretty much the same process and Outlook
setup is done on the light switch itself
so we've got the one switch here but
depending on your setup at home
brilliant also offers versions that have
two three and even four switch options
willing to them down below if you want
to check out brilliant if you want to
set up one leg switch two or three or
even more
they got 10 different options to
hopefully work for you guys so setting
up ero is completely idiot proof and I
can be the idiot that is proving that it
is a few simple steps yeah honestly you
take it out of the box you plug the
thing in to power it take anything that
cable from your modem and that's almost
the rest of that the app handles
absolutely everything else so the other
ones you don't even have to hardwire
them in you could choose to if you want
but plug them into power the app will
even tell you if you placed it well to
ask you some questions on the size of
your house and that's technically you
can set up all this equipment through
the unified mobile app on Android or iOS
but to really get the most out of your
hard-earned money and investment into
this system you're going to want to run
at the unified controller software
basically 24/7 it can run on Windows Mac
Linux or even in the cloud you're just
going to need some kind of computer or
server to run this 24/7 to be able to
get all the real-time data to be able to
make all of these fine tune adjustments
and tweaks to really get the system
working as it should be so the unified
controller looks a little bit
overwhelming and complicated and it
doesn't have to be necessarily but there
is a lot in here to unpack there's a
bunch of different settings both simple
and advanced and if you don't know what
you're doing you could potentially mess
things up though with a little bit of
time and research you can really get in
here and dial in the settings to work
absolutely perfect for the environment
you have these things set up in but if
you have to say that while hero was like
a four step process and took all of 15
minutes unify is not nearly that simple
that's a unify is like a twenty five
step process as you can see here there
was a lot that needed to be done to get
this all up and running and it wasn't
just a one person or one day job our
producer Ralph and I worked for multiple
days to get all the settings tweaked and
everything just right another point to
make is also that there's a little bit
of installation for the actual units you
can technically just throw the access
points anywhere they can just sit atop a
stand or something but for the in-wall
units they do require a voltage of power
through a network check that you already
own so you're going to want to uninstall
the plate basically plug the in wall
unit in it's going to receive that
voltage of power from apoE switch and
you're good to go it's not super hard to
do but it does take a little bit of time
so do a lot for a little bit
time to get these things placed and also
set up and configured so once you get
everything dialed in all those settings
tweaked and the in wall units installed
you can kind of just set it and forget
it
you do have the option to jump back into
the controller at any time and find
tweak settings and see some real-time
data but if you don't want to you don't
have to but you do have that option
available to you so the gyro and
hardwired in you can theoretically do
gigabit speeds but if you do it
wirelessly it's got a max of like 600
but just to see like what our baseline
is I did want to see what the hardwired
speeds were sleaze we could see what the
best of the gyro could conceivably get
us wired in I didn't quite get the
gigabit speeds I'm paying for was pretty
decent I got 750 three down and about
853 up but that's in an ideal world
which I've clearly note we do not live
in but let's check speed test and see
how it really does
so the speed tests are in obscure
results so as you can see you're pretty
good it actually was a lot better than I
expected especially when I consider its
handling sort of a gigabit speeds ease
of use was incredible the setup took
minutes and it was working pretty much
out of the box
so on the unify side the speeds were
definitely better so the money was well
spent the time though and a commitment
it took to get that working was way more
than I expected so the final decision is
going to be what you want to do and what
the speeds are in your house unify was
absolutely awesome the speeds were
pretty much double what I was getting
with the Eero system so for me I'm going
with the unified system but there's a
big caveat there you may not have
gigabit speeds if you've got something
slower or you're at a hundred around
there
you'll probably get those true speeds
with the arrow in which case it is not
worth spending the extra money for the
unify but if you've got those faster
speeds I would say anything faster than
probably four or five hundred the chance
of you actually getting those speeds all
around your apartment or house with euro
or probably less than you would get if
you went the pro route with something
like unify for me unify was worth it
because of what I do but if all you're
doing is streaming and playing some
games the e.r system would be absolutely
perfect I liked learning about
networking as a cool opportunity for me
to try to learn and have somebody that I
could ask and I could teach me how to do
it if you don't have that goat gyro I
don't think you're gonna be disappointed
