to you by citrix hey what's going on
guys the mark and sanger from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's episode of
rumor roundup we have a lot on tap so
let's just go ahead and jump right we're
still waiting for the HTC One m9 I hit
stores but HTC is already working on
another smartphone called the 19 now the
19 is alleged to support a 5.5 inch
display with a resolution of 26 60 x
1440 it should also come with a 2
gigahertz octa core chip 3 gigabytes of
ram 32 gigabytes of expandable storage a
20 megapixel camera and a 2800 milliamp
battery now these are definitely
flagship specs but from a design
standpoint the onee nine sports a
plastic body there's no unibody design
or aluminium to be found the camera in
the back also seems to stick out which
seems to be a trend nowadays with a lot
of the newer smartphones though there's
still no word on when the 109 will get
its official unveiling but earlier
report suggests that it could launch
soon Alyssa vacuo respects offered by up
leaks claimed the device will arrive by
late March so what do you guys think of
the 19 are you guys thinking of picking
it up or are you still interested in one
m9 just let us know in the comments down
below Google's pretty familiar with VR
already thanks to you google cardboard
but Google is apparently going even
deeper with a newer project design
around Android yep that's right Android
in a virtual reality world the wall
street journal reports that google has a
team of engineers tasked with creating a
version of android specifically for
virtual reality the software will
apparently be distributed freely just
like android giving companies a time new
focus on hardware now over the past
several months there's been a lot of
interest around vr and not just gaming
we saw several headsets from HTC Samsung
and even oculus there's not a whole lot
of details about the project just yet
but Wall Street Journal says that the
project is quoting quote speculative
hopefully we'll get a glimpse at
Google's i/o conference in a few months
the rumor of the day goes to Samsung and
a new Galaxy s6 now there's a talk going
around that samsung may already be
working on a water-resistant version of
the galaxy s6 Paul the galaxy s6 active
Samson redesigned to galaxy s6 if you
guys may have not noticed it lost all
its water and dust-resistant features
which is a big selling point for the
galaxy s5 the device that everyone's
talking about sports the model number
SMG
890 a making it likely to follow up to
last year's s5 active with a model
number SMG 870 a now the only spec we
know so far from this device is its
display which should be sporting a 1440
x 2560 pixel the essex active should
pack the same specs as its brother of
the galaxy s6 which should come with an
octa-core ex you know 7 processor 3
gigabytes of ram a 2550 milliamp battery
and a 16 megapixel shooter in the back
hopefully we won't be waiting too long
for same things official announcement
but I'm curious are you guys holding on
for the s6 active or are you guys more
interested in the s6 and the s6 edge let
us know in a comment something let me

4th river of the day which is coming all
the way from LG LG is expected to launch
its g4 flagship device in the coming
months but new reports from korea herald
suggest that that's not the only device
coming from LG the korea herald said
that LG plans to compete with samsung's
note series now they said that LG's new
device is going to be even more powerful
than the g for their new flagship device
the device will be sold under the name G
note which is already trademarked by LG
now we don't know much yet in terms of
specs but since reports are saying that
it's going to be more powerful than the
flagship g4 we're expecting great things
from the jhino now moving on to our last
room of the day also coming from LG it's
the LG g4 this week a few leaked photos
were published by nowhere else showing
off what is allegedly the LG g4 it looks
very similar to LG's recently released
LG G flex 2 thanks to its slightly
curved screen and body but it could also
be an early render of the G flex 2 and
not the g4 at all who knows LG hasn't
really revealed much about the g4 and
there aren't a whole lot of leaks just
yet either but we're guessing it's going
to feature a fingerprint reader an
upgraded 20.7 megapixel camera in the
back AG Pen Stylus a super high res
display with a resolution of sixteen
twenty by twenty eight eighty now we're
not expecting LG unveiled
for until april or even may but at this
point LG is likely putting its finishing
touches on 2g for I'm excited to see the
g4 and I thought the g3 was an awesome
phone but ready for something new and
more powerful anyways that's it for this

talked about in this video will be in
