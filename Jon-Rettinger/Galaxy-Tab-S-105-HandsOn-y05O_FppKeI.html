TechnoBuffalo I'm here with a lot of
people so I might be a little quiet but
I wanted to show you first look at the
Galaxy Tab s Samsung is gonna call them
both the Galaxy Tab s this and the 8.4
inch model but you're looking at the
10.5 inch version still super thin you
still got that amazing 2560 by 1600
pixel Super AMOLED display incredible
viewing angles and you can see it's
super light so I'm just holding with one
hand and of loading it around up front
you got the 2.1 megapixel camera up top
you have the power buttons and volume
control keys as well as an IR blaster on
the right you've got speakers micro SD
card slot it's gonna ship with 16 gigs
of storage you upgrade that up to 128
gigabytes
he's an slot right there micro USB and
SIM card slot so potentially carrier
partners although right now we haven't
been told about any regular buttons up
there and then you can see running
around this is like really nice metallic
finish so it looks like metal and then
on the left here another speaker 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and on the
bottom resting on my knee there on the
back you should say I should say is a 8
megapixel camera you got the flash and
the same kind of finish we fell on the
galaxy s5 and again these snap
cases where I guess they're like little
snap button so you pop on a case with so
a unique design element and that's
permanent so you can't take that off so
you kind of I love it or leave it
just go through the software real quick
it's basically the same experience that
we saw on the Galaxy s5 with some tweaks
for the tablet so you have paper garden
focusing on magazines Samsung watch on
news and a lot oh and side sync actually
it's just a really cool software that'll
allow you to place calls or receive them
through your Galaxy s5 that's using
Wi-Fi direct connectivity so no circuits
which network required for that but all
these apps as we've seen Samsung has
done the pastor optimized for the tablet
and going around galaxy essentials and
galaxy gifts you'll get special offers
depending on where you buy this device
and of course you also get some of the
pre-installed software milk has been
optimized Samsung's free music service
has been optimized for use on a tablet
now too
and under the hood three gigs of RAM and
an ex he knows five processors so
everything's moving along really quickly
no word on the battery but Samsung's
tablets have done pretty well in the
past batteries are not too concerned
about that but let's just give you a
quick look at a video so we can show you
how the screen looks since that's sort
of the highlight here to see the viewing
angles are pretty impressive it's kind
of stunning to see this quality and
something so thin and light it's like
opening a window so really impressive
and I just wanted to give you a quick
look here this is ty Hilton with
technolo taking out the Galaxy Tab s is
the ten point five inch model thank you
guys for watching please subscribe right
here be the first ones to know whenever
new videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do it mister electronics has to
be plugged in or uses batteries we
review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
