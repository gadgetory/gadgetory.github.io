gaming editor at TechnoBuffalo comm and
I'm here with a look at Monaco what's
yours is not all right Monaco what's
yours is mine was me by Pocket
walkthrough games and published by
Magisto let's write the same Majesco
with that old B logo that's not really
in use anymore those guys have been
publishing and making games since the
mid 80s anyway this is a top-down
stealth co-op heist title that just
released on the PC platform and it's set
to drop soon for Xbox Live but I think
it was recently delayed it's won some
really big indie game awards leading up
to its release and it has since pulled
in a lot of positive critical acclaim
anyways I know we just got started but I
am going to step away for a second so
that you can listen to the soundtrack
behind the game the piano music you're
hearing was actually composed by Austin
Wintory the same guy that composed the
Grammy award-winning soundtrack for the
PlayStation 3 exclusive known as journey
anyways check that out real quick
I have to admit that I am unfortunately
doing Monaco a big disservice first of
all I'm not quite good at the game yet I
think I recorded this with around an
hour of play time to my credit so I
haven't quite mastered the game's
mechanics but the bigger disservice is
the fact that I'm playing this game
offline by myself I did this in order to
avoid a drop match or maybe finding a
user who's gonna scream profanities at
me the entire time I recorded the
gameplay the community so far has been
awesome but this is the internet and
people are crazy so I figured it'd be
best not to risk piling on with someone
else so let me send something completely
straight Monaco is best played with
friends it's got both local and online
co-op so make sure you friend up or find
some Internet randoms to get going with
this game it's so much better when
you're playing with other people and
with Monaco you start by selecting a
character class so for this video I went
with the pickpocket and a bit later to
look out every class has special
attributes the pickpocket for instance
has a little monkey buddy you can see
right now running around and collecting
a nearby coins so that I don't risk
getting caught or hurt or you know
whatever setting off alarms there's also
a mole who can dig through walls
gentlemen who can disguise himself and a
lot more when you pick which characters
you use it pretty much defines how
you're gonna play the game forth at that
level you pick each level so especially
when you're with friends
scouting cash hunting and sneaking are
all done better by individual classes
and that basically creates this
automatic layer of teamwork and reliance
when right off the bat and ripen again
Monaco becomes a much more strategic and
cooperatively rewarding experience look
at me just running away I'm so terrible
at this game I'm sorry pay attention to
me lose for a bit
alright spoiler alert I am gonna die
here pretty soon but one of the big
advantages that you have when you're
playing with friends and Monico is that
you're able to cooperate and work
together to distract guards or discover
other parts of the map it's not reliant
on one single player to be the
distractor to run away and to make sure
that that the exit is reachable at all
times that's the trouble I got myself
into here I do make it through this
particular floor of this map just by
running away like an idiot like you see
me doing but it's much much easier and
really a lot more fun when you're
actually able to play the game with
others and work together towards saying
like hey I'm gonna distract the guards
you head towards the eggs and I'm gonna
hide inside a vent and then make my way
that way so much easier so much better
and especially when you're communicating
with others so that is why I say that
you should be playing this game with
your friends it's cool to play with
randoms but I mean if you've gamed
online before you always know that
you're gonna find that guy or that girl
besides I'm gonna run off by myself and
forget the mission at hand or I'm just
gonna walk around getting coins so that
is definitely a big positive to playing
with friends and that's why I recommend
it I will say that this game is not
gonna be for everyone I feel like I've
been saying that a lot with the games
that were playing lately but we're
seeing sort of an indie game Renaissance
right now and it's incredible for me as
a fan of the genre of gaming that that
any games tend to explore this this
stealth sneaking heist game is difficult
Monaco is not easy and it's not an
instantly rewarding game it's one that
takes a lot of time and patience to
master and as you can see here I'm I'm
bumbling like an idiot walking through
fire I'm nearly dead I don't care I'm
still having a lot of fun with the game
and like I said I am gonna die here in
just a second so we can enjoy that
together but if you are a fan of stuff
that makes you think stuff that's a
little bit different
perhaps not nearly as instantly
gratifying as a military shooter for
instance check out Monaco
it's cool especially if you have friends
as I keep saying you will want to play
this with partners if you're playing
solo that's fine too I've played a lot
of it by myself as well it's definitely
more difficult but I'm still having fun
with it and look at this just dead so I
will switch over to the pickpocket when
you die in the level you can use that
class anymore at least that's my
understanding so anyway you can check
out the end of this video and stay tuned
for more we'll be covering more indie
games and mask games here on
TechnoBuffalo and as always i'm joey
davidson and i will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
