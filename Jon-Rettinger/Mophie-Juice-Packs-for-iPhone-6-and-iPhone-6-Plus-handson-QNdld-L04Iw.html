TechnoBuffalo here one of the highlights
of CES 2015 was Moe finally announcing
their Juice Pack accessories for the
iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus we got
two of them in front of us they are
shipping now available in about five to
seven days so we've got two out of the
three total lineup we have the full
lineup here for the iPhone 6 plus it's
just the juice pack for the iPhone 6 you
either get a juice pack plus or you get
a juice pack ere difference is about 20%
they're gonna give you a hundred percent
battery life whereas the plus will give
you one hundred and twenty percent let's
go ahead and dig into both I'll take a
quick look at the packaging here we've
got the juice pack for the 6 plus go
ahead and open it up and I should
mention that these are available in
three colors in white black or in gold
all the movie products I literally like
about them they come fully charged you
gotta pick one up and run to the airport
you will be good to go you also tell you
the impact protection right there on the
lid so in addition to being able to
juice up your phone
they're also case you wanna make sure it
can protect them as well it's got a
pass-through charging so it's got a
micro USB ports you can also charge the
case and charge the phone and then a
standby switch of course if you want to
turn it off let's go ahead and open this
up this is going to cost you one 1995 as
I mentioned is available in shipping now
for Mophie go ahead and slide this right
out so we're going to have inside of the
box then of course we'll show you what
it looks like on a phone so not a on the
tiny side but the iPhone 6 plus is not
on the tiny side either go ahead and
pull this out there we go this feels
gigantic but we'll see how it looks on
the phone and of course we'll do a
pocket test as well an extension cable
for 3.5 millimeter headset jack because
it's way you recessed in there then
you've got a micro USB charging sync
cable and some information so let's push
all that off to the side let's take a
look at the case and of course what it's
going to look like with an iPhone 6 plus
this is going to give you as I mentioned
an extra 60 percent additional battery
which can translate to 14 points two
additional hours of talktime a little
over seven hours of web browsing 8.4
hours of video playback up to 48 Edition
hours of music playback so plenty of
time for that goes ahead and push
all the way in I've got a bit of a chin
down below and to speaker grilles put
the top back on on the bottom of it it's
a little bit raised that's where the
protection comes in and it's bit of a
soft touch plastic there to keep your
phone nice and safe and that should just
snap right in easy access to all of your
buttons here you've got your volume up
and down of course your profile switch
you can very easily access as well on
the right hand side there's your power
and lock button so right now I've got it
turned off you can see it's in the red
you've got LED indicators let you know
how much power you've got in it so it's
about 75 percent charged that's where
your micro USB port is going to plug in
of course if you want to get to through
the five millimeter headset jack and a
really long cord or you can use the
extender cable that Mufi is including
let's go ahead and turn this on and see
if it charges up my phone and it is
indeed charging my phone letting me know
that I'm getting power to it so not tiny
but you'd expect a case that has a
battery power on it for a large phone to
be about this size let's go and see it
looks like in the pocket so let's drop
the six-plus into my pocket I'm just
wearing normal dude jeans can see that
it definitely makes an outline it's not
unwieldy you could certainly walk around
and you can dance if you're so inclined
but certainly you will be aware that
you've got a large phone and then a case
on it in your pocket the white glossy
well looking pretty nice is extremely
slippery so I'll bear that in mind we're
trying to pick which colours right for
you the black is more soft touch and I'm
not sure what the goal there are two
options for the iPhone 6 I mentioned
we've got the juice pack plus the plus
meeting or get some extra battery life
out of it so you get up to 17 hours of
additional talktime here which is pretty
solid so we can slide this out there we
go 12 hours of additional web browsing
13 hours of video playback or for music
and extra 60 so here is the black
version it's soft touch black and pull
this out
from design standpoint relatively
similar you've got cushioning on the
side to make sure your phone is going to
be very well protected they're on both
sides and then of course you've got that
same soft touch back design standpoint
looks almost identical to what we just
saw with the iPhone 6 plus so I'm not
going to walk you through all the
buttons and that's kind of thing let's
go ahead and put the phone right in goes
in the same way top pulls right out go
ahead and bring in the iPhone 6 and
should turn it on slides right in you
can see that same sort of raised area
right there to give you an impact
protection go and slide that down and of
course you've got your battery right
here and then you've got that raised air
area that we just saw let's go ahead and
push the LED light same thing about same
five percent charge flip that over and
this should start to power on for us and
there it is let me know my iPhone 6 is
now getting juiced up this feels much
smaller this is the Plus version I would
imagine that the juice pack air is
certainly going to be even thinner they
do give up 20% of the extra battery for
me if I'm putting a battery case on my
phone rather have as much battery as I
can but Mufi offers options in case you
disagree with me so here are your two
choices
iPhone 6 plus iPhone 6 for me movie is
really the best between style
performance and impact protection which
is obviously really important with a
phone movies done a really nice job with
their sort of internal software to make
sure not too much power is going through
the battery I never go into overheating
issues or overcharging your battery and
did just do a really nice job that's
really not the only option out there but
at least for me when I pick up a case
usually Mufi is the way that I will go
