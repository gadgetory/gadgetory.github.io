TechnoBuffalo here today June 7th
Nintendo took the wraps off their newest
console the Wii U that's my letter U I
had a chance to go to e3 this afternoon
and check out Nintendo's booth while the
Wii U isn't playable yet they did have
some hardware sort of functional as
you'll see at their booth I was able to
get some hands-on footage with it
there's a lot of background noises and
no one was saying anything of substance
so instead of making you hear awful
awful noise you're gonna have to hear my
awful awful voice because I just dubbed
it over I thought would be just a little
bit easier so hope you guys enjoyed my
hands on foot with the Wii U for all
your Nintendo gaming and electronic miss
I'll be sure to check out TechnoBuffalo
enjoy
all right so let's take a look at the
Wii U this lady was walking around with
the controller she wouldn't let me film
it and hold it at the same time the
screen was completely unresponsive it
was just showing that Wii U image I did
feel very solid in the hand though serve
had that obviously plasticky feel very
reminiscent of the Wii remotes but it
did feel solid and it didn't feel too
big despite the sort of square size it
also felt a bit ergonomic in the hand
that little hump in the back really made
it feel nice you can see some images of
it here as well continuing our tour of
the booth you can see the display for
Zelda Skyward Sword this is where they
had the Wii U out and that's not even
real game footage supposedly that's xbox
360 or ps3 footage of the same game but
they had the controller out sitting on
the table you can see it right there
it's sort of props itself up next to the
Wii Remote and the nunchuck which I love
to say nunchuck they also had the actual
console sitting there you can see it
looks like a big fattie we finally some
HD gaming on Nintendo I'm pretty excited
about this there wasn't that much new to
see here just there the console itself
unfortunately no real gameplay footage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
