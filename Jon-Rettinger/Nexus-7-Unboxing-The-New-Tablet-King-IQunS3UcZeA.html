from TechnoBuffalo here than I'm boxing
to Google's Android tablet Savior this
is he just announced Nexus 7 made by
Asus this guy is rockin in videos
quad-core Tegra 3 got a 7-inch display
the 1280 by 800 resolution a Giga RAM
and a lot of hope and a lot of hype
let's go ahead open this box up dig in
let's see what it looks like
all right so here we've got the box with
the Nexus branding and kind of cool they
made the bezel look like a seven next to
seven on the side on the back made for
google play full-fledged Android tablets
and pure Google Nexus 7 features a
powerful quad-core processor
front-facing camera and vivid seven inch
HD display so you can play your favorite
games video chat and watch videos in
stunning clarity let's go ahead and
slide off the sheath and we've got a
black box Google will bestowed the eight
gigabyte version on us which will retail
for $199 and ship sometime in the middle
of July if you want to pick up a 16
gigabyte version it's gonna set you back
about an extra 50 bucks at two hundred
and forty nine dollars go ahead and open
this up cause another sneaky piece of
tape on the side I have not seen one of
these yet in person haven't held one
this is one of the devices that was
given out to attendees at Google i/o
open oh there we go alright so there is
the tablet sitting nicely in its little
sheath there it is running and will ship
with Android 4.1 jelly bean off it was
extremely light we've got a version in
white which I believe I was only made
available to Google i/o attendees a
black should be what initially ships at
retail push it off to the side for just
a moment see what else we're going to
have in the box
alright in box number one we have books
warranty information we have a sinking
cable and that is the microUSB variety
it's a pretty standard I'm guessing
you've got a wall charger kind of
exactly what we have Asus brand a wall
charger with that USB port that looks to
be about it and that's all we have in
the box let's take a look at the reason
everybody is here this is the Nexus 7
off all the plastic very satisfying
noise and open up new look
if that plastic whooshing sound so first
blush so on first blush this back looks
to be kind of shiny plastic actually I
serve a soft touch feel to it
big Nexus logo a little smaller Asus
branding right there from a dimension
standpoint seven point eight inches by
four point seven inches by a pretty thin
point four inches and this whole thing
weighs eleven point nine ounces you go
ahead and assume I can find a power
button and turn it on while we're
talking there we go lives right there on
the right hand side this display which
is now booting up for us is seven inches
as a resolution of 1280 by 800
that's an HD display that's the 216 PPI
cuz you're doing the math at home it is
a backlit IPS display take a look at the
jellybeans launch sequence here battery
it's a 4325 milliamp affair giving you
about eight hours of usage it's a Tegra
3 processor so it's quad core clocked at
about one point three gigahertz on the
front we have a 1.2 megapixel camera for
all your video chatting needs it also
has NFC built in here so you can do your
Android Beam we're gonna get a twenty
five dollar credit to the Play Store and
Transformers Dark of the Moon going to
be in here as well and it's going to be
a cover also available as well the GPU
is a twelve core GPU what we're not
gonna have in here though is any sort of
micro SD storage let's take a quick look
or around the device on the left hand
side really nothing except for a noise
cancelling microphone port and four pins
for presumably some sort of dock
connector maybe something in the car or
charging that will be coming soon on the
right hand side we've got power and lock
sort of hidden off there and volume
rocker up and down on the top nothing
but we do have another noise cancelling
microphone on the bottom that's where
you are charged in Singapore it's going
to live and 3.5 millimeter headset jack
let me go ahead and run through and do
all the start-up stuff here go take a
real quick look at the home screen of
Android 4.1 jelly bean on the Nexus 7
alright so here is a new home screen the
first thing you're going to notice is
Google Chrome is now the official
browser of choice
of Android is now out of beta let's go
ahead and take a look at applications
you can see it's gonna come standard on
here mostly usual stuff we got the new
currents on there the new YouTube
widgets pretty much the same as Ice
Cream Sandwich
nothing really noticeably different
there let's go ahead and take a look at
settings and just to show that this is
indeed running a newfangled version of
Android go ahead and go down to the
bottom about the tablet and there it is
Android 4.1 it looks like a phone
operating system but the phone and
tablet OS is have kind of merged here a
so it should be very familiar I've got
the soft touch bottom a soft buttons at
the bottom as well so no capacitive home
buttons or anything it's all standard
Android here now go ahead and swipe
those things off
similar to what we saw introduced with
Ice Cream Sandwich pull this down if I
had any notifications they would show up
there and they would be new fangled
fancy notifications so I'm gonna go
ahead and use this tablet for a little
while try and use it for at least three
days and we'll come back with our full
review of the Nexus 7 what do you guys
think is this the tablet that you've
been waiting for a price point under 200
bucks
it's certainly very competitive perhaps
its biggest competitor is this guy this
is the Amazon Kindle Fire and putting
these two next to each other at least
front to front they look very similar
however you see a big difference when
you take them and make a tablet sandwich
the tapered edges here on the Nexus 7
really make it feel thinner and it
certainly feels noticeably lighter than
the Kindle Fire but we're probably only
a month or so away from the Kindle Fire
2 debuting so very interesting to see
what Amazon does to compete now with the
Nexus 7 very excited to take a further
look at this guy and use it as my daily
tablet get it hooked up to the Nexus Q
and see how everything works any
questions or things you want to see
about this sure to leave your comments
down below
John Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you next video buh-bye
