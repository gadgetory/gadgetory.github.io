lakers calm with an unboxing for you of
the AT&amp;amp;T quickfire it's a new qwerty
feature phone from AT&amp;amp;T Wireless it's
got a touch screen full keypad at a very
seem to be very full-featured device I'm
looking forward to using it reviewing it
but for the meantime let's get to the
unboxing so here's a fedex pack that was
sent to me from PR firm go ahead and
give it an open here is the box in
typical 18t fashion with the orange 18t
quickfire the logos for 3g texting i am
emailing music Sam logos on the top some
phone information 18t on the side put
fire and another picture of those of the
device so it seems like this device is
meant to go head-to-head a sidekick from
t-mobile so let's go ahead and see how
this looks AT&amp;amp;T quickfire right there
and open this up inside of the box we've
got quickfire start guide take a look at
that in a second here is the device
itself go ahead and put that off to the
side and take another look at here's the
battery and here is the charging cable I
believe the phone is made by utstarcom
and ATT branded let's see if this is a
proprietary cable or if it's some sort
of USB standard it is totally a
proprietary cord right there really a
flattened form of USB so that's good to
know take a look at the other stuff that
came in the box here's the battery let's
open this up see how big it is you can
see right here maybe this is a 3g
capable device so hopefully it's big
enough it's a 1200 milliamp hour battery
which should be just the right size for
a device like this going to take a look
at the phone itself actually very
excited to see this been getting
excellent reviews and it seems to be an
ideal phone for the texting and
e-mailing crowd
threw it away all right out of the
packaging students think this was a
slide open it does got sort of a
spring-loaded slide kind of cool let's
put the battery in let's boot it up and
let's see what she looks like there
isn't a sim card in there so we'll see
if it still boots up without one I
assume that it will all right batteries
in will peel off the plastic just out us
a little bit more all right plastics off
let's power this bad boy own and see
what it looks like I'll do a full
hardware review of it too so you guys
can get a sense of the device and really
what it looks like and what all the
buttons are about in an upcoming video
so powering on get your AT&amp;amp;T logo I
always loved these love these first boot
up should i gets you a chance to know
the phone a little bit better I think
it's very cool that they added a touch
screen to a to that very loud 3d logo
and that's it that was a very quick
Buddha um so guys the camera back up
here just a real quick unboxing of the
AT&amp;amp;T quickfire made by utstarcom hope
you guys enjoyed the unboxing and I'll

review and a full overview of the phone
