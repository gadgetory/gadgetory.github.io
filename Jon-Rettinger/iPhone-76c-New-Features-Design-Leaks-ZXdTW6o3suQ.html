by domain.com what's going on everyone
jon rettinger from technobuffalo here we
are about 9 months away from the iphone
7 breaking its cover it doesn't mean we
can't start feasting on apple rumors up
first we have a brand new phone from
Apple rumored to be called the six-year
this 7c depending on who you believe
although I put my money on it being
called to be 6e coming supposedly
towards the end of April the folks at my
drivers are quoting some sources from
Foxconn supposedly know all the juicy
bits so outwardly it's going to look
identical to the iphone 5s all the way
down to the same three colors of gold
silver and Space Gray but the internals
suppose you are getting an upgrade going
to see a bigger battery 1642 milliamp
hours when I seen a 9 chip will see 2
gigs of RAM on board as well certainly a
lot of touch ID support to also see you
the same 8-megapixel camera also found
in the 5s and in the disappointing
slightly debbie downer news suppose it's
going to feature the same screen as the
iphone 5s so 4 inches and the same
resolution but supposedly again we'll
see all this break cover towards the
beginning of april and be able to be
purchased towards the end of april the
one thing we don't know yet is the price
expected to slot in below what the
iphone 6 cost so i'd imagine around 500
or so dollars what fun would alpha
rumors be if we didn't mention digit
times this time they are quoting a
source from need commercial x who spoke
with someone from catcher technologies
which is supposedly making one third of
the iphone 7 chassis the story goes on
to say that the iphone 7 is going to be
and i quote waterproof not sure if that
means ip67 for water and dust or some
sort of Apple technology that'll make
the foam safe if you say drop it in
toilet which happens more than you think
they go on to say that app was also
working on a new combat material it's
going to hide damn ugly antenna lines
found in current gen apple devices so
we'll see soon enough what the iphone 7
is going to have we've heard rumors for
a while about some sort of waterproofing
tech built into the iphone so make sense
of perhaps we'll see a debut and the
iphone 7 for now though these are just
rumours to take them with the obligatory
two giant head sides grain of salt buddy
i think you're excited for the 60 or the
iphone 7 look to your thoughts on it
till next time
render from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you
next video you guys have seen our videos
for a while you might have seen my
french bulldog Lucy snortin and
snuffling around in the background
sitting on my lap of cousin all kinds of
mayhem at the office perhaps you're a
