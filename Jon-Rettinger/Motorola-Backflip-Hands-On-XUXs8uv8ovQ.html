we're taking a look at the motorola
backflip this is actually the first
phone with this unique form factor here
trout's almost like a laptop screen
actually flipped backwards can't close
it all the one in front security right
there the keyboard after stays out your
pocket and then it flips up later on
relatively unique form factor I'm
actually gives you more room on the
piece here that would on the standard
sliding form background this is going to
be one of the five android phones
Ponyville coming to AT&amp;amp;T better notably
nice keyboards essentially like the
motorola cliq with a different form
factor a one interesting thing about it
in addition to how it closes is on the
back of the device actually has a touch
pad right there when you're using
anything one or two hands use it with
your finger and you can actually
manipulate the screen so I'm moving this
around swimming holes just was my finger
a little bit weird can be up to
developers how they want to use it you
almost get a little bit of cursor maybe
a little bit on the gimmicky side but
depending on how it gets utilized could
be interesting so the cuts got this
unique form factor the camera is
actually integrated right into the
keyboard by megapixel camera with your
LED flash point interesting now they
keep working to be ok that's a better
cheaper w the keys are very flat so
there's not much separation between them
I'd be a little bit concerned about how
this keyboard is going to hold up in
dirt and grime of your pocket that's
always going to be exposed 3x very
interesting anyway let's say you first
look here at the motorola backflip hope
you guys enjoyed by download</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
