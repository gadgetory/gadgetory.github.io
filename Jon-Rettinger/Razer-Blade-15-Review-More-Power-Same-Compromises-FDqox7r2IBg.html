I typically use them for about a week in
the office at home out and about really
trying to use them extensively in
various environments and learn their
quirks and test their performance but
things were a bit different with this
review I recently traveled to Shanghai
China to cover the vivo NEX phone and
for the purpose of this review
specifically I left my MacBook Pro home
and just use the 2018 Blade exclusively
as my only laptop throughout my
week-long trip doing everything on it
from watching movies replying to emails
and editing the video that you saw on
this channel on this laptop and after a
week of extremely heavy use I have some
thoughts let's take a closer look at a
razors latest mobile powerhouse razor is
marketing this machine as a powerful
mobile gaming rig so we first need to
start with the specs our review model is
the 15 inch version with the 144 Hertz
1080p display it's got 16 gigs of RAM
and 8th gen 6 Core i7 processor a 512
gig nvme SSD and a gtx 1060 max-q with 6
gigs of VRAM handling all of the
graphics and there is no denying the
fact that this thing is packed to the
brim with a crazy amount of horsepower
and impressive specs
especially for a laptop but all those
things come at a hefty costs both in
terms of price retail price on this one
here is 2200 bucks and the weight of the
machine itself and the blade is by no
means too big to carry but that all
aluminum body does have a substantial
footprint and weighing in at just over 4
and a half pounds there's no mistaking
this thing for ultrabook it was a little
cumbersome using this thing to catch up
on YouTube videos on a small airplane
tray table but once I got to the hotel
I had no issue using it at a desk which
honestly will probably be where you'll
be using it as well mainly because you
will not be able to stray away from
power for too long I was extremely
disappointed by the battery life on the
new blade having a few lightweight
programs like slack a VPN client and a
word processor open all at the same time
drain the onboard battery much faster
than expected even in the better battery
mode on one
ten I only got about three and a half
hours of use on average and that was
what the display said to about 50%
brightness this made it difficult to do
just about anything during a massive
press event with little power available
and it was just plain frustrating to
watch my battery quickly drain in front
of me while I did simple things like
copy files from an SD card over to an
external SSD when this machine was set
in performance mode and Premiere Pro was
open and rendering video the battery
life fell even faster and I was lucky to
get about 90 minutes before the battery
was completely drained and before you
start tearing me apart in the comments I
know I know Razer is not marketing the
blade as some machine with incredible
long lasting battery but I couldn't
achieve what most people would even just
consider the average and I expected much
better from the relatively large 80 watt
hour battery inside the machine okay so
let's move on to something a little bit
more positive and that's the display our
review unit has the 1080p display and it
looks really good and it's got a feature
you won't notice until you really sit
down and start using it and that's the
fact that it's got a refresh rate of 144
Hertz and if you haven't seen or used a
screen with this refresh rate it's hard
to really show or describe how smooth it
is but I'll say after using it you'll
probably find it a little bit difficult
to go back to that traditional 60 Hertz
display the higher refresh rate is of
course perfect for gaming but it's
noticeable all across the system just
scrolling through menus or websites was
extremely smooth and just makes
navigating around the system seem a
whole lot snappier personally though I'd
rather go with the 4k model of this
laptop over this one and it doesn't have
that insanely high refresh rate but when
editing in Premiere Pro or just trying
to get work done I found myself really
wanting extra resolution 1080p just
wasn't cutting it razor's also done a
bit of work to trim down the bezels
around the display and though there
still appear fairly prominently they are
better and hey at least the webcam is up
on top above the display besides the
screen the keyboard and trackpad are
very important on any laptop but I'm
happy to say that they follow the Razer
standard here on this new blade you're
getting an incredibly solid comfortable
and tactile keyboard with the ass
individual RGB lighting perky paired
with a fluid and now much larger
trackpad though pay special attention
to that keyboard as much as I appreciate
the inclusion of full-size arrow keys I
hate the fact that they are not at the
very end of the keyboard like almost
every other additional keyboard out
there that seemingly small and harmless
change led to many incorrect key presses
and was just generally annoying to get
used to all of my critiques aside though
when this machine does what it was built
to do any kind of high end performance
tasks like gaming or video editing it is
truly a phenomenal job and I was really
impressed with just the raw power you're
getting out of this laptop while editing
in Premiere Pro the blade was able to
edit and render my 4k clips like they
were nothing not only could I play them
back at full quality in the timeline but
the entire four and a half minute video
itself could be exported in 4k in just
about four minutes and being built for
games of course the blade handled games
here without any issue at all we played
two pretty demanding titles GTA 5 and
pub G and both ran incredibly well
although again it is only running at
1080p I was still impressed both games
were set to their maximum graphics
settings and we saw an average of a
hundred frames per second in GT 5 and
while playing pub G the game ran at a
solid 60 frames per second on Ultra
settings it is worth mentioning though
that we got these results when the blade
was plugged into power running off the
internal battery will cut the framerate
down a bit depending on the game but
it's still gonna be totally playable for
example we still were able to get 75 to
80 frames per second on average when
playing GTA 5 on the internal battery
putting benchmarks aside any game or
processor intensive tasks ran extremely
well on this laptop and I brought this
thing to Shanghai to do one main thing
and that was to edit the video that you
saw on this channel and I honestly could
not have asked for a better performance
especially from a laptop and razor says
the new and improved cooling system in
GPU helped keep this machine relatively
quiet during high intensive tasks and
they deliver on those claims for the
most part with this new blade it's
certainly not silent but it's not as bad
as we've seen on other razer laptops one
of the benefits of this thicker laptop
chassis is having more ports and luckily
on this blade you have a lot to work
with you've got three USB 3 type-a ports
a Thunderbolt 3 port HDMI mini display
and a headphone jack and these ports are
very much appreciated by the pros and
the gamers using this machine
put to use and fairly quickly there are
a few missed opportunities here on this
2018 blade I'd have loved to have seen
or I guess rather heard of better
sounding built-in speakers and I were to
really love to have seen some kind of
Windows hello compatible unlocking
method that spacious power button up top
seems like an obvious choice for a
fingerprint reader to be built into but
when it comes down to it everything the
2018 Blade was built to do by Razer it
does really well and there's no denying
the fact that all those components
working together provide a powerful
mobile experience that's just great for
gaming or video editing and this machine
is really built for all you guys out
there who want a portable gaming laptop
that can truly hold its own you want the
most ports you can get the most power
available on a laptop and the blade
delivers on that promise and the target
audience that this was built for by
Razer
is going to be very happy you will not
be disappointed but all the features
you're getting on this 2018 blade do not
come without a few compromises and I
just want to say this and kind of in
closing if you are not someone who needs
all that raw power or you really want a
game on the road
there are laptops out there many laptops
that are much lighter have a much longer
lasting battery are much cheaper and
just more well rounded in versatile
options that you're probably gonna be
happy with so what are your thoughts on
the 2018 razor blade are you someone who
really prefers a thicker laptop that has
more ports more power or a bigger
display that better refresh rate or do
you want something smaller a little bit
more versatile and a little bit thinner
