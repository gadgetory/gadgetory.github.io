console wars and why are we so adamant
to prove which console is better than
the next sure some sake justification
for dollars spent or to be spent but I
think the interest towards the debate
derived from something a bit deeper it
could be that it's driven and tied into
a process similar to natural selection
it's no accident that the majority of
the criticisms and complaints of the
previous generation of hardware have
been vastly improved upon the collective
mind of the gaming community drives the
evolution of the hardware and this is
why the console wars the debate exists
people like mark Cerny at Sony and the
team at Xbox listen in this round we're
going to be comparing the devices in
terms of aesthetics overall hardware
design heat output power consumption and
silent performance so welcome back to
the next installment of the console
the expectations for game console design
and aesthetics have been upped quite a
bit in the past couple of decades from
Ataris 80s wood paneling somewhat toyish
pieces of plastic game console design
has always been interesting and its
worst it's been but ugly but at its
finest it's been truly elegant the words
that come to mind when describing the
ps4 in this regard are compact and
streamlined first impressions are key
when it comes to aesthetics and the ps4
impresses with its sleek and slanted
design and surprisingly compact form
factor aesthetics are of course
completely subjective but when you see
the Xbox one for the first time it's
hard not to wonder where this goes and
there's no question about it the Xbox
one is significantly larger than the ps4
and the power supply is a sight to
behold
but there's been enough jokes about the
Xbox 360s power supply so I won't go
there but before you jump into any
conclusions is big and bulky always a
bad thing there is a reason why PC
gamers tend to enjoy big cases and one
of the key reasons behind this is
airflow the better the airflow the
cooler the components are and the cooler
that the components are the longer they
will last it's no secret that the Xbox
360 suffered severely from overheating
and it's actually pretty great to see
Microsoft taking measures to ensure that
this gen is the repeat of that debacle
the Xbox one is outfitted with a quite
substantial heatsink and fan that even
representative of the PC master-race and
appreciate the heatsink and fan are
mounted on the Xbox one's main
system-on-chip
and the fan is pushing air out of the
top end of the Xbox one the device has
substantial air intake vents on the
sides and the back so basically air
comes in through the sides and back and
the large fan pushes the heated air out
of the top so the Xbox one has decent
air flow
the ps4 is simply put a small
engineering marvel when you look at how
much Sony has managed to cram into a
relatively small space it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to determine which of
the two companies has a long history in
hardware engineering from a custom
blu-ray drive to the ps4 is compact
power supply everything has been
designed to accommodate the ps4 sleek
form factor but when the device are
packed with the latest hardware at a
relatively low price point it comes as
no surprise that a couple of concessions
has had to be made for one the frame of
the ps4 isn't quite in perfect balance a
teeter Zepeda when laid on an even
surface it is a bit disconcerting but a
quick fix no doubt in later revisions
the ps4 can be placed upright but
according to Microsoft the Xbox one can
not this is due to the choice of disk
drive which is not designed to function
vertically the cases of both devices are
made from a mix of matte and glossy
plastic the latter of which is extremely
prone to scratches a rougher microfiber
cloth will leave its mark on both I
learned this after a couple of wipes so
I recommend you heed my warning but do
you obviously can't get it all this
price point I'd actually pay a extra
hundred bucks for a metal frame but some
but I guess that's what pcs are for
while the ps4 is quite extravagantly
vented in the back to maximize airflow
the small size of the case obviously
limits the size of the heatsink and fan
which are significantly smaller to that
of the competition the ps4 pulls air
from the vents on the sides and the fan
pushes the hot air out of the back let's
take a closer look at how both consoles
perform in practice when it comes to
heat and noise output will be going
deeper into the CPU GPU and other
components in a later round but at this
stage it's relevant to say that both
systems run on a similar system on ship
with approximately comparable
architecture and power values
after extensive measuring the ps4 was
idling consistently around 38 degrees
Celsius or 100 degrees Fahrenheit which
is a respectable result but the Xbox
ones temps impressed me even more with
an idle tempo of 33 degrees Celsius or
94 Fahrenheit the Xbox one managed to
run a bit cooler than the ps4 when
idling in the user interface and not
doing much but what about low temps
while gaming I was surprised to see some
other text size getting opposite results
of what I measured while I was easily
able to heat up the ps4 exhaust temps to
about 50 degrees Celsius 122 degrees
Fahrenheit I could not push the Xbox
once temps about 47 degrees Celsius no
matter what I threw at it I played
titanfall while running Netflix in the
background
I tried forts on Dead Rising with
different apps and the web browser in
the background I could not get the temps
to rise beyond that point so simply put
the Xbox one at least in my case runs
cooler than the ps4 and these results
are actually consistent with the two
other measurements firstly power draw
while idling in the menus the Xbox one
draws about 65 watts of power and the
ps4 draws about 80 watts at idle and
after a couple of hours of intensive
gaming the Xbox one draws about 20 watts
less than the ps4 to sum up the ps4 is
more power hungry and it has a smaller
fan so when you put two and two together
you get a higher heat output for the ps4
and next up is noise output
to hear that the Xbox one is practically
silent when idling the ps4 doesn't cause
much of a ruckus either but the noise
output on the Xbox one is one or two
decibels lower than the ps4 and here's
where the Xbox one size may again come
into play
while the ps4 span ramps up with the 10
decibel noise increase during intense
gaming the Xbox one's large fan managed
to keep quiet even after an extensive
gaming session and even while Netflix is
running in the background and that is an
impressive achievement there's barely a
difference at the idle noise test but it
should be noted that the Xbox one has
two additional sources of noise namely
the Kinect and power supply both seems
to have a fan inside them thankfully the
noise from the Kinect is not audible
from an average viewing / listening
distance but probably the most annoying
thing that needs to be mentioned here is
that the external power supply is not
completely silent
it creates slightly higher pitch squeal
that definitely is audible when the
machine is on standby mode and speaking
of standby mode both machines are
capable of downloading updates and doing
some secondary tests in standby mode the
ps4 draws about nine watts of power
while the Xbox one actually draws more
than double at around nineteen watts
sure 19 watts is not a massive power
draw
but the Xbox one will run your utilities
bill around 10 bucks more than the ps4
annually the weird thing about the Xbox
one standby power draw is that it
fluctuates and seemingly reacts to the
Kinect so I'll be feeling that the ever
sing I could always be watching
there are a couple of distinct practical
design choices that separate the
hardware Sony has insisted to put the
two USB slots in the front yes they are
easy to access but the cramp recession
prevents you from using more robust USB
solutions like a 64 gig superfast
Kingston also if you use accessories
like a Astro gaming or turtle beach
headset that requires you to plug in via
USB you will have to run the wire across
the otherwise clean looking face of the
ps4 Microsoft took a very simple
approach to USB ports in the back and
one easy access port on the side I find
this a much better solution and it
doesn't spoil the look of the device the
power buttons and indicator lights on
both machines are subtle yet elegant I
enjoy both immensely but I hate the ps4
power up sound it's the same as on the
ps3 and it reminds me of the countless
times that accidently powered on the
device by sitting on the DualShock 3 or
Bluetooth remote there's not much to say
on the input and outputs they're pretty
much the same on both devices excluding
the two USB ports and the much touted
HDMI input on the Xbox one this of
course allows you to hook up a DVR or
cable box or other device into the Xbox
one the Xbox one also has an IR extender
output there's one key design choice
however in the ps4 with which the Xbox
one cannot compete with namely this the
ps4 is hard drive has been designed to
be easily accessible and it took me
about 10 minutes to swap in an SSD this
is not possible with the Xbox one
without tearing down the device and
voiding the warranty
so there it is both device look very
clean when hooked up and installed the
streamlined ps4 definitely wins in the
looks department and is undoubtedly a
marvel of hardware engineering
however the compact size of the ps4
comes with its weaknesses as the Xbox
one takes the cake
in both silence and heat performance and
from a practical standpoint the Xbox one
has a slight edge with the USB placement
but the ps4 receives a golden star for
hard drive accessibility and for all
these reasons can bind the PlayStation 4
and Xbox one deserve a point in round
two round three is up next and this is
where it gets interesting we'll be
taking an in-depth look at the cpus and
gpus of both systems so stay tuned for
the next installment of the console game
