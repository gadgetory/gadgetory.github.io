with cool tech but today cool Tech is
gonna be a little bit different we're
doing a transportation edition over the
last couple of months I'm sure you guys
have noticed there's been a lot of sort
of alternative electric transport from
hoverboards boosted boards all that kind
of stuff is cropping up I wanted to pick
two of my favorites recently that have
not been covered there Irby as well as
the specialized electric bike give my
two cents and get your guys feedback as
well let's go ahead and get started so
first we have the specialized turbo s
the way this works is essentially it's
like a normal bike and you can
definitely pedal it in a normal bike
format but if you would like you can
have it in electric mode where when you
pedal it engages a 500 watt electric
motor to power you on forward so it
helps you get up to speeds up to
supposedly thirty miles an hour we maxed
out at 27 but it's still plenty fast the
feeling is very unnerving it's kind of
strained you pedal and you go way faster
than you should be going but after
riding around for a little bit you
definitely get used to it and it's a
very feasible form of transport other
than it's $7,000 so quite expensive but
I will say if this is your primary form
of transport it's kind of worth the
money you get regen braking you get
really really good range specialized
claims between 35 to 60 miles so it's a
pretty broad spectrum but if you want to
go an eco mode I'm sure you can get
closer to that 60 range which is crazy
far I don't know who's gonna be riding a
bike those kind of distances but if you
are props to you and your quads if you
do somehow manage to run out of power it
takes about three and a half hours to
charge up to full-on a hundred and ten
volt wall outlet something of note is
that the bike actually comes with an app
which gives you tons of extra
information like what the battery life
is how fast you're going where you're
going how long you've been riding for
how many miles you've covered all that
good stuff and I could go on and on and
on with specs so I'm gonna cut it short
here because this is not a review but
the point is that this bike is very
practical very fast and very expensive
so lots of all those things its biggest
strengths is that unlike other electric
forms of transport when you run out of
juice you can still ride it like a
regular bike and get to where you're
going so that sort of eliminates rain
xiety moving on to the Irby which they
are calling is the first electric
foldable scooter I'd immediately like to
sort of debunk this whole foldable thing
it is foldable but by no means is it
portable it's just too heavy it's
awkwardly shaped and and that might be
the only negative thing I say about the
Arabi other than it's expensive not
quite as expensive as the specialized
bike but it's still expensive
it's about $1,700 for the Irby Black
Label which is the one we test and then
it starts it in about $1500 so I know a
lot of you guys asked us to do cheaper
stuff in cool tech so of course I did
the sensible thing and went for much
more expensive stuff apologies in terms
of specs to get those out of the way the
Irby charges from zero to full in about
four hours which is not bad at all it
weighs about 35 pounds which again
doesn't lend itself to be the most
portable device but it's not terrible
and has a top speed of 15 miles an hour
and can go up to 20 miles in range which
is good for a practicality standpoint
but where the Irby really wins is in its
personality the best comparison I can
make to it is it's like a Fiat or like
the original Mini Coopers it is so small
and it looks like a bit of a joke to be
honest but it doesn't take itself as a
joke it takes itself very seriously
whereas the specialized bike you can
launch it up to 27 miles an hour which
is really fast there's no drama about it
it just does it you get on the Irby you
twist the throttle it's front-wheel
drive and you'll get crazy amounts of
wheel spin you'll get smoke from the
tire and it'll take off at 10 miles an
hour yeah it doesn't actually go that
fast but it takes itself so seriously
that it's kind of endearing you just
love it right off the gate after using
it it has a little spring under the seat
which is a very comfortable seat by the
way so to push this to the limit we took
it off road and it did pretty well this
is again part of the spirit that the
Irby has is a product it just thinks it
can do so much more than it should be
able to do add that size and it did find
again you don't look or feel cool until
you realize that the Irby thinks it's
really cool and that makes you feel
really cool it's infectious and so
that's it for this video guys let me
know what you thought of this version of
cool tech and what you think of the Irby
and the specialized turbo as some very
curious to hear your thoughts leave us a
comment below this video is not easy to
make we
almost lost a drone in the making of it
so give us a thumbs up if you want to
give us props for getting that drone out
of a tree hit subscribe for more content
like this and the next version of cool
tech that I promise you there's more
cool stuff coming my name is Ron Frieda
thank you again so much for watching and
I'll see you guys the next one and
before you guys go I want to take a
quick second to thank our friends over
audible who made this episode of cool
tech possible I am a huge fan of audible
I Drive a daily commute from LA to
Irvine where our TechnoBuffalo offices
are and I listen to tons of audiobooks
some of my favorites are still like an
artist by Austin Kleon the askgaryvee
book as well as bold by Peter Diamandis
it's all in an effort to make my
sometimes two-hour commute useful to
keep me learning keep soaking in
information and because we love audible
so much they want to hook our fans up
you guys with a 30 day free trial if you
go to audible.com slash techno that's
where you can get that again that's
audible.com slash techno check it out
let me know what books you guys are
listening to of books I should check out
and let's exchange lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
