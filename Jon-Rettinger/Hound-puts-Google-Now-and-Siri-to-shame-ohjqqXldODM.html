to you by harry's and what's going on
guys the martin sang it from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's video we'll
be taking a look at a new voices system
that puts Siri and Google now to shame
sound hound the company behind the music
recognition app recently launched a
mobile personal assistant called hound
and even though it's in beta its
capabilities are hugely impressive just
like Google now Siri or Cortana hound
lets you do simple things like make a
call send messages search for music
flights or hotels but it's designed to
be deeper and more complex to where
hound really excels is understanding
more natural language you can say
something like ok hound
I need a hotel in LA near West Hollywood
from Wednesday through Friday between
$150 to $250 a night showing 10 results
with availability near West Hollywood
for Wednesday June 24th staying for 2
nights between 150 u.s. dollars and 250
US dollars per night to pull up a couple
of hotels near West Hollywood in a nice
list view that shows hotels near West
Hollywood between $150 to $250 a night
what's really impressive about how it is
that you can also add specific details
and follow-ups let's say you need a
hotel would have free Wi-Fi you can just
say ok hound
how about would free Wi-Fi to find
hotels near West Hollywood around $150
to $250 a night and would free Wi-Fi
it's super fast and works great even
though it's in beta Hound can understand
even more complicated questions than
that stuff Google now or Siri wouldn't
even begin to know how to answer ok
hound what is the population in capital
for Japan and China and their areas in
square miles and square kilometers and
also tell me how many people live in
India and what is the area code for
Germany France and Italy and 1 billion
three hundred thirty million 44,000 for
China and the capital is Tokyo for Japan
and baby a few moments later the area
code is 49 for Germany 33 for France and
39 for Italy so as you can see how it is
very thorough and replying to a complex
question it'll go through each question
and answer those questions in proper
order and the app itself will give you a
list of information in the order
ask them in pressing the question mark
button will pull up some of the things
you can ask or say to hound for example
you can ask coun to split a bill two
ways or four ways and it'll also show
you two percentage and how much you
should say for that specific bill
there's a lot more that you can ask
count by calculating mortgage and stock
information you can even ask what's the
latest news from TechnoBuffalo if you'd
like well how it is still in beta it's
amazing what it's able to achieve the
fact that it can understand natural
language and complex questions and
deliver those answers within seconds is
just amazing how it is an invite-only
beta program and it's only available for
Android at the moment
iOS support is coming soon unfortunately
only users located in the US can use it
as of right now so before we end this
video I want to thank our friends over
at Harry's shaving can be quite
expensive nowadays but fortunately our
friends over at Harry's can hook you up
with premium razors at non premium
prices their starter kit starts - just
fifteen dollars and that includes the
razor three blades and your choice of
Harry shave cream or foaming gel I
personally like the gel it feels nice on
my face as an added bonus you can get
five dollars off your first purchase by
using the code TechnoBuffalo all one
word in lower case and half they're
using the code you can also get an
entire month of Shaving for just ten
dollars anyways this is just a quick
look and overview of sound hounds new
mobile personal assistant if you guys
have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section down below
and if you guys enjoy this video give it
a thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
