to you by netflix welcome back to their
pursuit of renter's rats to shore a rant
rave and sometimes compliments things
from the wide ever-expanding world of
technology and past we've talked about
all kinds of things from social networks
to media perspective up this week we're
going to talk about the newest trend of
microtransactions you know I'm on your
cell phone they might be coming to a
video game console and PC or Mac near
you let's go ahead and get our Randy's
in a bunch so back in the early days of
the apple app store and then would
eventually became google play apps
mostly cost something somewhere free
some costs a buck two bucks there the
price might be once you had the app you
at the app you had all the features it
could have and then came
microtransactions we saw them first
start on web-based applications we saw
Zynga al for them with farmville and all
kinds of other add-ons and suddenly you
could start getting little more things
in apps started becoming less and less
complete almost incentivizing you to
keep paying more for the app you already
had and people got tolerant of it heck I
got tolerant of it I know I bought few
more things and I probably should have
been angry birds that sometimes you just
need that Eagle to just knock him out
but that model was fine as an extra
couple bucks something you get new stuff
it improves game experience you don't
have to buy it but if you want to get
the full breadth of the game you throw a
couple bucks down something you can get
more stuff and all was fine with the
world but that model has been expanding
it sort of been the next Gold Rush of
app developers and it's always been it
was the bubble of the 2000s and now it's
sort of the app developing bubble and I
think this might be the pin that burst
it so rumors are circulating that's
coming next generation of consoles so
I'm looking at you ps4 and xbox one and
i don't know maybe nintendo wii u is
next generation I mean maybe like a
little bit but micro transactions are
allegedly coming so let's take a look at
injustice gods among us so you go ahead
you buy the game you pay your 60 bucks
to play it on whatever your console of
choice you pop it in you got a few
characters you can play with there's
enough you can play through the whole
game you get a ton of unlockable
characters or you can pop on your disk
you can buy all dem characters and start
playing if you want to get your scorpion
online you go ahead and do that
evidently scorpions part of the DC
Universe now I don't really know how
they did that but hey you could do that
and you get that option to add content
but the new model we're saying that
might be develop next-generation
consoles is you download a trial of a
game you pay a fee to play that game so
maybe unlock the whole game for about
thirty four dollars what we're hearing
then you only get one or two characters
if you want to play the game yet to keep
buying is unlockable things that you
can't necessarily get if you just keep
playing through the game and that's
where my point is if I'm buying a game I
want to play the whole damn game all
right I get there could be extra things
that make the game better but I want the
full maps I want to be able to play a
full campaign you'd have to give me
every single character that's fine but I
want the whole game that's what I'm
playing for I don't want to have to buy
a game and have to pay another seven
eight bucks to charge me one fee
whatever it's gonna be and let me play
the whole damn game I'm fine with being
able to do what injustice is done where
you can pay to unlock new characters I
get that it's added benefit it's added
play to a game and sort of adds a new
dimension ality and characters you can
learn but you can always play the core
players that come with it or you could
play to unlock all the players never
have to pay an extra set I like that
model I respect that model I appreciate
that model but a holy crab do not charge
people I'm tell you developers looked me
square in my brown eyes do not charge
more people you will have a revolution
on your hands I'm sure they're thinking
they'll get used to it they'll be upset
at first but then eventually the way
games are done it is not going to be the
way games are done gamers are going to
revolt and not be tolerant of it and
they can get away with it on the
consoles you're gonna start singing on
pc games next and suddenly that sixty
dollar game is gonna cost me 80 90 bucks
to play and if you're a gamer and you
buy a lot of games you're going to have
to purchase half the games in order to
get the same value that you had before
and it's just not fair it's not right
and I don't want to see it happen so if
you see it if you see this trend happen
once the xbox one the ps4 hit later this
year fight say something got on Twitter
be vocal about it if you don't want to
have to do that and put your hard earned
money behind games you already bought
you shouldn't have to just got me all in
green the face the more I thought about
it so I wanted to share that with you
guys agree disagree my way off base am i
slow to adopt new models and I'm just
old fashions by thinking that I pay for
something I should be able to play it
fully but maybe that's just me
maybe the old plants vs zombies 2 thing
is the new model for games and micro
transactions or what it's all about but
I'd love to hear your guys thoughts on
now honestly leave your comments down
below we think I meant to thank our
friends and sponsors at Netflix you know
you love them you should definitely use
them if you live in an area where you
can watch the rest of development for
example you can catch up on all three
seasons before you watch the new season
forge actually I'm doing with my wife
right now who never seen it so you
should download netflix you can catch up
on the latest TV seasons movie streaming
anything you want on your TV or game
console get netflix and try it free for
30 days go to netflix.com slash Buffalo
give it a shot well no we sent you thank
you guys for watching another manic
episode of retinas rants I'll be back
next week ranting and raving on
something new in the world of technology
for anything you want to see me yell
about leave your comments down below
