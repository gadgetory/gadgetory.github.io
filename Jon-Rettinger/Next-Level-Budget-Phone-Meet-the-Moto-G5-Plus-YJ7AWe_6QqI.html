phones pretty much no matter what you
buy you're gonna get a decent phone at
any price point but there's a lot of
competition that like 200 to 250 dollar
price point entering that really crowded
marketplace is the Moto G 5 plus can be
available March 31st at its significant
retailers but is going to be a prime
exclusive on Amazon for 184 bucks or
$240 depending on which the figuration
you want to buy big thing you're gonna
notice is that one button down below you
but I think it's a button or a
fingerprint reader it's kind of all
those things but a lot more it's a one
button navigation you're not gonna have
a back button bullet asking button and a
home button like you've got a typical
Android phones and they do it with
gesture so you can swipe to the left to
go back and swipe to the right to
multitask and do a real quick tap to go
home and a long tap to lock the phone I
don't know I feel about it I'll serve as
I use it more for reveal let you know
but it's here and be aware that it's
definitely a new experience for Android
so spec wise there's still a lot here as
well
- snapdragon 623 - gigahertz octa-core
it's got a pretty nice 3,000 length hour
battery and of course turbo charge is
here as well that should get you about 6
hours of battery life in about 15
minutes 32 or 64 gigs of internal
storage depending on which one you buy
also depending which when you buy Ram to
be different either 2 gigs or 4 but if
you can do it gopher gopher store that's
gonna make a giant difference on a
longevity of all everything else here is
kind of what you'd expect the 5.2 inch
1080p display it's got Gorilla Glass 3
on it but one of the areas that motor
oil is really claiming this is a reason
to buy the phones with the camera at the
12 megapixel sensor and Scott larger
aperture and bigger pixels are
supposedly let in about 25 percent more
lights in the previous Moto G plus and
on the software front you're also
getting Android 7.0 nougats so you are
getting close to the most updated
version of Android as well so that's the
Moto G 5 plus it does a lot of stuff
well at a really affordable price I'm
still not sure where ice fall on that
single button navigation but I do give
Motorola credit for trying something new
but is that enough to get you to pick it
up like I said there are a lot of
choices at that price point let me know
down below if your play on ordering one
and why what feature is killer for you
