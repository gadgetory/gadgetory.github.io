from TechnoBuffalo here both of these
1+1 say cyanogen on the back of him but
one of these is a dirty filthy liar
because it is running one plus is brand
the new oxygen OS we did a video
tutorial showing you guys how to install
it I didn't overview showing the new
features the biggest question that we
had in the comment section was how's
matter that's gonna be on oxygen 1.0 0.0
vs what's currently available for the
oneplus one and that cyanogen 11 s so I
figured let's run some tests we were in
two separate tests and here's what we
did first we turn the brightness on both
phones all the way up we close all
applications except for YouTube there's
a video I like to test with you just
Google long HD video that's like a 6
hour video of fish and whales we played
that video to turn the volume all the
way down and we let it run I turned off
cellular data on the one running 11 s
and the one running oxygen did not have
cellular data to have to worry about in
that first test we got rent for about 3
hours and 47 minutes oxygen OS had 33%
battery life and CyanogenMod 11 s had 5%
battery life so about a 30% Delta there
but then we figured let's run it again
this time we put both phones in airplane
mode it's exactly the same thing turn
the brightness all the way up we ran
this test for 4 hours and 18 minutes
this time oxygen had 25% less and
CyanogenMod 11 s had 14% left so you can
see there's definitely a difference in
battery life in oxygen versus AI engine
before anybody gets all excited that
oneplus has done crazy things with their
OS feelings keep in mind first
oxygen is based off a lollipop 5.0 point
two to be exact whereas the Curtin
version of 11 s is based off a KitKat
4.4.4 and their huge battery
improvements in lollipop so a lot of
this might just be due the battery
improvements in Google's OS not what
oneplus has done to it the other thing
to bear in mind is that this was just a
test of watching an HD video making
calls might reveal different results or
browsing the web mate'll different
results but you want to at least get a
baseline to see how things performed I
think that we really going to see the
interesting test is when 12's comes out
which is also based on volley pop then
compare kind of apples
apples or lollipops the lollipops so to
speak but the moral here than the
takeaway is if you're worried that maybe
one plus it's screwed up with oxygen OS
and they can be a huge battery hog don't
worry too much about that actually seems
to be pretty good so far but of course
once 12's hits this the official release
for the oneplus will run these tests
again and see how they perform anything
else you want to see us test battery
life wise let us know we have an article
down below which is all the screenshots
- if you want to see the screen on time
and all that rest that battery goodness
and I guys hope you enjoy the big
subscribe button if you want to see more
one plus videos we love to share them
with you until next time from John
Ritter TechnoBuffalo so yeah the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
