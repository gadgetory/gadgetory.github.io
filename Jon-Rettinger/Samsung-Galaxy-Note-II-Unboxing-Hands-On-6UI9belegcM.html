TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of one
of the phones that I am most excited
about this year this is a sequel to the
extremely popular Galaxy Note it's the
appropriately named Galaxy Note 2 it
brings a 5.5 inch screen a quad core
Exynos processor 2 gigs of ram and
jellybean out of the box HSPA+ LTE and
all kinds of latest and greatest super
phone hotness let's go ahead and open
this big boy up alright so here we have
the box for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
it's got a picture of the device on the
front it is the gray version Galaxy Note
2 and we've got some specs on the back
of course we're gonna run through all of
those I cannot contain my excitement
let's go ahead and dig in I want to
thank our friends at nigga electronics
for her kind of stuff with his phone
it's available now if you want to check
them out Negri electronics go calm so
this will be coming to all four major US
carriers this is the International
unlocked version go ahead and cut some
more paper feel like a kid on Christmas
trying to get into this I loved the
original note arguably one of my
favorite phone so I'm really excited to
see the sequel with quad-core and LTE on
the unlocked version there's a lot to
like about this phone it's got really
everything you could want in a modern
Android powered smartphone so let's do
that it's enough to open it up and there
it is the giant wow that is really big
galaxy note 2 push it off this side for
just a minute and see else we're gonna
get in the box
not sure what the carrier versions are
gonna come in come shipping with but the
international version will have Quick
Start Guide power cord earphones the the
nicer Samsung your phones with the
little gels on them with an inline mic
the obligatory syncing cord that's
microUSB and a monster 3100 milliamp
hour battery so let's take the battery
out and we'll take the phone and I'll
run you guys through all the specs on
this
boy sir pricing is going to vary
depending on when you buy it unlock
they're looking at about seven hundred
and fifty dollars it's running Android
4.1 jelly bean from dimension standpoint
five point nine by three point one by a
very thin point three if you're
wondering how it's compared size-wise
the original Galaxy Note it's a little
bit longer but it's thinner and skinnier
both of those screen here is a five
point five 5 inch HD Super AMOLED screen
that's 1280 by 720
that's 267 PPI and it's been protected
by Gorilla Glass 2 let's go ahead and
pull all this off a huge as mentioned
3100 milliamp hour battery which is up
from the 2,500 million power battery
it's being powered by a 1.6 gigahertz
quad core Exynos chip that's the 44 12
with 2 gigs of ram internal storage is
gonna be 16 32 or 64 but you can expand
that with micro sd 8 megapixel camera on
the back with LED flash can shoot 1080p
and then we've got a 1.9 megapixel
shooter up on the front this version
does have support for 18 T's LTE network
that's 720 100 bands but also has HSPA+
bluetooth 4.0 NFC and of course we got
some brand new s-pen actually going out
here this is a redone S Pen to talk
about that a little bit more on our
hands-on and the review let's go ahead
and pop in the battery and do a first
boot up and see what things look like
alright so we've got the Galaxy Note 2
all powered up and ready to be toyed
with 5.5 inches of AMOLED glory let's go
ahead and see what kind of apps are
gonna come bundled on this guy so some
of the standard Samsung ones that we see
with TouchWiz chaton and some customized
icons for contacts and such the usual
suspects are here as well messenger maps
Google+ learning hub S note for using
that S Pen s voice is here although I'd
much rather use Google search it's
pretty awesome
and Samsung's own app store quick look
at the widgets Samsung's customized
widgets and then the standard Android
ones and some of their customized for
the S Pen like s note for example our
living here as well so this guy is
running jelly bean but don't take my
word for it let's go ahead and
yeah Android 4.1.1 right out of the box
it's nice to see a Android phone
Brandon you come shipping with jelly
bean so let's walk around the phone on
the left hand side we've got a volume
rocker up and down this really does in
every way you feel like a bigger galaxy
s3 from build quality to button so if
you use the galaxy s3 held one there
shouldn't be very familiar to you on the
right hand side power and lock button
down here we've got a one big home
button and we've got two buttons that'll
light up capacitively you got a menu
button and a back button go ahead and
hit home bottom we've got charging and
microphone ports S pen's going to live
down there as well or microphone not
microphone port on the top also have
another noise cancelling mic 3.5
millimeter headset jack push the back in
a little tighter plastic backing here as
well if you want to access your SD card
you do not have to remove the battery to
do so and then your micro sim is going
to go there as well and again it's at
3100 milliamp hour battery the back is
plastic like we've seen on the original
Galaxy Note and galaxy s3 and there is
your NFC antenna go ahead and pop this
guy back on the snappy noise it makes it
always very satisfying let's go and snap
that bad boy back on let's take a look
at some of the stuff that's going to
come on the phone so 5.5 inches let me
give you guys a bit of a comparison to a
5.5 inches on the phone looks like watch
this on your screen you probably can't
appreciate the size here is an iPhone 5
you can really get a chance to see the
difference and with a new foreign
screams by no means a small phone but it
really looks like a kid brother thanks
to a 5.5 inch phone and you can see how
much extra content you can see here as
well so we load up TechnoBuffalo at the
same spot on each we can see one two
three and part of four on the iPhone 5
here we got one two three four and all
of five on here so part of four and here
we've got five so you know if we can see
how much more content is gonna be
showing you can see the benefit when you
are watching videos or taking notes or
whatever it is that you want to do on
your voice so let's go ahead and see
what else we're gonna have to go
pull on down we got a typical settings
up here Wi-Fi GPS and rotation and
Bluetooth and all that kind of stuff
what I am curious though is how Samsung
incorporated Google search with the
voice we will search with some of the s
searching here so let's go ahead and see
if it works
testing all right so good to know that
that is in here and hasn't been taken
out in favor of s voice this is the
Google searches way better an incredibly
awesome on here so this has just been a
first look and unboxing at the Galaxy
Note 2 of course we'll be using it and
giving you guys hand out impressions and
comparisons with all the latest phones
out there anything that you guys want to
see particular about this device be sure
to let us know down below and check out
