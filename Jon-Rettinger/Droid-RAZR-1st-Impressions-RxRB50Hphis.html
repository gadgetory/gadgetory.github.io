technobuffalo here much like a tease
fashion and disco the razor is back if
you don't remember what the razor was it
was the flip phone that really changed
the flip phone industry developed in
2003 and released in 2004 it this guy
was razor thin and it defined Motorola
and to find Motorola so much they spent
the next few years releasing rehashed
versions of the razor but the name is
back this time it's a smartphone and
we've got the Droid Razr by Motorola
let's talk about it so today October
18th Motorola took the wraps off the
droid razr in New York City and this guy
packs a lot of punch it's really aimed
squarely at the droid bionic in
verizon's lineup right now it is a
verizon exclusive so let me run through
all the beautiful specs that this guy
has first 4.3 inch qhd Super AMOLED
screen so pretty beautiful screen 1.2
gig I always feel like I'm making it
back to the future quote when I say that
what would point through what do you go
on okay whatever one printer gigahertz
dual-core processor a 1 gig of ram
Verizon's incredibly fast a 4G LTE and
that's true for g 8 megapixel rear
facing camera can shoot 1080p video it's
becoming pretty standard and also has
image stabilization technology for crisp
and clear videos or so says Motorola's
PR it's got an HD forward facing camera
for video chat over LTE 3g or Wi-Fi kind
of cool you can video chat over 3g or
probably super choppy it look like
you're looking at a strobe light like a
what nuku 210mm 32 gigs of memory 16 gig
on board with 16 gig micro SD card of
course you can up that as well that'll
be pre-installed though the actual
4matic capacity is probably going to be
for a bit less gorilla glass screen
Kevlar build materials I wouldn't make a
flak jacket out of the same but it will
be pretty durable a 12.5
hours of talk time eight point nine
hours of video playback which is pretty
impressive this phone is incredibly thin
its razor so you'd expect it to be so
with 7.1 millimeters thin it's got a
motorola splash guard to protect it from
life's little accidents and funnily
enough the battery sealed inside of this
thin guy which also rocks that sort of
droid hump that we've seen on a lot of
the droid phones so this phone is
absolutely expect to the gills but the
timing is a bit curious so I mentioned
that today is the 18th later on tonight
google is taking the wraps off of ice
cream sandwich their latest build of
android this guy is running gingerbread
seems a bit odd this would be a top-tier
phone to be a phone that would
presumably go head-to-head against the
soon to be announced Galaxy Nexus but
with an outdated operating system so
that is a bit odd i think is going to
hinder some people's purchases i know if
i was looking to get a new smartphone
and i was jazzed up and i wanted the
most powerful one out there and then I
knew that was running an outdated OS you
never know when a new OS is going to
come carriers and manufacturers usually
just say soon it's kind of disappointing
pre-orders for this guy are going to be
starting october 27th if you are
interested i'll be available early
november for 209 2999 so just under
three hundred dollars if you don't mind
then it's going to be rocking
gingerbread presumably ice cream
sandwich at some point it's a pretty
badass phone brings a lot to the table
and a really really really thin form
factor you guys know I'm a big fan of
Verizon's 4G LTE network the speeds are
blazing fast if you happen to be in an
area where 4G is an ever-expanding this
is an awesome phone so is ice cream
black of ice cream sandwich at launch
going to be a big detriment for you you
care not care I'm really excited to get
my hands on this phone just from a
design standpoint I think it's really
cool Motorola is doing and that's really
one of the beauties of Android you could
have a ton of different form factors if
you want a slab form factor you've got
that if you want a qwerty keyboard
you've got that if you want a portrait
slide out keyboard you've got that a
landscape keyboard you've got that
you're
stand what I'm saying here lots of
options in the Android world I am
curious to see the camera though 1080p
really doesn't mean much if the bit
rates bad so we really want to see what
it's going to look like when we can
finally blow it up on a giant screen but
now I'm just rambling I want to see what
the droid grades are going to look like
we will have it right here in our
offices to unbox and show you this ice
cream sandwich matter to you is it just
make you hungry you not even know why
we're talking about desserts want to
hear from you too i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys the
next video buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
