clap yo guys johnathan here
yo guys johnathan here something about
the Simpsons yeah what's up guys
Jonathan here so I'm odd John but I'm
not that John I've been watching our
videos you notice that things around me
might look very familiar we've been
filming with John Morrison from TLD
today and I want to tell you what's been
going on and how we got here but the
story doesn't begin right here
so we moved into the space in 2014 so
it's been almost five years since we
came in and I had really grand plans for
this it was our first real office and
there was tons of space for everything
we got to build out our own studio
inside of it and make it look how we
wanted and built sets that we thought we
were going to use quite a bit we had
plenty of spaces for writers and we've
got a really big space waited up using
all the walls to build different sets
you've probably seen this film in
different locations through here so when
I made the decision to sell
TechnoBuffalo calm it became even more
apparent that this office space was no
longer going to be necessary or at least
where we called our office was gonna
have to change its said before we keep
going hope you guys are enjoying the
videos be sure to subscribe and hit the
bells to get notified when new videos
are coming your way and I want to thank
this video sponsor their desk if you've
been looking for a standing desk or
maybe you've got back problems
v√©ra desk has been absolutely awesome
for that we've got the Pro Plus 36
ordering was incredibly easy to do
opening out of the box is simple the
setup is surprisingly elegant and it
feels really sturdy so transitioning it
from a normal sitting desk to a standing
desk is really easy got handles on the
side it just kind of lifts it's got
different levels to adjust to you know
your height so it's serve optimal for
you so the pro plus 36 that we've got
right here is compatible with most
regular desk - so you can use it as an
attachment to a regular sitting desk and
then you just lift it up and it to
transition into a standing desk so you
can sort of pick how you want to spend
your whole day so if you want more
information on the model that we've got
or others in their desk portfolio go to
Vera desk com
or hit the link down below to learn more
and a big thank you again to Vera desk
for sponsoring this video I just think
it was slightly too expensive what was
kind of interesting I know if you guys
saw the video but a few weeks before
that sort of I sold the company good bye
TechnoBuffalo hello me video went up I
did a collaboration with John Morrison
actually we're talking about the iPhone
10 are and sort of how his experiences
are different than mine and then after
we shot that video I went to lunch with
John Morrison and Josh Kenson their
partners in Sun squared media as or the
comp and sort of runs everything
including Josh's brothers channel Kevin
they could see like the tiredness and
like the beat down look that I had from
sort of trying to figure out what was
gonna come next night it was really the
first time aside from my wife that I
expelled my gut so I'm like I didn't
feel like I could do anything right or
well and like they just listened and I
hadn't had somebody that I could talk to
that could understand what it was like
you know someone who's growing a
business like they have and it just felt
really good I'll sort of still debating
whether or not I was gonna sell just the
YouTube channel or sell the entire
business and be an employee and like
they just sat and listened like good
friends and then I got home that night
and John sent me a text it was like hey
can you come back tomorrow to talk you
know that sounds like fun but I can't
I should have kind of stuff to do he's
like well can you flick we FaceTime
tonight
so I FaceTime that same night that that
video got filmed with John and Josh and
that was sort of for the first seeds of
us working with Sun squared media after
spaces in Claremont kind of came to be
so I've talked a lot about the past but
let me show you around the present it's
obviously there's a lot of new stuff
around here we've got Pro audio setup
they got sound panels
I got styrofoam on one side of me we got
usually a bunch of lights sort of
helping create a more natural look and
helping like this clear skin tone look
like a normal human and all that coupled
with new cameras the new lenses have
created sort of a different aesthetic
and feel to the videos so sun square
media's got a few suites you've probably
seen him show up in different videos
this is the one that we have tended to
film in the most and they've been really
generous to let us have access to all of
their equipment to try and sort of may
our videos look as awesome as possible
so we've got access to awesome tripods
carbon-fiber legs sound panels you know
magnetic mountable lights audio stuff we
never would have had before this
gigantic thing it's called a faux beau
which is how we've been getting those
awesome top-down shots are all because
of that and one of the biggest changes
we made on the gear front this is a one
of two Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera
4k that's a mouthful took me a while to
memorize that but it was really a big
visual change when we sort of made the
decision to film here we wanted our
videos to look different so we decided
to move away from the sony a7s mark twos
that we were using it gives us a lot
more flexibility and I think kind of a
unique look to the video we have another
camera on order by Blackmagic it's their
Ursa mini pro g2 but BH hasn't shipped
it yet
we showed you guys the camera gear and
you saw old offices this is where we've
been calling home for the past few
months it's pared down and mobile
optimized so we sold all of our iMac
used to be editing on and now we've gone
solely for MacBook Pros we got a pretty
big Synology where we've been offloading
all of our footage we got a bunch of LG
monitors of different sizes and this is
where we'll have our meetings before we
go to film we'll strategize what's
eventually gonna make its way to the
YouTube channel so it's been 9 years and
over 4,500 videos but this one is
different so if you didn't see our
previous video from like three months
ago here's a Cliff Notes version
I sold the TechnoBuffalo website to
mobile nations I've been running the
website for almost nine years doing
video for a little bit longer and I was
being spread really thin to the point
where I was doing so much that I wasn't
doing anything well so after I decided
that I wanted to sell TechnoBuffalo a
few things had to be worked out so what
was gonna happen to the TechnoBuffalo
name obviously the YouTube channel was
still heavily branded TechnoBuffalo at
the time and then was gonna happen to
the writers that were writing for the
website those were two really paramount
issues that I had to resolve and when I
sided to sell two mobile nations I've
never actually talked about this on
camera before I had two other offers to
sell the business one was to a private
equity guy who just wanted websites and
one was to a larger media company and
the larger media company wanted to buy
everything they wanted to buy the
website they wanted by the YouTube
channel and they wanted me to come on
as an employee it was a tough choice and
I English too hurt for a really long
time and videos what I've always wanted
to do and if I was gonna bet on somebody
else to sort of make sure I was employed
why not have that somebody else beat me
that's sort of when I decided to double
down on video and be a part of creating
content that I'm proud of and content
that I love and so that decision became
relatively easy then working with mobile
nations became even easier from our
first conversation to sign the papers
was about three and a half weeks it was
that easy they were committed to a few
things they're committed to keeping the
writers so everybody who wrote for the
website would still you know be employed
and get a continue to ride for
TechnoBuffalo that was important they
also were willing to work with me on the
TechnoBuffalo name which was awesome so
we saw obviously TechnoBuffalo commented
mobile nations but we still have the
Instagram handle which is TechnoBuffalo
and a lot of you guys are probably
asking why we still have that Instagram
is hard to deal with the account is
verified and Instagram does not let you
change verified names and the first
thought we had was okay let's just lose
verification and change the name but
they don't let you do that either so
we're kind of out of luck by having a
channel that's totally bendy techno
buffaloed and a company that's bendy
techno buffaloed but have an account
name that is TechnoBuffalo what's going
on guys johnathan here with
TechnoBuffalo with my unboxing of the
2012 Mac Mini and if you know but John
worse and I go way back he actually did
videos for the TechnoBuffalo channel a
really really really long time ago and
then he obviously went on to incredible
amount of success and I think be one of
the best film makers in the tech space
you know that exists ever so it was
pretty awesome it's kind of almost come
full circle and to be here and sort of
learn from from him and learn from the
Sun squared guys about how they make
video it changed our processes on how we
make video and I think it kind of shows
and type of people that they are that
they saw somebody who loved video and
loves video and loves the creation of it
but was just sort of looking for a very
clear like this was before and this is
after and it was hard to get that like
line of demarcation while we were still
filming videos and the TechnoBuffalo
offices it had been you know five days a
week I was in the office from 8 a.m.
till about 5:00 working and that office
was an important part of running the
website but it was less important a part
of someone who's just trying to make
videos be an office building doesn't
lend itself to sort of the best looking
type of content so it was strange I was
sort of left with like a like a shrug
it's like very kindly they're like why
don't you we have some space here why
don't you come film here the very first
video we ever did here was that Mac Pro
video which is one of the videos on the
channel that I'm incredibly proud of if
the creativity is is is back and it's
cool that's its back with the same crew
that we had a TechnoBuffalo
you know I if you sell a message on
Twitter Instagram you know I try to be
the first one to tell you that's sort of
the reason that videos look good is it's
Matt Gonzales and Robert Rosenfeld
behind the camera that are sort of doing
this work and to see them have the same
kind of growth that I've had has also
been been really cool and sort of see
them kind of fall in love the creative
process again and kind of get out of the
rut that we were in has been
inspirational for me and the fact that
it came from one of the darkest times
for me professionally is when I sort of
went out to lunch with with John and
Josh and sort of spilled my guts and
told them it was like from those seeds
of despair kind of like I mean it
started some poetic but kind of grew
these like awesome flowers of creativity
so at your darkest time you never know
that could be the turning point when
things start to get better and I never
felt worse professionally and I did
like that month and I never have felt
better professionally than I do right
now
and I think you can see that on camera
so it's been it just been a really fun
experience and I've gotten a lot of
questions about the sets and the studios
and things obviously look visually
different but what's been going on so I
kind of wants to share the real story of
what happened to TechnoBuffalo and how
we got here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
