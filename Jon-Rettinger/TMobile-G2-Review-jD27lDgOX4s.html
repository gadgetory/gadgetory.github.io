technobuffalo here at the full review
for you of the sequel to the android
phone that started the android phone
craze the t-mobile g1 this is it's big
brother all grown up let's take a look
at the g2 before I start my phone
reviews like to talk about call quality
if the phone doesn't make good phone
calls doesn't matter how good a browsers
or what the processor speed is it's not
going to be much use to you I'm happy to
say that the g-tube has a very strong
radio I was able to pull in a very heavy
nice five bars of t-mobile 3g really
anywhere I went while other t mobile
phones generally hovered around for
certainly the bar system is a bit
arbitrary but it does appear as the g2
has a very strong radio a call quality
was quite nice as well I had no white
noise you're popping on my end and the
other end of kala had no white noise are
popping on their end on a 20 call test I
experienced no drop calls with each call
lasting more than two minutes speaker
foam is actually quite loud as well this
is one of the nicest speaker phones that
are used you'll be more than able to
sort of pop this guy on speaker put it
on your lap if you need wire in the car
and have no problem hearing all right so
that aside let's go ahead and start
talking about the specs so this guy has
a 3.7 inch diagonal screen it's got a
resolution of 480 x 800 it's got android
2.2 on board an 800 megahertz processor
with 512 megabytes of ram it's got a 5
megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus and LED flash which is also
capable of shooting HD movies at 1280 by
720 also known as just 720p that's got a
1300 milliamp hour battery good pics you
about 6.6 hours of talk time this thing
is by no means a battery usage champ be
prepared to have to be close to a
charger I barely got through a day
before this thing would turn off on me
and I'm a pretty heavy user so if you're
a lot of exchange account so you're
having push email sent you do a lot of
web browsing you are definitely going to
want either have a replacement battery
or keep the charger with you it does
have a 4 gigs of storage built in which
is quite nice of course you can expand
that with a micro SD card alright so
let's talk about some of the build
quality and what you're going to get
physically on the phone itself I have
long lamented about capacitive buttons I
think that sometimes they don't work as
well as advertised specials physical
buttons and I've gone on the record as
saying I did not enjoy them on the nexus
one however the g-tube capacitive
buttons obviously right they're all
backlit really do work quite nicely and
you work almost as well as physical
button so if you sort of had those
Furies like I did what not the
capacitive buttons are going to work
don't worry and you can actually see
them when they're not backlit as well so
now I'm sort of going to disappear like
we've seen with some of the galaxy s
variants I like the option of having a
trackpad I don't use it very often but I
like the fact that it's there sometimes
you want to use it in a game or an
application for simple navigation it's
nice sort of have that choice this is a
user the flexibility to do that so this
is very much stock android 2.2 but there
are a lot of google ad on things
actually hadn't really seen before and
these are all things you can generally
get from the android marketplace i got
some cool things here you've got sort of
a google sky map and go ahead and map
your phone up to the sky you hold it up
there's a ton of really cool sort of
value add Google applications here so
you got listen google translate which is
really kind of cool i want to show you
so I was translating right here upsets
me from English to Spanish hello how are
you hola como estas you could actually
use the voice capability series you can
talk to it so you can say hello how are
you and I'll change like that into
Spanish kind of neat it's not going to
do all your proper verb conjugation and
whatnot but if you're in a foreign
country and you gotta ask a general
question this is really going to work
very very very well kind of neat let's
go ahead and push the talk button see if
it'll talk so you have to pronounce the
arena for our country is push it you can
have that lady top for you kind of neat
one of the interesting things about the
g20's making a joke there about that
pull tab
is the keyboard sort of the way this
full keyboard slides out so it sits on
top of the phone instead of just sliding
straight out actually lifts up and pulls
I see that mechanism right there and it
does feel almost spring loaded it slides
out very quickly on this keyboard is
really an absolute pleasure to use I
really like having a physical QWERTY
keyboard this one has a decent matter
throw despite being a modified slider so
you can see sort of up top there's a
decent amount of key depression when you
go ahead and type it's got a nice big
space bar sort of a rubber feel to the
keys I also really like one of the
things that serve nice about the g2 yeah
these three custom own customized little
buttons at the bottom to set for
whatever you would like them to do it's
really a nice way to recover phone and
you know make it yours click go ahead
and slide that back I really do like
phones that are relatively on the thin
side this phone is certainly not the
fattest phone on the block but you do
the option without you want to use the
on-screen keyboard or the slide-out
keyboard and speaking of on-screen
keyboard it should say this guy will
ship with swype so if you're a fan of
swype and you don't want to take your
finger off the screen the g2 is going to
serve you quite well camera is a fairly
unremarkable pictures for 5 megapixel
camera that's pretty much exactly what
you'd expect from a camera phone
certainly not get any place your
whatever you use is your standard on
camera today not going to replace your
video recorder as well and we get the
job done for a quick blog or a video of
your dogs pooping but for the most part
keep another camera handy build quality
is absolutely fantastic HTC Strip has
that industrial feel to their phones the
metal back really makes it feel nice and
heavy in the hand but not too heavy that
it's cumbersome really just feels quite
good all right so this does have flash
10.1 support and does work quite well go
to open up the browser here here's a
technobuffalo go ahead and serve a seat
content start to place there's a flash
banner up there one of the things I was
not happy about was actually the pinch
to zoom scrolling here now I'm on a
flash page but it wasn't as smooth as
I've seen on other Android devices and I
would say that is not a symptom of the
800 megahertz processor people get very
caught up in 800 vs
giga hertz hear her rather and it really
isn't that big a difference mostly the
speed of a phone is going to be how well
the software is optimized for the
hardware and this software is actually
optimized very very well for the
hardware so you're not getting a slow
foam I you stretch the imagination with
the 800 megahertz processor you are
gonna be able to do everything you need
to do watch your videos check out all
your content things you're going to work
very well and I did like really which
showed me the hardest keeping up was
there isn't any that checker box
scrolling when I go ahead and scroll
through a web page or any views I would
have liked the browser to have been a
bit smoother but those are one of the
only shortcomings that I had with the g2
overall I've been very very very happy
with the phone as the phone that I could
definitely use my daily driver if I was
on a t-mobile so the are at t mobile
user is a very clear choice you're going
to get a great phone good build quality
good sound quality a great customizable
operating system I'm sure the
flexibility for future upgrades you
can't go wrong with the g2 on in 125
scale I give it a very solid four and a
half I would have liked to seen a bit of
a better camera and better browser
performance those are just nitpicky
after what is an overall very very
excellent device i'm jon rettinger from
