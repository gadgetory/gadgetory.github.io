Buffalo show I'm Wonder to host for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton everybody are you
doing Todd I'm still tired uh yeah yeah
I I have to agree with you also I just a
real quick piece of housekeeping if
there is this could very well be the
last episode of the TechnoBuffalo show
if I win 1.5 billion dollars tonight or
whatever amount it is yeah I'm not
coming back next week yeah seem here
actually yeah so I'll be back just to
say goodbye oh okay just kidding fur no
and if you're not here we'll know why
right yeah exactly well as I expressed
earlier today my plan is to buy tekton
Buffalo and rebrand it as a knitting
site so yeah I i just sent an article
this is funny for anyone who hasn't seen
it though there's it's on gizmodo about
this woman who knit like a life-sized
version of her son to cuddle with which
is just creepy Emily reprint
technobuffalo into a knitting site will
teach you how yes exactly we're also
going to show you how to make cozies for
your smartphones huh yeah because who
needs to go out and buy a case where you
can just nip one yeah keep your phone
room exactly so that's our plans if one
of us happens to win the 1.5 billion
dollars but beyond that yo since we're
in the world of reality unfortunately so
last week as you all know what CES which
i find hilarious that they no longer
allow us to call it the Consumer
Electronics Show yeah I still I'm sure
you've probably corrected it sometimes
when I type it out I still do that I
everybody does and what you don't know
folks is we get all these emails from
CES leading up to the show and for last
year and this year we kept getting up
and remember is now just called the
International CES is not the consumer
electronic show I forgotten they
actually always request that you call it
international to which I don't think we
do no I and we never will yeah because
it's the silliest thing in the world of
time
it's see yes you know fine whatever and
I'm sorry it's still the consumer
electronic show so yes folks we we were
there we were there in force I think
that was the largest team we've ever
taken I kept screw up whatever I would
make dinner reservations what was it
like 11 of us 11 of us but like at first
night when we went to the buffet i
miscounted right and we ended up having
to bring more people and then the night
we went to the irish pub i miscounted
and it was a 11 was just a weird number
to deal with yeah it is not a nice even
number but hey that was fun we got I'll
see everybody ya know it's great you
know that this is one of the few times
of the year it's actually the only time
of the year that so many of us are in
one place at one time so it's always a
nice not only to be there and see the
show but also to actually be able to see
one another in person the only people
that weren't there this year is the
gaming department which nothing I guess
they're just simply is not that much
gaming there and Killian ruk writer
right but otherwise all of us were there
and for those of you that fog along in
years past yes we did have a room under
the stairs although we had more we
actually had what was it four rooms in
like four rooms I spent all of my time
in one room mmm as did you in the room
under the stairs we separated each other
this time yeah good ears there were some
of us that want the quiet room under the
stairs and some of us wanted to be in
the big room and then we had a filming
studio upstairs and then we had a spare
room that we were just using for
voiceover work yeah which is hard to do
when you're in the car stereo section
and about every 15 minutes some idiot
turns up the stereos yeah it's like
we're sitting there trying to write edit
video do voiceovers whatever and all of
a sudden in this area someone to like
try to prove how you know loud their
speakers get probably for sales or
something I just hike it all the way up
like to the point where I'm like I'm
gonna have our tech that was so glad oh
there I fine I I normally don't
listen to music while I work but I put
on my noise-canceling headphones just to
cancel out all the stereo my wrists were
vibrating on the table most of it yeah
yeah it was yeah it was nuts but so
folks CES is over and Todd you weren't a
great piece about the fact that CS so
much this year wasn't about what we were
seeing right it was like the saw I say I
think I said the stuff that matters is
he as his stuff you can't see and I
actually I was surprised see yes put
that on their website which I know I
that that surprised me too that was the
only one of our post they put up but it
goes along with an editorial you wrote
ooh is very good about the the smart
home and uma and echo and stuff like
that and how is all of these things
combined you know we would think like
smart Homer for the young and the hip
and though you know people building new
houses like I gotta being on this and
now you know you were saying it's about
the elderly to might need assistance
with say calling 911 bailed early people
with disabilities there's a lot of stuff
that I think people are not realizing
about smart homes yeah which is sort of
exactly what I was saying to is that in
previous CES is especially way back the
day before I was probably born you know
I'd walk and you'd see like new speakers
and TVs and VCRs or whatever and you're
like oh that's that and then as I was
going sometimes it was phones and there
were still phones um you know obviously
the 8k TVs the 4k TVs and like
advancements in those areas but it was
more about you know not that hardware
but what's going on behind the scenes
stuff you can't see so like webos three
point 0 for example on the TV and even
like sure you can see it there but it's
not like you like I don't think I needed
to be at CES to say I saw webos
three-point Oh like I could have seen a
demo anywhere right um and and you know
just the advancements that we've we've
had in the smart home like you were
saying um not just TVs where else we
look in I mean you look at refrigerators
maybe just things are getting smarter
and I hate it to call it the internet of
things but the way everything talks to
one another now and that involves you
your TV and your smartphone and
appliance up like that and of course you
can't see it you can't see that
technology just walking up and down the
halls it's like you could see it demoed
but it really it's
that's software and the chips and stuff
you know behind the scenes at Intel and
Qualcomm and all these other companies
have been working on I think that's what
was super fascinating to me yeah I
actually I what people don't know is I
very rarely get out on the floor at see
us because I'm so busy air traffic
controller is they call it and on the
day you guys all were departing I was
still there i did get out for an hour to
and I went over and I saw the the
Samsung family hub the refrigerator with
the smart screen hang which I admit I
made fun of all that week and once I
talked to him I asked them one question
I go now when this refrigerator for
those that don't know every time he
closed the door the refrigerator takes
picture so you can see what was inside
so you can look you know without opening
the door the key to that though was that
you can access those pictures on your
phone so when you're away from the home
so if you're at the grocery store there
is a use their you you can look at the
picture and go oh I don't remember if we
need eggs right now of course the way
they were demonstrating this was a very
clean organized refrigerator I know I
was gonna say yeah I'm like unless there
are also cameras in the back you're in
my refrigerator never gonna see
everything yeah exactly like stuff on
the door and all kinds of yeah so it's
not perfect but it was still it was an
interesting idea and I can see some uses
for it but yeah I green tea though Todd
it was a lot about what we weren't
seeing we were being explained to about
it and they were running demos but it
was not a physical good right yeah it's
like it exists this the advancements
exist on physical goods that arguably
we've already seen like 4k TVs and bit I
mean at some point I feel like we walk
the show for and you're like okay it's a
big screen TV I can't afford it it's
sharp more colorful than I've ever seen
before you know like my eyes can't
comprehend the amount of colors and you
know stuff like that rias like okay I
get it yeah now I I did go over to LG's
booth I
I checked out the 4k with HDR television
yeah and I will say this so they had
four of them on display and they were
showing 3 0 demos on three of them were
showing demos that were just
unbelievably crystal-clear like there
was a NASA shuttle launch that was just
mind-blowing then the fourth scream was
showing netflix is daredevil and it had
this artifacting going on in it I was
like what the heck why is not clear I
kept looking I kept looking and so
finally I walked here on I talked to a
rep I'm like why is there artifact you
know artifacts on the dirt oval I was
all those were intentional by the show's
creator I went wait a minute I walked
back over I looked at it I studied it
real hard now for those that are in
comic book readers back in the 70s and
80s when comics were preying on just
regular newsprint there were lots of
little dots that would show up and the
the printing because it was just playing
newsprint the show daredevil would you
have not seen unless you see an HDR is
there is a layer of little dots no way
there is newsprint dots layered on that
show wow I did not know that I didn't
either until I saw it in HDR I was like
this is the coolest geekiest thing I
have ever seen in my life that's pretty
crazy yeah I that happened after you
guys left so I hadn't had a chance to
tell you all about that but yeah and he
goes yeah it exists you just can't see
it like on a 1080 screen and even on a
regular 4k screen it's tough to spot Wow
all right but I don't think that's why
I'm gonna buy it look at HDR yeah no no
no no at yeah I'm not running on by an N
HDR television just for for that but
alright so there were some technological
advances I mean TVs are always at CSR
always insane with what they show us and
they always make you come home and look
at your current television go I hate you
yeah exactly like I said what can't you
be colder like your big brother I know
but it's like I guess now and I think I
wrote this to like I guess now I could
buy the TV's we saw like two years
I don't know you know like maybe a
thousand dollars an affordable price I
don't know yeah but I still like I
wouldn't I already have this TV here
which is like a couple years old I was
just pointing out those who are just
listening the audio and it's fine it's
like I could I can't justify it
upgrading right right I mean I i
recently bought a refurbished Vizio
television which is 4k and that's my
first 4k television and the only reason
is because we're remodeling a room and
that is did not previously had
televisions now going need one so we old
one yo got the new one and I knew I knew
going in to see us I was like I know
there's going to be something there it's
gonna make me drool and hate myself and
and there was I mean the 4k with HDR is
absolutely gorgeous I will say the
stupidest television i saw was i don't
know if any of the rest of you saw this
over at GC how they had a television
that was done a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
which is the same as a movie theater
yeah and so they were showing a movie on
it and looked absolutely spectacular
however what they were not showing you
is regular television content to say
what happens so that I want to know
because basically you can only use that
television for movies yeah which I mean
I guess for people that have how big was
it like some people have their home
theaters um it wasn't big enough for a
home theater i think it was around 65 70
inches okay um but yeah and it was a
look let me tell you they were showing
after earth the M night Shyamalan movie
which is a horrible movie but it looked
unbelievable on the screen but again I
don't see you watching the big bang
theory on this on this toleration right
kind of like this point but you know so
let's dive in was there any one thing at
CES that you walked away and went wow
I'm so glad I saw that um if I'm honest
no I think it's more about the story
there like I think I was just very
blown away by and I knew about you know
HTC and under armour and their
partnership a little bit ahead of time
but just how everything is connected and
in a lot of ways it's either your
smartphone or the TV that's the hub and
this was the first time we really saw
the TV excuse me acting as the hub
especially LG's why bless three-point oh
you know I saw I didn't take any
pictures I'll because it was sort of
like oh ok but you know I saw it with a
whole screamer which are like status of
your washer status of your dryer that
we've talked about but also temperatures
of specific rooms in your house
temperature of like the fridge you know
I don't know how much people really care
about this and one of the things we've
talked about too is how many people are
actually gonna upgrade like all of their
appliances but you know if someone's
buying a new house they want this they
can have it all at once I can't imagine
how much would cost so that was cool and
then the other thing that I like walked
away you know I don't think I was like
oh my god I needed to see that but I was
very impressed by the next bit Robin the
smartphone that was a Kickstarter
started by some guys and they have some
of the htc's former staff on their team
who I've known for a while what the guy
Scott Croyle for example designed the
one m7 he designed this next bit Robin
and I was actually impressed as a
plastic phone I really liked it and
actually ended up backing it on like the
second gets on a Kickstarter I forget
the new one while I was in the meeting
with them so I'm excited for that to
ship sometime this month I guess yeah
that was funny when you came back home
well I liked it enough about one yeah
which I'm like I can't believe I did
that but I can yeah I can't it's one of
those things though where I felt like it
wasn't so much the phone and I am
impressed with the phone but also like
I've known these people one of them was
eric lin he worked for acc for skype and
back in the day for phonescoop as a as a
blogger just like we do so it was like
more like backing people that I believe
in that I you know that I've known for a
long time and I felt like hey this is
pretty cool so yeah I would say my
favorite thing that I saw I went over to
a special presentation by Dolby and they
were demonstrating how Dolby Atmos is
being brought into a lot of different
s but you know it's being brought into
tablets and smartphones and all that and
I have never been a big believer in
sound bars I think sound bars for the
most part mine I never saw the point of
them because I did have a surrounds you
know system I was like you know the
sound bars are just in front of you that
that doesn't make any sense well to
argue just real quick because I know
you're saying to in an apartment like
mine where I mean the TV's here the
couch across the room and I can't really
put surround sound if you just look at
this from home that's where like so I've
always wanted Santa Barbara they're kind
of expensive for the quality o on right
so they are coming out with Dolby Atmos
sound bars and so they took me into this
demo room now mind you I'm I know first
off this is a room that they have
fine-tuned could you within an inch of
its life I understand that completely
right so they sat me down the couch they
started playing this and it was a demo
of a leaf falling off a tree and behind
me I could hear more leaves wrestling so
when the demo finish I was like how many
speakers are behind me and they go none
and you are free to inspect the room
yeah that stuff's crazy yeah so what it
is they have tweeters in the top of the
sandbar that are firing at the ceiling
and then it's bringing it down behind
you through angles yeah it's bouncing
its cool stuff it was so awesome so it
was a sound bar and just a subwoofer and
that was it wow I i have to admit i
walked away really impressed from that i
will bring this up though so of course
everyone's talking about VR Dolby is
doing some stuff with VR and so mind you
I'm going to talk about to VR headsets
that although I saw them at the dolby
demonstration there this is not Dolby's
fault so they had a samsung gear vr for
me a try on and an oculus rift mm-hmm
has anyone that designed to be our
headset ever had to wear glasses while
wearing one of these I don't know I get
you so I had to sit there and for those
of you lo see on the audio podcast you
won't be able to really envision Eliza's
I had to sit there with my hands on the
gear VR and the oculus and pulled them
slightly away from
head that throughout the entire demo
because it was pressing my glasses into
my face so hard whoa that's annoying I
chiller had glasses on wall in the demos
yeah and the arceus especially it was
painful Wow yeah I want to walk out I
had to get my glasses cloth out and wipe
all my face off with us that's crazy now
but they the gear VR should technically
work without glasses to Rex it has like
and I assume the oculus but it has the
roller thing at the top it just it was
impressed out far enough and they might
be adjustable I fully realized that
however you in a demo situation right oh
I couldn't sit there and fiddle with
them completely right now that being
said that was my first time finally
getting to use an oculus and what they
were demoing to me was uh concerts and
it was it was kind of interesting you
know because it was Paul McCartney
concert and so it was filmed with the
camera set up on the stage and so then
you you know can look around and you can
look back out at the audience you can
look at the different members of the
band right and all that so that was kind
of interesting you know and I can
finally say I used an oculus
unfortunately wasn't a game though I
know that's where be ours truly yeah
it's incredible yeah I know I I wish I'd
had time to go try a game somewhere but
hmm not yet unfortunately I I will I
think HTC had like a four hour wait at
one point for the bots now I think that
was for everybody at the show I think
press could we could have made
appointments yeah yeah when I dated her
I knew he saw the well I peps come you
could just walk up and try it I'm press
because Rory and I took video of Jacob
trial that's right it and came to the
realization that nobody looks good where
I could be our help yeah well you're
just watching somebody standing at a
distance trying doing VR and they're
looking all around with that
and they have no idea what's around them
it's just really odd-looking yeah and
it's odd being that person because you
feel like you're in another universe
yeah transplanted yeah no that was it
was definitely proof of concept that you
cannot look good while wearing a VR
headset ya can't happen but no it was an
interesting show and you know CES 2017
is only 51 weeks away yeah and in here
comes Mobile World Congress which we
just booked yesterday exactly so and
that a oh I i would say phones at csr
95% dead yeah yeah i think the day of
the phones at CES dead i think
everyone's holding out for next month at
mwc in spain l unfortunately but it
comes so quick you know you're just like
all of a sudden here we are you know but
that's good after more war Congress we
have a little break until Eva and
September and all starts all over again
yay but of course don't forget yo we've
also gotten their google i/o WD yeah
that is true not nothing like starting
the year my other dates were just
announced yesterday we didn't they
didn't send out press invitations yet
but what are they don't remember that's
middle of middle of may i believe ya mei
18 to 20th so 18 is gonna be the big one
you want to follow for you know android
news and stuff exactly uh such a mahal
brings up one product we haven't
discussed yet that of course was a lot
of the talk of the show is the faraday
future FF 0 1 actually real and is it
coming out as real product yes it is
real it was there yeah but it's not
coming out as a real prize eggs
anecdotes yeah yeah it just there's no
way that Batmobile is going to come out
its own consumer car yeah i've done a
lot of radio and newspaper interviews
since CES closed up and that's been one
of the top yo discussions and trying to
explain to everybody what a concept car
of concept means has been real fun
hahaha it's just like a concept car were
the pieces of it are all concept yeah
yeah the feeding and watering tube
though is the part that kills me and
that's like okay um yeah it's almost
like okay let's throw everything
possible in here and that's exactly what
they did with the faraday you know it
was just it was everything else possible
hey ya know but the funny thing is you
know okay that was interesting and it
looked cool and then all of a sudden
what was the new feature that uh
summoned the Tesla just announced which
sounds incredible itself and it's like
actually here we can have the co you can
summon the car and like pull out of your
garage if you have you know it's up to
your smart home and they said within two
years it can like come across the
country to meet you that's crazy like
imagine being at work and you're like oh
need my car summon it yeah I all I could
think of was that the Pierce Brosnan
James Bond movie where he's using the
phone and driving the car yeah yeah yeah
is it but okay so it sounds it sounds
stupid and crazy and all that but what
about people in Manhattan or like myself
here we're parking is crazy expensive
yet you know like my my father-in-law's
house is about 40 minutes away I could
keep the car there any time I need to
use it i summon it wait 40 minutes and
then you know i'm not paying for parking
I don't know stuff like that to meet
your seems really cool and like parking
in New York City more expensive so
that's intra the other thing I
envisioned was like for a mom iron man 3
when he starts building the armor that
he could just stick out his hand yeah
yeah yeah it just comes exactly yes I
just picture you walk you outside sticky
your thumb out and also your car arrives
I mean I'd be awesome and imagine all
the people in your you just have like I
feel like the Meadowlands here which is
sort of like the wasteland of New Jersey
were just all of a sudden and i don't
mean the stadium which is what the
former jets and giants am used to be
called now it's metlife anyway but you
could have these huge parking garages
there like in the middle of nowhere and
everybody in New York City just keeps
their cars there you know they come in
when they need these driverless cars
going over I don't know just the few
true I just wanna know if I can
officially stop calling him the st.
Louis Rams yeah yeah that's right only
Rams as in last pirate it I I will I
always love the fact that we lost the
cardinals which is a very you know
prolific bird here to arizona where
Cardinals really don't exist right and
in exchange we took in the LA Rams which
we have no Rams here that's been like I
feel like that's been the threat though
of so many NFL I don't know how he
swished this but of so many NFL teams
for a long time leo we're just gonna
move to LA you know and especially the
Rams and now here here they go well for
those that don't know I I know what's
going to be blamed III don't know how we
got on this either st. Louis tried to
pass a law they put it on the ballot
where they were going to text the entire
state of Missouri to pay for a new Rams
stadium I think that's kind of common
sometimes and we we voted that down uh
I'm sorry we're not paid for sale is his
duty anyway back to see yes wow that was
a weird danjan anyway back to see so we
do have a question from such humble hall
here and this is well this is a delicate
one but it could also be fun what was
the one product or thing that you didn't
like at CES 2016 hmm that's a bit
tougher because we always look at wheat
town and I especially try to be very
positive we always try to go okay well
what about this use case what about that
use case yeah and there are times where
but there are times where you just have
to find go yeah now there's no no reason
for this to exist the other thing too is
like I didn't really go into the sands
we're kind of the weird stuff is um we
had our other guys go there I mean you
and ice with a lot of time asking people
to go places um yeah there is stuff I
mean okay I saw like
I don't know no I don't think of
anything I didn't like I thought some
things that I thought were kind of
stupid but something I didn't like them
like parrot parrot has these drones
which are all really cool and they had
like all of them sort of dancing
together and I thought it was cool but
then I was like that's also kind of
stupid I looked up online because I know
I thought I was also like oh I'd like to
own one of those drones cuz they were
all dancing together on their would
spell out messages in the air which was
neat and I go online they have like two
stars like people hate these drones so I
guess that was stupid to this is like a
specific product um I don't know I
actually liked a lot of what I saw there
now I know I and that's the I think like
I said we try to be you know anyone
knows worked on these products they have
spent years you know at least a year if
not years working on it trying to make
it as perfect as possible and unless
it's just a complete knockoff which
actually i'll bring that up us yeah it's
gonna say yeah unless it's a complete
knock off and the FBI raid you on the
show floor that was amazing it's hard to
totally dislike something that is a fun
story and let's not even discuss what
the products were but words all right by
it was a hoverboard there there was a
company that it has the intellectual
property rights to a certain hoverboard
they've been after another company for
months and lo and behold they're both of
CES and they're in the same aisle yeah
and the company that holds the
intellectual property rights called the
FBI and said they're here and now as I
understood Jacob walked past before the
raid and after the raid oh really I
didn't you know yes so Jacob walked past
it yo he saw me just you know didn't pay
much digital he walks by a little bit
later in the booth is cleaned out that's
funny see I can't imagine how
frustrating that must be though for
somebody that's no working very hard
inventing something and then you go to
like CES or you know this come
exists that copy to your product just
ripped it off completely like identical
you go to CES and you see them they're
like i can't imagine that would make my
blood boil and that's exactly probably
what happened well they have all these
crazy rules feel like i was reading you
have to have like so many like only so
many people from your company including
lawyers can show up to confront the
other companies crazy like the oh i
haven't heard about this yeah so i think
they had like two lawyers and two
representatives from the company you
know confront them I don't know it's
like the rules of CES so I guess it's
like an issue that's happened before
obviously I you can only bring in a
certain number of lawyers that's kind of
amazing yeah i mean you imagine you have
like your whole booth running over there
yelling at people apparently it's like
kindergarten and there's playground
rules yeah now Johnny Johnny what did we
say about using your outside voice yeah
and I think there were language barriers
to in this case that's got to be oh yeah
but so yeah a full FBI team showed up
and cleaned out the booth of everything
yeah so yeah that's uh gonna be
interesting I will probably never hear
the resolution of it but it was
definitely it was the talk of the show
there for a while yeah do you hear the
FBI showed up no no what happens oh no I
don't know the craziness of Vegas let me
tell you yeah I was just thinking about
things I didn't like and I I there's one
product it's Cassio's new android we're
smarter watch and i was very excited
about it first until i heard it's gonna
cost like 500 bucks or something or just
obscene but this brings me to like it's
not something i saw it's not that I
didn't like that but I went to the booth
for like a demonstration and all too
often this happens to CES and all the
other shows you have these people that
have been trained for like ten minutes
it feels like to demo these products for
the press and it's very awkward like
because they have
no idea what they're talking about there
you know going through this thing and I
was like oh how does this work has that
work like how how much battery life does
it get and they were like oh seven hours
seven hours of battery life like either
that's incorrect or it's just obscene
why is this even coming the market and
they say like so it's Android wear and
digital so it has a month of battery
life we just leave on digital but seven
hours of battery life what do why would
I ever want that yeah well I don't want
to embarrass the company you know what
happened with one situation where i was
given a completely erroneous piece of
information oh yeah from the booth
workers yeah I and it was completely
erroneous but believable so I didn't
follow up on it a second time which I
should have but you know if an employee
of a company is flat-out saying ET and
that they are not just an outside PR
person or booth work or whatever saying
you know it will do X I have no reason
not to believe that it will do x yeah
until the PR firm reaches out to me the
next day goes by the way can't see that
it doesn't do that but uh yeah so it I
agree to that is a frustration you know
and I understand yo time constraints but
still you know and what I always love is
when you ask them this you know they'll
go oh I off to check into that and you
go back like a day later go did you get
a chance checking oh no I didn't yeah
that's like my wonderful to that right
the empty promise always yeah that
that's not I don't know no and that does
happen a lot of CEOs and it's
unfortunate I mean I now where was it we
were somewhere oh it when we were when
we first got into the booth Ralph and I
were the first ones into the booth to
start work and make sure your internet
was working on all that a lot of the car
companies were running through their
presentations before show open man doing
rehearsals and that's great I think
that's what should be done you know it
was nice to hear them
doing that yeah because it was only
thing it was a little loud with no
bodies in the building to absorb the
sound but oh so they had to do it you
know I I will say this year I would say
one of the biggest things was was it
just me or was there a lot more traffic
yes there was a lot I think the distance
between our hotel and the conference
center was like two miles or something
yeah it would take us one day it took us
an hour to get home yeah you'll walk
that which is crazy because it also
involves as for people haven't been to
see yes for us we take I mean we have
cars there but you can't really park
very easily at the convention center so
you can take up a convention center at
all yeah across the street yeah so
anyway then so what do you do you either
take a taxi to take the bus taxi line is
insane um and the bus is like for us you
know you might wait there for an hour
sometimes they're supposed to run every
20 minutes but sometimes I just don't or
that you the traffic is so bad going
from the convention center of the hotel
isn't back like I said takes like an
hour that the bus doesn't get there on
time so you're just doing like a lot of
waiting CS is full of just waiting yeah
for I did nothing yeah now I did like it
when we went over to showstoppers and I
had never gone over to the wind with you
guys before so I wasn't aware of the on
property shuttle bus oh yeah the wind
has this thing we're like it picks up
from at the far end of its own property
and drives you the hotel which is great
yeah it drives you to the front of the
the place but I did love the fact you
took us longer to get through the hotel
to the meteor that took us to walk and
ride the bus oh yeah it's crazy you're
talking about like what was that what
which version of mario is I was on Game
Boy I think we're like you have to run
through the castle and like you have to
get the right you either run up top or
bottom and it like dings if you've done
the right one like if you run up top and
it's correct it's like ding and it
doesn't repeat it but if you do it wrong
it keeps sending you down the whole
hallway again and the wind walking to
meeting rooms in that place is like the
same
thing like this exact same hallway after
the exact same hallway after the exact
same hallway like 10 times it's really
freaky yeah they're there was one point
where we were walking through the window
was taking so long and I wouldnt I'm at
CSI don't have time to work out I've
been working a lot lately I decided to
start walking as fast as possible i was
like i'm gonna get a workout out of this
everybody's like oh Sh we must have
pissed Shana yeah I know it out once we
get there that you guys were all backs
are going with this shut off no I was
just exercising I'm like screw those
steps in right I've got it that's
exactly I was getting my steps out I was
like oh yeah what it took us 15 minutes
to walk there through his hotel it's
funny speaking of steps and technology
and these you know fitness bands now I
was sitting next to somebody at
breakfast the other day another couple
it wasn't with us and they're talking
about that like I got to get to my
10,000 yeah it's my 10,000 steps you
know and this is something that didn't
exist even like a year ago we had these
fitness bands but I didn't feel like it
was very common for everybody to see
like I gotta get my steps in today
that's becoming more and more
interesting especially you know the
technology it's a yes everything
connected yeah it's nuts read Jeff case
questions pretty funny and it actually I
have an answer for it okay from Jeff k
todd has anyone told you that you look
like Ralph from A Christmas Story
anyways what did you sell while away so
my brother I have a twin brother and he
has always been called Ralphie and I
only just recently started wearing
glasses so I guess that's a now it's
coming for me too um what did I sell
nothing but i did buy a pair of
headphones that I probably shouldn't
have bought in the airport cuz I didn't
have comfortable ones and I didn't have
room i bagged four big ones so i might
get rid of those i did not know about
this yeah their bows in here i want is
the first time i've ever used one of
those best buy machines you know like
the damn yeah like ah uh folks I
i I've just received a message from Joey
are gaming editor stating Sean I'm sorry
I have to take the rest of the day and
that's followed by the news that one
direction is splitting up ah yes yes and
he replies that I just sorry I can't be
here right now so I feel his pain are
they going so it's not one direction
anymore right it's like multiple
direction hey there you go you hit the
nail on the head dispersing and and he
just Joey just added looks like they
went in separate directly Jeff I did see
he hang 184 human-sized rome by the way
we steal that question that thing looked
awesome if so they say anything about
furthering weight capacity could hold a
I didn't um I honestly just went there
to take a picture of it like for myself
and to say hey i saw this Roy our
managing editor picked up the brochure
which might have more information on it
but I really just want to see this thing
it's this drone that can carry humans
like what is it like five to 10 miles so
you know just hop in it and go somewhere
I guess but it looked cool yeah I ain't
shaky though I would never I don't think
I could get I I could never get it all
first off I'm over the weight limit but
secondly the idea of it okay
self-driving cars I can kind of get
behind getting into a ton of us drone
yeah to me is like well you remembered
futurama the suicide machines yeah yeah
that's what it would feel like to you no
offense to hang I hope it works not for
me yeah um I mean I guess the funny
thing is these days like planes can you
gotta fly themselves right like a
pilot's there but I actually there was
at one point in my flight the other day
that you know how they now block off the
access to the cab
so they can come and go to the bathroom
weather so I've watched that and so the
pilot comes out he uses the restroom get
some food goes back in and the doors
open the copilot's sitting sideways in
his seat got even looking at the
instruments exactly I'm like yeah this
makes me feel comfortable I'm I'm okay
with this somebody look at the
instruments yeah I mean it's gotta get
boring right here's like okay we're fine
i I'm sorry but if you got a Plane full
of 180 or so people look at the tape
instruments look at the damn it's true
it's I want your hands at to Ted and I
want you to look at those instruments so
the idea of getting in the e hang and yo
I'm off to work and this autonomous
vehicle that is fly through there and I
have no control over yeah means the
Jetsons it is the Jetsons but like in
the worst possible way yeah uh Jeff case
says asks what's worse One Direction
splitting up or Sean being stuck in the
basement with a ghost behind him um on
being stuck in the basement with this
ghost me yeah well first off I'm not in
a basement but uh and we don't talk
about Henry hey I've named my sheet but
no definitely one direction breaking up
I mean it's that that's a tragedy that
just is the the world will never recover
from uh interesting question from such a
Mahal and we'll we'll be wrapping up
here this week since you have the echo
does the Amazon echo only work well if
you are an Amazon Prime member and
that's an interesting question because
then you wouldn't have prime music right
yeah so you just wouldn't have access to
that but it would still work well I
primarily use mine for for my lights and
you know random things like what's the
weather today so yeah which lichens I
just those Todd the echo is missing from
your shelf did she moved it actually
it's now
uh X to the TV there ok one more central
location because for whatever reason it
doesn't listen to my wife and it used to
be on the shelf here and I thought well
maybe that's why it doesn't she's like
turn on the living room lights it's like
there are several lights you know like
name and she's just like I give up so
I'm not moving it somewhere else
woodworking does it so essentially the
echo and you shared that in common that
you don't listen to your life oh geez
