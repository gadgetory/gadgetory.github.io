the Nexus and I know that sounds a
little bit dramatic but the death of the
Nexus line left a little bit of a hole
in my heart I'd loved that the Nexus
line started as it was a bit of a
curiosity from Google and involved into
incredible devices year-over-year so I
thought we could look back the history
of Nexus devices from the very first to
the very last the story of the Nexus
began on January 5th 2010 when Google
officially announced the Nexus One
this was Google's chance to try things
differently to try a phone on their own
and throw us some side-eye at the folks
at Cupertino they launched a new store
to sell it with it was sold on
subsidized and there's a lot of cool
things that could do in fact if you want
to know everything about the Nexus One
we did a video revisiting the history of
that device but the specs were this it
had a 3.7 inch AMOLED display and at the
time a pretty powerful 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor it had a pretty
decent 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
LED flash had digital zoom remember it
was built by HTC it had a really nice
premium unibody feel as you'd expect
from HTC so in December of 2010 Google
decided to announce the Nexus S Google
decided to switch away from HTC and
partnered instead with Samsung for this
device and it sort of continued Android
and I guess Google's pushed towards
larger displays so the unique feature of
the Nexus S was a NFC with something
that became a staple of Android phone
that you could see the trends start to
build tier of Nexus phones launching
what's going to be flagship features of
Android Nexus S had a lot going for it
but do you think it didn't have going
for it were battery life and reception
but those decide it was still a pretty
well received phone after the success of
the Nexus S Google figure of ain't broke
don't fix it and before they moved to
another OAM they stuck with Samsung for
the Galaxy Nexus keeping the trend of
phones getting bigger the display got
larger here was four point six five
inches and pretty nice Samsung displays
it was an AMOLED panel camera got better
as well 5 megapixels it had autofocus
limited shutter lag and a single LED
flash it also brought things like DLNA
bluetooth 3.0 and kept things we saw for
the last gen like
NFC LG's own Optimus G which the Nexus 4
was based off was having a lot of
success so it seemed to be a good
platform to base the Nexus 4 on and in
fact it would proved to be one of the
most successful Nexus devices to date
and it had a really eye catching
shimmering glass back design some people
love it some people didn't like it I
kind of dug Dawei it looked so fresh off
the success at Nexus 4 LG got a chance
yet again and on October 31st 2013 the
world met the Nexus 5 Nexus 5 was an
awesome combination of specs and
features and had a four point nine five
inch full HD 1080p display and it was
really well received by a smartphone
community and technolo included I've
been hyping up a little bit that these
Nexus phones kept getting bigger next up
you know how big things really got as
the Nexus torch went to Motorola for the
not surprisingly named Nexus 6 generally
and historically next devices have been
focused on really good prices for a
premium product Nexus 6 though came out
at 649 bucks for a 32 gig model the
phone looked like a Gigantor version of
a Moto X but just had a Nexus logo on
the back of it and areas where Nexus
line had not always been that strong
like camera for example just thing at a
13 megapixel main shooter on the back
optical image stabilization so I
mentioned that a lot of people you might
be one of them still loved the Nexus 5
so it kind of got a revival and these
next two Nexus phones record the last
two Nexus phones never launched at the
same time the Nexus 5x and the 6p so
again the 5x the real successor 2013's
Nexus 5 and it carried a lot of the
aspects that everybody loved about the
Nexus 5 other features that these two
Nexus phones brought in the 5x in
particular brought in fingerprint
reading and USBC so what about that 6p I
know a lot of you guys still love and
are probably still in your pocket this
is the Acme the pinnacle the top and the
last of the Nexus line the device
included an all aluminum base body that
was thinner and liar the Nexus 6 before
it had a rear fingerprint reader called
Nexus imprint the phone felt premium in
the hand it looks like a flagship
they've performed like a flagship and it
got supported by Google like a flagship
it
until the pixel phones came and the
Nexus line got pushed aside before you
guys get super nostalgic about the end
the Nexus line of phones you might just
want to perk yourself up a little bit
and go check out the Discovery Go app
maybe you want to watch like me
Deadliest Catch dungeon Cove maybe
you're more of a casino secrets or a
cruise ship disaster type person
whatever you want to watch you can do it
with the Discovery Go app link to it's
down below so this has been a history
and look back the Nexus device it's not
a sad history because it's over it's fun
because we got to know them what was
your favorite of all these phones how
would you rank Nexus devices I love to
hear your thoughts on it if they're
comments down below thank you guys for
watching give the video a thumbs up to
let us know you liked it and of course
