TechnoBuffalo here I'm super excited to
unbox this guy it is the brand the new
HTC one though officially just called
the HTC one it's older brother was my
favorite phone of last year I'm hoping
that family trend continues let's go
ahead open this guy up and see if it
lives up to the hype so here is the box
for the brand new HTC One just called
the HTC One but it does happen to be all
new the box looks pretty similar to the
last generation but inside I'm hoping is
going to be a pretty awesome phone the
outgoing HTC One was my favorite phone
of last year and hoping that this guy
holds a candle to it so we've got the
European unlock dish in right here of
course there's a Google Play edition and
the carrier versions as well looking
around the ball keys Zoe boom sound
motion launch blinkfeed and the duo
camera - really excited to take a look
at nothing else here we got some specs
and that kind of business but if you
wanted to read the specs you don't come
and watch a youtube video go ahead and
pull off the box and boom there is the
brand new HTC One with its 5-inch 1080p
screen go ahead and pull this out of
here come your phone feels nice push it
off to the side for a really quick
second promise that I will come right
back to it what else we're going to have
inside of the box it's like you got some
sort of case this was sent to us
courtesy of the folks HTC a little bit
of a gel case not they're sort of dot
case that you can use to see things on
the screen getting started guys got a
sim adapter and some other limited
warranty stuff we've got looks like a
micro USB cable we've got headphones and
people always say I don't show the
headphones and the unboxing so I'll go
ahead and do that and see if those look
like it's also an inline mic with the
mute button built into it and a couple
extra ear gels if you've got different
sizes we also have a pretty extensive
wall work you can tell that this one is
not meant for for the US I think that's
the UK if my memory serves me correctly
but that's not why you're here we are
all here for this guy the piece de
resistance
a brand new HTC one I'll slide it out of
its little house there and it is really
nice feeling in the hand phone feels
very very solidly built somebody run
through the specs here for him you're
looking at a five inch screen it's 1920
by 1080
so that's 1920 by 1080 you could do math
really quickly you would know it's got a
441 PPI protecting this thing is
according Gorilla Glass 3 so pretty
durable screen other than that could
break it would be three guerrillas
what's gonna keep this guy powered is a
2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 800 chip police
in the US outside the US Asia and China
it's going to be clocked at 2.5
gigahertz but it is the new Snapdragon
801 chip augmented with 2 gigabytes of
RAM you have expandable storage on here
now so you can expand it if you'd like
with storage cards up ten to twenty
eight gigs internal though it's going to
have either 16 or 32 on the back this is
really where a lot of the story is
you've got the duo camera right there
which is for ultra pixels and a lot has
been talked about altra pixels and I'll
put it to its base and see how it does
but supposedly takes pretty awesome
shots on the front though is also a
pretty beastly little camera right there
I'd say five megapixel wide-angle lens
other stuff 802 11 ABG and AC at 2.4 and
5 gigahertz a sealed in non removable
2600 milliamp hour battery
we've got NFC in here as well available
in gunmetal gray which we clearly have a
glacial silver or amber gol it's a quick
look at the phone here so it's notable
differences of course it's a bigger
screen gone though are the capacitive
buttons that we saw on the original HTC
one through the back and the home and
dead HTC as much as he wants it to be
was not a button we all have on-screen
buttons here on the phone as well boom
sound speakers supposedly about 20%
louder which is nice covered in 90%
metal versus the 70% on the outgoing
model you can see sort of the side here
had a plastic ribbon in it so moving
along the sides of the phone on the
right hand side that's where your
microSD card is going to live on the
left hand side that's where your SIM
card is going to be on the bottom three
point five millimeter headset jack and
your
charging and Singapore does have support
for a quick charging though which is
kind of cool on the top and guessing
that's where that 10% plastic comes in
you've got now a plastic home button
which feels a little more clicky are
just quite nice in the back burns a
solid piece of metal in this case
aluminum or aluminium the phone feels
really really nice in the hand a little
bit slippery
maybe presumably though in the
caregivers and hits will get carrier
logos you know sitting everywhere it's a
little bit more rounded than we saw with
the last generation I usually see those
two there side by side it looks you know
you can tell it's the same family device
definitely looks different I saw all the
leaks to expect it to look almost like a
bigger version the last gen actually
looks very different maybe it's because
the color is a little bit changed it's a
little not as angular but it feels
really good in the hand HTC I think it's
some of the best build called in
industry and this one looks to be
continuing that trend so of course run
through its paces I'll give you a tour
of what sense looks like I'll take you
to the duo camera and all kinds of other
goodness here I'm gonna save turning it
on you're gonna save that for an
upcoming video but a lot of awesome
things to see here what's hopefully
HTC's flagship phone this is gonna
hopefully sustain the company and bring
them to greatness throughout 2014
but first it gotta bring them to
greatness here and TechnoBuffalo lab so
we will put it through its full paces
