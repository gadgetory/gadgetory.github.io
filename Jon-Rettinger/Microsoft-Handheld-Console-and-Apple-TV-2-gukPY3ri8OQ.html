to you by godaddy hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley it's gather any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me anytime on twitter at TechnoBuffalo
or at ashley ask evan just use the
hashtag ask the be so i can see it i'll
usually answer around for questions
every episode so let's get going captain
spaulding asks hey ashley it seems that
the smartphone market is starting to
plateau as far as specs and features
what do you think companies might do in
order to stay competitive besides upping
screen resolution to 2k or even 4k so
captain spaulding this is what i think
so i kind of consider cell phones and
the way cell phones have kind of evolved
really similar to the way desktop
computers have evolved so really once
the iphone was launched we saw this kind
of gradual ramping up of really cool
features and then all of a sudden we had
spec wars where everyone was trying to
get as many cores as they could into a
phone then it was how big can we make a
screen than it was how much resolution
can be put in that screen and that we're
still kind of living that right now I
think it's really similar in that
respect that we have sort of seen that
plateau and desktop PC as well however
there's always a way for somebody to
innovate so for example even though it's
not really widely in use something like
the surface pro which is for all intent
and purposes a desktop PC for somebody
just really really portable is it a way
for them to innovate so at the end of
the day I do think companies will find a
way to sort of innovate it just kind of
always works that way where it does this
and then it plateaus and then it does
this again and then at plateaus so just
give it some time I think I think it's
uh I think it's too soon to be saying
that it's completely plateaued out
chiefs fan 005 asks hey Ashley will the
new rumoured apple TV become a killer
accessory well chiefs fan I think that
Apple is mu
moving its Apple TV into the spotlight
now before it kind of played second
fiddle it was kind of hidden in the
apple store online and now they've
really kind of given it a prominent
position so I have a feeling that Apple
might have more in store for the Apple
TV then even they're letting on it and
we heard the rumors about maybe Airport
Express being part of the next Apple TV
which makes a lot of sense because of
course you want fast internet for
streaming and for gaming and for
everything else that you can think of
that you would need it fast internet
connection for and then also a focus on
maybe an Apple TV app store so that
could be something or maybe we just pull
from the actual app store and then you
use say your iPhone or iPad as a
controller this is all really a kind of
a group of things that Apple could do
with Apple TV and I think that if they
do start doing those things Apple TV
will definitely get out of the hobbyist
column and move right into the spotlight
of home media and entertainment Adam
Berg and asks do you think Microsoft
will ever come out with a handheld
gaming system to compete with the
PlayStation Vita for me they already
have a handheld gaming system it's
called a windows phone and I know that
sounds kind of crazy because obviously I
you know sony has the Xperia line and
that's not necessarily their handheld
gaming system they have the playstation
vita but at the end of the day I don't
think Microsoft is necessarily a hundred
percent invested in the idea of getting
into the hardware business of handhelds
especially now that mobile has really
kind of overtaken handheld zehrs just
recently I believe earlier this week
there was a report that handheld gaming
is now not the king any more of kind of
mobile gaming between phones and
dedicated handheld gaming devices like
the Vita and the 3ds I think at the end
of the day Microsoft probably doesn't
see a lot of value and going forward
with a dedicated piece of hardware
especially because number one Nintendo
and Sony really have a lot of that
market share oh pretty much all of it
and and then there's also you know the
shields that you have to contend with
and things like that and I just don't
see Microsoft really getting into that I
do see them get
really into sort of that second screen
experience with the xbox one so I have a
feeling that at some point in the future
there's going to be even more
integration with as soon as the market
share goes up on Windows Phone devices
but there be even more integration with
say Xbox games Xbox one games as time
goes on so that's a really exciting
thing to think about but I don't think
you should hold your breath for
Microsoft dedicated handheld gaming
device I gotta take a quick minute to
