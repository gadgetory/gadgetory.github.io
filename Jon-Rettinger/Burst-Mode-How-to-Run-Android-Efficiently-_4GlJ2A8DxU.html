were TechnoBuffalo and I thought it
might be fun to do a quick video with
you guys just talking about what we can
do to make our devices run as
efficiently as possible you know these
days there's so much going on in our
pockets that it becomes kind of tough to
manage everything our smart devices are
doing so I just wanted to take a few
minutes to talk about some
misconceptions and some tools that you
can use to make the most out of your
Android devices first off stop killing
your apps like have a seat take a deep
breath listen to what i'm about to say
to you do not use a task manager don't
do it don't constantly be going through
your reasons and swiping them away most
importantly OEMs stopped putting a
closed all button in your recent menu
killing apps compulsively like this is
just going to result in diminished
battery life and performance killing a
task ends the process and that prevents
the process from being cashed in your
phone's memory which means that when
you're ready to use that app again it's
going to wind up using more CPU cycles
and more time to recreate the process
from scratch the only exceptions here
are a device with low RAM so if you need
to free up some space you can go ahead
and dismiss an app or if you don't use
it frequently then by all means kill it
otherwise just let your device do what
it was built to do while we're on the
topic though greenify is a phenomenal
route app that will allow you to
designate apps as hibernated which is a
kind of happy medium between totally
active and totally disabled I use
greenify on my Nexus 6 to hibernate data
and battery guzzlers so that when I'm
not using them they're not off running
rampant but they're still available
there when I need them and this is
actually the number one reason why I
still root my device here's a big one
lots of folks these days love to turn
your Wi-Fi off when you're not using it
because it's using power yes that's true
it is using power but you know it uses
more power cellular radios don't just
turn your Wi-Fi off just because you're
not connected to a network your phone
can still use open networks and your
Wi-Fi radio to identify your location a
lot more quickly than say a GPS can I
say a GPS because that's what we all
have in our devices assisted GPS it uses
GPS signal and some
from your cell radios to help identify
your location if your Wi-Fi is off your
phone has to rely on just a GPS which is
your cell radios and your GPS signal to
find you when if it were on Wi-Fi it
could find you more quickly more often
than not and the battery that you would
lose by leaving it on is pretty
negligible plus it could also save you a
ton of data if you're in range of a
network that you've used before while
we're talking about our data usage opera
max is an app that is surprisingly well
designed it gives you a ton of control
over the data consumption on your phone
like many other apps in this vein opera
max uses a VPN to funnel all of your
traffic through compress it and then get
it back to your device resulting in far
lower data usage this is a godsend for
those of you who aren't on unlimited
plans with your carrier you can even
allow or restrict access on a per app
basis which is actually kind of cool
ultimately it amounts to a non-trivial
amount of data savings which could mean
the difference between going over your
data cap and staying comfy right under
that ceiling that's all the tips that
I've got for you right now if you have
questions or comments feel free to give
me a shout either down below or over on
Twitter at mark B otherwise you can like
this video if you enjoyed it you can
subscribe to get a head of lettuce
delivered to your doorstep every
Thursday evening and you should also of
course be kind to each other and I will
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
