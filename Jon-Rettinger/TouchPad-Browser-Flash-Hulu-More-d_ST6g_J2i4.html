technobuffalo here and today we are
taking a look in web browsing on the
brand's new HP TouchPad let's get
started so one of the most important
things that I use the touchpad for any
tablet in general is web browsing it's
great for consuming media and it's great
for checking out your favorite websites
like for example technobuffalo calm what
you've got open right here so you're
probably familiar with the user
interface it's a deck of cards type you
I you can scroll through different cars
on have anything else open here but if I
were to say open the app store or the
app catalog it open it up at a new card
and you swipe through cards you just
pick the one you want and open it up and
you can have the stack of cards as well
I can see I've got two different
websites open so we'll go and go into
TechnoBuffalo you can see what it looks
like when you scroll scrolling is very
smoothly takes advantage of the Qualcomm
dual-core chip pinch-to-zoom is very
smooth as well notice it's no delay no
lag your little tap action there as well
there's an effect we touch this free to
get a little ripple serve no right weird
on this sometimes they like it some time
to find it very annoying but it is there
and this is a full flash capable browser
and you can see I've got some flash
content up and running the sink here on
the side is flash that's not overly
excited join flash content you can see
how things look though on a regular site
what if you want to view flash and video
let me go ahead and show you what that
looks like and let's jump into let's say
YouTube Hogan let's just finish loading
I should also mention that there is a
gesture area across the panel's of each
side depending on how you have it
orientated so you can swipe up and you
can get access to those cards because we
were talking about otherwise there is a
physical home button here on the bottom
alright so let's go ahead and go to
youtube and this is not YouTube mobile
this is the real deal youtube I'm gonna
go in and do it refresh here is the
Youtube channel of course to go ahead
and see what a flash video looks like
and then we'll try everyone's favorite
flash site hulu and so you can get Joe
hulu own while using your touchpad every
time i say touchpad keep the think they
want to touch it and if you do decide
you want to touch your tablet which i'm
sure you will you will have finger
lower the back of this guy is like a
fingerprint magnet and I saved that a
lot for a lot of advice but this one
really is that sort of piano black
you're going to have fingerprints all
over this all right so YouTube is the
loading and this is no funny mobile
version where it opens up at a nap this
is native YouTube just as you find on
your desktop browser so you can see it's
doing a little spinny thing there and
it's getting ready to play now it's come
play I think a pre-roll ad on touchpad
unboxing actually it looks really really
good this is probably the best
implementation of / that I've seen there
really isn't much stuttering you could
very easily watch a video here which
full screen flash without any difficulty
at all and you give access to all the
same controller you'd have otherwise
really just a nice implementation of
flash I give HP credit I'm sure they
worked very closely with Adobe here to
make sure everything worked well and it
does work very well doesn't appear to be
a stutter even on full screen here it
works very nicely to get the same for a
scrubber bar that you get on regular
YouTube so go ahead and close that here
go ahead and reorient it yeah and swipe
up alright so we saw what that looks
like and if you want to get rid of
something here on deck of cards you just
flip it off the screen we're going to
swipe that off the screen open up a new
web browser here and let's try hulu and
see if you can get yo hulu own i will
say to the keyboard here is really nice
i love having a full road numbers across
the top i didn't realize how handy that
was going to be so hulu.com go ahead and
hit enter let's see what we got we got
it cue it up so we looked like it's
going to play we've been fooled before
yeah hulu on other devices i know some
android devices to it looks like you're
gonna be ready to go they're trying to
play boom you can't play so we'll try to
click from friday night lights and let's
see if we get a hulu hulud you go who
dance which i suppose like a who love
dance my jokes are awful day
the holiday weekend guys come on i'm
making this video because i love it
looks like what's loading are we going
to have some playing action this i need
like a some sort of dramatic drum roll
here to say let's say be a death roll
are we gonna be playing it's getting
there thinking about it boom it is fully
playing hulu is compatible with the HP
TouchPad so if you're looking for a big
selling point as to why you might want
to pick up a touchpad over another
device this is probably really
compelling reason you can watch hulu
content right on the touchpad as we'll
see here in just a minute actually does
look kinda nice you can watch videos you
can watch movies TV shows because all
that would probably qualify as as videos
here so we got an ad that's a getting
ready to play resumed in 30 seconds so
it's going um see those you guys going
on here opened up a new card by
accidents go ahead and go back to the
hulu card and it is off and running to
the races so go ahead and close out of
this everything else is about as you'd
expect on a browser things just worked
very nicely i'm pretty impressive
touchpad browsing overall certainly I
don't think the screen is a sensitive to
some android tablet for the ipad that
i've used this is a tablet i could def
get used to using on a daily basis so if
you're looking to maybe get a touchpad
and you weren't sure if you wanted one
hope for this video helped all the ton
more feature videos coming up soon I am
jon rettinger from technobuffalo and
I'll see in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
