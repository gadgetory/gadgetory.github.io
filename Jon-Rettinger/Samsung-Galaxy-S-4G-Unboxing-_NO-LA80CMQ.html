TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the t-mobile Galaxy S 4G this is a
variation on their initial galaxy s
device the vibrance all done up in 4G
clothing which is going to add a bit of
nuances and some great new features
we'll go through all those in just a
minute in the meantime let's go ahead
and dig in
of course for any phone unboxing we will
bring in the big ol unnecessarily large
knife to cut this package this is going
to be released on February 23rd for
$199.99 on a two-year contract and of
course we'll get to all the specs and
thirsts thank goodness you're going to
go ahead and hack into the package see
we got and still you guys think it's
always a joke when I say not cut off the
finger I'm still skeptical every time
I'm going to indeed hack off a finger so
let's say we got in here we gotta still
continue the package of cutting trend
cut me papers live alright and there's
the device go ahead and pull that out
pull that out off camera so phone number
on there anything alright
4G and this time it's not avatar
featured it is inception a pretty good
movie actually so there is a picture of
the galaxy s4 G on the front we've got
some spec information on the side it's
got that typical t-mobile box now with
the gap in the middle and then some
little bit about it on the back so this
is probably a good time to actually run
through some of the specs on this guy
and I'll show you what they all are once
we take the phone out so it does have
the Galaxy S stuff do we see in the past
four inch Super AMOLED screen and I'll
give you more details on that this guy
does have Android 2.2 which is nice for
a Galaxy S Tobias certainly they've
struggled to get that onto their phones
5 megapixel camera it's got 802 11 B G
and n so rockin the same one gigahertz
hummingbird processor which is
we fast just 1 quart and it's got a 16 i
1650 rather milliamp hour battery up
from the 1500 milliamp-hour battery
found in the vibrant of course the big
news is access to t-mobile's 21 plus
HSPA network all right we'll go through
more specs as you look at the phone so
here is the phone itself looks very
similar and feels very similar although
I think without the battery to the
vibrant push it off to the side see us
we're going to get in the box
I bet you guys can guess though what's
gonna be in here we've got some
information which I don't think
anybody's really going to read but there
you have it so you've got your wall
adapter got your zooming micro USB
charging cable pair of there is your
memory card so I assume as an adapter
for it it is a micro SD adapter there's
a micro SD card in there we'll check the
size of that got a pair of stereo
headphones with a microphone and that is
about it pretty standard stuff for a box
I don't see a battery in there maybe the
batteries in the phone is just weight
lighter now um okay so let's go ahead
and pull this thing out of the bag
No there definitely is battery in there
but I can say that now because I already
said there wasn't all right so let's
peel this off I know you guys hate the
stuff on the screen
what's the same here on the back if I
can get that plastic off come on boom
alright so let's recap some of the specs
and sort of get more into detail on the
device itself so as I mentioned it does
have a four inch Super AMOLED screen
that's four inches measured diagonal
that's Super AMOLED what that's going to
get you our darker darks richer colors
and less wash out in direct sunlight
instead of putting the touchscreen
technology this is of course a
capacitive touch screen instead of
putting it sort of on the top of the
glass that's on the phone is actually
integrated into the glass and that's one
of the ways that you get sort of that
bright popping color a little bit of
Super AMOLED trivia the resolution again
is 480 by 800 again Android 2.2 which is
nice for samsung devices of course
you've got TouchWiz
top their own skin the camera on the
hump of this guy is a 5-megapixel job
which is going to take video as well at
1280 by 720 which is 720p and it's gonna
do all that at 30 frames per second 802
11 B G and n are on board for your data
transfer again the one gigahertz single
core Humminbird processor 6 - 1650
milliamp hour battery 1650 million
photos trying to say and access to 21 +
HSPA network so we also have on the
front now some that makes us different
than the outgoing vibrant which is
t-mobile's current galaxy s device
you got a front-facing camera it is a
VGA resolution for video calls typical
Android buttons across the bottom they
are capacitive buttons as well but you
can't see them they're not like hidden
they only light up sometimes that can be
really annoying menu button home button
back button search button on the left
hand side and volume rocker up and down
on the right hand side you've got your
power and a lock button top microUSB
charging port the little door slide that
find that I know I need sometimes on Tim
some devices but it is there and as a
word of warning if you're trying to
charge this sometimes that little door
gets like stuck like half way think it's
all the way back you can't figure out
why your power cord keeps falling out
push that door all the way back make
sure to snap into place and then your
3.5 millimeter headset jack bottom got
your microphone and that's about it back
of the device sort of has a cool grey
effect to it it is plastic let's go
ahead and pry this out and see if got a
SIM card in there what our memory
situation is as far as expansion back is
pretty easy to take off so t-mobile did
indeed include SIM card let's see what
our memory is going to ship with it's
got this little spring-loaded mechanism
which is always nice reading these cards
out and is going to ship with 16 gigs of
internal storage and I believe there is
one gig already onboard see how about
just 17 and then there is that 1615
milliamp hour battery that we were
talking about and again just a plastic
back here so let's put this on let's go
ahead and give it a first boot up of
course we'll be testing t-mobile's 4G
network
a little bit further and doing a full
rundown and battery tests of the device
maybe even putting a head to head and
some other galaxy s devices so galaxy s4
G I don't have a vibrant here but what I
do have is a TT version the captivate we
can see if there's any sort of size
difference here between these two let's
say cousins they definitely look similar
same size screens a little different
form factors though you get the almost
Chrome with meringue and rounded edges
here on the galaxy s4 G as opposed to
the more box you look I'm taking the
stand point it's probably what you guys
care about most looks almost identical
adding that 4G radio does not appear to
add any weight so I guess that 4G radio
doesn't have any calories in it so here
we go using Google's locations is
probably going to look very similar to
what you guys are used to I'll go ahead
and set this up and in the next video I
will give you a full demonstration of
speed and what we can expect from
t-mobile 4G network so for now I am John
Breton jure from TechnoBuffalo reminding
you at the Galaxy S 4G from t-mobile
will be available February 23rd for just
shy of two hundred dollars with a
two-year contract see you next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
