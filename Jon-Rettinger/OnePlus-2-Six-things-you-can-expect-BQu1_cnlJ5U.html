saying it from technobuffalo and today
we're going to be talking about the
oneplus 2 1 plus his new flagship
smartphone will be unveiled on July 27
just a few days away from now and we
thought it'd be great to go over a
couple of things we can expect from the
highly anticipated flagship device the
oneplus one was our favorite phone from
last year so we have some high
expectations for the follow up here are
six things that we can expect from the
1+2 number one is a new invite system
last year when a 1 + 1 launch an invite
system was implemented to ensure the
company could keep up with demand but it
wasn't without its problems as some
customers waited months and months to
receive an invite making for a very
unpleasant experience this year 1 plus
is apparently doing something different
with their invite system for those who
don't have the time to check social
media and enter giveaways you can simply
give one plus your email and the company
will send you an invite as soon as
they're available the other change is 1
plus will also offer physical invite
cards which means out for you or someone
you know purchases the 1+2 you'll
receive physical cards to share with
friends this should speed up the process
up significantly and build a community
and hyper on the incoming flagship it
sucks that an invite system is even
necessary but it allows 1 + 2 better
operate and serve its customers which is
verging on cult status I'm among them
number two is a higher price tag the
oneplus one was a bargain last year
coming in at just 299 for the base model
and 349 for the more premium 64 gigabyte
sandstone black model for the oneplus
two to make an impact it'll need to
match that great value or at least be in
the same vicinity unfortunately because
the device is coming with improved specs
we already know it'll come at a higher
cost 1 plus CEO Pete law has already
confirmed that the oneplus 2 will cost
less than four hundred fifty dollars but
how much is the question if the base
model starts at around that price it'll
be way out of impulse buy territory
which is what initially made the 1+1 so
attractive I can justify buying an
unlock device for 299 or even 349 but if
that price is raised by a significant
amount then suddenly the 1+2 is just one
of many well spec phones there are a lot
of affordable flagships on the market
right now and if the 1+2 doesn't hold
this advantage over some of the bigger
companies vying for attention it becomes
more difficult for one plus C compete
I'm curious to hear what you guys think
about the higher price tag so may
should have let us know in the comments
down below number three are better specs
with a higher price tag at least we're
getting better specs one plus has
already revealed the majority of what to
expect we know that the one plus two
will come equipped with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor four gigabytes
of ddr4 ram a 3300 milliamp battery a 13
megapixel camera and USB see it's also
going to pack a fingerprint reader which
we'll talk about in a bit additionally
the device will come running an improved
version of oxygen OS which one plus
introduced earlier this year now those
specs alone make the 1+2 a very
promising device of course there are
other flagship devices such as the One
m9 the galaxy s6 LG g4 with similar
high-end specs but we're also waiting
for similar devices such as the Moto X
the galaxy note 5 and the iphone 6s some
of the things we don't know yet is the
screen size and resolution as well as
storage options rumors claimed the 1+2
could feature a 5.5 or 5.7 inch display
with either a 1080p or qHD resolution as
for storage options we're expecting the
1+2 to offer 32 and 64 gigabyte options
though we're not sure if it will feature
expandable storage number 4 would be the
fingerprint sensor now this is something
that I truly appreciate and I'm glad
that one plus is adding this technology
to its flagship device 1 plus confirmed
in June that the oneplus 2 will feature
a fingerprint sensor that is quote and
quote done right it will apparently be
refined and lightning quick even faster
and more accurate than Apple's touch ID
1 plus also mentioned that with the
oneplus two one quick tap on this sensor
will take you right to your home screen
which sounds like a nice touch
fingerprint sensors are becoming
increasingly popular for things like
security and mobile payments so it's
great to c 1 plus recognizing how
important the technology is number 5 is
a new camera module now we're expecting
the 1+2 to feature an all-new 13
megapixel camera with an F 2 point 0
aperture and laser autofocus along with
a 5 megapixel front-facing cameras for
selfies 1 + CEO Pete law has already
posted pictures online comparing the
oneplus tues camera to the iphone 6 and
the galaxy s6 and results are promising
so far we're really impressed with the
quality and we're super excited to see
more we'll definitely do a camera
comparison between the oneplus 2 and
other flagship devices in the future so
be sure to hit that subscribe button to
keep up to date with
all of our videos number six is the
all-new design now there have been quite
a few rumors saying that the 1+2 might
feature a more refined design I
personally thought the oneplus one was
built two flagship standers despite the
lower price tag but with the 1+2 we're
likely going to see something that's
even more premium we should also expect
new style swap covers that will
hopefully make its way to consumers
adding some personalization to the mix 1
plus is hosting a poll on their forums
which allows its registered users to
vote for their favorite style swap cover
materials from bamboo ceramic denim
leather and more we're assuming that the
options that are getting the higher
number of votes will be available to buy
at some point but we'll see what happens
one plus initially wanted to offer style
swap options for the original one plus
one but it eventually had to shutter the
feature due to manufacturing issues now
let's hope that doesn't happen again it
was an added bonus 1 plus ceop Lau
confirmed plans for another new
smartphone launching later this year
though he wouldn't reveal anything else
when the de vent planned for next week
perhaps we'll hear details then though I
wouldn't be surprised to see the
company's event solely dedicated to the
flagship one plus two if a second phone
is indeed on its way I would expect it
to come with more water down specs which
would in turn be more affordable but
we'll see and there you guys have it six
things we could expect from the 1+2 now
July 27 is just right around the corner
and we'll be sure to keep you guys on
the loop for anything one plus two
related over a technobuffalo calm if you
guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up and we will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
