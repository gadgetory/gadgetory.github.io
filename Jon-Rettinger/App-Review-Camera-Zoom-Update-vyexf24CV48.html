TechnoBuffalo here one of the glaring
omissions from the iphone is the lack of
any sort of digital zoom for the camera
application so bring in the App Store
which had an application called camera
zoom which i reviewed earlier in the
month and admittedly my review may not
have been the nicest in the world I
might have mentioned that you'd be
better off spending the 99 cents wiping
your butt than buying this app because
quite simply it did not work it was not
three point 0 compatible at all you
opened it up and it would just go back
to the home screen it wouldn't do
anything well it's been updated still 99
cents so to be fair I thought that I
would do an updated review on the camera
zoom and show you how it works at least
now I can show you actually doing
something instead of just crashing go
ahead and open it up loads and you get a
pretty simple interface it's go ahead
and put something in front of this you
can take pictures up here's the palm
treo pro so you'll notice that you've
got now a zoom bar right across the
bottom and you can quite obviously zoom
right in now what I do like about this
is that the fact you can still zoom if
you're using a 3gs you still get the
autofocus if you tap to it see you tap
and it'll still do the autofocus I
didn't go ahead and just stamp your
picture we better push that back down
and your pictures will show up right in
the bottom left-hand corner that I will
launch your pictures sort of digital
zooms up let me open that up and show
you what it looks like and I will tell
you that a digital zoom definitely does
pixelate the images a little bit it's
not bad if you want to zoom in on
something you just realize you're using
it with your camera phone it's not going
to be that bab don't expect to blow this
thing up to poster size and hang it on
your wall and expect Ansel Adams type
photography because you're just not
going to get it especially with digital
zoom it is functional and it is usable
should be all that you should be
expecting from this so let me show you
some of the options that we have with
the application so hit the little I in
the corner now you can choose the
resolution so 320 x 480 pictures will be
saved with faster and the pleasant
blurred so yeah I want that on
fullscreen shutter means you can just
tap anywhere on the screen take pictures
kind of nice ask to save it'll ask you
if you want to save it before taking it
with your picture folder full screen
slider swipe anywhere on the screen to
zoom in and out kind of neat and I can
determine where you want the slider
position and you can tell a friend and
your feedback and surprising that the
feedback stuff wasn't there the first
time around because it would have been
quite bad and I think that their ratings
reflected the boredness of the
application and the non compatibility
with three point oh now that may have
been apple's fault not approving it that
may have been the manufacturers fault
for making a bad application either way
the end result was an awful user
experience and when you're shopping for
applications in the App Store you expect
a positive user experience or at least
you expect to get something functional
when you download so guys that's it just
a real quick re review of camera zoom
it's a 9910 application that i can now
say actually works and does function as
a camera zoom and fills and sort of one
of the holes that the iphone OS left out
and we guys hope you enjoyed for
