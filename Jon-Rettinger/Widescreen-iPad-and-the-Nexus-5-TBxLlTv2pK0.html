welcome back to another episode of rumor
roundup this is the show where we round
up all the rumors from the wide world of
technology of this week we've got rumors
swirling of a $99 nexus 7
we've got widescreen iPads is the HTC
One X 5 actually the Nexus 5 and is the
MacBook Air and MacBook Pro going on a
diet and getting even thinner this is
rumor roundup let's go and get started
why it's Green iPad is coming according
to analyst Paul Muller he's citing three
sources inside of Apple that's saying a
widescreen iPad is on the way and is not
talking about the upcoming iPad Mini the
iPhone 5 just went pretty much 16 by 9
and the iPad is still 4 by 3 the
examiner as well as also had sources
inside of app will confirm what Mueller
has been reporting I was a huge
proponent of the iPhone going widescreen
I've used widescreen tablets and I
actually prefer the four by three aspect
ratio on the iPad over some of the
widescreen options that say I think it's
bad a personal preference I like the way
it feels in the hand so what do you guys
think could have possibly iPad 4 or
newer iPad go widescreen would that make
the size actually go from 9.7 inch to
10.1 would you like a longer iPad or did
you like the size that rat right now
would you think the iPad Mini is
actually going to be wise for you that
would be interesting to see I love to
hear what you guys think about it I do
think though that we are going to see
widescreen depending on what Apple's got
in the lineup but definitely widescreen
is going to be coming it's a wave of the
future black bars be gone it's time for
widescreen so one of my favorite tablets
of the past year was the Nexus 7 I love
the way it worked I love the simplicity
of it and I love the size it looks like
it's gonna get even better it's $1.99
price point is gonna shave off the one
at the beginning
according to digit times we've got a $99
version of the Nexus 7 coming before the
holidays they are saying that actually
an updated version Nexus 7 is going to
be coming it'll be thinner have a
smaller bezel depending on different
sizes we'll have one that's going to
keep the same price point at $1.99
probably larger storage
option and one that's going to come in
at 99 bucks which would absolutely fly
off the shelves then $10 puts it in
competition with some really low-end
products but the awesomeness of tegra3
couple would jelly bean would make that
thing absolutely fly
I could pick up a $99 Nexus 7 now II
might go to holiday gift for everybody I
know that tablet was absolutely awesome
I 99 bucks would really get to that
impulse buy price point I think they
would sell between 1 and 1.5 bajillion
so much like supermodels thin is in
according to I fix it the MacBook Air
and MacBook Pro models are getting even
thinner not by much but definitely a
little bit so rumor has them going from
point 4 millimeters in the display at
they are right now to 0.25 millimeters
not much what that's gonna do is prevent
keyboard mark they're showing up on the
screen if you use an Apple laptop you
know you open it up and you see all
kinds of grids from your keyboard now
people don't like that not gonna be a
giant noticeable difference it'll
probably be a very quiet update it's not
gonna come with a huge keynote but it's
nice to see the already thin MacBook Air
and the already very thin MacBook Pro
Retina display getting even thinner are

Google's answer to the galaxy note we
may see it actually debut as the Nexus 5
GSM Arenas claiming that they've got a
pretty good source saying it's going to
go pure Android it's going to shed its
see why and bring us a very native naked
Android on a very large screen something
refresh your memory I want to spec to
this guy are going to pack it's believed
to pack a 1080p display and the new
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset could also
feature 12 megapixel rear facing camera
2 megapixel front facing camera LTE 64
gigs of internal storage and a 2500
milliamp hour battery it's gonna have a
lot of stuff crammed inside of that
package I would love to see a larger
Nexus device I loved in Nexus phones

updates I would love to see a giant
phone I love big phones five inches
