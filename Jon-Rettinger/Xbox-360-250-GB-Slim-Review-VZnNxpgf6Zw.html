John retina from TechnoBuffalo here with
a full review and overview for you of
the Xbox 360 250 gigabyte model which I
nicknamed me the Xbox 360 slim a full
review of the console via bit exhaustion
of combing unnecessary since it's the
same Xbox experience that you've been
getting for a few years now Xbox Live
plays the same the games you will play
and look the same look at the new
features and what's different here sort
of below the surface and will I guess on
the surface itself so we're going to
focus on the aesthetics and the
components of the new hardware so what
start with what's new and that is the
processor first it's using a new CPU and
GPU but the 45 nanometer die which is
people are always been asking you know
what's the difference that you carry
about the system on chip why is the
client help well if ever heard of the
red ring of death or experienced it
yourself you're going to be very
thankful for this certainly the reason
the older Xbox have failed so much and
because the GPU have so many other
components will pull it to the circuit
board for a number of reasons but
primarily heat so in sort of with this
new die a new robust plinks it's an
expectation is that the console will
have a much much much longer shelf life
for component life to hot if you will so
next the big difference here is actually
50 gigabyte hard drive
previously only available on special
edition Xbox 360 elite so that's view in
here as well I'm sorry interestingly
enough the hard drive itself is the same
as the partner as the outgoing models as
far as how it connects to the console
itself but use the new enclosure so it's
not compatible with the other Xbox 360
model so you've seen the older ones
looked a lot bigger about the hard drive
itself inside of that case is the same
case itself has changed it is still a
factory connection we now have Wi-Fi
built in an 802 11 n and then Wi-Fi it's
actually very reliable except a really
nice signal I was a bit worried about
gaming over Wi-Fi it's been working
perfectly it smooths fluid it's really
been no different than my wife actually
I have the previous Xbox 360 but you now
have two more USB ports or a total of
five you can now not use actually memory
units if you rely on memory units
again on Xbox Live or save your games
those are going to be gone if you want
to transfer you data from your old Xbox
360 to your new one you can use a thumb
drive or they have a dedicate dranks for
cable there's also a dedicated connect
port on the back and what connect is if
you don't know is previously product
installed it's Xbox new motion gaming
system it doesn't use controllers you
would actually become the controller
itself now people have been wondering
why isn't dead kick export when
Microsoft sends that all it's about 260
models would work with Kinect well the
answer is pretty simple I'll connect the
draw the decent amount of power and as
the interface with the console is USB
base but the USB itself can't pull
enough electricity from the console so
it's going to need a dedicated power
supply so what the connect port does
actually puts enough power out to power
connected outer zone power supply so
sort of the long story short if you have
a new console you won't have to plug in
your connects into an outlet if you have
an older Xbox 360 console you plug into
USB port you also have to plug into out
sort of this short version of that
I'm not certain there's a new design as
well it's lighter it's smaller it's
certainly much quieter and the fans sort
of kick in a little bit sooner to keep
the console and much cooler from the
design standpoint they sort of we went
the way of the original PlayStation 3 I
think we got surfing out with glossy
black displays opposed than that we had
previously
we have touch sensitive buttons as
opposed to the physical buttons from
before so for power and eject and the
system itself looks a bit more
streamlined I've done overviews of these
in the past we've sort of seen the
console hands-on but sort of looking at
it now it looks a bit more modern it
looks less blocky and it's smaller power
brick makes it less cumbersome to use
and to plug into a component system like
I have right here so overall the console
has been pretty reliable and a couple
weeks I've got a third part to do a
reliability test for the short period of
time but I will say it does run quieter
and it does appear to run into cooler as
well
I can't fry an egg on it like I couldn't
on the older xbox360 models so is that
those reasons enough to upgrade probably
not my paper working xbox360 model I'll
take the peg reason to run out and buy
the new one unless you have to have your
on fire one of those features I just
mentioned
totally plugging in connects not to be
that big a deal soon you have the
outlets for it this one just looks a
little bit nicer it looks a bit newer
but functionality wise you're going to
get pretty much the same experience this
isn't meant to ignite a ps3 versus Xbox
360 flame work we've got a console work
series that covers a lot of that I'll
put a link to those videos down below in
the sidebar
do you want to sort of rage about your
console you prefer now but the
experience here for the Xbox 360 twin 50
gigabyte model it's pretty similar what
we've had with other Xbox 360 is just in
a new package hey guys what do you think
are you gonna upgrade now that freedom
kind of curious to what you have to say
I'm John revenue from TechnoBuffalo I'm
not seeing the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
