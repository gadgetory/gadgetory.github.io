pisode of rettinger drifts I'm your host
Jon Rangers the show I just talked about
anything's going on in my mind I am just
freshly back from Northern California
for the apple event I thought to talk
about what it's like to be at the event
what I saw that you might not have seen
on the stream when I think about the two
new phones and the watch that was going
to release him very soon this renders
riffs let's start riffing so for the
past two years technobuffalo has gone to
the Worldwide Developer Conference but
we've never been to a product launch
there's a very first time attending
serve a big product announcement of
course Apple ends up announcing the
iphone 6 the iphone 6 plus and the Apple
watch really gonna try hard to not call
it the iWatch was a pretty cool
experience to be there to see everything
get announced the see sort of the whole
spectacle that goes on with apple event
so a few cool things that you might not
have seen I'll talk about my opinions on
the phones and devices in a minute so
you guys saw the live stream or at least
while the live stream was up I heard
there were tons of issues with it we
were sitting pretty close to the front
on the right hand side of the stage when
tip cook came up and he used first
announced the iphone 6 he showed a video
sort of announce it first and then he
came out afterwards talked about the
phone what i always thought he did is
always thought he went off stage I
thought he just sort of went behind and
that's where he waited till the video is
over turns out he actually went to the
very right side to stay deep into the
shadows which was right in front of us
so while the video was playing I was
just watching him to see what his
reaction was and as the video was
playing he was fist-pumping he's getting
all excited he's doing thumbs up yet and
no one could really see him at all so
it's kind of cool to see you least like
his passion for the products the same
thing when the Apple watch got an ounce
which has been three years in making so
it's probably happy to finally talk
about it not be like oh this can't talk
about it anymore when he first came out
on stage to you could clearly see the
outline of a big phone in this pocket so
that kind of gave it away but of course
we didn't know until they announced what
was going to happen well it is insane at
these Apple events I've been to huge
product launches for really every other
manufacturer accompanying you know
Google we've been to everything Apple
puts a lot of hype into it and I kind of
call that the you know the hype machine
or it's a little bit of a PR and sort of
the mystique I guess that Apple tries to
promote for themselves whether it worked
or not as a whole other discussion but
there definitely was a bit of
electricity there for Apple was going to
announce so it's kind of cool to be
there people stood up when he announced
the iWatch everybody got excited when he
said or the Apple watch everybody out
excited when he said you know there's
one more thing haven't done that for a
while the stage was historic it was
where steve jobs and build the very
first Macintosh was where the imac also
gotten veiled so it's kind of cool to
sort of introduce a new product line on
that same stage which is probably why
they did it I just a lot of excitement
was there is a mad rush afterwards to
get into the hands on that big white
cube Garrett building was just almost
like a small apple store oh they were
doing hands-on with all the new products
I thinking of new products let me talk
about them suckas so iphone 6 iphone 6
plus we pretty much knew exactly what
they were going to be with very very few
surprises I would have liked spec for
spectra to be exactly the same just
different sizes like the ipad mini and
the ipad air but that was not the case
so the iphone 6 nice addition bigger
screen 4.7 still 720p which i think
thumbs down for that in digital image
stabilization I would have loved
obviously to have the oh is that the 6
plus has packed into that phone up if
those you guys are thinking about
ordering to have had a chance to hold it
we have hands-on with two videos you can
link to them right down below you can
see all the stuff we did the phone feels
really really nice in the hand the
curved glass err on the side make
swiping really easy so that was really
kind of a nice think this feel but it
feels like any other 4.7 inch foam on a
really nice build quality there's
strangest the iOS serve on a bigger
screen the 6 plus what I thought is the
most interesting the sort of something
that's really really knew I liked at
1080p I would have really liked for them
to had a 2k display nice day of optical
and stabilization I would have liked
more name megapixels I would have really
liked wireless charging maybe they're
saving that for the 6 plus or the 6s
plus which is kind of a long name anyway
so I we didn't get everything and I
think everybody wanted I would get
finally get NFC what and everybody's
saying androids had four years of course
they have had for years the mobile
payment to the Apple pay was really nice
but it was just weird to see
iOS on such a ginormous screen look at
the hands on video just strange and
seeing it rotate to was weird too it
rotates all the way around depending on
how you had the phone oriented which
seemed strange it also was really
sensitive the folks in the office were
asking how the phone felt it felt heavy
or not didn't feel heavy to me at all I
like big bones with felt very natural in
my hand if you like big phones try
picking up if you have access to one the
one plus one at sort of close the same
dimensions it felt very very similar to
that device you want to get a sense
first with weight and screen size on
that kind of thing so the one plus is
1080p screen whereas started 1 plus the
6 plus is 1080p whereas a 6 is 720p we
had them side by side to getting a seen
the video they didn't look that
different they don't look that different
at all so don't want that screen
resolution thing be a big determining
factor for you I think the big
difference for a lot of people is
getting good o is take a lot of pictures
you might really want that but it's
still a giant phone to carry for not
used to it so I don't know bear that in
mind chances are if you watch this video
you have a cell phone and you're
probably picking between one of the four
major carriers and you know that they
are gouging you want to take a little
bit about ting with ting there are no
plans at all your unforced to pick a
plan based on arbitrary number that you
think you might use each month they only
charge for what you use each month that
means there's way less waste you simply
pay for what you use leave the service
whenever you want with no fees at all
there's nothing hidden there either
there's no admin fees or weird sketchy
charges ting bills are simple to
understand and they only charge your
usage plus six bucks per device plus tax
each month and that is it the mobile
phone experience includes is a ton of
confusion and powerlessness you know
plans tend to be littered with hidden
fees steep penalties arbitrary rules and
just stupid and necessary premiums and
phone companies tend to be totally
unapproachable if ever tried to dial 611
on your phone you get somebody on the
line please hold we're going to transfer
you for a minute so bottom line
consumers are overpaying and they're
being underserved and if you feel
frustrated underserved you've got to
give Tim wireless a shot current
customers with ting will likely see a
huge decrease in their monthly bill go
check out the rape page at technobuffalo
ting com to see what your new lower
monthly bill is going to be and if
you're ready to get started and sort of
move on to a better
some use a promo code technobuffalo ting
calm and save 25 bucks on your device
purchase or get twenty-five dollars in
ting service credit towards your first
monthly bill pretty sweet deal and the
Apple watch it's square if you just
showed me a picture that the screen off
I would be like oh look at samsung's new
gear and that would be the end of it I
really do like they did with the digital
crown turn into analog was nice that's a
cool thing was very intuitive the OS
looks super smooth what it's going to do
is kind of neat how often I'm going to
send my heartbeat to people or just send
notes or how close you have to be they
don't know what battery life is going to
be all the rumors gonna be just about a
day I love they had sort of the magsafe
and duck of charging i would have want
that on the phone the band designs were
absolutely awesome the three versions
make very little sense to me you've got
the Apple watch Apple watch sport and
the apple watch edition first of all
who's going to buy gold watch you're
probably an upgrade every year nobody
with that price and that's going to be
it's probably to me super expensive the
support one was really nice but it's
thicker than the regular apple watch and
all the band options were really nice i
think the regular normal it's named
Apple watch is probably going to be the
sweet spot it looks nice but I think I
want to hear more about it before I make
fun of students on it I really would
have liked a round screen similar what
we see on the Moto 360 I think people
hold Apple up to a very high design
standard of course the what it could
look like can change we now and release
but it's still going to be square a
little better than I would have liked to
the usefulness of it is still kind of
yet to be seen now foods you guys are
worried about left-handers usage
evidently you can just put the watch on
the other way and Lori orient itself so
it would be good for left-handers to or
someone likes to wear the watch on the
right hand is post they're left over
although I loved thing at the event it
was really cool was fun to see
colleagues at school sort of see a brand
new product at announcer time i go back
to sort of see that first announcement
ever we do a flashback friday on the
original apple lodged in six years a bit
cooler i was there and that was sort of
really fun to be at it was cool to see
everybody up close and personal was fun
to see you two on stage and serve all
the celebrities that were there kind of
geeking out a little bit inside to see
Steve Wozniak and Rupert Murdoch was
behind me I was really kind of cool to
see all those folks and I guys that was
all my thoughts and impressions there
was a lot of things to talk about what
do you guys think about the iphone 6 the
iphone 6 plus how many times did I call
the apple watch the iWatch I want to
