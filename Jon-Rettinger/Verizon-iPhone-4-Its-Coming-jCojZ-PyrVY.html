that I just put on the tripod zoomed in
on my face and sets a record quite a
surprise today we're gonna have a nice
little chat just you and me
and we're gonna talk about the legendary
legendary creature that may just exist
we're not talking about those deep-sea
fish with the weird lights on their
heads that they find once a year we are
talking about the mythical beast of a
technology world which really is a
Verizon CDMA capable iPhone and it looks
like we finally have one so super cheese
intros aside let's get started Verizon
iPhone rumors and videos in the past
have been like cotton candy fun to try
very little sustenance there we've heard
reports in the past from a ton different
sources that a Verizon iPhones done deal
done deal it's coming up a bit here in
the holiday season we saw it last year
before year before that it just keeps
coming however now we have some actually
substantive rumors that are turning the
cotton candy is rumor mill into more of
a hot dog rumor mill something a little
bit more tangible so The Wall Street
Journal is reporting that Verizon and
Apple have inked a deal for a CDMA
capable iPhone which is actually already
going into mass production
using a Qualcomm made CDMA chip which we
will see just after the first of the
year so after the holiday shopping
season which is in itself very
interesting previously there have been
some holdups this is what's been
reported at Verizon and Apple read of
stalemate because Verizon wanted to sell
their own music via the Rhapsody and V
cat store on the phone and Apple said
hey we're Apple no no no but evidently
they have come to some sort of middle
ground look at what Verizon's done on
Android the doctor put on their own App
Store in addition to the Android Market
so it's speculated that maybe they came
to a similar agreement with Apple and
they sort of met in the middle you can
say that would be their Appomattox
Courthouse if I can get all historic
good on you for a minute so that's
actually pretty exciting if this is
indeed a CG man
phone us customers are finally going to
have choice for carrier when it comes to
their iPhone miss Europe has choice
really
Canada has choice a lot of other place
you can go where you can pick your
carrier we've been limited here in the
US the rumor mill however does not stop
there supposedly and not surprisingly
apples hard at work on an iPhone 5 which
is going to be a different design from
the current iPhone that we have right
now it's unclear whether different
design means they don't have a big
blinking light saying don't touch here
on this line or it's a completely new
redesigned phone however speculation is
that this new redesigned phone is not
going to be the Verizon iPhone so
possibly we'll see an iPhone 5 on AT&amp;amp;T
and an iPhone 4 on Verizon yesterday
Verizon announced the new 4G network LTE
going live in 30 odd cities by the end
of the year it is not speculated that
this iPhone 4 will support the LTE
network 7 - what we saw at the first
generation iPhone not supporting 3g the
network wasn't fully rolled out yet
however once 4G is more prominent we
start getting 4G devices you are going
to be getting some tasty tasty download
speeds and a Verizon iPhone maybe just
the phone to sort of push that onto the
mainstream again much like the 3G
version did for AT&amp;amp;T so what do you guys
think about these rumors I know sort of
it's gotten a little bit crazy now we
keep hearing these over and over and
over again
however being reported by The Wall
Street Journal does add a bit of ara of
credibility to it supposedly the phone's
already in production they look very
similar to the iPhone 4 so we have now
presumably without the antenna issue and
then a new iPhone 5 coming which won't
be for Verizon I wonder if Apple is
going to be doing some sort of divergent
product line maybe the iPhone that Wall
Street Journal is reporting on it's
perhaps just a smaller tablet that would
be going to rise we've heard reports of
that in the past so I really want to
hear what you guys have to say I'm
curious quiring minds want to know what
do you think about the Verizon iPhone if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T would you jump to Verizon
if your contract is up are you very
happy with your AT&amp;amp;T service I am a very
very interesting here
you guys have to say and I wonder if
there were a Verizon iPhone if horizons
network would suffer the same issues at
18 T's and then the iPhone first
launched serve a huge influx of user
users using massive amounts of data it
would be quite interesting to see how
that held up and guys I am John Breton
