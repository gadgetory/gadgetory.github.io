charging experience even better and here
it is it's a mat that you push your
iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 down and it just
starts to charge and there's a beautiful
new interface
now it's November 2018 late November
2018 and air power is still nowhere to
be found where is the air power I mean
either way it's not a great look and for
fans is disappointing more than anything
else
Apple don't show us something until it's
actually ready to go this is not
possible
with current standards but our team
knows how to do this so look for the air
power charger next year we all know how
this story ends
the rapids history if it's ingrained in
their DNA they've made impossible
products possible but recently the past
few years even announcing things months
before they're shipping products have
had delays and even some cases are being
canceled all together so how did we get
here and know that it wasn't always this
way before we keep going I hope you guys
are enjoying the new style of video we
were having a blast making them if you
want to get notified new videos are
coming your way of course at the Bell
and obviously subscribe and I want to
give a big shout out and thank you to
this video sponsor - lean so it's
actually kind of came back into my
consciousness when it was reported that
Facebook was just storing passwords in
plain text and security is super
important and dashlane is just the best
way to keep your passwords information
secure my favorite thing about is that
they're not storing any information like
themselves nobody can ever get access to
your passwords like they don't remember
any passwords they'll do autofill for me
and perhaps right now one of the best
features don't notify you when a company
you have an account with has a breach so
you can go ahead and just change your
password pretty securely it syncs across
all your devices but it's desktop or
mobile if your passwords are always
up-to-date it works well and it keeps my
information secure which is you know
pretty important it's probably one of
the best things about dashlane is it's
it's totally free there's a premium
version though that you can try that
does give you more features if you want
to learn more link to it down below

this is a day I've been looking forward
to for two and a half years I don't know
where you were in January of 2007 when
Steve Jobs announced the very first
iPhone this is before they were started
broadcasting and streaming the event
some of you probably weren't even alive
I remember I was glued to the MacRumors
live block I had just started making
YouTube videos the iPhone was like the
next big thing had been hide for
seemingly years Steve Jobs came on stage
and said they were gonna announce three
products a widescreen iPod with touch
controls a revolutionary mobile phone
and a breakthrough internet
communications device and then he was
like it's one device it's the iPhone and
he showed it and it was amazing he
rotated and coverflow happened it was
pinching and zooming typing on all glass
screens all this stuff maybe by itself
wasn't new but together in one device
was totally unheard of and unseen and it
looked like we were looking at the
future but we were very clearly seeing
only one side of the querque what Apple
wanted us to see you wasn't till the
figures after Steve Jobs death we got
actually look you know behind that
curtain and see what was going on what's
going on was a lot of engineers sweating
profusely because that phone did not
work Steve Jobs had to follow what they
affectionately dubbed the golden path so
the phone would he crash had to open
certain apps close certain apps and
follow the set path of applications to
make sure the phone wasn't going to
crash on Satan can you imagine what have
happened if the iPhone crashed on stage
and we've seen sort of the jokes when
Syria doesn't work on stage now but
imagine if if Steve Jobs himself was
there showing pinch-zoom your cover flow
and the whole thing just crashed like
that would have taken the wind
completely out of the iPhone sales and
as it was remember the iPhone was met
with like disdain from the mobile
industry I mean famously Steve Ballmer
like laughed at it and like who's gonna
buy it it's too expensive
you had the rim CEOs at the time being
like yeah we're fine you know so that
would have only didn't credence to those
arguments so you look back on the iPhone
can realize how close it was to being a
failure before it even launched some
other kind of interesting
behind-the-scenes stuff that was going
on there was a secret Wi-Fi network that
only that demo iPhone was connected to
so nobody else would be on it and the
phone actually launched on singular
which then kind of became AT&amp;amp;T but
singular at the time brought in their
own cell phone towers and also the phone
was hard-coded to only show five parts
of service even if it wasn't to make it
look like you know it was gonna be the
bee's knees of edge and at the end of
the presentation Steve Jobs said we're
gonna be shipping these in June yeah Kim
so they announced the iPhone five months
before it shifts that pre-announcement
strategy worked it built up months and
months of hype by a time the iPhone
finally came people were lined up down
the street for it so that strategy
worked for Apple then now maybe not so
much
the biggest example on the one on
everybody's lips is air power it was
actually announced in September of 2017
with the iPhone 10 and sort of the vague
ship date of coming sometime next year
and obviously next year when to 2019 the
product has now been cancelled what it
was supposed to do is something really
cool it could wirelessly charge all of
you our Apple things without having to
have certain strike points you had a
place two products there were coils
everywhere you could drop your wireless
charging air pods you put your Apple
watch your iPhone anywhere on the pad
and it would work it was a really cool
idea and not that that we'd ever seen
exists and turns out we hadn't seen it
for a reason Apple was fighting physics
in the heat associated with those coils
and could never get the product to
market one example that you might have
forgotten about was the white iPhone 4
was actually announced in June of 2010
and didn't come out for ten months
almost a year of delays before I finally
hit the market and really just before
the iPhone 4s was released funny side
note on the white iPhone 4 I actually
had a white iPhone 4 right after he was
announced it wasn't a real from Apple I
just had colored plates put on to make
it look like the real white iPhone and I
was had an eye robot event and the
reporter saw the phone and asked me
about it I made up on the spot a
completely bogus story about Apple not
being able to match paint just to see if
they would publish it and about 40
minutes later pictures went up of me
holding those white iPhone that the guy
thought he was super stealthily taking I
laugh to myself so you can look at the
home pod it was announced the WWDC 2017
was supposed to come out in December of
that year but didn't actually dip
getting released until two months later
in February 2018 but this new trend
didn't just apply to Apple's hardware
happens to software to hook a group of
FaceTime it was supposed to be the
flagship feature at least one of them on
iOS 12 and Apple said it was gonna be
coming in September of 2018 and I wasn't
till a month later in October where I
finally saw a mass release even most
recently you can look at Apple's
announcement of Apple TV plus an apple
arcade announcing they're coming in the
fall
so now Apple's announcing products six
months before they are set to finally
debut
it's a very easy argument to be like
just Apple don't announce stuff early
but sometimes not just Apple companies
have to so again to get ahead of leak to
get ahead of FCC filing it's important
it's also sometimes an opportunity for
Apple or any company sort of plant their
flag behind the technology what do you
think about sort of the circular Mac Pro
and now it's obviously way earlier
before it shipped it was Apple saying we
believe in this new Thunderbolt
technology you can adopt it now and know
that Apple is going to be behind it and
also it's just a straight-up build up
hype people get excited for something
new and also it holds customers from
perhaps making a purchase Apple
announced the new iPhone people probably
weren't running out to go by the new
generation blackberry pearl that was out
they wanted to wait to see what Apple
was going to do so sort of tapping into
perhaps you know that pent-up demand the
people who would say this would never
happened under Steve Jobs did convenient
untrue argument there were plenty of
product and receive jobs that had
similar issues you can look at the cube
and how that was was cracking you can
look at dot Mac you can look at the the
Lisa the original Macintosh there was a
ton of delays and products that never
shipped or came out and were crazy
expensive Steve Jobs was a mortal man
and he made mistakes oh that's a very
short-sighted and just factually untrue
argument the big point an overlying
theme this whole video is can you still
trust Apple or can you trust Apple at
all and I think that answer is still yes
you can still trust what they say and to
ship things when they say it but Apple
is not infallible you know take
everything with a grain of salt products
an ounce it seems too good to be true
apples made a history of their entire
company of shipping products that
generally have seemed too good to be
true there was certainly a stumbling
block recently obviously with air power
but Apple has traditionally shipped what
they said they were going to ship so
until the air power example becomes the
rule I'm gonna look at it as exactly
what it is the exception
