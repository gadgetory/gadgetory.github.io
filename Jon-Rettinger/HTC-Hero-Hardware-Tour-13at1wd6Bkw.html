technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a hardware overview of the HTC hero
I don't generally do hardware / use of
devices but I've got a lot of requests
from people who are interested about
this since it's not released in the US
what people don't know that much about
it let's go ahead and get started first
thing size wise it's 4.41 inches so down
by 2.21 across by point five six and you
also notice that there is a as i said in
my unboxing a jay leno esque chin on
this bad boy moving on we've got a 1350
milliamp hour battery which
unfortunately I can't test its full
capacity because this doesn't have us 3g
on it so just using edge speed the
battery is going to be fantastic it's
got a 320 x 480 pixel resolution on
display on its 3.2 inch size wise so it
actually is the same resolution as your
iPhone it looks fantastic on it it's got
a 5 megapixel autofocus camera on the
back with camcorder capabilities which
is quite nice oh there is no self
portrait mirror so moving on with the
specs this thing can handle a ton of
multimedia cluding mpeg-4 h.264 h.264
mp3 AAC aac+ wma WAV it's got a micro SD
card slot which is hidden underneath the
back panel here you gotta take off the
battery it slide in the mini SD card
microsd cred rather but unfortunately
i'll show you you do not have to remove
the battery taking off the back cover is
kind of a pain you got to pop it up with
your finger and take a nail if you have
one sort of slide it down pop it up and
pop it up on the other side and then
your microSD card slot just goes right
in there you can see the battery in the
sim card is right underneath though as
hard as it is to get the battery off
it's just as easy to put it back on so
I'll keep going through some of the
specs on the device it is of course
running Android it's got the Qualcomm
528 megahertz processor the same
one that you'll find in the touch
diamond2 it's got two hundred eighty
eight megabytes of RAM and 512 megabytes
of ROM it's got a full HTML browser and
in a later video I'll give you a
demonstration of the browser capability
isn't leaving to a head-to-head
comparison against the iphone this
browser however does have full flash
capabilities when you can play youtube
videos right from within the browser
just like you would on a normal website
you can access a ton of other flash
content as well as I said before it's
got mini USB 802 11 B and G it's got
bluetooth to point with stereo streaming
it's got a lot of connectivity options
now the actual hard work on the device
it's got a send key the typical Android
keys that you'll find on most devices
the send key the home button a menu
button and a call end or power button
it's got they pretty useful trackball
it's got a search brings up a universal
search or google search and a back
button on the side and I look this the
first time I actually didn't think it
had a volume rocker but if you can see
it looks like one piece that actually is
a volume rocker up and down very
traditional like you would find on most
phones just doesn't look like it it's
got your speaker up front on each side
it's got two LED indicators one for
charging want to let you know when you
have new messages so the charging is on
the left new messages will blink on the
right it's got HTC's proprietary mini
USB port but that will charge and work
with any mini USB accessories so that is
actually quite nice on the rights that a
device you've got nothing snap the case
back on it's got this sort of metal
accents on the side definitely gives it
a nice look and feel and on top you've
got that coveted 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and as I showed you on the back
it's got the 5 megapixel camera on this
you'll notice that it nowhere does it
say with Google even though this is
running Google's Android operating
system so that means you get a custom
build of android right out of the box
and you get this sense UI which is a new
skin on top of the Android operating
system I'll do a full demonstration of
the sense UI in a upcoming video as well
so the phone overall this have a very
nice yield to it it's got just enough
weight to feel substantial but not
enough to feel heavy it's got a
capacitive touchscreen so it's same
touch screen you'll find on the iPhone
the g1 and the blackberry storm so no
stylist here so it does feel like a
solid piece of glass and the touchscreen
does seem to be very responsive overall
am I just day with the device I really
like the way it feels it's got a Teflon
coating on the back sort of feels like
the soft touch that you find on some
windows mobile phones but not quite as
soft touchy but it doesn't feel like
it's going to go sliding out of your
hands I definitely feel like it's going
to stick in there overall the hardware
feels great and seems to be quite
responsive one of the knots and device
has been that the processor speed is a
little bit on the slow side but I'll
talk about that more in an upcoming
video so just a quick hardware overview
of the HTC hero hope you enjoyed for
