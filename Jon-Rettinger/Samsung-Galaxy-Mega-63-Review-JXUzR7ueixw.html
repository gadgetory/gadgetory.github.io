TechnoBuffalo here at the for review for
you of the Samsung Galaxy mega 6.3 and
this thing is totally mega let's go
ahead and see if it's too big or just
the right size or if you're looking for
a phablet style phone check out if it's
the right one for you let's get started
Seaver look at your Galaxy Note 2 and
said man that screens too small for me
well Samsung's got your answer with the
product I'm not sure who asked for this
is the Galaxy mega 6.3 in its name 6.3
does the screen is 6.3 inches this is a
ginormous phone so I go ahead and give
my disclaimers I usually do before I do
any sort of review so I use this phone
as my giant daily driver for the better
part of eight days only phone I used I
got to know it inside and out when you
see the hands-on and see how I use it to
try and figure out serve a reference
point I have pretty large hands I can
palm a basketball so might not be how
it's going to look in your hands but
just sort of a something to keep in mind
as you look at the singer like maybe I
could use it maybe I couldn't use it
hopefully that will help that's before
we get to all the specs and talk about
the screen size let's talk about call
quality quality is pretty decent and
free on par with other Samsung devices I
didn't have any drop calls tested it on
ATT HSPA+ network it's an unlocked
device so all this is only reflective of
how it worked on that particular network
I was not tested on t-mobile but it
worked well a speakerphone wasn't overly
loud as if rely on that for making phone
calls ever you are you might want to
pick up an external device it was kind
of a teeny as well but other O's other
than that very serviceable worked well
pulled in a pretty strong signal no
issue between network switch off switch
HSPA+ I mean just PA and sometimes out
the edge no drop call issues there at
all Samsung really knows what they're
doing when it comes to their antennas
and making the phones just work alright
so in case you forgot what the Galaxy
mega 6.3 is rocking let me go ahead and
remind you so of course 6.3 inch screen
is a 720p display it's running Android
4.2 so one of the few phones actually
has 4.2 onboard being powered by a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core processor so only
two cores found in John Norma's phone
1.5 gigs around be available in two
configurations either with 8 gigs of
internal storage or 16 ours has the 8
you can expand it of course with microSD
card no issue there at all cameras got a
megapixel sensor on the back and on the
front there lives a sort of oddly
megapixel to 1.9 megapixel sensor a
Wi-Fi all the latest is here including
802 of an ABG and and a/c so your future
proofed at least from the Wi-Fi standard
you've got NFC on here as well
and it pretty giant 32 hundred million
power battery keeping this guy juice
we'll talk about the battery life a
little further on in the review let's
begin with the screen and I am NOT going
to knock this for having a gigantic
screen so that's like you're buying the
phone for anybody who reviews this phone
and says hey the screen is ridiculous
you shouldn't use it it just doesn't
seem right
you're buying this phone because of a
6.3 inch screen so I'm not really going
to factor that into the full review I'll
talk about the size of it a little bit
but it's a big screen and you know what
you're buying this phone you want a
phone with a John Norma's screen let's
start with the good it looks really
awesome for a 720p screen everything
looks beautiful in fact I had to go look
up the specs make sure didn't have a
1080p screen on it I was a little
worried the pixels were so big on the
screen the size really no issue at all
the screen was beautiful Samsung really
nails it here tough to see in direct
sunlight but indoors pictures/video
everything is absolutely pops text looks
awesome especially on a screen this size
things are able to look really big they
did a wonderful job with the screen
didn't even miss having 1080 on it at
all 720 what samsung technology really
worked well so continuing the good the
phone is so big that hardly been used my
tablet if you're saying okay I only have
enough money to get one thing I don't
know if I want a new phone or I want to
get a tablet this might be a pretty
decent option I really didn't use my
iPad Mini at all which I usually I use
several times a day this thing was
plenty big enough
alright so now on to the bad when you
hold this phone up to your head you got
a line and that there speaker with that
their ear and because the phone is so
wide I was really hard to find exactly
where that was so I have time to keep
moving it around and obviously the audio
quality didn't sound so good till I
found that sweet spot but also because
it's so big the phone almost creates an
echo so when your voice comes out
a mouth hole to reflecting on this phone
and coming back you sort of hear it
which is very strange for our phones or
something to definitely keep in mind the
other big question with the phone of
this size how does it fit in your pocket
how can I possibly carry a 6.3 inch
phone I don't know how else to describe
it but I wear regular dude jeans
I don't wear skinny jeans they're not
like giant you know 1990s pants either
they're just regular do jeans able to
fit in my pocket no problem I can walk
around that really noticing it where I
ran through a problem that was when I
had to sit down that's when it got
really tight and I was very aware that I
had this huge phone in my pocket I keep
taking it out when I sat down and put it
on the table if you're the kind of
person takes your phone and keys at your
pocket anyway then no big deal at all
but if you keep your phone in your
pocket all the time
you really don't want to try this at a
store if you don't want to get arrested
though don't put the phone in your
pocket at the store you really don't
like that it's obviously in my line of
work I get the opportunity and the
privilege to test a ton of phones I have
never had so many people stop and ask me
questions ever as they did with this guy
people like why are you making calls on
a tablet to what is that is that the new
Galaxy Note we were just crazy
curious out what this thing was and
since hasn't come out in the US yet I
was very happy to share but I've never
had anybody stop me as often as I did
with the Galaxy mega so if you like
attention would be a reason to pick this
sucker up so software wise there's a lot
of galaxy s4 features on here air view
is on here I actually found myself
liking TouchWiz on a screen this big
admittedly a month the biggest TouchWiz
fan but I did not install a launcher on
this guy I used it as is as Samsung
intended and I kind of liked it I don't
know what it was about seeing it bigger
but it worked for me and I really
enjoyed it so I know that's a personal
thing but if you're always sort of first
thing you do is put a launcher on it you
might want to reconsider when you pick
up the galaxy mega so battery life giant
screen you might have some concerns
through 200 milli amp hours you're
easily going to get you through a full
day my usage off the charge around 732
emails being pulled in on Wi-Fi most of
the day an hour so a phone calls some
games and video viewing more web-browser
than I usually do on a phone because the
screen is so big and it lends itself to
scrolling through and through and
through pages I was able to put on the
phone at night around 11:30 with almost
50% charge the battery is incredible on
this whether it's having a huge battery
or samsung is on battery management and
he
no problem at all getting through one
day and if you're careful you can
probably even get through two days and I
don't do any auto-brightness I keep my
brightness generally around 80% so I'm
sure if I put that down you know 240 or
lower that I could have probably gotten
through much longer without any issue at
all so I was very pleasantly surprised
from battery standpoint so on to
performance it was adequate I did have
some slowdown when I was doing very
quick Scrolls through pages apps loaded
fine they played fine the bonus didn't
feel as if these other devices and I've
been testing a lot of quad core even
some octa-core phones so it might have
already been in my head but it's not a
fast phone it's a very serviceable phone
it works well apps load quick enough but
it's not a formulated wow I can't
believe how fast that opens or well I
can have so many apps running at once
and you can but you are gonna have some
sort of slow you might have to do some
app management but the trade-off for
having a phone this big I suppose there
aren't any other options here so nothing
with quad core octa-core out there yet
perhaps the Galaxy mega 6.3 2 will have
that released right now you left with
dual core which in the Android world
might be not quite enough to get the
performance that you need all right so
what's the conclusion on the mega 6.3
there's clearly a market for it I like
big screen phones my wife who is never
once using an Android device ever
expressed any desire to use a phone
other than an iPhone saw this and said
when you're down with it can I use it
she couldn't believe that she could see
everything on the screen and she's in
care if it's in her pocket because goes
right into purse so there's clearly
people that want this phone I love giant
screen phones but for me the 6.3 inches
is just a little too big I think 5.56
inches probably the biggest that I could
go but if you want something a little
larger this is here it's here now it's
available and it works so if you're the
kind of person that says listen I want
the biggest I only want one phone I
don't want to tablet as well it's a
really good choice this gets a very
solid eight on the TechnoBuffalo reading
scale so you guys agree disagree I'd
love to hear your thoughts leave them in
the comments down below please give the
video a thumbs up we most definitely
appreciate it I'm John rent from
TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you next video
