the apple store and here is the new
unibody plastic macbooks that released
earlier in the week i'm filming this
with the iphone so it's a little bit
shaky please excuse me you can see it's
definitely more rounder and sleeker
definitely an evolutionary type design
very thin you can compare it for the
thickness of say and iphone for example
you can see you know how thin it really
is the top and you looked it up looks
just very similar to what the old
macbooks look like but it's got this
plastic that looks like it's just an
absolute fingerprint magnet and it's
totally destroyed anything as you
because you tie courage because he
prints all over that but it's not bad it
doesn't look nice especially when its
clean look at on the left-hand side some
of the some of the courts that you have
here got the new magsafe you've got your
a Gigabit Ethernet you've got your mini
or micro toast the new mini display port
two USB ports and your audio in which is
now audio out as well there's only one
audio port which is kind of interesting
not for this there's your new backlit
LED display which looks just like a back
belly to display its when the brightness
up to fancy a difference it definitely
doesn't look as washed out as the old
macbook monitors but it's a doesn't
appear to be that drastic a difference
either the mover on the other side got
your super drive and that really appears
to be it definitely just a definitely
nice solid feel to it also on the back
you've got that sort of rubber rubber
feel it's gonna keep it from falling off
and of course your sealed battery in
there there's an apple logo urban boss
on the back these things will start at
nine ninety-nine s the same price point
but spec for spec these are almost
exactly the same as the entry level 13
inch MacBook Pro just in a plastic form
factors so it's definitely a really
great value for a computer one thing if
you guys a real quick overview of what
the new unibody plastic macbooks look
like for exclusive content to take me
out on twitter twitter.com slash

learn more about that i'll put a link to
both in the sidebar see you guys the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
