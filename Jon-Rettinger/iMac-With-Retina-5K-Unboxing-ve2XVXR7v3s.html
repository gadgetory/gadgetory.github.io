TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest iteration of the iMac this is
being done at the end of 2014 and this
is the first time we've seen a 5k
display on an Apple product
it's the iMac 5k with Retina Display pax
2 times resolution of the outgoing iMac
let's go ahead open up it looks like
because the box is subjective the
unboxing over so we can't do it in our
studio we got a picture of the iMac on
the front this is shipping with Yosemite
which was just released nothing else
overly exciting on the box you got some
Apple logos got that same sort of flat
cone shape on a picture of it on the
back as well
we've got spin about two and a half
years they last in box an iMac we now
have a pull tab to make it a little bit
easier go ahead and rip this off what
we've got in this one special-ordered a
little bit it's got the four gigahertz
core i7 processor in here 16 gigs of ram
although you do still have the
upgradable RAM slot in here if you want
to acquit yourself you can we've got a
one terabyte fusion drive on here as
well which is kind of always nice to
have I'll upgrade the video card as well
it's got the AMD Radeon r9 M 295 X with
4 gigs of RAM which would be quite nice
it's got Thunderbolt 2 which is capable
of 30 gigabits per second again into 27
inch diagonal screen it's IPS technology
the resolution is 50 120 by 26 60 the
old was 2560 by 1440 go ahead and pull
this top off your thing doesn't go
flying on out opens frontways it's nice
the whole box kind of falls away we've
got designed by Apple in California
Apple Wireless Keyboard and I got this
with the Magic Trackpad
so we've got that and also let's see
else we also have inside here as long as
I've got this open and see what else we
got we've got a cleaning cloth and some
materials in there you can also get this
of course with the Magic Mouse if you
want and that is that but that's not the
exciting part that's those been around
for quite a while this is what I want to
see so I've got some styrofoam
protecting it
I can take a look at this guy when Apple
announced it at their event in Cupertino
and it looked gorgeous in person so
hopefully look as gorgeous in this
office so I can use it let's see and
pull this out
so we should check here that looks to
unbox on these things one piece of
styrofoam gun I don't knock that over
and another piece of styrofoam done that
one was much more elegant hidden inside
of this one we've got the power cord
very exciting power cord it's got three
prongs and it's got three holes on that
side plugged into the back pretty unique
power cord we've got to be about it I'll
go and pull this off and I'll get it out
of here and I'll get the box out of the
way by box you go on the floor that's
where you live all right now we can open
this sucker up go ahead and pull off
sort of paper felt material here and
it's probably the one time that I don't
have gross stains or finger prints on
the monitor let's see what all dem K's
look like doesn't look like anything
with the screen off more plastic alright
let's go and take off this plastic I
should have mentioned that these are
available in stored already they are
available the same day although we
couldn't find them if you want to get
one ordered though you're gonna look at
about maybe three to five days wait time
a lot of stuff get the rest is plastic
off let's see we can get it just
gigantic whooshing noise I always love
that on smartphones this is just a big
screen let's see it it's it yeah it
wasn't as dramatic as I would have hoped
a giant crumple noise alright we've got
all that business done here is the iMac
in with the screen off it looks kind of
like the old generation iMac let's go
ahead and take a look at its booty booty
you've got the power button you've got a
microphone this is all where all of your
IR stuff is going to live alright so
you've got your a Gigabit Ethernet of
course you've got a 211 AC in here
you've got two Thunderbolt 2.0 ports we
have because I can count one two three
four USB 3.0 ports SD card slot and
there is the headphone out back here as
word if you wanna upgrade your RAM I
believe there are four slots and that's
where your power is going to plug in and
then of course the Apple logo but it's
not really the exciting part let's go
ahead and plug it in and see it looks
like you've got this all turned on have
it moved over any files when I'm gonna
start this guy up from scratch it looks
really really nice I think the big test
is again maybe once you start editing
videos on it I would you start looking
at images and start looking at four or
five K video then use like to see really
different other that looks like a really
nice display if you look at maybe a qHD
screen on the phone versus a good 1080p
screen not that giant of difference if
you guys are thinking about maybe
picking up one of the entry-level 5k
IMAX use it as a monitor because you
know 5k monitors cost usually more than
2500 bucks
entry price it's not gonna work
unfortunately so you can't use an
external monitor but you can of course
use an external monitor with this so
just a little bit of a tidbit of course
we'll use it we'll test it I'll see how
it performs of course put that gorgeous
5k display to good use unfortunately
though from filming it to YouTube to
YouTube compressions whatever screen
you're watching is I'm not really gonna
see what the full of 5k display looks
like but take it from me
does it look really nice of course we're
gonna have a ton more coverage on the
new 5k iMac anything you guys want to
see in particular let us know we'll see
what pictures video games all what kind
of stuff look like on the display until
next time i'm john r ng from
