Lakers comm I'm gonna give you a
demonstration of the backlit keyboard
found on the 2.4 gigahertz but not found
on the 2gig get hurt MacBook and the
backlit keyboard is also found on both
version 2 the back Book Pro I'm gonna
show you what that looks like I'm also
gonna walk you through the speaker
system on the MacBook and show you how
it compares to the iMac so guys hope you
enjoy and don't forget to check out the
website WWJ for Lakers comm and if you
think whether you have what it takes to
be a ride and be sure to hit the apply
button down on the right hand side
alright guys I will talk to you soon bye
alright guys here is a keyboard on the
MacBook it's not totally dark in here
but it should be dark enough for you to
see the backlighting
you have certain settings you can set it
for whether you want to stay on all the
time or stay on for 10 seconds 20
seconds really any interval that you
choose so I have mine set to turn off
after 5 seconds
there you go you can see the back lights
kind of light up each row of keys and I
believe that's powered by two LEDs found
on each side of the keyboard so there's
one here and one here and they spread
out across and it definitely helps for
typing in dark conditions it's not
entirely dark in here but you can see
looking over the keyboard right now it
is a little bit hard to see the end in
the EM when you light it up becomes much
much much clearer so guys just a quick
demonstration of the backlighting and
what it looks like looks very similar in
the MacBook Air and I found the
backlighting to be very handy actually
not a terribly large drain on battery
life either so no harm leaving it on a
little bit longer
there's the monitor as well alright guys
I'm gonna give you now a quick
demonstration of the speaker system
alright guys to show off the speakers
and to avoid any copyright issues I'm
going to use GarageBand I'm gonna use
the default rock music that shows up so
the first thing you're going to hear is
music from the iMac coming through the
Harman Kardon sound 6 speakers so these
are very very high-end speakers with
great sounds there's a subwoofer
underneath so you can get a sense of
comparison here so we're gonna go ahead
and hit play and let it play for a
minute
we're at the base coming out okay now
I've got the same thing open here on the
MacBook I'm gonna go ahead and play that
as well
that was a decent comparison between the
two the MacBook certainly doesn't sound
as good as the larger Harman Kardon
speakers but it is much better than any
laptop speaker system that I can
remember it even sounds as good as my
old MacBook Pro while there isn't that
necessarily a dedicated speaker grille
the speakers are behind here right at
the hinge between the front display and
the base of the computer so there is
actually a fair amount of room for the
super noise to come out right back there
it's also where the vent is as well so
guys hope you got a nice sense of the
speakers they are certainly loud they're
lacking a little bit in base obviously
but you know for general laptop
soundings it actually is very impressive
if you're looking to do any professional
sound mixing you definitely gonna want
to connect external speakers but if you
just want to watch a movie with some
friends or listening to some music these
will serve you just fine and when you
guys hope you found this helpful and I
will see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
