will be of the global and not us variety
earlier this week it hit the interwebs
that the Lumia 900 will be launching on
AT&amp;amp;T in March for a scant ninety nine
dollars 99 bucks on contract nine
dollars in two years of your eighty
dollars a month cell phone commitment
will get you the flagship Nokia Windows
Phone device which I personally am
pretty excited for as long as I can get
the cyan blue one room are still kicking
around about a better 900 now being
called the 910 shipping later this year
with a bumped up camera but a little
birdies telling me that that's 12
hogwash that the 900 is the flagship
device and will be at least for now I
don't know these are just rumors that's
why the show's called rumor roundup but
lots of rumors kicking around also LG
