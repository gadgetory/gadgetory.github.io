about full bulletins time hello internet

well this was a little unexpected early
yesterday morning news broke that media
giant comcast intends to purchase cable
provider Time Warner 440 5.2 billion
dollars that price is seventeen percent
more than Time Warner's current stock
value which surely makes their investors
happy but there's a pretty big obstacle
standing in their way US regulators this
is a huge merger and it could create
service monopolies in markets across the
country adding the recent death of net
neutrality to the mix makes it unclear
if this deal will ever get the thumbs up
so I guess all there's left to say is US
regulators mount up the recent Lenovo
acquisition of Motorola Mobility left a
lot of questions to be answered
including what would happen to current
executives one of those executives has
officially announced his plans as
motorola CEO dennis woodside posted a
farewell letter on modos blog revealing
he's taking a new chief operating
officer gig at Dropbox Dropbox hoped
Woodside can provide high-level
experience and oversight for their
growing company and Woodside will start
his new gig on April first this is an
elaborate April Fool's gag rights
probably not over in gaming Nintendo
held another one of their Nintendo
Direct events online yesterday it was
one of the longest Nintendo Direct ever
and it focused on Wii U and 3ds games
coming by the end of spring we saw
things like a second installment of nes
remix little mac from mike tyson's
punch-out joining the Super Smash
Brothers fray checked out some new
Bayonetta 2 footage and got a solid
release date
for mario kart 8 which will hit retail
shelves on May thirtieth and include
seven Koopa Ling racers also in gaming
rovio unveiled the newest installment of
their angry birds franchise Angry Birds
Stella interestingly there's no sign of
the infamous pigs in this press release
and it seems like all the birds in this
game have names and distinct
personalities of course rovio mentioned
the story will quote live and evolve
across physical and digital end quote
meaning we'll be seeing all kinds of
media platforms carrying Angry Birds
Stella and loads of merchandise to go
with it our wild card today is a fun one
we are playing the movie card this week
and Brandon's got our list of the 14
most anticipated science fiction and
fantasy movies of 2014 there are a ton
of great geeky movies coming to theatres

america sequel chris nolan's
