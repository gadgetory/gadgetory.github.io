welcome to another edition of good to go
I'm Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo calm
when I James Kendrick from ZDNet mobile
news we're going to try to get this one
in under the wire because the storm
clouds apparently our gathering down in
Texas where James is so I we want it we
want to get get through talking about
Google i/o so you can batten down your
hatches down there lights have flickered
once already since we stored it so I'm
gonna talk fast if I and if I disappear
you lost me and you're not getting me
back all right anybody watching from the
Texas area if James screen goes blank
send out the rescue dogs the st. Bernard
just a little lot the little lie barrels
of and medicine on their collars so uh
google i/o big news this week here it is
here's oh my goodness is the i/o edition
tab 10-1 some of that loot that you
brought back with you actually you don't
have it all yet I don't have it all yet
the the Chromebooks they're not shipping
until June and they actually when they
gave out the the tab they give it a
little card saying come back tomorrow
for a verizon mobile hotspot right and
they didn't have them in I left the show
before it was over and I didn't have
them in yet so oh really yeah yep so
that's the Samsung like i have actually
in here somewhere yes Samsung Samsung
was like the official unofficial
official sponsor oh like they put up
some stuff that's for sure they've been
they've been going hard this month they
had the event earlier this month in New
York they have another one the 24th
where it was like they're going to
officially launch launch this thing that
the Samsung version with the TouchWiz
panel on it which this is not how I talk
about right again yeah a lot lots going
on there but well let me ask you because
I was you know when you're at these
conferences you tend to sort of get
really deep into whatever it is you're
focused on but then there's so much else
going on you know I sort of wound up
relying on the media as much as anything
to find out you know what else is going
on what was your takeaway from you know
from not being at the event but
reporting on it and covering it from
afar well they're really good about
streaming it live and I mean I admit I I
was watching it as much as possible I
mean android is the hot platform right
now in anybody's reckoning and whether
you like it or not it's it's the hot one
and then we knew they were going to
really tell us some more about Chrome OS
and now the Chromebook which we know so
that's kind of the second timely
platform you know in the news and repo
but really all of the news was coming
out of Google i/o this week so it must
have been fun to be there with all those
other geeks it was the at the press room
at rest rooms that these things are like
you know like a real-life version of the
usual suspects you're kind of sitting
there all locked in and I'll come up for
air take the earphones out if I've been
editing video look around and like Oh
him and him and her and him and you know
so it's fun to see those things fun to
uh to get people's take on it but then
this show in particular just walking
around the floor you know for all I get
grief about being an apple fanboy
sometimes online a lot of a lot of
attendees that the show came up to say
hi and we're very nice and didn't didn't
call me a fanboy so you know that that
was every every picture of the crowd at
Google i/o I saw had nothing but max
yeah yeah I mean that was it yeah I
think I saw one when I don't even know
what it was I'm it was a windows machine
of some kind but that was it yep yep a
lot of max max on stage you know during
the keynotes that they had a couple
couple powerbooks up there running
things what was very interesting is that
on day one especially at the beginning I
saw a lot of people now at the keynotes
out they had a press section so I was in
the press section but there were a bunch
of people using iPads you notice to blog
the show or whatever they were doing but
by day two of the show because the hand
of these things out on day one well I'll
tell you what there's the craziness of
live TV I guess
James I hope you are right i'm guessing
the you said the lights were flickering
i'm guessing the storms rolled in and we
lost you there so if he comes back oh
wait just as i said that i'm seeing them
back on skype so let's see if we can get
James back here all right we got them
back James the the power the lights seem
to be on what's going on down down there
in Texas you know my internet
connectivity went dead so right now I'm
on LTE using my samsung mobile hotspot
that you are just sharing you haven't
picked up yet we met her do that I i
actually bought one from verizon as soon
as they came in and great great backup
connectivity for me we we clearly we
clearly there's a certain sponsor who
should be sponsoring this program i just
got a little warning on my end on skype
call recorder saying that the frame rate
is going to be lowered so for those of
you watching this at home later you know
at least we've got James at least we've
gotta yeah that's probably the LTE
although it's pretty darn quick I mean
as a rule but I mean like I said lights
flickering it's it's pitch black outside
well we need to fit in drought
conditions for like three months right
so it's good it's good well a lot well
we'll get this in real quick I'd started
to ramble about walk fast lots of max
lots of iPads but them by day to
everybody's walking around with these
things because I had a great app
you know for for just dealing with the
show with scheduling and locations of
war different sessions were and
everything and this thing is so light
that walking around with it and this is
this is you know my thing about the tab
10 1 samsung I don't know how much it
cost them when I have had to came out
they went back to the drawing board and
we're like we need to make ours better I
don't know how much it cost him but but
they did they did good cuz my big
complaint about the Moto zoom was just
kind of too bulky too heavy you know I
don't I I like the smaller tablets the G
slate we've talked about but this thing
is so light that even with and so thin
that even with the 10 inch display it's
really no problem to hold it one-handed
I actually
when after I Oh Moscone Center where it
were they held it is just a few blocks
from an apple store and downtown San
Francisco and right by the drain that I
was hopin integra so I went into the
apple store and we're uh yeah right down
there exactly exactly um and when
they're I know how that still you get
you can picture me walking in going to
the right to the ipad to display and
picking one up and thinking yeah you
know I like the hardware better on the
on the tab not talking about performance
wise because I haven't had it long
enough to know and not talking about
ecosystem and apps and all that but just
form factor and the way it feels this is
you know they did they did well so I've
never seen as many unboxing videos for
one device at one particular location
rare I must have seen ten of them yep
Anna and a bunch of them had zooms the
so I I see what you mean right rare yep
yo they were they were comparing them up
there and that was a big problem i had
when i was testing the zoom I didn't
like it was too heavy and people yeah
there were I'll tell you I talked about
this on Twitter a little bit but you
know getting in the spirit of the show I
had a nexus s 4g with me the whole time
since that's the most recent review unit
I've received Android and I put Google
Music beta on it and I was using that
and that's interesting it works really
well except and this is a sprint 4g
device and when i would go from a 4g the
3g area when the handoff happened in the
music the music would pause and it does
some local caching and this is the first
time i'd use it i was commuting in from
you know leaving my house walking to the
train taking the train into san
francisco walking to the show so there
were some handoffs and whatnot and i'm
sure to improve as more stuff gets cash
that was the one hiccup on the network
end otherwise the beta service works
really well they're not selling anything
lots of talk that this is not the
service google wanted to launch they
wanted to launch with with you know
music companies on boards etc but for
what it is
it works really well so far the stereo
speakers on this thing are actually
quite good for how thin this thing is so
yeah I find the sound on my seven inch
Galaxy Tab the original one is quit
really good too they know how to do that
I know how to do it yep Ice Cream
Sandwich you know interesting to to hear
about it kind of like a you know hurry
up and wait thing I guess q4 this year
so you know possibly setting up a little
ice cream sandwich I've os5 battle for
your holiday dollars of course q4 that
starts the meter of everybody with
devices say am I gonna get it or not
rights right same old thing you know you
have any thoughts on what they announced
it to that end the I forget the term
they use but the priority partners
getting all the latest updates I think
it's a good step but it was clear from
all of the executive q and A's
afterwards when people really started
grilling them they admitted it's all in
the talking stage jaynen so what does
that mean I mean we really need to see
finite rules on these people and and I
hope Google is not naive enough to think
that these other big companies they're
playing with carriers and OEMs are going
to say oh sure will we volunteer to do
what's best right now I want to see an
actual you know procedure outlined in
writing I yeah we need to know like if
you walk into a store and you're looking
at buying a particular android phone you
deserve to know how long am I gonna have
updates available to be right right and
yes I will have them available to yep
and especially if your sign in a
two-year contra you deserve it period on
top of that if you're signing it to your
contract that's got early termination
penalties and and you know upgrade costs
and everything yeah you know is your is
your phone going to basically be left
for dead before you can upgrade it
without penalty let's yeah well but
we'll see at least are doing something
they're not yet and to be
fair they're not the only ones as soon
as I close my mouth I thought well you
know Apple you know you don't know when
you buy the iphone for right now before
to you have a history though yeah you do
yeah so that's that's the problem we we
have a consistent history with Apple at
least and unfortunately we have a
consistent history with Android to it
it's not good right right and that's
that's why they're in this whoa well
what was I can't think off the top of my
head you know with the last round of iOS
updates that the older models won't
support well only the 3g I mean and is
that it's a marker here we're at it for
years yeah but if the hardware won't
support it it won't support no right
right right right you know but that
doesn't mean you should just be out of
luck I mean there is no such thing as an
android phone with hardware so outdated
that it can't do all of us right it's to
do do you want the g one can run a
puppet you one's toast it's like a
doorstop yeah I but pretty much
everything after that has been
Snapdragon getting it yeah let's face it
i mean my evo is not a dual-core
whiz-bang latest thing and it's is
plenty fast enough to do every right so
i actually got my hands on an EVO 3d for
the first time at the show and yeah you
know the whole 3d thing is whatever it
is it you know it works fine what is
it's a gimmick the phone's a little
bulkier than i was expecting that extra
dimension yeah instead extra dimension
exactly also saw the new sony ericsson's
the xperia mini and mini pro which you
know i like seeing a those look pretty
good on ya yeah they have snapdragons in
and 1 gigahertz single core but
snapdragons they both at it's the later
generation later generate a lot faster
than the original one gigger yep and
with the smaller screen it's not pushing
as many pixels so you know it seems to
be plenty fast they have kind of an
update
gingerbread version of that four corners
UI which I thought was very clever makes
it easy for one-handed use having
shortcuts in the four corners that you
know I'm doing this because my thumb can
reach the shortcuts and front-facing
cameras so you can do the video chat or
you know whatever the kids are doing
these days with the with the cameras so
just like Furness faceplant there you go
real quick because I you have you have
storms to deal with and we also want to
wrap it up yo NE wrap up its my lights
are flickering any quick quick thoughts
on the Chromebooks you know they look
cool they look what we expected aii i
was i like the enterprise subscription
plan I think they're actually going to
hit the enterprise big time because
that's basically a maintenance agreement
yeah and yep and I think that's very
costly car cost effective one for the
enterprise education could be too i
don't know if there's enough budgets in
the school yeah i have for it but I I
think there's a there's a plan i do
think they'll have all time in the
consumer space I agree I yeah they're
gonna have to do a hard sell somehow
yeah and 350 bucks it up is not gonna do
it right I'm fully active better than
that fully agree I consumer wise you
know I think there's going to be a sort
of geek novelty factor people interested
in them and you know that I'm excited to
get one a play that we'll see how they
perform but I think like you said
energized and an education I actually a
free one I'll take a free way to go
exactly that reminds me I remember you
saying that you were gonna give that
galaxy tab to me haha don't I remember
was that we're gonna happen I think it
was on a past show i'm pretty sure send
me the URL some of the you're off we can
verify that will uh yeah oh that's on
the internet it must be true must be
true it's on the internet but yeah i
used to be a teacher and do tech stuff
in schools teaching at tech support and
you hit it on the head of maintenance
you know if they're really virus free
fully supported or close to it anyway
that's
that's costly costly stuff in a school
in a business where ever so we're just
having a fixed monthly cost is but they
could budget that yep yep that's their
problem now they have a they have
breakdowns uh yep we don't have money to
fix that right now right right this
month free next month 20 grand you know
yeah your aunt Fran can't have it this
month you've got away anyway it's pretty
cool yes see how it shakes out all right
well let's wrap her up both for a
four-year steak with the weather and the
viewers sake and you know keeping it to
a decent length we're taking next week
off uh yeah that's right because we vote
we both have some stuff going on that's
going to preempt us but we'll be back
the week after that which what the date
is but is that the week of the big
there's there's a windows phone 7 event
and a samsung event in New York on May
twenty-fourth so that's true and by that
time I'll be able to talk about a gadget
that I'm actually playing with now but
like I can't even admit I have very I'm
really liking I like the ti like the t's
there I like the team oh I have to talk
I first I hate at the you know that it's
I can't even take it out in public right
right right well if you want if you want
more from mr. double-oh-seven here James
