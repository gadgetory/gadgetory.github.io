to you by godaddy what's going on guys
the m√§rklin sangha from TechnoBuffalo
and in today's rumor roundup we'll be
talking a bit about the ipad pro some
new galaxy s6 info android wear five
point 0 revealed in a massive leak and
are we going to see us backed out Lumia
phone running Windows 10 this is rumor
roundup let's start rounding those
rumors up a device we know nothing about
is being delayed and it looks like the
iPad pro is being pushed back from early
2015 to quarter 2 2015 reports are
saying that the problem is the time
needed to produce an arc side panel with
a high res quick response in high color
saturation is proving more difficult
than Apple initially thought we've heard
a few different sources say a few
different things about apples supposed
pro iPad model and while most reports
have agreed the device will sport a 12
point nine inch screen a recent rumor
claimed that will actually be a bit
smaller than that at 12 point 2 inches
which isn't that big of a difference now
with that being said I think the 12 inch
range seems a bit too big for a tablet
but we'll have to wait and see the
device in action before making any
judgments I don't know what do you guys
think of this ipad pro craze rumors out
of Korea are already starting to brew a
fresh details on a galaxy s6 with
sources saying that Samsung is working
to push up launched by a month instead
releasing the handset in April as the
company typically does for its galaxy
refreshes it's currently working to push
the galaxy s6 out the door in March
we're still a bit in dark on what the
galaxy s6 will offer but one analyst
said he believes Samsung will offer a
display with two curved edges and quite
honestly I don't know what to think of
having two curved edges for a display we
just got our hands on a note edge device
that has a curve on the right side and
we're still not sure if we like it or
not we included the link down below to
that video so make sure to check that
out android wear still has a ways to go
before it feels like a fully functional
wearable OS but an incoming updates
should add a handful of much-needed
features and improvements one of the
biggest improvements coming to Android
wear is a watch face API which will open
doors for tons of new customization
options the update also makes it
possible to show whether notifications
right from the watch face so you can
find that information with a quick
glance other notable features are at
ability
back a notification card once you swipe
it away and Google might also let you
control screen brightness with new
theater and sunlight modes there's no
official words on when this updates
going to rule out but we can't wait to
try it out let's take a quick break from

details last but not least the lumia 940
Microsoft seems to be focusing on the
low end mobile market these days but the
company may have a new flagship device
in a pipeline as well the first specs
for an upcoming Lumia 940 leaked out on
Monday revealing a Windows 10 device
with cutting-edge hardware based on a
rumored specs sheet the Lumia 940 might
come equipped with a 5-inch 1080p
display with Gorilla Glass 4 a
Snapdragon 805 processor a 24 megapixel
PureView camera NFC 3 gigabytes of RAM
and 32 64 and 128 gigabyte of storage
options the device is also supposedly
running Windows 10 which won't
officially launch until late next year
and I'm kind of excited to see what
Microsoft has for us in a near future
when Windows 10 officially launches
though by the time it comes out those
specs might not look very flagship like
since today's Android device has already
come with better specs anyways it's it
