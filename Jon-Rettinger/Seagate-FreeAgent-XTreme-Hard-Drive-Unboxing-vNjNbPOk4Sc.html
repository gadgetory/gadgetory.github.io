TechnoBuffalo here flow see that follow
me on Twitter you'll know that my
Western Digital my book external hard
drive that I've been using for years to
back up every one of my videos that I've
done since I've started completely died
on me it won't work on any computer I've
even tried taking the harddrive attitude
enclosure the thing is just completely
shot and it was wrecked and a bit
devastated of having lost all my records
of every video that I've ever done well
I was tweeted that out and the folks at
Seagate actually got word of that and
sent me over a another brand of hard
drive to review and try for you guys
this is their free agent Xtreme I'm
hoping for much better results and for
me better results would be just not
dying after a few years so this is the
free agent Xtreme in the 1.5 terabyte
version guinness running about 200 bucks
the sizes they have available ranges
from I believe 500 gigs up to 200 gigs
ranging in various sizes I'll put a link
in the sidebar if you guys wants more
information let's go ahead and dig in
and Hynek here you see what this looks
like and see how hard drives have
advanced and as I last picked up my
Western Digital in the past I've had
pretty good luck with with them but
having the hard drive crash was just
completely unacceptable I'm especially
of having that much valuable information
in retrospect I probably should have had
more redundant storage and sort of let
that serve as a bit of a warning to you
guys to make sure that you sufficiently
back everything up so let's go ahead and
unbox it of course we've got the
obligatory don't cut your finger off big
knife then slice the plastic at least
it's not in a blister pack those blister
packs are impossible to open up what
comes in a pretty big box you got
picture of it on the front little bit of
a side profile see what fork it's got in
a minute and picture of it on the side
so we will dig in I cut some tape first
so there is the hard drive it's actually
much thinner than some of the other ones
that I've checked out in the past I'll
compare it to my outgoing dead Western
Digital pretty thin for a 1.5 terabyte
drives got a bit of a tapered edge to it
which is kind of neat let's go ahead and
see what ports this one includes so it
has two firewire ports a mini USB eSATA
power and Kensington lock I've never
used eSATA but it seems to be becoming a
bit more prevalent you shouldn't even
see you SATA ports on some laptops go
ahead push it off to the side for just a
minute and see what else comes in the
box
probably cables so we've gone they give
you a FireWire 400 cable through
standard size power brick nothing that
exciting and you have any more cables
got little dots to keep the thing from
sliding around we've got a stand if you
want to keep it vertical got a USB to
micro USB and that is about it so let's
do a real quick size comparison to my
outgoing Drive the one that's dead and
lost all my information the Western
Digital my book this one here is only a
leave a terabyte in size but it's a
little bit older you can see that hard
drives have definitely shrunk I think
that this one is probably two platters
this one must be just want to keep it
that thin you can see
even from the port standpoint what the
difference is so the guys were kind of
comparing and shopping I have not used a
Seagate drive so I can't speak to the
reliability but if it works I'll be
better off than it was with the Western
Digital Drive definitely something to
keep in mind if you are looking for a
new hard drive the folks at Seagate what
we're very nice to send us over so I
will give it a review I will try it I'll
try transfer rates on firewire I'll even
find a computer with eSATA and try that
and USB and I will blast it and blast it
and blast it back and forth with data
and transfers to see how it holds up
over probably the course of about two
weeks to a month any questions you guys
want to see about this let me know I'm
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
