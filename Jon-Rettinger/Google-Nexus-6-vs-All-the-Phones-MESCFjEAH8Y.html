from TechnoBuffalo here the Nexus 6 is
out it's available and you're probably
considering picking one up but if you
are maybe we're thinking about crush
dropping one of the other myriad of
super phones that are out there so I
thought it'd be kind of fun a little bit
Cotuit is to take all the other phones
that are available I would see there a
few we could have added here but these
are the big ones put them all together
and just compare it to all the phones so
let's go ahead and put the Nexus 6
against everything so we've got a cadre
of phones we've got the Nexus 6 we got
the Lumia 1520 we've got the galaxy s5
we got the Moto X 2014 we've got the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 the LG g3 the HTC
One m8 the Droid turbo guy phone 16
iPhone 6 plus over here for our smart
phone loving hands
I love phones I do this because I love
phones and I just look at all these
phones makes you so happy
it Envisat weird that i just kind of
want to lick them all that probably is
weird so we did a video like this when
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus launched that
figured that one was fun but let's add
more phones and now we got a nexus it's
androids turn to see what it looks like
versus everything let's go ahead and get
started so this is a 5.9 inch screen on
the Nexus 6 because it sounds better
than the Nexus 5 point nine six so let's
compare it to a true six inch screen
this is the red lumia 1520 it's pretty
odd phone we put these two side-by-side
you can go ahead and see that lumia is
bigger it's chunky its square I can see
if those two look like side-by-side and
stacked they're just getting a little 6
inch makeout sesh going on
alright lumia your time is over go back
to play with your friends next let's
bring in the flagship from Samsung this
is the galaxy s5 we can also test your
smartphone knowledge before I say it see
if you know what the screen size is of
all these phones if you said 5.1 inches
the galaxy s5 you would be correct
hello Galaxy s5 hello Nexus 6 this is
how how I play with my action
and I put these two side-by-side a
concludes the difference between 5.1 and
just about six inches we're gonna call
it three inches because it's just easier
to take five point nine six big
difference here between the two see
difference there in thickness as well
the design the metal bands are show the
fake metal band around the galaxy s5 and
then versus the Nexus 6
alright galaxy s5 we're done with you
what about one of the latest for
Motorola this is the 2014 Moto X how big
is the screen size if you said 5.2
inches you would be correct this one's
got the leather back which looks very
worn here let's put these two
side-by-side they can just get there
make it on it looks almost like kid
brother versus regular brother it's a
crazy world when a 5.2 inch screen phone
feels teeny and tiny so here are these
two side by side see those guys look
like alright and these are the kind of
related I guess
now they're kind of like kissing cousins
I see what both of these guys look like
next to each other you can notice though
the antenna bands are in the same spot
on each down on the bottom they both
have those same lines on the top and on
the bottom so you can see some family
heritage there but enough with you moto
X it's all about the latest in the note
line and that is the Galaxy Note 4 how
big is the screen on that 5.7 inches is
how big the screen is this is sort of
the first of Samsung's new design
language we saw at first the Galaxy
alpha or the second I should say other
design language that's where that metal
ring rounded much more premium feel so
these two are pretty close to the same
screen size five point seven to six
inches see what they look like hello
there and this is a much closer example
they're almost the same size little bits
smaller on the note 4 but they're those
two side-by-side see if those guys look
like all right note 4 done with you how
about the almost bezel as LG g3 whose
screen size is 5.5 buttons on the back
to look like slow getting used to so how
about half an inch of inch in these guys
and you can probably see a big
difference here since the g3 is really
thin on the bezel side you can see a big
difference here
in the width and the height of both
phones so there are those guys and
there's the width of them they're just
they want another minute just to be
together all right
maybe put these two together they'll
make a g3 vigor sorry bad joke
let's take the HTC One m8 hello m8
you're like an old friend I kind of
missed you how big is the screen says it
is 5 inches 5 inches and I can don't
want to say diminutive 5 inches which is
crazy remember the Dell Streak kit that
was 5 inches in seemed gargantuan oho
our perspectives have changed so there
is of those two side by side you got the
metal versus the plastic build and keeps
DC's got some incredible build quality
and you can definitely see the
difference here between the width of
these guys and with not talking
thickness but the width of the actual
phone itself so there's that so there
those two side-by-side alright so next
let's bring in the latest from Verizon
this is the Droid turbo it's Kevlar back
and it's 5.2 inch qHD screen so there's
that you might think hey Johnson lucky
but this thing's got a battery that'll
last you fo days I really kind of liked
that feature and we've really enjoyed
playing this guy around the office there
are those two and see if they look like
they're big difference but I'll take
that thickness for their rigid
redonkulous battery life and next let's
bring in the first of the Apple's lineup
here is the iPhone 6 with its 4.7 inch
screen which last year we're just seen
big Python standards but this year seems
downright tiny so here are those guys
side-by-side so 6 inches or there abouts
and 4.7 it looks like you could almost
fit like two iPhones on here two iPhones
and maybe like an a couple iPod nanos
you could you could stack and see the
screen size difference in there and the
thickness there as well now let's bring
in the largest and this is the last
phone of our comparison of the iPhone
lineup this is the iPhone 6 plus which
is 5.5 inches and this is where things
get interesting I certainly said that I
thought the iPhone 6 plus had big bezels
so looking at about half inch different
screen size from the two phones yet if
you put them on top of each other
they're almost the same height
the Nexus 6 is a little bit wider but
that's about it so you get almost an
extra half inch of screen real estate
for it close the same size package don't
the more you know but that guy back so
we compared the Nexus 6 to all of these
phones obviously there are more phones
out if you guys want us to dig into our
inventory and see the other phones you
compare this to let us know this is a
fun light-hearted video I like to just
look at all these phones and again kind
of want to lick them but this is if
you're considering getting Nexus 6 and
you want to that would look like next to
another flagship here are all of the
flagships I'll call the flagship I flag
shy you can pick which one is right for
you and I hope you guys enjoyed just to
be out a lot of fun making these videos
