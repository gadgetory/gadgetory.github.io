from technobuffalo here and i want to
give you an overview of the sense UI
found on the HTC hero now this device
that I'm using is an unlocked device
with no US 3g bins as of now it has not
been picked up by a US carrier but the
operating system and the skin on top of
it is really unique so I'm looking
forward to sharing with you so first
let's go ahead and unlock it those you
that maybe don't know this operating
system or the skin on top of it it's
again called sense UI made by HTC which
is a hardware manufacturer and it's
sitting on top of the Android operating
system some of you might be familiar
with other HTC devices and this may even
look familiar to you as cues from
touchflo and touchflo 3d that are found
on windows mobile phones have taken some
cues from that let's go ahead and get
started this is a widget based interface
and I'll show you what that means in
just a moment so in typical Android
devices you've got three home screens
that you can slide around two and this
really takes that three home screens and
more than doubles it actually give you
access to seven home screens I'm just
scrolling around here you can see that
there are a lot of screens to use so let
me show you what you can do with these
screens this is what I have set for my
home screen I've got a big clock widget
with a wet weather widget down below you
can see i'm in irvine and that'll
actually automatically adjust per your
location which is actually quite neat i
needed just shortcuts that i have on
what i consider to be my mobile desktop
you can move these shortcuts around just
by holding it down and you can tap and
move them around you can see that little
square glows to let you know where you
can put an icon if you want to delete it
when you're holding it you just drag it
down to remove it'll glow red and you
let go and there it is so let me show
you some of the widgets that you have a
choice of putting on here and some of
the customizations that you can do so
the big one right here is clearly the
clock and below that the weather so if I
tap it I get much more clock information
now i'm in the pacific time zone i can
add a city here some cities that i've
added for some global times you've got
alarms you've got a stopwatch
and then you've got a timer with a very
familiar-looking dial interface let's go
back home we'll go over to the next
screen here in fact let's go go to blank
screen I can show you some of the
widgets that you can add so you add
widgets quite simply by using this plus
button and it pulls up a list of what
you can add to the home you can add
shortcuts and here are some already pre
described shortcut so bookmark school
mail mail inbox and program to go ahead
and just select whatever program you
want and put an icon right in so I'll
show you what that looks like let's say
I want to put in my mail inbox for
example just standard shortcut I don't
have any mail setup your actually except
with a bad choice let's say I want to
set up music player music playlist will
add a playlist and I go and hit back now
you can see what sort of these options
look like for you so going back to the
added shortcuts you've got HTC widgets
and this is where well the HTC
customization comes into play let me
show you what these are these are really
the most exciting ones on here you've
bookmarks calendar clock footprint so
I'll show you about in a minute mail
message music people photo album photo
frame search setting stocks Twitter and
weather Thank You me just a sampling of
what you can do here let's say I want to
pick bookmarks go ahead and tap that go
ahead and tap it and you can choose
different layouts that you wanted to
have so grid layout or the four icon I
24 icon so I'll select it and now there
is on one of my home screen says I slide
there is my main home screen there's one
on the side and out here is that
bookmarks and I can tap it it's not
really much that I can move it but you
can provide this a little bit if I want
to erase it go ahead and drop it down
let me show you some of the other
widgets that you can add here and some
of them are very cool so you got a
calendar you can choose to have a view a
big calendar i notice that this calendar
looks quite different actually then the
standard android calendars
example of HTC sort of going below the
surface of Android really putting some
other customizations into the core
functionality you can view it sort of a
small piece that you can move anywhere
you want that shows you when your next
appointment is and those are your only
two choices so go ahead and use the back
button and go back now we've got clock
and there's a lot of clock options
you've got text like 12 different clock
options some analog clocks is a big old
digital clock just a ton of different
choices and some of them are actually
pretty neat how they look you can really
customize this any way you want and
that's one of the nice things about
Android in particular the sense UI is
get complete customization over your
home screen which is certainly not found
on other popular capacitive touchscreen
devices that I'm not going to name so
we'll go back it is one called
footprints which is actually kind of new
let me give you a quick overview about
what that is you can select a wooded
style let's pick the big one then it
select such what footprints does it's
quite simply it does geo-tagging there's
a sample picture that I took you can see
it says Irvine 01 it picked up my
location using the built-in GPS and
it'll geotag your pictures if you want
to email them out or post them to
Twitter whatever you want it's just
HTC's own version of geo-tagging kind of
neat so I'll show you just a few more of
these widgets that you have the option
of putting in your home screen we're
going to remove that and you'll see that
things are very fluid they look nice and
they work quite well off the sense UI
let's go ahead and add a few more HTC
widgets you can add people and you can
pick your favorite people photo album
you go ahead and scroll through all your
photo I'll show you what that looks like
let's select it and select an album
we'll just use all photos you get sort
of a shortcut in a snapshot to all your
photos actually quite neat you can
scroll through them following that you
like let's say this one that sort of
looks like Katie Holmes going to open it
up and that takes you to the photo
viewer
and you can take advantage of the
multi-touch that actually HTC put
ominous you can zoom in with two fingers
and zoom out and you can scroll to the
next picture and this will also use the
accelerometer if you want to turn the
device on another note so those are some
of the HTC widgets you can add it can
spend probably another 15 minutes
looking over these with you but in
brevity's interest I won't do that so
let me show you some of the other
options that we have the back button one
more time okay go to a new home screen
and you also have the ability to add the
standard Android wouldn't set people are
used to and one of the cool things about
Android that you get the ability to
again customize your home sweet you can
put folders there you can drag down
folders any way you want and I really
liked it about the operating system so
get some of your standard ones here is a
battery widget that I had downloaded
analog clock that's kind of standard on
most Android devices this will look
pretty familiar you can move it around
just like you can on other Android
devices you'll see that little square
that follows it around to help you put
your icons wherever you want and to
further show that if i select say google
maps here you can see that follows me
around to let me know where I've got
room to put icons and you can really
customize this any way you want and
you've got all these home screens one
thing I will say though if I'm all the
way on the left most home screen I want
to get all the way back to the right
there isn't a home button that i can use
they'll take me go back to the side or
that'll help me move along you got to
scroll through each screen individually
so i can like i said if i hit home it'll
take me right back to that home but if I
want to keep scrolling I got to keep
scrolling all the way through I wish
there was an easier way to navigate
through these screens you can use the
trackball as well to scroll through
these but it's not the quickest way to
do it if you notice right here as I'm
scrolling there's a little bar that's
moving with me and I wish towards a way
to sort of tag that bar and move along
but there isn't unfortunately so some of
the other things about this operating
system it's very social network friendly
meeting when you first set it up it'll
ask you if you have
witter account Facebook MySpace all
these social networking features that
integrate right into these widgets
you'll see right here for example I've
got a Twitter widget that really came
comes built into the device and takes
advantage of the notification bar so
let's say how many new tweets I have it
uses a client called P which is very
nice and practice but i'll say that this
client peep crashes on me not seeing one
out of every three uses so it's great in
theory not so great in practice look go
ahead and scroll that right up so again
like all Android devices you can change
the background here I've got a map of
the world thought it was kind of neat
and you can just put their whatever you
like anyway guys I wanted to give you an
overview of the sense UI it really is a
great user interface although it is very
processor intensive and also RAM and ROM
intensive rom meaning it takes a lot of
program memory and ram it use it a lot
of well the free memory to run it so it
does get a little bit boggy an HTC hero
has a well over a 500 magnet or
processor but it's severely taxed using
this sense ey so things can be a little
bit slow I think that this user
interface is going to be perfect when
processor speeds gets a little bit
faster or perhaps as HTC learns to
optimize it I wouldn't be surprised to
see this make its way on other Android
devices perhaps even backwards
compatible for older Android devices I
would also expect to see this possibly
take some cues onto the new version of
touchflo 3d that's going to be on
windows mobile devices this really is a
great implementation I've been really
happy with it up using it from my
primary phone for the past few days and
it's been very fluid and really easy to
learn so guys hope you enjoyed for
