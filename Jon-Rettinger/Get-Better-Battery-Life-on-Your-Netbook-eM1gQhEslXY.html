TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
going to show you how to get better
battery life on your netbook these tips
will also apply to your laptop if you
have one but netbooks notoriously have
smaller batteries so battery management
power management becomes more important
now these tips are for Windows 7 and
Windows Vista and some of them will work
on Windows XP if you're using Windows XP
most of the utilities that we're going
to use to adjust power management can be
found in the control panel so let's
start off by going to the start menu and
I want to get into advanced system
settings so I'm just going to type
system settings and here we are right
here and underperformance I'm going to
click settings now to get better battery
life you want to uncheck as many as
these items as you can possibly stand
because a lot of them like the fancy
animations and the arrow glass effect
utilize the GPU and the CPU which uses
electricity so if you can disable as
many as possible you'll get a small
incremental gain and battery life
because your your computer doesn't have
to work as hard to produce these visual
effects so that's step one step two is
that we want to go into power options so
click on start or go into control panel
and go into power options and we have a
lot of tools to work with in here so
here we are in the power options screen
and we want to click Change plan
settings and from here we can adjust
some sort of basic power plant options
we can choose to dim the display and
obviously you want to have this set as
low as possible this will dim the
display when you're not using your
computer to about fifty percent its
brightness as it is set when you're
using it also you want to set turn off
the display as low as you possibly can
stand so that's not inconvenient for you
and also you want to put the computer to
sleep the default is about 15 minutes
but it's likely that you're not going to
be not using your netbook for 15 minutes
you'll probably close the lid anyhow so
that number does it matter as much and
of course you want to adjust screen
brightness as low as you possibly can
stand because the backlight uses a
tremendous amount of power from your
device now we want to go down to change
advanced power set
we're going to go through a few things
in here the first thing that we're going
to go to is hard disk make sure that
your computer is set to turn off the
hard disk while it's on battery after a
certain amount of time five or ten
minutes makes a lot of sense if you're
using a solid-state drive this doesn't
matter as much if you're using a
mechanical hot hard drive you will see
gains if the hard drive is shutting off
after five minutes of inactivity because
it does use a significant amount of
electricity okay going down the list
wireless adapter settings you're rather
actually has to support this in order
for it to work what it does is your
router will actually buffer packets and
wait kind of microseconds to send the
information to your netbook or laptop
and your netbook current laptop will
turn off the wireless radio temporarily
saving a little bit of battery life you
can adjust this to maximum power savings
but this will actually decrease the
performance of your Wi-Fi just a little
bit so probably the best bet is to leave
it on medium power saving unless you're
trying to squeeze out every last drop of
power and battery life from your netbook
let's move on let's go to sleep make
sure you have hybrid sleep enabled what
this does is it transitions your your
netbook or laptop from sleep to
hibernate after a certain period of time
sleep is a low-power state that does use
electricity the good thing about sleep
is that your computer will go on within
about one or two seconds the downside is
that it does use your battery life while
you're not using your computer hibernate
is a much better option because it uses
pretty much no power just to illuminate
you know the LED but it takes longer to
get your computer on so what you're
going to want your computer to do is go
from sleep to hibernate after about four
or five hours that way you can still
have the convenience of using sleep but
if you're going to bed for the night or
you're going away for the day your
computer will slip out of sleep and go
into hibernate so it's not using a lot
of power while you're your way or you're
sleeping so make sure that's enabled and
then we want to go to this setting
hibernate after and I have it set at 160
minutes so after four hours it will go
from sleep to hibernate that seems to be
a good amount of time and finally we
want to go down here to where it says
battery your computer will actually shut
off after it gets to a certain critical
battery level and you can reduce this
critical battery level so he squeeze
every last minute of work time out of
your net
book or laptop so we're going to click
on critical battery action and on
battery it will hibernate after we get
to a certain percentage of battery and
that's good that's what we wanted to do
and then we want to go down the critical
battery level and the lowest you can
possibly go is two percent so when the
computer gets down the two percent it
will slip into hibernate but of course
they'll give you a warning at ten
percent and and five percent or as
specified by the low battery
notification so that you have some
morning and you know to save your
documents before the device slips into
hibernate mode so that was a look on how
to get better battery life on your
laptop and netbook I figure that you'll
get an increase about ten to twenty
percent in battery life if you implement
some of these changes and of course if
you bring the screen brightness down a
little lower and you have the display
dim even more these things all add up to
better battery life so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
