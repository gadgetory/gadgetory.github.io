TechnoBuffalo here I've had the core i7
imac throw over a week in half and
during that time pad a lot of questions
asking how it performs not the best way
to sort of show its performance was to
run a full battery of benchmarking test
so i downloaded and purchase geekbench
we're going to run this thing through it
and see how it comes out let's get
started alright so before we run the
benchmark let's review the specs of the
computer so it is running Mac OS 10
version 10.6 point for which is
currently the most updated version it's
got an intel core i7 processor o'clock
22.9 three gigahertz it's got a
gigabytes of ddr3 RAM the startup disk
or all the applications and the OS
stored is on a 256 gigabyte solid state
drive computers also equipped with the
two terabyte 7200 RPM spinning drive
let's go ahead and check out the
graphics odd is required with an ati
radeon 5750 video card so as i mentioned
i purchased deep bench we're going to go
ahead and run these tests in 64-bit and
32-bit configurations a 64-bit probably
the most accurate all the applications
and the OS itself is 64-bit however some
things are still 32 I thought people
might want to see what that was going to
look like so we are going to run both of
these tests 64-bit I think should
probably be the most accurate but let's
go ahead and get started let's start
with the 32-bit we're going to go ahead
and run the test right here I'll explain
what all of these things mean as well
we're going to go ahead and run the
benchmark and as it gives us a result
sort of all go through and talk about
what each thing means but it's not the
sort of show the overall score was in 32
and I'll sort of analyze the 64-bit
scores you can see right here you bench
is running it runs pretty quickly all we
have open right now is a screen
recording program i'm using called
screen IAM i won Firefox window open and
my external monitor is connected
everything else is closed this shouldn't
be a too taxing application for the
program to run alright so here is the
full geekbench score of 8543
the 64-bit operating system 32 it's not
really optimized for so this isn't the
most accurate test but a keeps people
were wondering what the 32-bit text was
here is the result for that let's go
ahead and now jump to the 64-bit test
and we'll go ahead and analyze that as
well let's go ahead and open this up
we'll do the same thing to take the same
amount of time to run so go ahead and
run benchmark so it's going to give us
an overall performance it's going to
talk about integer performance floating
point performance memory performance
room performance and a few others while
talk about sort of way each of those are
so it's going to measure first integer
performance and that benchmarks measure
integer performance by measuring a
variety of processor intensive tasks I
make heavy use of integer operations so
I'll just pretty much running a bunch of
processes in the background and here is
the score coming in at nine thousand 76
which is actually a bit lower than I've
seen on other tests that I run this on I
just had a bit over 10,000 when I ran
this test a few minutes ago so it's
going to be the rain varies so here is
the overall score here's the integer
performance we talked about here's a
floating point performance memory and
stream go ahead and zoom in a little bit
you guys can see what I'm talking about
we've got a 7730 74 process or integer
if you just talked about floating point
we have a score of 13,000 925 in
floating point benchmarks measure
floating-point performance by performing
a variety of processor intensive tasks
and heavy use of floating-point
operations so there's that Marion
performance 5144 memory benchmarks
measure not only the performance of the
underlying memory hardware but also a
performance of function provided by the
operations system used to manipulate in
memory and you've got a stream
performance is that final one that came
in at 4663 extreme benchmarks measure
both floating point performance and
sustained and memory bandwidth so that
is what the 64-bit test comes in at
let's run it one more time and see if we
get a higher lower score to show if
there is any sort of fluctuation in the
square pratts would be lower and will be
higher and also talk about some
their computers and how this compares
with some geekbench scores let me go
ahead and quit this and we'll try it one
more time run the 64-bit test and see if
we get sort of any different score so go
ahead and run the benchmark and we'll
see if there's any different think it's
important to run a test at least twice
to see what I guess the standard
deviation or margin of error may be so
we had a score of little over 9000 last
time we'll see if it comes in any higher
this time we're about halfway done with
the geekbench score and if you do want
to buy the software to run this it's
about twenty dollars so we gotta just
about same score looks to be pretty
accurate 9620 eight so let's see how the
Stags up to some other scores and other
of computers that have been benchmarked
let's go ahead and bring in a window
here that talked about it so these are
people that have published or deep bench
result we're all pretty recent us we've
got a macbook an older macbook late two
thousand six with a intel core like a
core two duo 1.3 came in at 2747 here's
an imac with a core i5 so pretty pretty
rough recent one here with a 2.63 giga
processor 6874 here's a late 2010
macbook pro or the core 2 duo 2.4 3000
here are some other tests here's an imac
with it's like two core two processors
12 cores ossa Mac Pro rather came in at
a whopping squirts 30,000 could keep
going down here with another mac pro
another 30,000 oh we can go ahead and
browse the most recent results and we'll
see if we have any other scores here so
here's an imac 85 I five we talked about
here's another macbook pro here's a
lenovo with a core i7 so another core i7
on a lenovo don't this laptop or desktop
says run it was running windows 32-bit
4590 1 i've got a virtualbox machine
here with an i7 chip came in at three
thousand
got a few other scores that will keep
continuing down we've got a macbook pro
13-inch early 2010 3000 here's a mac pro
with a 16,000 score here's a hackintosh
with the 5000 scoring go-ahead and there
are a lot of these you can go to browse
geekbench dot CA you can get a lot of
the scores in case you're curious so
this is how the imac stacked up its test
was pretty solid a 9000 is a relatively
decent number it's fast you can sort of
see how the integer selection shape up
here this is my computer and this is
sort of what some of the competition has
been doing or average I suppose you can
see that it's a pretty strong
considering the newer computer you'd
expect a relatively strong results I'll
go ahead and keep scrolling down so you
can see all these in case you guys are
into geekbench scores I can sort of
analyze these on your own so this was
the total score here i'll be running
another test using this in windows i've
installed windows 7 home premium via
bootcamp and we'll see how the steps up
and compares on the window side and who
dies hope you enjoyed this geekbench
score i'll be doing a ton of other tests
on the imac we doing some SSD tests and
see how the solid-state drive and preach
sings or henderson's as well so i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i will
see you or talk to you in the next video
bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
