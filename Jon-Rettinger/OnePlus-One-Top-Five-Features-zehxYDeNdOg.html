it from technobuffalo and this is the
one plus one and another one if you
don't know the one plus one's supposed
to be this year's flagship killer
sporting the same kind of specs and
design like bigger manufacturers but
with a much lower price now the 16
gigabyte model starts at just 299 the
only downside however is that they're
really hard to come at the moment
because of an invite system we've been
using the device for about a week now
and while we want to spend more time
with it before a full review we thought
we'd share some of our thoughts and tell
you what the one plus one is so exciting
now the first and most obvious thing we
love about the one plus one is a price
16 gigabyte variant and so quite starts
at 299 1 64 gigabyte version in
sandstone black is only 349 a lot of the
more popular devices today are upwards
around six hundred dollars without the
contract or around two hundred dollars
with a two-year agreement with a one
plus one you get the same high end
flagship specs for a much affordable
cost it's more compared to what you'd
pay for something like the Nexus 5
though the one plus one is still even
cheaper than that it's definitely
something that we as consumers love now
the second thing we love about the one
plus one is the camera it's got a 13
megapixel Sony Exmor sensor and an F 2
point 0 aperture with six physical
lenses that means you'll get the most
detail in your shots even in low light
it's capable shooting 4k videos and 720p
slow motion video as well since this is
running cyanogenmod the saw camera app
is also different it almost looks
something like stock Android with a few
other little tweaks now you can change
scene modes quality the picture toggle
4k recording and other neat little
features in a beautiful semi-transparent
menu the third thing we really like is
ability to switch between capacitive and
on-screen software keys in the settings
menu there's a button option where you
can change it all you want it just
depends on your preference the on-screen
keys do take up screen real estate since
the oneplus one does Sport a 5.5 inch
display you still get a lot of room for
other content if you'd rather just use
the capacitive keys you easily have that
option the only downside is that they're
very faint with no option to raise the
brightness you can however change how
long they stay illuminated you may or
may not have a preference but it's nice
to have the best of both worlds and your
fingertips the fourth thing we love
about the 1+1 is the ability to quickly
change themes what's the image in mod 11
that's already installed you can choose
from thousands of themes in the theme
showcase app or download
separately from google play store
cyanogenmod comes with a lot of
customization options already built in
in addition the themes you can change
things like font icons boot animations
and much more last but not least let's
talk about the oneplus one's design the
design is definitely up to par if not
better than most flagship that are on
the market right now it's got a
beautiful 5.5 inch 1080p display a
seamless high quality plastic bag with a
subtle curve that wraps around the phone
and a slim profile that rivals the best
mobile design out there now the
sandstone black model in particular
feels great it's got a nice felt like
material that offers good grip and it
doesn't really attract oily fingerprints
like most plastic alternatives soon
enough phone plus is going to release
different back plates or what they're
calling style Swamp they basically allow
you to replace your phone's current back
plates to match your look and style
devices don't deserve to be in cases and
with style Swamp can easily switch it up
from something like bamboo denim Kevlar
or even silk and sandstone the option
isn't available just yet the swappable
back plates look incredible and we can't
wait to see them in person so these are
just a few of the features that we like
so far and if you guys want to stay
