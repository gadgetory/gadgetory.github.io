to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup is the show
where I take a rumor from here take a
rumor from there and make rumor sandwich
for you up this week we're going to talk
about the iphone 5s supposedly offering
not only NFC key but fingerprint
scanning playstation 4 and x generation
xbox games might be getting a bit more
expensive Sprint is allegedly going to
offer a pure touchscreen blackberry 2013
it's just not the z10 i were to talk
about Motorola's rumored x phone getting
a new name and some new specs this is
rumor roundup I'm her host jon rettinger
so I didn't get started so let's begin
with the iphone 5s rumor we are hearing
that it's going to offer NFC and a
fingerprint scanner KGI securities
analyst ming-chi kuo said last week that
Apple's iPhone 5s will pack a
fingerprint scanner directly under the
home button for added security and now a
fresher mer from China is totally
backing up that claim a bit dubious
though about the home button having a
fingerprint scanner I can imagine that's
going to cause crazy software delays or
what if you're wearing gloves what if
your fingers are greasy your dirty are
all kinds of other things I could see it
being something you enable or not enable
we just have some sort of face track you
might be a good way to but we should see
this possibly relatively soon a China x
backing up those claims saying that
Apple will deploy fingerprint scanner
technology provided by authentic a
company that provides module sensors and
other hardware security associated with
fingerprint scanning the news outlet
also claims that Apple's granddad NFC
support from mobile wall capabilities
unfortunately mobile wallets haven't
been too successful United States so far
Google Wallet relied on NFC but sprint
was the only carrier to support it also
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon working on a
totally separate initiative called Isis
that is currently still in testing when
just a few US markets still though NFC
could be pretty useful for sharing data
between iOS devices like photos videos
and music and then technology had
already widely used by Android and
Windows Phone 8 smartphones so be kind
of cool to see something standardized
although it's not as quick as you might
believe NFC really is in
standardized yet though across all
devices so be interesting to see if
Apple comes in with straight Han FC
there may be some weird type of apple
product or technology the rumors though
or just that hopefully we'll see in a
few months when apple unveils the iphone
5s what do you guys think fingerprint
scanner you want that or do you want NFC
what's more important to you what do you
most want the iphone 5s to have for me i
want to redesign iOS but you take their
fingerprint scanner that you take the
NFC and keep it I just want a fresh new
OS love to hear your thoughts leave your
comments down below alright so let's go
from phones on over to gaming rumor has
it that the PlayStation 4 in next Xbox
360 console games are going to cost 70
smackeroos industry analyst Michael
Pachter held a presentation to recent
South by Southwest gaming conference
Jeff Healey who is reporting therefore
gametrailers.com was live-tweeting the
lecture keeley reports that pachter put
out a prediction regarding the price of
games next generation here's what
Keeley's tweet was he said at South by
Southwest panel at Michael Pachter says
ps4 next Xbox games likely will cost
seventy dollars about ten dollars more
in the current gen so granted before we
get all worried this is pure conjecture
on practice part I'm not totally
convinced though it's legitimates dance
either 59 99 or about 60 bucks needs to
be the sweet spot for sowing game it's
worked well for this generation I don't
see either Sony or Microsoft making the
first move to raise the prices if 60
bucks wasn't working it would have
changed over the course the past 7 plus
years of a console lifecycle it didn't
clearly it's worth mentioning no
prediction does hold true tin Tendo will
once again offer the cheapest option for
gaming software the wii's catalog
generally sold for about 50 bucks and
then we use is typically listing at
around sixty dollars so definitely see
I'm hoping that sixty dollars already
ten dollars more in generation before
that I would seem like that's probably
is a sweet spot you don't want to gouge
the customers more people to buy
obviously more you're going to make to
print the disc doesn't cost that much
money hopefully they'll sell more at 60
bucks then they would at seventy dollars
will keep our game prices at the same
level but more rumors that i want to
know aside from gaming prices what is
the next Xbox going to have hopefully
we're only a few weeks away from finding
out all that information alright so
let's jump back to phones Sprint will
allegedly offer a peer touchscreen
blackberry 2013 just not the z10 that's
already out which kind of weird spreads
already said it's not going to sell the
z10 smartphone instead offer the full
qwerty keyboard q10 later this year
which I'm super excited about the q10
looks like an awesome phone but no one's
had a chance to really play with it or
touch it I'll we had a chance to see it
at blackberry world but they wouldn't
let us use the screen or turn it on so
we really don't know how it's going to
perform that doesn't necessarily mean
though that Sprint's not going to
provide a blackberry that offers a full
screen touch screen however all things D
learned on Monday that Sprint will offer
another device still and unannounced bye
blackbird later this year with a full
touchscreen and without a qwerty
keyboard it's possible the phone's
launch will serve than exclusive because
we can't imagine why they would simply
hold off on the z10 which is already a
pretty decent phone that's just our own
speculation the phone will allegedly
launch the second half of the year
although all things D could provide any
insight whatsoever is what sort of specs
going off for how will differentiate we
already on the market z10 our guests
though will probably hear a bit more
during blackberry live sometime in May
so if you're on sprint's and you want
some full screen action you can have to
wait a few months we step back for the

room alright so let's stick with phones
and talk about the motorola x super
phone is now reportedly being dubbed a
motorola NXT or just next I guess
motorola and google are allegedly
working on a secret project together
develop the motorola x a next-generation
super foam alpaca apparently features
unlike any we've ever seen any
smartphone before and specifically will
target apple and Samsung's efforts if I
had a nickel for every time somebody
said well have a smartphone unlike
anything you've ever seen I would be a
very very rich man this X device however
is now being reportedly called the NXT
probably pronounced just simply next
apparently we can expect in 4.7 inches
bleh which we've seen full HD resolution
which we've seen 16 megapixel camera we
seem pretty close 5-megapixel
front-facing camera so that's something
new nvidia is new quad-core Tegra 4i
processor that's new and latest version
of Android what you're expecting to be
unveiled during Google's annual
developers conference coming up in May
we've seen most of the hardware and
other phones before save for the 5
megapixel front-facing camera and
Tegrity 4i processor so we're guessing
they're real groundbreaking work it's
gonna be done on the software services
side of things there's no surprise there
especially as smartphone makers begin to
rely more and more on features instead
of raw hardware specs the phone will be
the first that's built entirely by
Google and Motorola but we're not quite
sure yet this will be the next Nexus
phone or for be an entirely separate
device from Motorola all together I'm
thinking though we're probably looking
at the next Nexus in the first phone
we're gonna see launch with key lime pie
so what do you guys think you want to
wait for the X phone do you want to pick
up the galaxy s4 the HTC One or you just
sick of waiting for phones you just want
to freaking buy something leave your
