release of four hundred and seventy six
different smartphones you can you can
check that if you'd like it took a long
time to get that number as we look back
on all those phones that got released
there were some that were incredible
some that were less than incredible and
one thing became clear that is hard to
find a bad phone nowadays no matter how
much money you want to spend but still
several phones rose to the top so I want
to pick smart phones of the year for
2017 we've broken it down into five
different categories and the last one
will be my smartphone in the year
alright so every rectangle you hold in
your hand you're looking at the screen
so it makes sense to start with the best
display this winner should come as no
surprise the Galaxy Note 8 has the best
screen of any smartphone I have seen in
2017 which also means the best grand
smartphone I have ever seen
this could be extended as well to the s8
and the SI plus but this screen is
absolutely incredible
Samsung screens are I think always been
amongst the best for some they're a
little too saturated but I loved the way
it looked it worked well in direct
sunlight pictures look beautiful colors
were vibrant the screen often times look
like a sticker on the display I
absolutely love what Samsung has done
and to come as no surprise our runner-up
screen is also made by Samsung that is
the screen on the iPhone 10 is the
runner-up here it is a beautiful screen
in its own rights if I had to pick just
one which is my video so it did Galaxy
Note 8 takes the best display
our next let's jump into the best camera
and cameras took a huge jump in 2017 I
think bigger than we've seen in any
previous year we're looking at
borderline DSLR quality when it comes
smartphones but hands-down the best
camera that I tested these on paper
didn't look like it should have been the
best camera but it goes to the pixel -
and the pixel to excel the cameras are
incredible I'm not just talking about
the rear cam which is incredible in its
own right portrait mode looks awesome
it's only gotten better with the machine
learning it's worked great in any
situation whether it's a low-light
whether there's a ton of sunlight
whether they're shadows or nachos the
pictures always look incredible it also
extends on a front-facing camera where
portrait mode lives as well and those
shots look equally good it's almost
impossible to take a bad picture with
the pixel to the pixel to XL camera
Google absolutely nailed to this one
friend for our runner up it seems always
bridesmaid never a bride the camera on
the iPhone 10 takes this one as well I
think when it comes to rear cameras it
would have been close to a tie but the
front camera on the pixel - far
outshines their front-facing camera on
the iPhone 10 especially when it comes
to portrait shots so for the next
category let's go to the most underrated
smartphone this category could have also
been the most under the radar smartphone
or the best smartphone you didn't
consider it goes to the LG V 30 this was
our social guy Jessie we're teases
favorite phone of the year and for a
really good reason the camera is
incredible the OLED screen is absolutely
beautiful battery life lasts for
seemingly days everything about this
phone screams flagship and a flagship
now and a really good value so if you're
looking to get a phone that maybe not
everybody's gonna have the LG v 30 is an
awesome phone and it should definitely
be on your radar although I juiced your
software is a little bit better but
that's what that's what launchers are
for again we saw a ton of phones come
out this year but some were surprising
if I film this video like three months
ago this phone probably would have won
the biggest bus award but the biggest
surprise of 2018 goes to the new cover
on the block
and that's the essential pH one I love
what essential is done recently dropping
the price at 500 bucks alone it makes
this phone of Steel you're getting one
of the best builds of any phone that I
have ever held and I've held a lot of
phone's ceramic and titanium then octo
is a camera that you've done an
incredible job pushing out camera
updates since all the initial reviews
hit they've added portrait mode in fact
as a day of this filming they push an
update that enabled 360 video on
Facebook on YouTube got a 360 camera
that can attach to it you've got
potential for modularity the cameras
actually gotten pretty good here as well
it's got pretty solid battery life this
is my favorite phone to hold in my hand
and if you're looking to spend a 500
bucks and you want the best feeling
phone out there a phone that feels fly
ship and feels premium I've been really
surprised and impressed with the
essential pH one get in white I love I
loved it away and without further ado
the smart phone of the year and I tested
a lot of phones this year and I love
mobile technology but the phone that I
look back on most fondly is my favorite
phone that I tested a figure four they
actually went out and bought and spent
my own money on that is clearly the note
eight I've absolutely loved this phone
it's not the phone that won me back from
iOS that crown goes to the galaxy s 8
plus but it's the phone that kept me
from going back to iOS I love everything
about the note obviously this blazing
Sat one that category
I love the form factor I loved didn't
narrowness of an L slope you get the
giant screen everything about this phone
screams premium if you could check off
every flagship box it's here you've got
wireless charging you've got incredible
fast Shirdi you've got the s-pen you
even have a headphone jack built-in
expandable storage there is nothing that
I don't like about this phone except for
all the duplicate apps and Samsung
insists on shoving on their phones but
you can throw those in a folder and
ignore some software foe pause for a
phone that's been absolutely incredible
performance-wise have been great I love
this phone in fact it's gonna be the
phone it's gonna be in my pocket and the
calendar flips from 2070 to 2018
Samsung's got a home run on their hand
the note 8 thank you excited for at the
galaxy s 9 that's 9 + are gonna be and
of course what the note 9 is going to be
next year but for right now my favorite
phone of the year that encompasses
everything that I love about phones goes
to the Galaxy Note 8 so those are smart
phones in here and I can't read the
comments yelling me that I didn't
mention your miscellaneous Sony phone or
Huawei phone and perhaps we did not
check out here at TechnoBuffalo this is
my video and my choice and my awards and
I love these phones especially when it
comes to the note 8 but let me know in
the comments down below why you think
I'm wrong why you think I'm right I'd
love to hear it get the video a thumbs
up we appreciate it and of course a
little bell to notify when new videos
are coming hope you guys enjoy it
until next time I'm John render from
