to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and on today's episode of rumor roundup
we'll be talking about the iphone 6s
Sony's Xperia z5 Samsung's giant new
tablet in the Huawei Nexus this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
samsung was one of the first companies
to push smartphones into phablet
territory now the galaxy maker could be
trying something similar with a
mysterious new tablet a recent shipping
log spotted by nowhere else reveals that
the company seems to be testing seven
copies of an 18.4 inch slate the device
is described as a tablet pc samsung also
notes that it plans to destroy the
devices once evaluation process is
finished it's unclear what Samsung has
planned here we doubt the company would
release an 18.4 inch android tablet for
regular use then again with apple's ipad
pro reportedly on the horizon samsung
may be looking to preempt the release
with its own supersize slate still it
seems more likely this could be a big
hybrid two in one device we're not
expecting this mysterious device to turn
up any time soon clearly Samsung is just
trying to test out the idea for now and
there's no guarantee this model will
ever see the light of day in the
meantime it looks like the company could
have a new tablet planned for next
week's unpack event so it probably won't
be anywhere near as big as 18.4 inches
another day calls for another look at
the upcoming xperia z5 in its compact
sibling twitter tips are busy leaks is
back with a new image of the rumored
smartphones though this time the leak
comes with some disappointing news as
you can see from the images both the
xperia z5 and xperia z5 compact will
sport regular micro USB connectors that
means the company won't be adopting
reversible USBC technology well at least
for now on the bright side that means we
probably won't have to sacrifice quick
charge capability hopefully Sony will
also include wireless charging in its
new flagship phone based on previous
leaks we're also expecting both devices
to feature a fingerprint reader built
into the power button overall the design
isn't expected to change much compared
to previous models though the power
button is getting bigger to accommodate
the new sensor as a result the volume
controls have also moved closer to the
bottom of the phone we're also expecting
the Xperia z5 to pack a 4500 milliamp
battery four gigabytes of RAM welcomes
latest snapdragon processor and a 20.7
megapix
camera meanwhile the Xperia z5 compact
could include similar specs and features
any smaller but slightly thicker body
Sony appears to be set to unveil its new
xperia z line up next month in an event
on September second but before then you
can probably expect plenty more leaks
for the Xperia z5 n z5 compact LG's
rumored new Nexus has been getting most
of the attention recently but Google is
expected to release two new stock
Android smartphones this year now we're
getting a look at a second device from
Huawei a leaked video of the upcoming
Huawei Nexus appears to confirm several
key features including a fingerprint
sensor on the rear panel and a USBC
connector along the bottom edge the
primary camera also looks pretty big
though there's no way of knowing how
many megapixels it will actually pack
for now as for the design there's
nothing too impressive here earlier
rumors suggested the Nexus phablet could
sport a unibody metal build but that
doesn't seem to be the case instead we
may get metal edges and a plastic back
panel then again it's possible this is
just an early prototype and not the
final design based on previous leaks
we're also expecting a 5.7 inch quad HD
display a Snapdragon 810 or 820 chip a
21 megapixel rear camera and wireless
charging Google probably won't reveal
its new Nexus lineup for at least a few
more months at least if the last few
years are any indication but hopefully
we'll know more soon let me stop the
video real quick and thank our friends

word in caps at domain coms check Apple
is reportedly delayed production of the
new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus by one
to two weeks production is expected to
begin later this month with a possible
release in September the news comes from
KGI Securities analyst ming-chi Kuo who
usually has ear to the ground on Apple's
supply chain movements you DN a Chinese
news outlet that cited quos recent
report then provide a reason for the
delay it's possible Apple is making sure
its suppliers are better prepared for
quality control and issue that has
affected iPhone production in the past
or that it's waiting for additional
parts that haven't yet arrived the new
iPhones are expected to introduce new
features such as a forced touch display
and an even stronger build
the report suggested the production
delay won't affect the announcement of
Apple's iPhones nor its launch and
rather than Apple suppliers are just
getting off to a later start than
originally expected anyways that's it
