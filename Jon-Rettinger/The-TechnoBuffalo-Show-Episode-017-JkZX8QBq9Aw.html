TechnoBuffalo show I'm I'm your three
host for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site i'm joined by executive
editor dormobile todd haselton everybody
and executive editor of gaming joey
davidson what's up guys how are you guys
doing today yes yes yes yes yes I'm
doing yes yes well that's the first time
in several weeks that all three of us
have been able to get together yeah
that's right yeah man III and Google i/o
and negotiations and riot vacations Todd
how was your vacation man i haven't
toast good it was good i did mostly
fishing the entire time oh I wouldn't I
went crabbing nice i love trivia is good
man i worked ah but in november i'll go
on vacation oh yeah there you go and
next week i'm in irvine we haven't
figured out how we're handling the show
next week yet that's like what oh yeah
yeah that's that's exactly what it is
hey I actually have to like where normal
people clothes go to the office go to
the office yeah put on a hands and put
on pants and interact with people and
there's no sheets hanging there Oh God
maybe I should just take the sheet with
me and hang it up so I feel like I'm at
home here at all exactly so this week we
actually don't have a whole heck of a
lot to discuss I'm sure we will think of
some tangents as we go along but of
course the big one is we published our
review yesterday of the Samsung gear
live the first android wear watch and
Todd and I both bought the G watch from
LG and yeah mines now here's some here's
something telling for you I'm wearing
the pebble the g luck and i just put on
charger i put this on for the city to
show ya
wow that kind of bummed yeah I this I
feel safe and saying this is one of my
largest regret purchases of her whoa
yeah it's not i mean i was and i wrote
an editorial on this yesterday if
anybody wants to read it on the site but
basically i was under the impression
that Android wear had or was going to
soon have this ecosystem of apps just
like pebble or kind of run alone on the
watch but really they're android apps
with built in android wear support and
there's there's no consistency to how
they work so you go from one application
all the cooks i think it's called i kept
saying it was all the recipes but you
can send a recipe down under your watch
now that's useful but then you go to an
app like lyft and you're supposed to
interact with it on the watch by saying
like call me a ride but then it crashes
if you're not in a lift market and
you're not sure why you don't know
what's going on and then there's eat24
where one would think you could say
order food and that would launch but it
doesn't and when you try to say start
eat 24 that starts to command and that
it pops up with a list of applications
for me it would bring up be 24 and it's
just it's just all over the place i
don't even know how to use some of the
applications and i think that was the
biggest problem for me yeah I mean John
you know mentioned it in his review that
you know the the G the gear live has a
button on the side which makes
navigation a little bit easier you and I
chose the G watch because of the larger
battery right yeah the larger battery
has done us a world of good we still
have to charge every 12 hours or so
exactly yeah you gotta keep it plugged
in at night and then it'll get you
through the day and then you've got to
plug in it again otherwise you're not
get well have you run into the situation
yet where you do run out of power no no
so that's good but I do you charge it
every night so I'm getting through the
day yes but when you do run out of power
there's no way to turn it on but to put
it in the cradle right back on the
charger I read that and that's wild but
at least I guess aren't charged
are better than the samsung one which is
awkward and I read reports about it
didn't happen to argued it but I've read
reports about the battery of the
charging mechanism getting all that
stuff and breaking just terrible well
apparently on the G watch you can there
on the back above the charging things
there's the reset button you can use a
paperclip and turned on that way but
that's you know because I always have a
paper straightened paper clip with me at
all times funny enough I actually you
carry a paper clip very frequently for
swapping sim cards but that makes sense
but yeah it's oh I Joey in you expressed
a lot of interest in the Moto 360 now
that we've had experience with Android
where's that interest still there for
you um well I think that the I really
don't I hope I'm not speaking out of
line here with you guys but I think that
you are suffering from the early
adopters curse vine hardware that is
arguably very half-baked and you've
bought into it when they're the
third-party development is literally at
it look at its lowest point like it will
the third party app selection will never
be as bad as it is right now that's such
a great point and that's when you guys
you guys generically not not you Todd
that's what you guys started to decided
that you needed to do your reviews when
the user experience was at its worst
right with that well I think we should
revisit this I mean and we cattle
futures you have something I mean it's
it's what John and this is something
that the the public doesn't know but but
jon rettinger and and you Sean have
talked to my department about reviewing
the gaming consoles once every year
because they do change and perhaps
Android wear will deserve a second look
in three months six months nine months a
year right now it's like it's like
reviewing a roller coaster on the uphill
climb you know what I mean like they're
not even really getting the full scope
of the ride you've got the initial start
now with that said we're not even on the
uphill climb we're still in the load
live yeah you've you forgetting a magic
shoulder thing on yeah that's right so
with that said you have quelled my
interest in the Moto 360 at the onset I
will not be in line at the beginning I
am still incredibly interested in
smartwatches if i look at the android
that my phone had five years ago next to
the android that my phone has today
they're wildly different user
experiences and I think that we expected
that same level of Polish and and design
and approach that we have on our phones
I mean obviously with a different like
way to interact with it and when we
didn't get it we're disappointed as we
should be it is disappointing and all
the hands-on videos I've seen the way
that they behave in sunlight is
atrocious yeah yeah I mean all that
stuff is making me go I'm gonna wait I'm
not given up on it yet I know you guys
aren't giving up on it yet but no the
Moto 360 still has my attention I'm just
not going to be in line to get it I have
faith in the genre of product but I
think that we've reviewed it too early
we that the earth has reviewed it too
early because it's just not this isn't
these opinions they're not that useful
yet you know what I mean mmhmm yeah I
mean look at the pebble before when it
first came out it was he a limited now
you crying Jay would look Sean what
would you give the pebble today versus
what would you have given it's not a
ten-point scale when it first launched
when it very first launched I probably
would get like a five or six and now I
definitely give it an eight same and how
many years are we talking about here
Todd when what year did the pebble
launch I don't know not that long ago
right I mean I got mine probably a
little over a year ago a year ago so
right now that's the difference and
improvement that is released in 2013
there you go so a small company like
pebble brought their own device up three
points for Shaun what do you think
Google's gonna do you know I mean a lot
and I think that's what I was I was
trying to say in the editorial yesterday
like it's certainly gonna take time
because you look at the
eppler I'm looking at the specs right
now this thing has like a cpu I've never
heard of 128 kilobytes of memory a
sleepy you I've no it's like you're
describing the stats of a printer right
now right exactly and I'm just so this
just goes to show and the pebble right
now is super super powerful now the
smart watches that we have the g watch
from the gear live how Snapdragon 400
processors like Snapdragon 400 processor
powers the desire 610 the Lumia 635 like
all these smartphones so there's a lot
of unused power I think there's a ton of
unused power in the settings there you
know what's going to change you know
well you know and and it's a good
analogy Joey about going back and
looking at the game consoles a year down
the road you know and you compare what
was at the launch and say the xbox one
on launch day compared to a year from
now and it could change your opinion
greatly it already has they already have
with software updates Microsoft and Sony
have both been crushing it Microsoft
especially has been going every single
month the xbox one from launch versus
the one that we have today is already
different yeah yeah exactly and and so I
mean I'm not gonna sell off my my G
watch I'm gonna keep it around I you
know I but for right now I'm still gonna
wear the pebble instead and the G watch
will just you know whenever I hear
there's a massive update i'll give it
another look and see if my opinions
change i just say this the these two
watches have picked my interest for the
pebble yeah that's a side effect i think
that pebbles pretty excited about but
you know and i have to say i mean when
when we first saw the android wear
launch at Google i/o I was like um you
know poor pebble you know what's going
to happen to them especially with the
iWatch coming as well and I i have to
agree to Joey I think it actually
android wear ended up being a boost for
pebble how many how many videos have you
seen or videos pictures anything
articles that have the Android wear
devices that the g and the gear live
right next to pebble and the screens are
like this is the pebble you can read the
number
is here I need you can't see anything
like you a lot with this and you can't
with this yet I think yeah it's great
advertising almost I mean it
unintentional advertising right right
I'm sure pebbles like yes no I it's an
excellent point and you know I I'm
definitely yo now I'm kind I've even
went maybe I should get a pebble steel
nail you know right that's a side effect
of the G watch yeah it's yeah i mean the
sunshine issue is unbelievable I mean
I'm sorry I can only really use my watch
inside yeah basically yeah yeah but
that's insanity but you know it is why
it is but I do think Android wear is
going to Tim because it goes down the
road I they like the Moto X nice
considering how much power is in the G
watch and in the gear live you know like
you said Todd that it's running
Snapdragon 400 processors that's a lot
of untapped power it's a lot of untapped
potential a you look at the number of
Android wear a Android wear apps I'm
using that loosely because they're not
Android wear apps yet right you know
there's there's going to be a lot of
room for growth here and Joey you're one
hundred percent right we're suffering
from early adopter regret total yeah i'm
i'm on for the roller coaster ride let's
see where it goes now that being said I
think there are some definite physical
design issues exist I just want to go
back to that roller coaster metaphor
imagine if you're at all it goes just
love the corpus and you're in you're the
guy getting strapped it and there's a
dude next to you going this sucks you
guys right now this ride sucks it's
right stuff we haven't even started oh
I'm gonna go to that somewhere it's you
know I am I may be going to Disneyland
this weekend so i'll stand outside the
hundred
the line going this ride socks off I
know we haven't even gotten in the
scratching room yet this right socks
funnier since is my all-time favorite
right uh so Sasha mahalo to ask a
question about hey sean how does your LG
G water be your pebble and comparable
still compete with the new android wear
watches yes it can and do you know the
fact that we're all discussing that
maybe this respect thing that ever
happened to pebble I think that does
yeah they can bear is it's a really
interesting side effect now all this
being said do you guys think that you
know on top will start with you you know
does apple have enough time to learning
lessons from Android we're not not
saying that they were gonna have
problems but do they have enough time to
go whoa maybe we need to change this we
have to wonder out the strategy's gonna
go right are they gonna follow the
strategy that pebble has done and sony
has done and samsung has done we're on
the watch itself you can go and launch
these apps by tapping which I like a lot
where are they gonna go voice only with
some kind of Siri google now approach
with what which is what you have with
Android wear and you're supposed to use
your voice a lot more often which I find
less appealing I just want to tap around
and get the sports scores or whatever
you know and instead of asking so i
think if apple's learning any lessons it
should be to provide options and that's
why the android wear mini i think the
mini launcher i think i said it's called
um it's an awesome third-party app for
android wear and i think it's a must hat
you can swipe from the corner of the
screen and bring up all the apps and
then it makes asked accessing stuff a
little easier so a full-fledged sort of
launcher would be ideal to and I which
am I the only one that and maybe I am I
just want to ask am I the only one who
feels like a drunk slurring idiot every
time he says ok Google now like no it's
so weird it's like ok Google well on
your on your phone cuz you've the Moto X
ok Google now is the command to wake it
up ah yeah I know what I'm most other
greater idiots just ok Google I can't I
can't even do it can get a bit ok you
will that ok Google now like oh hey hey
ok fools bad enough ok Google mouths
when I was living with my friends I was
on vacation with my friends last week
and I kept unlocking my watch and if you
say okay google it starts activating so
people are yelling across the room like
ok Google ok Google tryna Carson butts
pictures of butts like pictures of buzz
yeah I don't know I I think I mean we we
really don't know what the interface is
gonna be on the iWatch although yeah
we've heard all these taylor and i watch
you guys it's they're a tough question
aight aight i am going to unequivocably
say that is definitely in development
hey I can't say for sure it's going to
launch this fall but there is no
question in my mind that is in
development is is this horse going to
run as fast as the unicorn we've heard
about that's the question that I yeah I
mean this thing is it's supposed to be
the best thing in the world at this
point so all right so like yeah I'd
monitor every piece of your health I
mean like every like how how tall that I
grow today hey Sean my point is I
hesitate getting excited about a product
that doesn't exist and I don't I might
exist internally at Apple I mean like it
I don't know maybe I I totally agree and
i'm i'm not trying to build up
excitement around the iWatch but with
everything that's gone on and with how
Android wear has been received I'm just
carry you know apples hired a gajillion
people to work on this thing apparently
uh someone says they were hold on ok
will ok Google are we activating the
phone yeah xbox on stop it
do Eric know it's like that blasted
Aaron Paul commercial that doesn't do
anything to my xbox it doesn't mine
either it might might connect sits right
in front of the television right uh I I
have to think that that if if Apple
actually has an iWatch and that's that's
a giant if from joey davidson the
executive editor of gaming so don't call
me an authority here because i'm not
that's my point if Apple has an iWatch I
wonder if they've been waiting for
Android wear to kind of to roll off just
to see like what the reception's been is
it worth our time to put this out is
there a market for this I maybe they're
waiting for Google and everyone else to
test the waters before jumping in
themselves maybe or maybe they're gonna
stick with phones because they're
incredibly popular and profitable for
them you know does apple need that need
that watch market share do they even
need it oh well it was clear for the
taking I I do i draw the oh who was it
was a Katy Huberty the other day predict
yes 40 million yet 60 million units in
the first year yeah okay for that i
watch there is no way that's as many
what was that that's as many iphones his
apples all the first year so yeah no way
none yeah she attributed to the halo
effect aka the fanboy effect like all
these Apple fans are gonna go out and
buy it and that was at three hundred
dollar price point to which I cited in
the different stuff heels are in a
different report Nielsen said what was
it sixty four percent of wearable buyers
think that the price range between two
hundred three hundred dollars is already
too expensive so and that's people who
own wearables so you have to imagine
they're probably not going to spend that
much more and then you get a look at the
people who already don't unwearable too
expensive sorry had 300 i'l or 60
million units that's a lot I don't know
yeah yeah and now it's the idea that 60
million was even Brandi too bad I'm just
right well I mean people said tablets
weren't going to be popular either and
they said the ipad was an oversized ipod
touch and you know I don't do I mean
change this the market we all had
regular phones and now we all have
smartphones and I think a lot of ways if
Apple does it better than somebody else
or if Google does it better than then
we'll start to see these become more
mainstream products but you know right
now it's obviously pretty what you keep
oh yeah it's it's definitely a geek toy
yeah so yeah I I don't know hey I think
wearables do have a future I just I
think we're in I I think we've got a lot
of companies racing forward to have
their foot in that door and they weren't
ready to put their foot in that door
maybe but with watches though to you
face obstacles that he didn't face with
smartphones right like i have my
favorite watches one my wife bought me
for my wedding so it has sentimental
value so for a lot of reasons i might
not buy other watches or where other
watches and i think a lot of people
might have that too they have a watch
they got for retirement or other things
and so you didn't face that in the
smartphone industry or with the tablets
because people didn't have sentimental
value attached to things let alone a
jewelry factor in and fashion and and
you know a three-hundred-dollar watch in
some circles we might make you look
before because it's not a Rolex you know
what i'm saying i do agree with you shot
and i think that there's and there's
also that that whole market gap of
people that just literally don't want to
have their stuff stolen from them right
off their wrist yeah your people who
live in cities are hesitant to use their
cell phone on train sometimes cell phone
smartphones on train sometimes so why
rock a three-hundred-dollar watch that
can be easily identified and yanked off
your wrist I've run the picture one time
on technobuffalo ages ago of a sign I
saw in a neighborhood in London a couple
years back it showed the silhouette of
somebody walking down the street with an
ipod and I like in a big puffy jacket
staring at him and it was just on
silhouettes it said they want your pod
my application what are your youth issue
warnings on stuff like rest of us yeah
but just that always cuttin do so unless
you'll be put they want your watch that
exactly it's crazy but you know in New
York on the subways back when the when
the ipod was still coming out and super
popular like they were born against the
white earbuds because it sort of told
every I remember that yeah every wasn't
basically wearing those earbuds you were
like signaling yourself as someone who
had something expensive like an iPhone
yeah right instead our sweet walkman
yeah duly boy yeah bootleg earpods off
of a um ebay for a dollar 49 right right
I i I'm wearing fluorescent green
earbuds I read that came with HTC and
made oh the Harman Kardon ones no no no
these aren't even though so I didn't
find very good there too slick the court
system oh it's all the art the deep
discussions that we get in technology
yeah I find this cord to be to stuff
right morning is just not working for me
I so oh good grief well moving on to
some other questions I've come in uh
here's one from Sasha Mahal about what
are some features of Android wear that
you like and wetter ones that you could
do without it and what about features
that you would like to see in a future
update I I think Todd we're in agreement
apps on the watch right right and then
you get that with with the wear mini
swipe mmm which I still need to download
yeah it's cool but like other things to
like fit is stupid because it's
incorrect all the time like I can take
sense from your students oh oh you have
the pedometer it yeah thing is react if
we want to get back into that car seat I
know I know I'm very carefully how to
cons that but it's just not my thing
like I don't say like like take a note
you know feed the dog like who does that
you'd know but he does these things like
they sounds so cool and when I guys when
an engineer's on stage like take it a
note you know no pick up milk but nobody
touched that you forget the milk that's
what you did you know yeah no I or you
write it on these papers and I'm sorry
it it does feel silly going ok Google
yeah it does lets you think ok cool what
what's that report from the police
station this is Dick Tracy I'm on my way
yeah right like hearing you show me my
steps agenda set a timer start start
stopwatch set alarm show alarms settings
and start and like you have to dig into
that menu to get to start to get to the
apps unless you say start and then the
name of t hat it's just so silly now it
but like joey said Jodi wrote a report
at Google i/o after Google i/o saying
that Google's engineers are designing
things for google it silly you don't
wonder like there's something to that
yeah yeah yeah did you consumer testing
with this stuff no but I Joey's right
you and I are the idiotic guides on the
roller coaster going those Red Sox yeah
I know it's true i mean i bought it the
second it was available for google play
right guilty as charged yeah and I'm
excited to see where it goes up were
just commenting and answering that
question yeah i I'm not Shaun just to
kind of derail the conversation someone
on YouTube is asking us to talk about
Apple and IBM oh yeah that's interesting
stuff that broke what I don't know 4 30
yesterday do you know that's on Vega be
sweet this happened after I was off the
clock so I don't even know anything
about it I'm no well no yes a very
interesting so yeah we see that sort of
the exclusive interview with Tim Cook I
just happen to have a TV on we were
watching Yahoo earnings came out and so
they're talking about this new
partnership between IBM and apple and
Tim Cook was saying it was a natural fit
how
you've been working with IBM for a
couple years and now it's bright time
suits and it's it's apple's big step
into the enterprise and as a result i
mean it looks it looks like a fire
across a shot across BlackBerry's bad
right because BlackBerry's bits were
enterprise King along with Microsoft
colada boys and now so I can see what
are they trying to do with IBM though
what's what's how IBM is going to
provide a special suite of applications
built like security and business
applications and it's also going to sell
these devices directly to its customers
provide a back-end a device management
solutions which is similar to what EES
is blackberry enterprise server would
that allow so really this is like apples
huge step into the enterprise we're like
companies instead of a lot of companies
already have BYOD initiatives where you
bring your own device to work it could
be an iphone or android or whatever but
there are still lots of companies it's
still my brother works for a bank for
example they still issue BlackBerry's so
now this is potential for IBM to go to
its customers who might already be these
banks and say hey we have the iphones in
Selma to directly will get guys all set
up in kind of a bad way which i think is
huge that is this apples attempt to
plant a flag in the ground and maybe
maybe claim some of that enterprise
workspace from Microsoft as well oh yeah
yeah and the thing is Apple's has said
in Tim Cook clarify this yesterday too
it's already in like nine percent of the
forge global fortune 500 company so it's
already there but this is a huge step to
sort of deploy its devices including
iPads to the enterprise mmm and the
Magnificent result blackberry stocks
down an apple and IBM her up in it it
was yeah is gonna be on the squeeze from
this big time yeah I'm not very well now
it's down eight point one percent Todd
that's scamming that's scary for them
you have problem two of the market
leaders getting together and literally
saying blackberry your duns oh well you
know they things go on sir did you see
Todd yesterday how many people posted
the old picture of Steve Jobs standing
under the IBM logo and flipping it off
no really not again
yeah it's an old picture because when he
first started apple with Wozniak that
was his big thing he did I know I'd the
IBM in the early 90s late 80s is very
different than the IBM of today me idea
back then made computers like consumer
computers yeah you know I told that to
lenovo ya know it's a completely
different company now and so yeah I mean
yes everyone had their their good
chuckles out of posting that picture but
that's like comparing apples to oranges
literally and it's just two completely
different worlds and mindsets at that
time yeah but this is a huge move for
Apple you know because Apple to this
point has been viewed as a consumer
company right and you know be 1x rice
like exactly and even when I tried to
see like our devices are in the
enterprise because they are it's sort of
always came back well you know but still
there's other options and now a sort of
IBM it's like Enterprise I mean that's
what you really think of so let's go
know that this was a big big move for
Apple and you know kudos to them my
blackberry though I mean this may have
been the death blow it makes you wonder
I mean they still there so get it you
know hype their security up which IBM is
obviously doing the same thing I mean
they said security a thousand times
yesterday up an interview but blackberry
is still going to hide their security
they're pushing forward I mean today we
saw a blackberry assistant I also done a
chuckle there it's just it's getting to
the point where you have to wonder what
their strategy is I mean when Apple's
getting into their core space yeah
that's got to be scared for blackberry
which arias would have happened
obviously with the device massively yeah
I mean but I mean hey blackberry has the
passport coming yeah which they push
today with blackberry assistant their
new Siri competitor never let me know we
were commenting like blackberry
assistant who's sitting around like
let's come up with something blackberry
assistant that sounds snappy what
I mean it makes sense in the business
world yes accessible on and I said it
does yeah exactly it does makes em
blackberry is very much an enterprise
company and we understand you you don't
have no snappy names and corporate but
still you know when your company ads in
this much trouble you put a little bit
of effort into the name to do something
right they revealed it but that but held
off on like explaining all that it can
do which makes it seem like a watered
down version of all the competitors it's
like it's an assistant it can schedule
things for you and read your emails but
like can it tell me a sports score and
doesn't use Google to query that or Bing
or something else like how does it work
and we didn't really get that
explanation yeah i don't know i haven't
play with blackberry 10.3 another sleep
fields out there so I'm sure somebody
out there those happens well next week
is the the show to end all shows for the
year even though it's not technically in
our field san diego comic-con hmm where
all the where all the geeks gel migrate
to as of going to the Holy Land and
actually I for the first for the first
time in 18 years God has been 18 years
at the first 18 years I'm going just for
one day but it'll be interesting to see
huh no this is my first one in 18 years
I went I mean unique yeah I went 92
threw 95 every was like she didn't you
own a store no I I owned a store plus I
was working for like wizard magazine or
combo magazine at the time so for me it
actually was a work trip the five times
I went but what one question here from
Sasha Mahal related to a story yesterday
about a hey Sean what do you think of
the new Thor they made Thor female aim
at one point Thor was a frog in the 80s
really yes and they called him the
Thunder frog don't don't go any deeper
there
at one point he was replaced by an alien
named beta ray bill you know so the way
Marvel will do this is by the time the
second Avengers movie comes out it will
be back to the Thor we all know because
when somebody walks into a comic shop
having seen the second Avengers movie
they're going to want to buy a book with
that Thor they're not going to want to
buy a book with a female Thor so they'll
split female Thor off into her own book
and main Thor will be back who's who's
writing it uh Gail Simone she does a lot
of the i believe it is Gail Simone I
believe so I there's every chance it's
gonna be a good story I I have no
problems with them going down this road
but i also have been around the comma
chemistry long enough to know this is
very temporary I want to see who's who's
the author I just goes with marble calm
they've got a page up there that lists
all the UH the staff on it poor is kind
of a manly name I mean it back into the
Norse mythology yes Thor was always a
male but yeah it's marble apparently
tonight on The Colbert Report Joe casada
the editor-in-chief of marble is going
to announce another new title in a a
bold new direction for marble because
I've never heard that before heyo having
worked in the industry it's jason aaron
jason aaron okay i'm not even familiar
with him he's been working on store for
a little while I don't know if he was
right after stints key or not but yeah
yeah I haven't followed thorn a long
time I totally awesome there for a stint
when J michael Straczynski was doing it
it was pretty exceptional I don't know
about Jason Aaron so yeah I just Thor's
been one of those characters I just kind
of float in and out on hmm throughout
the years I I don't think I've ever done
a big long run with Thor like i did with
like say père David on the Hulk or
something but wow that got really geeky
there for a minute because they uh I
news Dominique whoever wants to know how
accurate is the pedometer compared to
the pedo meter
I I haven't driven by a school with the
G watch yet right ahead yeah Alex out of
here I'll Drive by a school here in the
near future and it's almost lunchtime Oh
guys oh I didn't mean I was gonna heat
the trip if it's anywhere is anchored at
the pedometer it's not very accurate so
right yeah uh I tried so worse just like
I was I was wearing this and I had my
galaxy s5 I think I hadn't leaped up to
you and like they're both telling me
different steps so just like oh he said
things what's the point there's no point
if it's wrong here's another question
this one's for you Joey from Dominique
Webber thoughts on the assassins creed
movie the movie I am paying it no mind
there's my thoughtful I'm not I'm not i
I just I don't video game movies don't
register for me they they never have
they probably never will I recognize
that some fans get super excited for
them and that's really cool um the only
one that's even on my radar is uncharted
and that's simply because i think it's
the series that its most adaptable to
film movies and games are wildly
different beasts and one of the reasons
why assassin's creed is so thrilling as
a game is because planning an assassin
climbing a building and then jumping off
of it and killing some european dude is
awesome like it's like a really awesome
feeling and i don't know if they'll be
able to take that feeling and translate
it into a movie i don't know if that
being able to do it yourself as part of
the thrill seeing it on the screen i'm
just like it's kind of like if they ever
need to really bring in the series i
really want them to talk to you doing i
want to be called kill some european
dudes killing simulator historical
european killing simulator exactly it's
a what opera is just sore o kind of
zorro but like a total could jump from
roofs that's the arrows i I mean it's
exciting i'm excited for them i'm just
uh
would be I'm more inclined to get
excited about something like Uncharted
which is pretty much just Indiana Jones
with more guns that's all it is so you
know I I've never played in the Silent
Hill series but I watched the first
movie and as a movie it was enjoyable
it's just you're talking about a series
that I'm not into a franchise of films
that I'm not into so no the second movie
was horrible the first movie I actually
enjoyed it was entertaining you know but
then everyone so I like you know one day
I was surfing on cable and I saw dead or
alive was coming on yeah oh why not i'll
watch this I was like oh god make it
stop what a film that was just make it
stop kind of like the mortal kombat
movie hey no yeah i think it's hard to
like any movie after watching pitch
perfect let's just this is funny i just
looked at my phone in the Google Play
stores well Todd that's just acha
awesome so and there's so many good
lines that oh and they're filming a
sequel right now are they really are
yeah I filled that to pitch perfect ER
and I believe it's just pitch perfect 2
but too perfect to pitch tutor I'm sorry
anytime there's any movie with the two
in it I just immediately go electric
Boogaloo yeah it's just it's it's
ingrained into me to just say whatever
two electric boogaloo but oh my anyway a
question from the killing machine what
do you guys think about the iphone 6 do
you guys think it's worth the upgrade
and what is your favorite spec about it
we can't answer this um you know yeah we
have a dummy unit at the office but I
mean we don't know the definite specs we
don't know any of the definite features
answer privacy yeah except iOS 8
you know I mean if you own an iphone now
and you're waiting to upgrade to an
iphone you should certainly wait well
there's the big question that I ok you
know if you're on a 5s definitely no
it's too soon if you're going to five
maybe anything before the five year or
whatever if you want to seeing the
iphone ecosystem if you're got a 4 or 4s
than definitely you're going to want to
consider the six not even the six
necessarily but you should wait until
it's unveiled to make your decision
because yes the six comes out regardless
of how good or bad it is the prices on
the other phones are gonna plummet so
yep at this point it's just it's worth
your time to wait no matter what
definitely definitely yeah I if you
wanna stay in the iOS ecosystem then you
just don't even want to consider a phone
for the next few months yes even if you
drop your current one into a vat of lava
I wouldn't I end up without a phone
until that I'm bailing my buddy just did
that he went the pool with his iphone 5s
and had to go in another 5s and he used
like somebody on his family plans
contract someone asked on the youtube
channel would it be good for Sony and
Microsoft to make a console together um
and I obviously said not for consumers I
say obviously because I know that that's
what sean and i would both say um and
then that's why uh i mean it's a you you
don't want two of the leading
marketplace manufacturers making a
machine together because it removes
drive to excel ya know it i definitely
agree competition for the marketplaces
always an aggressive right exactly i
mean maybe the initial design is
impressive but if sorry if essentially
you're removing the whole excuse for
them to improve without any competition
there's no reason to make a better
machine there's no reason to have
playstation plus there's no reason to
have the games with gold there's no
reason for them to buy over exclusives
and and create more
technically pushing graphical
powerhouses of games just the whole
drive for that stops you want more than
one company operating in a single space
because it's good for consumers the
initial greatness of having one console
under one banner might be great but that
that would dim quickly so you don't want
you don't want them teaming up that's no
good that's what forces Google and Apple
Microsoft for release new operating
systems every year right yeah I have to
you have to stay on the front side and
if you don't you lose consumers is
competition that that's the way it works
yep entirely I just I'm catching up on
the last season of south park I am up to
the episodes where they did a game of
thrones parody based around the ps4 and
xbox one and the kids are going to war
over which one is will be the console to
build them all it's yeah it's quite
something very nice and I think that
will bring this week's episode to a
close do you guys have any final
