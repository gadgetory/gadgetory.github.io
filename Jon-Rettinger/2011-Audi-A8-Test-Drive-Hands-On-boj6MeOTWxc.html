from TechnoBuffalo and I'm here in
downtown San Francisco
as Wednesday afternoon turns to evening
I'm at the Audi clout event for the new
8 8 2011 8 8 car ironically enough this
is the car I got driven around June at
CES when I was working for Nvidia but
this is a separate deal the folks from
clout contacted me full disclosure
not being paid for this but I was
invited by the folks from clout there's
my full disclosure to check out the a8
going to go for a ride I think I even
get to drive it which I didn't can do in
Vegas so here's a look at the car the
2011 model this is the a8 not the a8 L
which is the longer wheelbase model but
the a8 but you don't want to hear from
me I'm here with Paul from Audi social
media who can tell us a little bit more
about the vehicle before we get into it
yes so this is the all new redesign a 8
its brand new for 2011 actually came out
November of last year sales started
rolling out and people are really
enthused about the technology that's in
the car some of what you'll see well
know is driving you will get to drive
now so we'll have a good time why don't
we step in the car
all right we're in the car I'm going to
leave the light on my video camera off
so you can get the full power up
sequence experience here of the a8 so
we're going to go ahead I think Paul's
got the key we're going to yeah there
are two ways to start the car one you
can actually leave your key in your
pocket just push the start/stop button
right here or two if you have the key
out already like I do you can put it in
here put on the brake and the car will
start up if you press it in for just a
few seconds all right now I don't have
the wide-angle lens so I don't know if
you got the effect but the screen came
up the wheel came down and then what you
couldn't see you just got to take my
word for this is that the lumbar part of
the seat the driver's seat here kind of
wrapped around me I'm not I'm not saying
that's good or bad I'm just describing
you what happened we've got the LED
running lights up here I've been told
that they can be dimmed or disabled if
they prove distracting I can tell you
from being in the backseat that the LED
lights are pretty entertaining at least
for a ride from the Vegas Convention
Center to the airport that's for sure so
is this a touchscreen this is not a
touchscreen everything is done through
this MMI interface okay so you roll
through the settings you'll see here
this is just radio radio selection but
to go back
you just hit back or menu to go to the
full menu and this is actually pretty
involved so I won't get into all the
nitty-gritty details or say no we want
to get a test drive going right that the
car enthusiasts in our audience I'm sure
familiar with the various generations of
MMI even I
being a not a supercar geek know a
little bit about MMI and the you know
awards and critiques and whatnot it's
gotten but is this the version with the
the touch the touch panel it is okay it
is
yeah and that's that's strictly in the
navigation and if you have pre that's
what the numbers are here for if you
have presets for radio that you like you
just push the buttons and they'll
they'll go to your radio presets well
I'll show you again just so comes up
gotcha and then when you're in that mode
it also functions as a because you you
you
that's you go to destination you have to
select that you hit address let's see
let's go to something interesting so
Street will say in San Francisco and
then if you look it'll show you that
it's in the mode that you can write you
can disable that too if you don't like
it but you just and it picks up s T a
that's pretty good because that barely
looked like an au true right it almost
seems like before and it picked it up
gasps no
very cool all right and then one thing I
have to ask you because my previous
experience in this car I was not in the
driver's seat I remember actually the
first time I got into this car I was
trying to I was trying to adjust the the
passenger seats to the people behind me
in more room and the next day I knew the
touchscreen lit up and something was
moving in the seat there's a massage
option in there there there is a massage
opsin option and I'll actually use it
right now so you can see what what now
is talking about but when you when you
push it this comes up and this allows
you to set everything that you want to
set so the massage option is right here
and you hit wave and I'm feeling I'm
feeling the pressure on my back right
now right it's actually kind of nice and
that's it and that's a passenger seat
only no it's driving it's both it's both
it's both driver and passenger oh very
cool
all right I'm gonna have to turn the
camera off so we can drive this thing
and you know I can try to massage
optional all right sort of red light
here downtown San Francisco I'm behind
the wheel and you know first things
first y'all should know that I am NOT a
regular driver of a flagship motor races
in hasta Dan
no matter the make or mark as they say
in the car magazines I like to read
so you know take my opinion with a grain
of salt but the a8 feels smaller than I
thought it was going to feel when I
first pulled out I was trying to adjust
the mirrors and I managed to like flip
them inwards and then you know the radar
thing was telling me not to back up
anymore
you know it's kind of like when I used
to review phones and I couldn't get the
battery covers off similar feeling for
me but driving the car I hit the pedal
and the torque kick did and we kind of
lurched out and then once I realized
what I was dealing with it's it's smooth
driving granted we're downtown there's
gridlock you know we haven't been able
to I you know carve up any canyon roads
or anything but the car definitely feel
smaller than I was fearing it would when
I pulled out very smooth I mean the
technology is all around you but I've
been able to pretty much ignore it
except when we're at a red light and I
wrote my name on the trackpad just just
to say I could you know visibility is
pretty good
I figured out how to get the moonroof
happening which I'm pretty excited about
and you know you can definitely feel
there's a little bit of get up and go
under the pedal but like I said I
haven't had a chance to really you know
open the thing up alright so the fun
police called now I'm kidding I'm
besides it's green police and the Audi
commercials that's for a different car
ah mama call daddy calls me wants the
t-bird back so we're bringing the a8
back to the to the event here that's
away from traffic litter which is good
it gives me more time to talk little
tour around I got one chance to floor it
on an open street I got to floor it for
about a second and a half and then had
to hit the brakes but Paul was
describing the aluminum space frame the
car is light it's actually one of the
lower or the lowest rated horsepower car
in its class but because it's so light
it kind of doesn't matter and you know
the car moved when I asked it to move
and like I said I'm no super driver guy
but you know what it felt nice to drive
it was smooth it was easy I felt like
there's power there I'm hoping I win the
prize they're giving away a weekend with
this car and I'm hoping I win it so I
can take this thing out for a weekend
and see how it really feels you know out
on the road there any rate the tech is
very cool the nav you know there you go
find places to eat if we want to all
that kind of stuff and I here for for a
big luxury car it even gets decent gas
mileage but I'm not shilling for Audi so
you can go find out more about that if
you want to I'm just saying I got to
drive the AAA I had fun I'm gonna go
inside and see what my fellow clout
influencers I think we're called with
the
all folks inside need so there you go
from the clout out ei8 event I'm Noah
from TechnoBuffalo much much more on all
this stuff including that stuff I did at
CES there's nvidia tech in these cars we
can go find out about that over at
TechnoBuffalo comm and special thanks to
my new friend Tatiana who was nice
enough to do a little filming from the
backseat while we were driving Tatyana
appreciate it thank you we'll see you
later
all right special meant special guests
bonus feature here I ran into will Park
editor-in-chief of into mobile a quality
website in the quality man but for real
he's much more of a car guy than I am
so you know I were talking about the car
afterwards and he was like oh you know
it's cool
and he showed me and I thought you know
I'm not going to grill will on camera
but what he thought of the car just to
show well showed me with yeah like this
door for example don't hold all the way
it'll suck itself interesting it one
more time slow light yeah it pulls us
out there so have to catch on camera but
a pretty cool its luxury technology
there's a lot of state-of-the-art scar
that are cool and what's yet what's the
website again well into mobile comm
there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
