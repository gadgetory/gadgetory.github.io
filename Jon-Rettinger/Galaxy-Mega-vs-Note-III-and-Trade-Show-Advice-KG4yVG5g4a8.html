to you by lynda.com hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the buffalo the show you can ask me
Ashley together any question you might
have from the wide world of technology
every Tuesday we put up a call for
questions on TechnoBuffalo comm you can
leave your questions in that post
comment otherwise you can send her to me
any time of the day or night at
TechnoBuffalo or at ashley ask either on
Twitter just use the hashtag ask the bee
so I can see it and usually I answer
between three and five questions every
episode let's get answering this is ask
the Buffalo
our first question comes from Ben's fans
club on Twitter he says get the Galaxy
mega 6.3 or galaxy s4 or wait for the
Galaxy Note 3 well the Galaxy mega 6.3
the thing I have a problem with this
it's a 720p screen so you're not gonna
get that beautiful crisp 1080p screen
that you really want right now I think
that's sort of a hot thing right now
1080p screens and it really actually
shows resolution wise on that device
as for the s4 it is a little bit older
so I'm gonna say since we're more than
likely gonna see the Note 3 at IFA this
year in a couple of weeks I would wait
for the Galaxy Note 3 but that's just my
opinion I think the note 3 is sort of
the best of both worlds you get that big
screen size but then you also have all
that speed and beautiful resolution that
you have on the s4 twitter users son t
guts 14 asks i'm starting last year of
high school soon I need a new backpack
with enough space for textbooks and
laptop and charge devices all my
suggestion is obviously the power bag
I'm a huge fan of the power bag they
have back packs that have 3000 and 6000
million batteries so you can charge all
of your stuff you can charge your laptop
you can charge your tablets your phones
and you can take it with you to college
because they're really super durable I
have had one for tradeshows and that is
honestly one of my absolute favorite
things to have with me while I'm on a
show floor Josh asks hey Ashley what
does Nintendo need to do this holiday
with the Xbox one and PlayStation 4
coming out of November this is a really
good question that not a lot of people
are actually asking so many people are
so excited about the new consoles that
everyone's kind of forgotten about what
Nintendo needs to do strategy-wise this
holiday season I think Nintendo strategy
needs to be get those first party titles
out I mean that's when intentos famous
for the Mario's the Zelda's I would love
to see a new Metroid I would love to see
a full-blown Kid Icarus game and you
know just bear with me on this it could
be really amazing that's all I'm saying
I think that they need to really look at
their stable of characters what they
have available and they need to just
start cranking out those first party
games because really that's where
Nintendo's salvation lies Twitter user
at Droid edge asks covering any upcoming
trade shows and any advice for
first-timers doing so yes actually I
will be at IFA in Berlin so Aoife my
nice - anybody going to a trade show I
have definitely done a lot of the don'ts
for trade shows which is like buy a new
pair of sneakers the night before the
show not a good idea
so here are my dues for any trade show
that you might be going to travel as
light as possible you don't want to be
bogged down with you know your 17 inch
laptop and a whole bunch of camera
equipment I mean really pare it down to
the bare minimum of what you need and
always bring a notepad and a pen just in
case you run out of battery you don't
have connectivity you want to remember
something
we're worn and sneakers definitely wear
sneakers that you have worn before
otherwise you will be on a train to
blister town which is never fun I have
certainly been there and for CES one
year I was pretty miserable so we're
worn and sneakers very important you
want to bring a sport coat or something
nice for a little bit of extra polish
because you never know when you might
snag an interview with a high-profile
executive or you might want to be
interviewed by a different news station
or somebody might ask your opinion on
camera and a sport coat or something
light that just sort of polishes up a
t-shirt and jeans look it's something
that's always good to have on hand drink
tons of water I this is a marathon that
you're running especially at a show like
CES where it lasts a week long for
people who are pressed you want to
continually be drinking water if you can
bring your own water in from outside the
tradeshow even better because you can
buy it cheaper wash your hands hourly
this is something I learned the hard way
after it's my first year at CES they
don't call it Khan crud for nothing it
is a miserable I was sick for two weeks
it will lay you out you have to remember
how many people are touching phones all
day long and you're touching those
phones that all those other people have
touched before you're putting them up to
your hands you're rubbing your eyes you
have to make sure to keep your hands
clean super super important you're gonna
be shaking a lot of hands there's so
many germs out of convention just keep
your hands clean because that will keep
you from getting very very sick that's
my number one piece of tradeshow advice
