TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of the
brand new mid-2010 refresh ipod nano
let's go ahead and see if this guy lives
up to its lineage alright so this
generation iPod Nano is a complete
departure from previous generations gone
is the click wheel that we've known to
love or loathe and replaced with a just
touchscreen only it's a 1.4 inch TFT
display with a 240 by 240 pixel
resolution enough of me talking let's go
ahead and dig in so here is the Box got
a picture the Nano on the front iPod
Nano on the side letting you know that
this is a 16 gigabyte model which is
going to cost 179 dollars it's also
accompanied by an 8 gigabyte model which
is going to be a hundred and $49 iPod
Nano iPod Nano and iPod Nano this should
be a bit of tape somewhere around here
to go ahead and rip off there we go let
me know you got to pull it in that
direction a little bit of an arrow keep
ripping this thing off all the way
around now as top should come right off
as it did a typical Apple fashion go
ahead and pull this right off there is
the iPod Nano push that off to the side
for just a moment let's see what else
you're going to get in the box
signed by Apple in California start here
so you get a pair of course Apple
earphones and a 30 pin connector pretty
standard and that is about it let's take
a look at the Nano which looks very very
similar to the older generation iPod
shuffle I'm go ahead and peel it off
plastic take that off and here is the
new iPod Nano
but there's something on the screen
let's go ahead and see if we can get
that off there you go let's take a look
at this device which I got in the sort
of default silver comes in a ton of
other colors so let's do a very quick
walk through here so there is the 1.5
inch touchscreen this multi-touch you
can sort of arrange it any way you'd
like
the top you've got physical volume
buttons are quite nice you no longer
have to go to like this grille wheel you
had to move it around you can I'll just
go up and down the volume buttons look
very similar to what we see on the
iPhone 4 and you've got your lock and
power button and the 30-pin connector on
the side or on the bottom rather and a
3.5 millimeter headset jack all
accompanied by a little bit of a clip it
looks like I turned it on let's take a
look here and do the walkthrough we will
select English done and it looks very I
Oh s ish but this is actually not
running iOS just happens to look like it
so here is the home screen and you can
go ahead and scroll through and see all
your icons we'll start here we got
playlists now playing use playlists
artists you keep scrolling does have
built-in FM radio podcast photos
settings songs albums composers and then
I'll be Nike Fitness stuff and a clock
built in now I believe you can rearrange
these icons any way you like if you hold
them down we'll do a little jiggly dance
and move them anywhere you want we'll
just leave them right there also hit
that home button right at the top but
you can rotate the screen which indeed
you can and let's say you are somewhere
in one of the menu settings so let's say
we're here in settings if you hold down
anywhere on the screen that's going to
be equivalent to hitting a home button
and take you right back to the home
screen so just for a group fun size
comparison let's bring in the older
generation iPod shuffle so this is the
one that was the first one that had to
click on it you can see at the size
difference there's not that much there
and this thing's packing 16 gigs now for
the Nano
last generation hype on man let's go
ahead and bring in this one certainly is
much larger a little bit on the thinner
side but it does have a camera built-in
which this new model does not so looking
for camera capabilities this new Nano is
not going to be for you let's see how
they stack up fitness-wise
go ahead and see that Nano itself is
actually still pretty thin the clip adds
a little bit of bulk and just for fun
and for lineage sake let's bring in my
wife's old iPod mini haven't seen one of
these things in a while and you can see
that
quite how far this line has come due the
size difference right there this has
been a first look and unboxing at the
iPod Nano stay tuned to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo for a full review coming
very soon I am John Rhett enger' and
I'll see you in the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
