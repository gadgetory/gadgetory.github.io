to you by full sail university what's
going on everyone jon rettinger here
back in the rumor roundup chair up and
gone for the past couple weeks being a
daddy and it feels nice to be back of
this week ipad 5 rumors it got leaked in
space grey and silver nexus 5 might
charge a premium for battery which is
kind of a neat model a motorola mystery
device with a ginormous mega 6.3 inch
display could be a droid ultra successor
could be expected sometime next year and
the galaxy s5 might be water resistant
this is rumor roundup let's start
rounding up rumors if your rumor then
run so this week ipad rumors are running
rampant more specifically the ipad 5 and
what colors they might come it looks
like they're going to be adopting the
same color scheme as the iphone 5s which
means say goodbye to the boring black
and white and say hello to space grey
and silver Sonny Dickson leaked back
plates which look exactly like we
expected look at bigger iPad Mini in new
colors and speaking of iPads if you're
wondering when you might be able to get
your hands on one of these new bad boys
or at least get your first look at
official ones looks like the 22nd is
going to be the day All Things D which
kinda makes me laugh every time I say it
broke the story and the loops Jim darn
Pole said his famous yep when asked if
he wanted to back it up so mark it down
your calendars the 20 seconds will be
when we see a new iPad 5 and a new iPad
Mini which almost excited about fingers
crossed for retina display we've seen
phone makers charge premiums for all
kinds of new things but we haven't seen
phone makers charge a premium for his
battery and it looks like Google might
be doing just that with their Nexus 5
our friends over phone areata were
citing the best kind of sources
anonymous claiming the device is going
to come in two different models so a
cheaper 16 gigabyte version with a 2300
million power battery and a more
expensive model with 32 gigs of storage
and a bigger three thousand million
power battery for 399 bucks so it's kind
of cool we've seen storage speed charged
for premium but now battery if you need
a phone that can last longer you have
the option to get that if this is true
I love this rumor so it was a refresher
the Nexus 5 might come with we're
looking at probably a 4.95 inch screen
1080p display 2 gigabytes of RAM pretty
beastly Snapdragon 800 with a clock
speed of 2.3 gets a megapixel rear
camera 1.3 on the front NFC my favorite
wireless charging and will be the Flex
device for android 4.4 deliciously named
KitKat i did still kind of like two key
lime pie moniker either way that we
should see this device make its grand
debut sometime this month let's talk
about a gigantic 6.3 inch phone we
previously saw a behemoth of this size
from samsung in the form of the mega but
looks like motorola wants in on that
action so supposedly this to be a droid
ultra successor which would be expected
sometime next year they are saying it's
got a six point three inch device in the
works now internally as x play which is
kind of a cool name as well as the
device i will succeed the company's
droid ultra known as the quantum really
don't know much about what this thing is
going to be or what it might be but
another 6.3 its phone from motorola if
it's a bigger Moto X iPhone I'll be
super duper excited the next rumor it
looks like Samsung's getting all into
the active and waterproof line of phones
if you love your galaxy s4 active and
you're hoping that maybe the next
version has five might get the same sort
of water-resistant treatment you might
be in luck if the rumors are to be
believed it looks like the s5 might only
come in a water is just in variety but I
wouldn't put much stock in that i would
put more stock though in the galaxy s5
taking any aluminum bills and perhaps a
rugged version of that phone and we
might also get a galaxy note 3 active
meeting if you like giant screens and
you also like the whitewater raft or
just throw it in the pool or take to the
beach you might be in luck let me take a
