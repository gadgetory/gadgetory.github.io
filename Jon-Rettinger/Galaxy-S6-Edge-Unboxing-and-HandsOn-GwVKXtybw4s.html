TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing that I
am really excited about ever since I saw
this guy in vailed at Mobile World
Congress this is the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge just like the galaxy s6 with a few
new tweaks if you didn't get a chance to
check out our galaxy s6 unboxing I will
link that down below so the box here is
completely redone for Samsung gone or
the previous generation wood boxes that
we use to see you have got a more sleek
design with a new font on top so adios
wood we've got the t-mobile version here
in 32 gigabyte configuration it's gonna
be available for every major carrier and
most minor carriers as well 32 64 128
gigabyte sizes go ahead and slide that
off I've not yet seen one these guys in
person so I'm going to look like we can
experience it together we've got the
white version the edge is also available
in black gold green or white although
I've got fancier name than that but that
was the colors that they are well that
feels very interesting really almost a
sharp edges not much to hold on to push
off the side for a real quick second see
what else we're going to have inside of
the box
we've got looks like we've got some
booklets and getting started guides and
welcome to mobile information push all
that off we've got microUSB with a
standard USB you don't have a USB 3.0 on
there anymore a sim removal tool which I
just threw we've got your standard wall
adapter which is going to enable
adaptive fast charging and we've got a
pair of headphones with different sized
ear gels and also noise cancelling mic
and volume control but accessories and
booklets are definitely not while while
you are here
let's take a look at the edge together
I'll power it on I'll run through the
specs and everything about it let's
start with what we got going on on the
sides you've got a volume rocker up and
down on the left on the right-hand side
power and the lock button on the galaxy
s6 this is where you have your a sim
which obviously is not much room here on
the edge so that's been moved to the top
got some IR sensor noise cancelling mic
you can see the antenna bands on the
bottom it probably looks very familiar
too if you're a phone fan
are you three point five millimeter
headset
micro USB port noise cancelling mic and
speaker that's now on the bottom which
should sound better than speakers that
are rear-facing coated front and back in
Gorilla Glass 4 and speaking of the back
we don't have a t-mobile brandings here
at all but you do have Galaxy s6 edge
branding let me go ahead and get this
guy set up and we'll finish the rest of
the tour you are looking at a very
almost identical expect phone as galaxy
s x2 few exceptions it's a 5.1 inch
period and that's from corner all the
way down to corner on both of the edges
this time around it's a quad HD Super
AMOLED got a resolution of 2560 by 1440
nigut has a 577 PPI which is a really
high resolution underneath this camera
hump right there and it's a very
pronounced camera huh is a 16 megapixel
sensor that can be activated in 0.7
seconds it's got Auto real time HTR when
the features of Samsung's padding is a
double tap of the home button go ahead
and pull up that camera the front is a 5
megapixel sensor that has a 120 degree
wide angle lens so you can get all your
friends in that selfie shot first time
we've seen the XE no series process or
make its way to us phones
it's an octa-core processor it actually
has 2 quad cores one at 2.1 and one at
1.5 and of course it's 64-bit 3 gigs of
ram in here available storage of 32 64
128 you're not going to find any micro
SD card slot because it don't have one
so make sure you get the storage i
that's going to work for you a little
bit bigger battery than we have in the
galaxy get 615 million powers bigger its
2600 milliamp hours it's going to be
available as I mentioned in black gold
and green or white so what can you do
with the edge there's a lot of stuff you
can do with it also it just looks very
cool so if device is turned off haven't
done much in the settings but if you
give it a little rub let it know you
love it I'll get some stuff that will
pop up on the side you can see now it's
got a clock and stuff set up there give
you news and anything else you want to
configure and if you want to configure
stuff I which I'm sure you do go into
settings and now we've got something
here for edge screen I should mention
that's if you're looking at the note
edge this
Maps at work on that for the edge are
not going to work here on the galaxy s6
its got edge lighting and wind edge
people and what that's going to do to
create a row of different colored icons
or from people if you have the phone
turns upside down it'll glow the color
the people that are calling so you can
see who's messaging you now you can see
what other else other things you can do
with the edge and of course we will test
all of us when we do our full review
it's being powered by Android 5.0 it's
actually 5.0 point 2 I believe and
hopefully we get five point one on here
at some point see we got 5.0 point two
lollipops you're going to get a kind of
a cool combination of lollipop and
Samsung's TouchWiz Samsung has made this
40% lighter in the bloatware department
you can really see that when you go to
apps there's just that I got a couple
folders certainly but not that much in
fact you can remove the Samsung maps
that you don't want to use and of course
Samson would be happy for you to
download more from their own app store
pull this down you can see combination
of volley pop notifications and then
this Samsung shortcuts you can access
more edit how that's going to look
depending on what you want to do it
feels really nice in the hand you don't
get that same sort of cool feeling you
get with a lot most bigger bezel on the
galaxy s6 but this phone looks unlike
anything else I've ever seen a question
I had it when I first turned it on was
and I can get the full screen resolution
or just going to sort of cut off where
it starts to edge down on both sides and
actually it wraps around you get the
full screen resolution so I've got
TechnoBuffalo queued up here and you can
see on the side getting out to rotate
you can see on the side that goes all
the way through the edges as you're
doing the scrolling so it's a very neat
effect doesn't take away anything at all
I really like what Samsung did with the
edge you get almost the same specs as
you get on the Galaxy it's like
something new and different if you don't
use the edge feature you still get the
same very highly SPECT a flagship phone
from Samsung if you want to see more
Galaxy s6 edge coverage too big
subscribe button to be doing a ton more
on this guy we'd love to hear your
thoughts on it we have new videos coming
out seemingly everyday until next time
I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo see
ya
