here from TechnoBuffalo here and finding
the right gadget for any budget can be
tough let alone finding the best gadget
to suit your life under $100
here are five bits of technology that
I've actually bought that I used I think
you guys might enjoy let's start with
some external storage and the Samsung t3
coming in just a penny under $100 budget
you're gonna get 250 gigs of USBC
fastness fastness I think I made that
word up but it is fast quartz is gonna
work with OS 10 it's gonna work with
Windows 10 and also it will work with
Android if your device has USB see
things so small you might want to throw
it in your bag you can survive those
bumps it is shock resistant super tiny
it looks good and is very fast wherever
you go you're going to need some extra
power in your bag and there's a ton of
external power banks to choose from for
me I picked the anchor power core 20100
this twenty thousand one hundred million
power battery can fully charge one
macbook one iphone and one ipad air on a
single charge so it can charges all your
eye things or android things or windows
things USBC is the future but now you
can get one of the best things about USB
see with micro USB here is a reversible
micro USB cable from the folks at mic
flip it's an IndieGoGo product that
raised over a hundred eighty thousand
dollars and they claimed to be the
world's first reversible cable I haven't
seen another one so I'm gonna take their
word for it
thirty bucks and get you a 2-pack it's
got an ultra strong nylon braid it's got
an aluminum shell and gold-plated plugs
you can prevent corrosion but it's
reversible it works awesome you
definitely need one these if you have a
micro USB device let's say you're
thinking about picking up one of the new
MacBooks and you think to yourself self
why does the thing only have one port
that is super annoying I don't want to
carry a ton of dongles let me introduce
you to the product Apple should have
made this is the hyper drive USB see
five-in-one for just 49.95 can be
available in all the macbook colors
except for rose gold so space grey
silver or regular gold it's got USB see
pastor with charging SDXC card slot
micro SDXC card slot 2 USB 3.0 and it
sits flush with the bottom of the
computer so it doesn't look super
awkward if you get it color matched it
almost looks like it belongs to the
computer so say goodbye to dongles
by the docks this thing works really
well and it's all you're gonna need and
it doesn't need any external power so
that's nice and last let me introduce
you to the gatekeeper this ominous
sounding product is gonna cost you
$39.99 and it's got two tricks one we've
seen countless times it's a Bluetooth
proximity tag when you step away from
something it's gonna set off an alarm
the other trick though something kind of
cool it's locked or unlocked your Mac or
PC based on your proximity of your
choosing so you have the standard
keychain you all closed your computer
it's going to unlock or lock it
depending on what you said it to do it's
super secure without being complex which
I liked and it's really easy to set up
so what do you guys think of these five
products under $100 might not be the
most flashing most sexy but these are
five useful products that I carry with
