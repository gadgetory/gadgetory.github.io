TechnoBuffalo here and if you know how
to read you know we've got an unboxing
for you of the surface pro 2 the
original surface pro is one of those
devices at at first I wasn't a fan of
and then the more I used it the more I
liked it in fact I had to do an updated
review on how my opinions change the
first product I've ever had to do that
with so I'm looking forward to checking
out the surface pro 2 it should look
exactly the same but perform a much
better go ahead and take a first look
alright so here is the box for the
surface pro 2 looking almost identical
to the original surface pro box except
got this giant to emboss on it nothing
that exciting to see we do have the 128
gigabyte version you can also pick this
up in a 64 256 or 512 the lowest
configuration is going to run you $8.99
through the 64 you can up it to the 128
which we have here for 129 or go for
1,300 for 256 and also get eight gigs
and RAM as opposed to four or go giant
style for almost 1800 bucks for 512 go
ahead and pull this out I'm actually
really excited to take a look at this I
use my surface pro all the time at home
so this guy will get a lot of views here
is the surface box also new accessories
are available for this as well there's a
docking station there's an update
updated type cover and touch cover which
now have backlit displays and way more
sensors for improved accuracy I had the
original touch cover it was never overly
accurate so here is the surface pro 2
I'm just going to probably call it the
surface pro it does look identical to
the outgoing surface pro model they held
the side-by-side you really couldn't
tell a difference push it off to the
side for just a quick second
congratulations you've earned the best
of Skype earned it excited bought a
computer so there's the best of Skype
and there's 200 gigs of SkyDrive storage
it's nice and then the surface pro 2
booklet also comes with a pen and it's
sort of a Wacom stylus s thing and it
goes right into the charging port and
falls off very easily
so make sure you keep an eye on that if
you want to get one we've got a new and
improved power cord here supposedly
looks pretty much the same does have a
USB port for charging and it's also be
improved connectivity to the tablet and
there's the connection see what that
looks like a pretty small but
significant is if you can even say that
small and significant charging power
brick push all it off to the side and
here is the reason we are here these
surface pro to go ahead and peel off the
plastic and hopefully it sounds super
satisfactory haha plastic pull you off
so true to look at a surface versus a
surface pro 2 the only way to clearly
tell a difference is that it now says
surface there instead of the windows
logo other than that though pretty much
pound-for-pound looks wise it is exactly
the same but a few notable differences
aside from just the writing right there
the kickstand you've got one angle which
was okay for sitting on a desk I'd want
to put on your lap it never worked that
well and I liked the fact to the
kickstand went all the way across the
entire tablet so it's sat very well on a
lot the angle was very weird Microsoft
took some feedback and gave it now a
second angle which supposedly feels much
more natural for sitting on a lap or
even just using at a desk I will say
though that I've used the surface 2 that
has the same angles and this angle is
much more comfortable so a little
difference actually makes a lot of
difference so push all that off to the
side here go ahead and power it on and
run through the rest of the specs I will
say though from the get-go we are
looking at the new Haswell core i5 grip
which is quite nice clocked at 1.6
gigahertz and should give you way way
way more battery life we're hearing
upwards of seven ish hours of battery
which should be about an hour nap
two hours better than the original
surface pro point five millimeter
headset Jack come volume up and down USB
3.0 you can see the vent port goes all
the way around it at first I found that
kind of annoying and cumbersome but I
got used to it very quickly and even
notice that it was there you've got some
speakers there is your power and lock
button holding the tablet in landscape
it's going to be in the upper right hand
corner on the bottom that's where that
docking and charging
is going to go is also where the
accessories for the keyboard and such
will plug into continuing the tour we've
got display out you do have expandable
storage and that is micro SD and then
the connection port and also where that
pen is going to connect to and I'll
bring that in here real fast and I'll
show you what that looks like so there
are those ports there's that it just
kind of sits in there and will very
easily get knocked out you can find a
way to push it in and it'll stay right
there if you want to use it just pull it
out and make sure you hold on to it and
should have a keychain with it same
screen resolution here it's a ten point
six inch display it's 1920 by 1080
meaning it's got a 206 PPI on it it's
the clear type Full HD the same
magnesium build that we saw on the
original surface although Microsoft
calls it a vapor mag it feels like
aluminum puts Posey is much more durable
and has better sort of heat dissipation
I've got the same cameras here as well
the surface to was when I got the camera
update not so though for the surface pro
2 dimensions wise just to remind you in
case you forgot it weighs 32 ounces of
907 grams on ten point eight one inches
or twenty seven point four six
centimeters its 0.53 inches thick or
thirteen point five millimeters I'm
going to go ahead and do a real quick
setup I'll come back and show you what
it looks like when it's all booted on so
we've got the surface pro 2 all booted
up when I signed it with my SkyDrive
account on setup I actually set all of
my apps where they used to be with a
little sort of arrow pointing down it'll
start downloading them when I select it
what used to live right there was a
shortcut to Chrome on the desktop side
of windows 8 so this is running Windows
8.1 and everything you'd expect from
Windows 8.1 is here all my old apps are
starting to show up Microsoft Office it
is a trial on the pro version but will
come pre-installed on the regular
surface 2 version let me go ahead and
tray the desktop just regular windows 8
we do have that new sort of looks like
you think you'd be a regular Start menu
and it kind of is but all it does it
just take you to the modern UI version
hopefully that'll take us there there we
go
do the same thing with just that big
button right there but the big story
releases from my mind as accessories
that come with the new surface line of
tablets I've got right here in my hot
little hand the type cover now I could
hear the comment saying John never say
hot little hand again I promise you I
won't I knew it was bad as soon as it
came out of my mouth this is going to
set you back about 130 dollars it's much
thinner than the outgoing version keys
have a surprising amount of throw to
them considering it's so thin also it is
now backlit I'm powered solely by the
tablet there are a lot of other
accessories there is a battery accessory
a dock and there's a DJ accessory it
snaps in with a really sort of
satisfactory click noise you can go
ahead and use it new to the type cover
this year we've got sir that felt
trackpad and buttons that we saw on the
touch cover which is still available now
has way more sensors on the keys and is
also backlit I was going to set you back
about $80 but navigation is really
really quick and using the keyboard is
awesome it's a really enjoyable typing
experience with the type cover I did not
have the best experience with the touch
cover on the original surface for
whatever that it was worth so it's been
a real quick first look and unboxing of
the Microsoft Surface pro 2 I will have
a full review and let you know what we
think before I go though let me just
show you real quick comparison with the
surface 2 this is what was previously
called surface RT I will do a real quick
side shot here and show you what that
looks like and you guys hope you enjoy
