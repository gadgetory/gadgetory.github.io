TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
going to compare the home screen
experience of the HTC hd2 with that of
the iPhone 3GS let's get started by
unlocking the devices and both devices
have different unlock screens that we're
going to take a look at of course with
the iPhone 3GS we get the date the time
some notifications and of course a slide
to unlock bar at the bottom we've seen
this a billion times but on the HTC hd2
we get a little bit more than that which
is really useful so not only do we get
the day and the time and the
notifications but we also get next
appointment down here which is really
convenient so you don't have to unlock
your device to see to go into your
calendar application and then to see
where you need to be also new to the HTC
hd2 this is actually a windows mobile
6.5 feature is that the unlock mechanism
has some functionality so if you have a
new SMS or new email or a missed call
when you tap on the unlock button you'll
actually get dropdowns for each
respective area and sliding open sliding
over the email notification will drop
you right into the email program as you
can see here which really saves a lot of
steps and not having to unlock your
phone then go into email then look for
the new email this really saves that
step and and can make you more
productive as a result now let's take a
look at the home screens HTC has done a
lot with the home screen of the hd2 to
make it super productive and super easy
to use
of course the iPhone hasn't really
changed much it's still a dump of icons
it's a very application centric device
so in order to do anything to see a
stock quote or to see the weather or to
dial a contact you have to open one of
these applications of course you can go
to the search box and do it from there
but in terms of the information that is
on your home screen panel there really
is none it's all applications that you
have to go into on the hd2 HTC has gone
a long way to change this idea so we
have the time we have the weather and
actually if I go into the Start menu and
close out I get clouds behind and it
knows where I am right now so if I
travel to New York City it will change
the weather based
where I am so we also have the
temperature and the high and low
temperature for today we have the date
and the time and a link to our alarm
clock if we want to set an alarm clock
we also have our next appointment right
on the home screen now we have what is
called Quick Links and there are three
here and if you flick upwards you get an
additional four or actually six and we
can remove some of these Quick Links so
let me remove one so I can add it again
and what you can do is you can add a lot
of different things for these Quick
Links you can add programs bookmarks or
contacts of course on the iPhone you can
add programs to your home screen or
bookmarks but you can't add context
which is super convenient because if you
want to have a OneTouch access to dial
someone you can also have a OneTouch
access to email someone or send them a
text message so imagine filling the
screen up with people that you text on a
regular basis or that you email on a
regular basis so a really fantastic way
of putting the things that you use most
on the home screen that I think
personally my opinion is far superior to
what you get on the iPhone where you
need to drill it to any application to
really get information so that was a
quick look of the HTC hd2 home screen
experience compared to that of the
iPhone 3GS we'll be back with more
comparison videos of these two devices
soon that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
