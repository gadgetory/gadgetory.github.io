brought to you by netflix welcome back
to another episode of ask the buffalo
i'm jon rettinger and it feels good to
be back in the driver's seat after Noah
Kravitz filled in for me over the past
few weeks on this episode we're going to
talk about everything mobile we're going
to talk about phones we can talk about
tablets including Windows 8 tablets
we're going to talk a bit about my trip
to Europe and everything in between so
sit down relax it's time to get our nerd
on with ask the Buffalo I missed you
guys I'm happy to be back hosting asked
the Buffalo I am jon rettinger if you
want to get your questions into the
answer Don asked the Buffalo you can do
it one of two ways first you can go to
TechnoBuffalo calm once a week we will
post an article asking for you to submit
your questions now you got to do is type
them in the comments otherwise if you
want to send a message to me on Twitter
you can send it to either my personal
account at John for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo ask your question and use
the hashtag ask the be so I know you
want your question to be featured on ask
the Buffalo obviously you can't answer
all of them but I do try and get to as
many as I can alright so without further
ado let's go ahead and jump into the
first question this one comes from a
manual dab it off who asks John what do
you think of the samsung galaxy note i
had a chance to see the announcement of
the samsung galaxy note at the ephah or
IFA trade show in berlin and everybody's
just kind of dropped when they saw a 5.3
inch phone being announced but those
crazy specs got a 720p display that 5.3
inch display that i just mentioned it's
got a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core processor
in that thing and i gotta tell you i had
some chance to get hands on the device
and that screen is beautiful as good as
you'd expect a screen of that resolution
to be it looks almost twice as
it you think it's going to feel really
big in the hand I did try doing the
pocket test on it and in normal dude
jeans it actually fit okay if you sit
down you're not going to snap the thing
in half even though it is very thin so
you actually may be able to use this as
a phone it certainly felt weird up to
your ear something you could definitely
get used to one of the other cool things
about the note which I think kind of
went under the radar is actually has a
style if it's funny now we're coming
back to styluses this one is actually
magnetic and it worked really well
actually at the Samsung booth at the IFA
trade show they had a caricature artist
i would actually draw your picture on a
samsung galaxy note using that stylus
and then email to you right from there
oh it's kind of neat so it works very
well if you can't tell I'm excited about
the Galaxy Note it means i would have to
carry a tablet when i go anywhere and i
don't to carry another phone i can try
and carry once or a bridge device so
it's a big phone or a small tablet
either way it's probably have a place in
my pocket our next question comes to us
from technobuffalo calm from nathan
cohen to who asks what tablet do you
recommend ipad blackberry playbook
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 etc well in my
mind there are three tablets to really
consider and chances are you probably
know which one or which camp you're
going to fall into far as things that
are available right now if you're on the
apple cider you're swayed by you know
the beauty and luster of Apple certainly
the ipad 2 is a great way to go it's the
market leader for a reason you're
getting a pretty powerful tablet a thin
thin form factor with a ton of
applications if you're more suede
towards Android in the openness of the
platform and what it can do is far as
multitasking customizations there are
two choices which are absolutely
outstanding choice number one and this
is the thinnest tablet that really I've
ever have my hands on that's been
released at least this is the samsung
galaxy tab 10.1 assuming apple doesn't
sue samsung again here in the US and get
the sales halted that is probably my
preferred tablet of choice on the
android front it is an awesome tablet it
works really well it's razor-thin
battery solid I've got some great
additions to honeycomb
and with samsung's touchwiz on there
it's just a great tablet overall the
screen is beautiful i love the
widescreen form factor of it just worked
crazy well and also sort of a keyboard
dock too so if you can take it to class
and take notes it's going to work out
well for you speaking a keyboard the
tablet number three deserves to be
mentioned is the asus eee pad
transformer which is an awesome tablet
in its own right it's got the same specs
pretty close at least to the galaxy tab
10.1 it's got that beautiful TFT display
course is running Android Honeycomb and
videos Tegra 2 processor in there it's
got that same widescreen aspect ratio
and you can get again keyboard dock
turns into a laptop and it's that sort
of transformer a name to it and worked
well those smooth he didn't have any
delay both of those android tablets are
awesome so whether your Apple or whether
your Android I would definitely
recommend one of those three or not can
go wrong with any of them I'm gonna keep
in mind hopefully that helped answer
your question so let me take a quick
second to thank our friends and sponsors

B gonna get some awesome stuff and the
last question comes from technobuffalo
user Louis pull us Louis open console
your name right who actually had the
pleasure of meeting at my London meet up
when I was in Europe and he wants to
know about that trip what was your
favorite moment of your europe trip so
if there's you guys that know where or
maybe don't know at least you know now I
went to Berlin jury to cover the ephah
trade show and while I was sort of in
the region I did a little bit of
traveling I went to London first then I
took the train to Paris and then I flew
from Paris to Berlin I had been to any
of those three places or even the three
countries those places are in so I was
really excited to go and check them out
while I was in London I had a meetup we
had about 30 35 people come and it was
actually awesome I went to it was the
Covent Garden Apple stores from the
largest stores in the country just had a
great time I really enjoyed it that was
probably my favorite moment from the
trip I was getting a chance to meet to
meet fans and to meet fellow nerds and
get a chance to just talk to everyone
that people in London were awesome I was
really happy they had things on the
street though that said look left look
right because I probably would have got
hit by a card 17 times forget they drive
on the other side of the road I'm not
saying the wrong side of the road
because it's right for them but you
definitely can't forget while you're
there so it's very happy food was
awesome people were really friendly
actually at some the best indian food
ever in London I never been to Paris so
it's really cool to see the city in the
history like walking through history
that was really really cool and then
Berlin I never been to Germany so it was
awesome to get a chance to not only meet
some fans at the ephah trade show hey
Tim and Jesse it was also really cool to
sort of see the city in the history of
Berlin I'm kind of a world war two buff
so to sort of see where all these things
happens and how the German people felt
about what happened was really very
interesting and I got a chance to know
some of the German geeks out there so
that even made it better and I will say
this the German beer is awesome so if
you're over 21
it's a go to Germany I definitely I give
that a shot it was just a dull trip was
awesome and I'm happy to let me be back
a home that you realize so excited to go
but I'm so happy to come back home as
well so that was a bit of a personal
story thank you for tuning in to another
