technobuffalo here back with the third
edition of the advice for aspiring
youtubers and tech reviewer series in
the first video we covered where my
gadgets come from and how you can get
your own in the second video we covered
how to build your channel and help find
your audience and in this third video
we're going to cover probably the
biggest reason that people quit YouTube
cancel their accounts or end their
careers before they even begin that is
haters and dealing with negativity so
may first come out and say that
negativity is going to happen you're
going to get haters your get people that
are going to leave negative feedback on
your channel and videos it's just a
reality of the business when you make a
video you're opening yourself up to a
lot of criticism people can see your
face they can hear your voice i can see
your background there are a lot of
things for people to comment on and the
commenters have you nice added bonus of
being completely anonymous so while you
wouldn't walk up to a stranger and say
hey you suck necessarily you can do that
on youtube you can go ahead and write
some awful things and no one knows who
you are there's no accountability for
those comments so oftentimes to be bit
of perspective and you're looking at
this horrible negative things that
they're just anonymous commenters they
don't mean anything about a reflection
of who you are personally now that being
said on these commenters can get
especially hateful they can be
threatened violence in some instances
there can be racial homophobic slurs and
things like that i have never tolerated
since my first video so you have a few
tools at your disposal you can take
advantage of the delete button you
easily delete a comment you can give it
a thumbs down if you want to try and
mark it down or you can mark a spam or
could you put on the older youtube or
probably the best weapon you have is the
block button simply block the user
you're going to find that you start
blocking these people that are leaving
awful comments going to get a bit more
positive now don't expect all sort of
rosy comments on your videos oftentimes
those aren't merited I've learned a lot
from some of the constructive criticism
a pat on my videos for instance i made a
video a few days ago showing flash on
the ipad and i went to the world of
warcraft website and i misspoke and i
said that you could actually log into
world of warcraft and play through your
browser and of course world of warcraft
is a desktop game not a browser game and
i was jumping that immediately and
rightfully so is my error and I
to being called on that I'm going to be
more careful next time making my videos
so just an example of how the criticism
a pen should work in your favor I don't
expect everything to be unanimously
positive people to love you because it's
just not going to happen when i first
started my channel light a few videos
and I was extremely nervous in front of
the camera you can go back and watch
earlier videos I was looking around I've
given lots of saying like all the time
and I just didn't know what I was doing
it which is sort of playing around and
having fun and I had a lot of negative
comments I was be called all kinds of
names I learned to do four little words
and there's something that I had to deal
with and it was hard there's been a lot
of times I wanted quit YouTube a lot of
times when I thought about shutting down
my channel I even had my mouse on the
delete button many many times thinking
about it the end of the day I just
couldn't do it and now I've got a much
thicker skin to do up all this
negativity it's going to happen guys
it's just a reality of the internet and
YouTube you're going to get negative
comments and it hurts I'd be lying if I
said it didn't sting a little bit every
time you read something but you have to
try to let it bounce off for you take at
some of the positive comments that you
get even if it's one positive comment
and to see a negativity that's one
person that like what you do and if
that's one person that commented out
there are many many many more that like
your videos I think more people comments
with negative things and positive so if
you sort of do that ratio you know one
positive comment means more to me than a
slew of negative ones so the moral here
is that you have to ignore and it's hard
to ignore there are a lot of it stings
in a lot of different approaches you can
take to ignore them me personally I
oftentimes try to engage the negative
comments if they're not sort of violent
or awful to sort of a negative feedback
all oftentimes email that user and I
appreciate what you said you know what
do you recommend where you think I did
wrong oftentimes it really helps i found
people that appreciate you know being
heard you take the other approach or
guys like hell DeBlasio who have their
it sir Peter's call into a live show and
sort of grill them live on the air yeah
that's another post you can you could
have you can start a dialogue with these
haters and see why it is that they're
hating on you so there are a lot of
tulle your school zone probably the
biggest one again it's just take the
block button and try and go on with your
day I know it's hard now it's difficult
something that you really is necessary
if you want to grow your YouTube channel
in your on
you have to have a very thick skin to be
on YouTube what they're doing tech
reviews or celebrity blogging or
vlogging or anything you just gonna have
a lot of negativity and it's sort of the
gravity of what you do but it's
something that you want and you have a
passion for being on video even passion
for what you're talking about you're
going to have to deal with it it's a
reality in any job or any business yet
take some licks and you have to sort of
work your way up and it's just part of
it think of it as your YouTube
internship you're doing with a boss
would like to yell at you that's what I
looked at it a lot you know I had a boss
that was angry I just had a deal with it
you can't say anything unless you want
to get fired so guys hope you found this
video helpful was more of a stream of
consciousness just talking you guys
almost one-on-one about how I dealt with
the haters and sort of what I do now I
know you guys have a ton of problems
with this I need you guys get negative
comments like every channel does on
youtube so if i can help you know please
let me know and hope this video you guys
found useful and if you have more advice

negative comments you know leave it down
