TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
LG G flex and this box tells you
anything this phone's got a few tricks
up its sleeve including it's crazy
curved display curving the opposite way
of what we saw with the Samsung Galaxy
rounds go ahead take a look at this guy
see how performs so here is the box for
the LG G flex it's one of the cooler box
that we see because look at that the box
also flex this is the SK Telecom version
sent to us by our friends at Negri
electronics difficult phone to find but
they've got in stock as well as pretty
much every other unlocked accessory and
phone out that's where we get all of our
stuff from check them out at Navy
electronics comm so go ahead and pull
off the phone and there is the 6 inch LG
G flex which looks let's see how it
feels it definitely a flexed phone kind
of strange looking push it off the side
for just a quick second and see what
else we are going to have in the box
we're going to have little happy
cartoons of LG people singing coupon for
something that I cannot understand in
Korean we're going to have a pretty nice
pair of headphones with noise cancelling
we've got and a microphone accessory on
there as well we've got a sim removal
tool in the G shape they've got a wall
wart and sync cable nothing big there
this though is the reason everybody is
here I'm going to go ahead and try and
power it on and run through the specs
and notice the power buttons on the back
which is now sort of LG's new standard
got your volume up and down then your
power button right there so it'll
hopefully turn on is a six inch screen
with a nice little animation right there
it is 1280 by 720 with a 245 PPI it's AP
OLED screen Android 4.2.2 at launch
being powered by a pretty beastly 2.2
six-acre Hertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
chip so a lot of power there 2 gigs of
ram 32 gigs of internal storage for
thinking that's not a big deal I can
just add some external stuff you're
going to be
severely disappointed the main camera on
the back is a 13 megapixel shooter 2
megapixel shooter living right there on
the front
Wi-Fi 802 an ABG and an a/c Bluetooth
4.0 a really impressive battery at 3,500
milliamp hours especially considering
that sort of curved shape LG was able to
get actually a curved battery in here
the first I believe that we've actually
seen the battery in the Galaxy round was
not curved at so I was a little bit
smaller
Wang 177 grams or 6.24 ounces I'm gonna
go ahead convert everything over to
English I'm gonna do a quick tour of the
phone we've got this guy I'll convert
over to English fortunately our managing
editor Roy Choi is fluent in Korean
let's do a real quick tour of the phone
on the left hand side that is where your
SIM card is going to live on the right
hand side you've got nothing nothing on
the bottom except for a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack I've got a noise cancelling
mic and I will say that again millimeter
and there's your charge and sync port on
the top microphone you might be thinking
wow this phone comes with a stylus
that's cool it does not this is a SK
Telecom phone and a lot of phones in
South Korea have an antenna living here
for actually watching mobile television
they take advantage of some of the old
mobile radio bandwidth used to have in
the country so that's that
I don't able to use that anywhere else
unless you are in South Korea so let's
take a quick tour of the phone it's
pretty standard LG UI here you pull it
down and get all the there tweaks a cute
slide app lets you run to applications
on top of each other a lot of them here
as well you can see a calculator is
probably the most useful one you can go
ahead and run that on top and you could
change the opacity of it if you'd like
don't show this again and you can close
it whenever you want so you're probably
thinking yourself that's cool that it
flexes but what's the utility of it and
to be honest I'm not really sure what
utility of it is yet
LG claims when you watch movie you get
an IMAX like experience and when I first
heard that I kept thinking about the
Apple desktop then I realized talking
about the gigantic movie screen IMAX so
we'll watch a video on it and see if
that actually translates does curve and
it looks really nice how it's going to
fit in your pocket though we'll check
that to let you guys know if ease
are not usable it seems like this might
not be the most conducive less you got
super weird legs that would work but
other than that it's pretty standard LG
fair here too and they do a nice job I
think with their skin it's sort of UI
heavy but I think it's actually
relatively intuitive and the Snapdragon
800 should not be slowed down at all you
can see a lot of SK Telecom you think
that we get a lot of bloatware on our
phones with ATT Verizon or you know
t-mobile take a look at the bloatware
here man there's a lot of stuff that
comes on these phones
some are LG and some of course the sort
of carrier skins themselves and there is
quite a bit here so what a third space
is let you guys know what we think
anything you want to see about the LG G
flex be sure to let us know
it looks like aside from a crazy design
there's not that much here that we
haven't seen perhaps a crazy design adds
a whole bunch of new things to it if it
does we'll let you know if not we'll let
you know that too I don't think you guys
