here the nexus one is undoubtedly one of
the hottest Android handsets on the
market right now bringing with it some
really beefed up specs in a very
powerful processor but it also brought
Android 2.1 and I want to show you guys
what you can expect from Android 2.1
when it hits your device whenever that
maybe since there are a lot of really
cool new features that are found in this
update so let's start with the
lockscreen go ahead and unlock the
device on 2.0 you get sort of a round
swiping motion now you go right across
get the same functionality you had a 2.0
you can change the style from ring to
vibrate or just unlock if you slide it
right across well the first thing you're
going to notice are these crazy new live
wallpapers which is an addition in 2.1
sometime our interactive some of them
not so much they just sort of move
around and do different things i did a
video on the live wallpapers and showing
you all the ones on the devices but you
can see the one right here is a nexus
and this one responds to my touch
doesn't add any functionality and
probably drains a battery pretty
significantly but it is sort of fun to
look at so the next thing that's really
new is this applications button right
here gone is sort of the old drawer that
used to be there and you tap that and
you get a very different looking 3d sort
of almost wheel scrolling application
folder you see at the top right there
looks like they're actually coming out
and you scroll back up looks like
they're rolling back in nothing but eye
candy but still kind of neat to see in a
new home button right there that shows
up when you're in it go ahead and tap
home also new five home screens we've
seen multiple and extra home screens
added with things like motoblur and
Sense UI but this is just native sort of
version build of Android 2.1 now five
home screens that you can work with and
also you've got these little dots on the
bottom and helped make it easier to get
from home street to home screen if you
tap them it pulls up almost a webOS card
looking interface where you can see
screenshots of each home screen and you
can tap and go to the one that you want
to see the most kind of neat
another nice addition is the new
speech-to-text which
found in any area where there's text
entries so whether you're an email or
whether you're in text message I did a
full video showing how the
speech-to-text works and it works very
well anywhere really there's a keyboard
you are now going to have that little
microphone so you can see where to go
also when you're in your new messages
and you tap an icon you get a new bar
that comes up here with contacts draw
out a message M or Gmail or even map an
address it's sort of a neat little
feature that's been included with two
point one and something I haven't seen
many people mention so let's move along
here and show you some other cool things
that this has Gmail for example now
supports undo when you label or delete a
message which is quite nice accidentally
label or delete things out of time
there's now an undo function in the
built-in Gmail application also Google
Voice comes pre-installed something you
could download from the Android
Marketplace before but now it's just
sort of on the device another really
cool thing insert something that takes
advantage of the Snapdragon processor is
the new gallery that gets very 3d ish so
let me show you what that looks like go
and watch it up here go back to the menu
not sure what this looks like some 3d
animations right there and it arranges
it by day and pictures or video hit this
little scroll bar at the bottom you can
move and sort of scroll by different
days you're then so a picture I took on
the sixth hour pictures I took on the
10th sort of puts video and pictures in
the same thing so when I was doing a
comparison of the camera quality between
the Nexus One and the iPhone 3GS you can
see the pictures in the video that I
took to show that like tap on it view a
picture I can start a slideshow or see
the menu options right there I'll show
you some other things you can do the
video plays just right natively inside
video the cat that I use for
demonstration purposes and now also has
landscape mode go in turn that up it'll
rotate or scale itself accordingly and
very fast something sort of a cool dive
liked about Android 2.1 not really
getting that much increased
functionality but you're getting a lot
of increased sort of visual and design
cues it make it look a little bit more
polished let me show you some of the
aspects where you are getting this
functionality that's in the widgets one
of the cool things about Android is that
it's a widget based and you are of a few
new widget options here so there are the
wallpapers and live wallpapers are in
there that we talked about there are
some new widgets as well that are
available so here are some things I've
downloaded but you get a new weather
icon new picture frame and it's a few
other options you can see some of the
programs I have probably the most useful
new widget is weather and news so you
can see some news will come across right
there and it changes it so it's dynamic
content if you tap it so we get a
week-long forecast so i'm at irvine
california at 70 degrees here that's
quite nice it's like it's going to go to
rain on Monday but not that big a deal
and if we go back or hit the top there
you can see the top stories and go ahead
and scroll through and click on anything
that you like and it will launch the
browser all at all there's a lot of nice
new functionality in Android 2.1 don't
they look forward to four other Android
device owners so if you've got a Droid
or my tie dura hero or an heiress or a
moment or even a g1 whatever device you
have ultimately you probably will get
two point one since sort of a sneak
preview of what you can expect when it
hits your phone hope you guys enjoyed am
