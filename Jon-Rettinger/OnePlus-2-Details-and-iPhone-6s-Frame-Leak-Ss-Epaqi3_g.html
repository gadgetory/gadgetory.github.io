to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys in Markman second from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking about the
1+2 the galaxy note 5 and the s6 edge+
and we're also going to be talking about
the iphone 6s this is rumor roundup so
let's go ahead and get started 1 plus 2
details have been coming fast thanks to
regular leaks and announcements from 1
plus directly now a new set of sketch is
obtained by Business Insider may reveal
a whole lot more about the highly
anticipated smartphone the first sketch
shows the oneplus 2 from the front and
it looks fairly similar to the original
one though a few notes review little
feature an 8 megapixel camera up front
and that it's also going to feature a
stainless steel material along the
bottom edge of the device that could
wrap around entire phone moving on to
the back panel a second sketch suggests
1 plus won't be skimping on features one
note reveals plans for a dual lens
camera and that one plus will also add a
fingerprint reader which the company
already confirmed is coming the oneplus
he looks pretty great but these are just
sketches of the alleged device now even
if they came directly from one plus
there's no guarantee the actual device
will match perfectly the oneplus 2 will
make its official debut at the end of
July so it won't be too long until we
know more images of the iphone 6 s's
frame were leaked and surprised it looks
exactly like the existing iphone 6
according to the images the design will
remain the same it's got rounded edges a
slim body and those obnoxious antenna
lines it also shows the same button
arrangement speaker location and
headphone jack the cutout for the camera
and LED flash are also in the same spot
though it's hard to say if the camera
will support rude when the refresh hits
later this year what's notable about
this leak however is the fact that the
actual shell features new mounting
points for a new logic board 9to5 mac
claims that apple is working a double
the supported LTE speeds for the iphone
6s thanks to a new Qualcomm ship and
this upgrade should mean improved
battery life to welcomes new chip
supports LTE download speeds up to 300
megabits per second which is twice a
throughput of the iphone 6 upload speeds
apparently won't increase from where
they are now at 50 megabits per second
apple's new motherboard may also be more
compact in general and that means more
room inside the device possibly paving
the way
a slightly bigger battery that's what
I'm waiting for the iPhone 6s and iPhone
6s plus are also expected to feature
force touch though the exterior design
will likely not change Apple probably
won't unveil the new phones until
September but the device is apparently
already coming off the assembly line so
that means additional leaks are probably
just around the corner the galaxy note 5
and galaxy s6 edge+ are still
technically just rumored devices but
samsung's upcoming phablets are getting
closer each day no fresh leak reveals
what could be accurate case is designed
for both of the upcoming smartphones the
images were sent to phone Arena by
mobile direct a Romanian retailer with a
history of leaking high-end smartphones
mobile direct leaked the dummy iphone 5
model in 2012 and did the same for the
iphone 6 last year the newly leaked
photos didn't reveal much but they do
clear up a few design details based on a
rear cut out on both cases it looks like
the flash module will be located to the
side of the camera on the galaxy note 5
and the galaxy s6 edge+ rather than
below the lens the galaxy note 5 is
expected to be Samsung's most powerful
phone ever packing a 5.9 8 inch qhd
display a four thousand one hundred
million battery a new X you know 7422
chip and USB see support meanwhile the
galaxy s6 edge+ is expected to feature a
smaller 5.5 inch screen along with a
snapdragon 808 processor it's also
packing a 16 megapixel rear camera and a
5-megapixel front-facing shooter at this
point we're still counting on samsung to
reveal both phones in September at IFA

surprise us with an early announcement
