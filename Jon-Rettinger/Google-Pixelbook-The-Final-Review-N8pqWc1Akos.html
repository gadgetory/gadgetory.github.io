platypus it's made up of a bunch of
different parts that shouldn't seem like
they go together but somehow do so as a
picture book gets to be about a year of
life we're expecting a revamp version to
come from Google in the coming weeks but
I don't make sense to do a final review
a last revisited of a laptop that I've
been using pretty much every day for the
better part of a year now we did our
initial review I was pretty jazzed on it
in no way does this computer make sense
financially it's $1,000 starting point
for a Chromebook and the value is
clearly not there this is an extravagant
purchase I'm testing the baseline
version it's been great for me it's a
Core i5 and eight gigs of ram which
should be absolutely overkill for Chrome
OS you could spec it up up to I believe
1,700 bucks but now is that year starts
to tick and the calendar starts to go on
there are discounts to be had on the
pixel book so initial thought was the
thing that it was best at was battery
life when I did an issue review I was
getting almost ten hours of battery life
it's gotten significantly less awesome
new battery standpoint over time now I'm
hovering almost around half that between
five and six hours and my use has not
like changed at all all that's really
change is software updates and maybe the
battery is not as good as I initially
thought or it's not aging as well as I
would have initially thought so the big
drop had the Chromebook for me was I
could use it for days and days and days
and not really worry about charging it
that is becoming less true and as
battery life seems to be getting worse
the computer itself is becoming less
useful to me and things were pretty well
inside of Chrome most of the work I do
is inside of there and it runs Android
apps now as well and it runs almost a
full catalog of Google Play apps that's
been a nice to have those options but a
few caveats often times I found myself
dealing with duplicate apps not only
which one to use slack for example the
Chrome Web App is awesome but the
Android app sometimes useful as well
especially when it comes to
notifications so you end up with
duplicate apps you're not sure which I
kind of necessarily which that has kind
have been confusing otherwise Chrome OS
has been surprisingly full-featured so
using this computer I have had no issues
I've had no slowdown it's played 4k
video it's not everything I've needed it
to do with speed and alacrity but if you
guys can't guess I'm a sports guy
I had my fantasy football draft I do it
through Yahoo and it's all done through
Chrome and I was doing my draft I didn't
bring home my laptop serger the
Chromebook would be fine when I launched
the page to do the draft the computer
slowed to a halt
I couldn't scroll through players it
almost as like the thing absolutely
froze it was unusable to me to do this
fantasy draft that was the first time I
really saw maybe limitations of
chromatin that a hardware limitations
and it's got a Core i5 in it so not a
hardware issue at all is something that
was going on with Chrome OS and I tried
to look at more research on what Yahoo
uses it's not even a flash experience it
was just chrome struggled on it that's
of one instance and that was really the
only time I've had a problem and I won't
run into that problem until next year
when fantasy football season comes
around again but did again give me a
little bit of pause about the utility or
at least the long-term utility of the
pixel book so the software experience
aside the hardware is been absolutely
awesome it's held up really well
I had worries about these sort of
silicon pads on the sides getting dirty
they look pretty much brand new and
again I'm using this thing all the time
the screens been absolutely awesome and
beautiful I don't have any like dead
pixels of things that have happened the
bezels are still ginormous on this
obviously the bezels didn't shrink over
time but I thought I'd stopped noticing
them and I'm still very aware of how
giant the bezels are but I'm also still
aware of how great the keyboard is the
keyboard throw has been awesome the
shortcuts across the top make things
that you want to do a lot easier like
volume control even shortcuts for
screenshotting Google assistant is here
as well a dedicated button for it I've
actually very rarely used google
assistant on the computer I I'm not sure
why this hasn't used as much as I would
have thought listen I'm not gonna claim
that I use the pixel book pen more than
I have I probably used it about four
times but it doesn't work it works well
it's had software update to make the
experience even better
battery life is good on Abbott how to
replace it but I don't I don't use the
thing it's obviously the pics of book
one of the big draws behind it crazy
thin but it also bends and you do
different modes at nth mode of
presentation mode I've used that less
than I thought I would as well sometimes
if I'm showing something to someone or
showing a document to my wife I'll put
it in tablet mode but honestly I mostly
use it as a laptop which kind of goes to
show I clearly did not need the pixel
book I don't think anybody needs to fix
the book there's much less expensive
options if you want to get into Chrome
OS and a thousand bucks you're in the
world of some really good Windows
laptops perhaps some discounted Mac
books it's very crowded waters you
really have to want this nobody nobody
needs it so here's what it's boiled down
to for the most part my initial thoughts
after a few months still ring true the
battery life has been a surprising
disappointment with the pixel book I
still love the speed in which it boots
up that's thin with the biggest reasons
why I use it turn it on do something
quick turn it off and be done people
have used it for things like video
editing with this Android apps I haven't
necessarily pushed it that far if I have
to video edit I'll use my regular laptop
to do it speakers have been awesome I
love the fact it's got two USB type-c
ports on it used either for charging it
does charge very fast so that's been
nice sort of counter the depleted
battery experience that I've had at a
thousand bucks I cannot recommend this
at the top spec model in almost 1800
bucks
I can't imagine who that is for there's
been rumors that Google might allow a
dual boot we could put Windows 10 on it
then you could certainly see more
utility right now it's been a very nice
extravagance I don't think that I'll buy
the new version I'm probably just ill
stick with this chrome OS seems to be
fine but I'm less jazz about it due to
that that's battery life so that's been
the final review of the pixel book it
still does what I thought it was going
to do just get necessarily do it as long
if you guys like these final reviews we
serve the last revisited there's product
before they hit their end of life to get
in place with the newer version also let
us know in the comments and the best way
to let us know too is give the video a
thumbs up
always appreciate that until next time
