thinking yourself hey that's 5.8 inch
screen sounds awesome but I wish it was
6.2 what if I got good news for you
meets the Galaxy s8 plus and 6 more 2
inches sounds really big and it is a big
phone it looks absolutely beautiful but
you do not need like ginormous sized
hand to hold it the phone is mostly all
screens they got a much bigger screen in
a smaller package and holy crap that
screen look gorgeous
it's a quad HD panel at 2965 1440 it's
got a 530 PPI and every one of those
those ppis
go to make an incredible looking package
video looked absolutely awesome I
thought some mobile HDR content is phone
support and it looked gorgeous the
infinity display here is the big story
much like a galaxy s 8 it looks like
thing is all screen it's got the curved
edges we've seen before but it's a way
less subtle curve than we've seen at the
galaxy s7 edge I'm previous edge devices
I didn't like the way those looks you're
going to be probably pretty happy here a
lot of the story here though is it's an
S state with the bigger screens all the
stuff you love or don't know about the
s8 is going to be here on the s8 plot
fingerprint reader is now on the back
we've got a touch sensitive area on the
front of the device where your home
button is and then your back and your
multitasking buttons are going to be
there so the home button as I could
understand it works like this on screen
home buttons like we've seen before
but instead like you for watching a
video on Android you've got a tap screen
the buttons appear and then hit home
from any app you can kind of do a force
touch on the bottom that will take you
Amelie home so it sort of cuts out the
intermediate tap screen steps a lot of
other new things the Galaxy S line of
phones are here again just like the
Galaxy s8 the Irish getting technology
we saw on the note 7 really surprisingly
fast face detection although it is a
low-level
Samsung claimed not going to be fooled
by like a picture or video but kind of
want to test that for myself 64 gigs of
internal storage is going to be standard
you can of course expand that via
microSD power and this guy in the US is
going to be Snapdragon 835 or a samsung
built XE nose if you live outside of the
so those are things that are new some
stuff that's the same four gigs of ram
is the same we've seen on last
generation phones as well as that 12
megapixel camera sensor same sensor is
the note 7 and same as we saw with the
s7 s7 edge the Samsung does forever its
worst claim software improvement what is
new though is a front-facing camera it's
now 8 megapixel with an S 1.7 aperture
all the other stuff you'd expect for
flagship Samsung's are here you've got
wireless charging got fast charging now
with us news is nice to have and of
course it's got the pretty awesome ip68
water-resistant almost waterproof also
new here is Samsung's new AI Bixby eye
so it's a little bit of time going
through what it can do and our galaxy s
8 hands on so go ahead and check that
out also new or some new accessories to
go along with you sculpt I went through
all those in more detail on a Galaxy s8
video but it's a new gear VR a new gear
360 and also a new mesh system with
smart things built so like me you may
have had some complaints to Samsung in
the past with really heavy software it
seems at least on first impressions of
sampling listened the UI seems like
Samsung got really out of their way and
focus on what works
you now have kind of a Google pixel
style type launcher we have swiped up
into the app and it doesn't care to be
too much on top of that it looks like
fans like the best of Google with the
best of Samsung I found a really nice
combination here just because I feel
like I got to say it now in phone videos
there is a headphone jack
hooray for that there will be headphones
acquitted in the box the same thing was
really proud of their tune by AKG and
they claim that if they sold these
suckers it'd be about a hundred bucks to
buy they're still in the box headphone
so I don't know how they're going to
sound but they are there regardless can
plug your own headphones in because got
that jack
so remember this with the Galaxy S eight
plus somebody who's held it yeah it's
big because it's almost all screens
doesn't feel nearly that big in the hand
you're debating between the SI at me si
plus probably go to a store and try it
and see them for yourself it's already
like a big screen phones
I think jump into the si plus you're not
going to regret it the screen looked
absolutely gorgeous in fact I am
pre-ordering a galaxy s 8 plus for
myself I came away that infrared that's
about the best endorsement I can give
anything as putting my own money behind
it and worrying in black just
throwing that out there I think the
black looks best I wish the US was
getting the really awesome blue or even
the gold and Federer skidding like to
depreciate the gray and and that darker
color winked all this stuff again down
below if you want to learn more but what
are you guys getting if anything and
that's eight and say plus what color or
why or why not
are you skipping this one leaving the
comments down below have a conversation
about it
so next time John Rangers will
