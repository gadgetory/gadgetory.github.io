you by audible in my oh so fabulous fake
radio voice well hello there how's it
going it's John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
apse in the last episode electro star o
X 10 suggested that I check out our
permit for iOS and Android Opera Mini
isn't really anything new but as a
longtime opera user I feel like it
deserves a go so hang on to your 3d
glasses folks with this episode of
what's the apps we're gonna be checking
out Opera Mini for many years opera was
my main browser
I loved the UI and I really really
really loved the mouse gestures I mean
out of this world
I only recently switched over to Chrome
because of the Google syncing and and I
really really liked the web development
tools in chrome they're just really
awesome and plus it's really lightweight
and portable compact fits in your pocket
kind of thing love that opera did a
stand-up job by integrating their slick
and stylish UI down to their mobile
applications but is it necessarily
better than your phone's native browser
well we'll just have to see let's start
off with the basic Opera Mini features
that your mobile browser might not have
opera starter page is pretty awesome
it's a visual display of your bookmarks
and can be customized pretty easily
sharing is natively integrated the tabs
are really really cool and check this
out
there's a find in page option which I
really appreciate not to mention it
works really really well there are also
options to adjust text size as well as
image quality to improve load times full
screen mode is also always appreciated
because you know like having 20 pixels
at the top and bottom just so so very
important performance wise I've tested
Opera Mini on these three devices each
with its own popular operating system
and all over the Wi-Fi first let's start
off with Android Opera Mini more or less
works like the default Android browser
if you didn't know any better you think
that you were using the same web
browsing application some pros of opera
would be that when scrolling up or down
an arrow pops up which can take you to
either the top or bottom of the page
scrolling also feels a little bit
smoother this might be a little bit hard
to see on camera but you just got to
trust me on this one
some cons would be that the images of
the hood pretty nasty even unquote high
quality
also behaves a little bit strange when
rotated as instead of readjusting the
browser sighs it kind of zooms in into
the text content also Opera Mini doesn't
look like it supports a video playback
shoot you don't even see a link to open
it on YouTube or anything the fullscreen
non mobile desktop site loaded pretty
okay but the menu was a little bit
screwed up I noticed this on other sites
as well not all but some the experience
is similar on iOS but it's more pleasant
than horrible Opera scrolling is
absolutely fantastic on iOS much better
than safaris which I thought was pretty
good at first but now looks all weak
feeble and frail compared to this
free-spirited one swipe never ends kind
of experience you'd get on opera
unlike Android images render just fine
and video shows up as well but like
Android it has that weird when in
landscape mode I must zoom into
everything kind of thing going on lastly
let's check out Opera Mini on a non
touchy small screen no nonsense all
business of ice like this blackberry but
first a quick word from our sponsors at
audible.com audible.com is the leading
provider of digital downloadable
audiobooks and spoken word entertainment
audible has over 75,000 wonderful titles
to choose from to be downloaded on to
your mp3 or iPod to be played by
anywhere anytime ok choose from books in
every genre science fiction thrillers
drama comedy business history and much
much more
I was on there and I saw that they had
some titles from George Carlin now I
have as ebooks but there's nothing like
you know carlins words spoken by the man
himself and having that playing in the
background via audiobook while you do
work
awesome awesome stuff like makes me
happy inside to get any of George
Carlin's works or any of the 75,000 plus
titles just go to
audiblepodcast.com/tekzilla our do book
download of your choice when you sign up
today
back to the review we all know that the
web browsing experiences are really too
good on them blackberries and if you
didn't know that then
hey man the web browsing experience not
too good and then blackberries stuff
usually takes time to load stuff renders
incorrectly things break sometimes
spawns are just ridiculously tiny and
all that fun fabulous stuff and with
Opera Mini it doesn't get any better in
fact it gets worse not only the stuff
usually break but on a lot of sites text
is shrunk and shifted to the left for
some reason you can definitely see this
a lot on non mobile
sites look overall I can't really give a
rating for this one as the experience is
different for different alessa's but
I'll say this if it works the features
of Opera Mini are pretty gosh-darn cool
and the darn thing is free so you don't
really have much to lose here so I'd
recommend Opera Mini for iOS or Android
but if you're on a blackberry stick with
the default browser I know that's not
saying much but but yeah just stick with
the default browser thank you very much
for checking out my review of Opera Mini
if you have any applications in mind
that you would like me to check out let
me know by commenting this is John to
you from TechnoBuffalo thank you very
much for tuning in and I'll see you guys
next time
