from TechnoBuffalo and today I have a
review for you guys of the Dell XPS 15 9
550 Signature Edition a lot to remember
there but I'm very excited to review
this laptop because it's pretty awesome
right out the gate so a couple things I
want to cover our pros cons neutrals and
my overall impressions of a laptop but
before we get to that first is a
performance and the speed because it is
a laptop it has to get work done has to
a heavy duty work done can it do it so
in terms of spec you're rocking a core
i7 2.6 gigahertz processor from Intel it
is very very fast and very capable we
have 16 gigs of ram in this one we have
500 gigs of PCIe SSD storage which is
all very very fast and we have a 2
gigabyte Nvidia graphics card which is 2
gigs of dedicated memory works very well
is very fast and very capable I did a
lot of video editing on it and it got
through most 4k footage without too much
problem or complication compared to
something like a MacBook Pro I'd say
it's definitely on par the 15-inch
obviously in some cases actually a
little bit faster I felt because CUDA
works a little bit better with Adobe
since they sort of embraced that but
overall really really good in terms of
performance moving on to the pros and
cons things I really like on the front
where you have your keyboard below the
texture of the laptop is rubberized soft
and does a great job it's very
comfortable very easy for you to rest
your wrist
type very high quality feeling the
texture is superb moving up a couple
inches we have the keyboard and this is
probably one of the best keyboards IV
used to date nothing too crazy here good
travel very flat great design and just
works really well before I knew it I was
typing very very quickly on it without
much issue or many errors so good job
from Dell they're a little odd maybe
kind of a fetish thing that I really
liked was the power button it has a
physical pressable power button and the
tactility behind it was really really
nice just pressing it was really
satisfying so take that for what you
will and probably my favorite thing
about this laptop is the screen it is
nearly bezel less 4k absolutely stunning
display just one of the best displays
I've ever seen it is a touch screen I
don't really use Windows 10 with the
touch screen down often it just isn't
optimized for my liking
even in tablet mode the apps are still
desktop app so I'm not a huge fan I use
it for scrolling and stuff but not much
else that being said the one inch I did
see with the screen
was stunning was it was a little
oversaturated for my liking especially
the Reds in certain colors would just
pop a little too much that is for my
liking
but if you're just watching movies and
doing a lot of content consumption
you'll probably like this display I'll
probably one of the best on the market
for you now I did mention this is a
touch screen and so credit to Dell
because the hinge is pretty damn good
here it's very firm and so you're not
gonna have too much flex in the screen
so if you do want to use Windows 10 with
the touch screen if you do enjoy that
experience on a laptop you will be able
to do so here without too many issues it
also is a battery indicator on the side
which is great one button you can see
what your battery life is like it's like
on the old MacBook Pros or like on a
multipack with the recent loss of the SD
card slot on the new MacBook Pros I feel
it's important to rejoice having an SD
card slot here it's a really good SD
card slot what I mean by a good SD card
slot is the way it takes that ste card
and how much of SD card is poking in or
out so I'm using the last gen 15-inch
MacBook Pros my daily driver and the SD
card sticks out pretty far and there's
always a fear of me slamming it on the
side of a desk and breaking the SD card
with this it's very solid hold the SD
card in place and it goes in about 3/4
of the way so you don't have an SD card
hanging off the edge again it's the
small things that make a really good
experience with a laptop like this ports
a pretty standard here you have two USB
3 ports one Thunderbolt port your power
you have a headphone out which is also
your mic and you have an HDMI out so
pretty much everything you're going to
need moving on to cons the first thing I
wasn't a huge fan of was a trackpad
there's nothing really wrong with it but
coming from a MacBook Pro where the
entire trackpad is clickable having the
bottom only click here on the Dell XPS
was a little bit hard for me to get used
to if you're coming from a similar
trackpad it might not be an issue but I
think they could have still done a
better job one of the bigger issues that
I ran into on a day-to-day basis was not
having a lip under the screen it sounds
like a really small complaint but every
day when you go to open up your laptop
you have to dig your nails under the
screen to lift it up and even when you
do that the whole bottom of the laptop
comes up to is pretty annoying razor is
one of the few companies along with
Apple that's figured this out so to see
it not here I don't know why it's so
difficult to do it's pretty frustrating
probably the worst part of this laptop
are the speakers they're not good at all
I don't know if it's because it's under
the rubberized texture but they sound
super muffled super bass heavy and just
really not good so
I recommend you bring pair of headphones
or speakers with you one of the biggest
things with a laptop is always the
battery life according to Dell you get
about 10 hours of battery life which is
pretty on par with most laptops of this
size however in my usage I did got
nowhere near this bear in mind I'm doing
hardcore video editing so I'm pushing
the CPU and the GPU to its max at all
times so I ran out of battery in like an
hour using Adobe Premiere most of you
will get somewhere probably between five
to seven hours if you're very very
frugal with your usage you can probably
get to that ten hours I never even got
close that's because of the type of work
I was doing however expect from this
laptop in the battery department what
you would expect from most other laptops
in this sort of region of the market and
last but definitely not least if you're
wondering what the Signature Edition
means here's what it is it means the
device comes with no bloatware no junk
where it comes pre-installed antivirus
software for the lifetime of the device
and it means you have to buy from the
Microsoft Store this is interesting and
important because it's almost like
Microsoft's version of what Google has
done with Nexus devices and right out
the gate I'm a big fan of it I think
this is how the device is intended to be
one of my biggest issues with Windows is
you have to go through when you get a
device uninstall a bunch of stuff and
you run into popups and none of that
here very smooth very fluid experience
and makes Windows a much better pleasure
to use than it normally would be with a
bunch of extra stuff on it and so those
are really my thoughts on the Dell XPS
15 this laptop is mainly for people who
are looking for a hard core performance
machine that looks kind of underrated
I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic but
it is a sleeper laptop you won't be
tracking too much attention but you can
definitely get everything you need to
get done the touchscreen if you like
that is a nice additional feature
display is insanely amazing and if you
compare to something like a 15-inch
MacBook Pro it's considerably cheaper
for similar specs and equal performance
in my opinion you'll get it at about
five to seven hundred dollars less
depending on exactly how you configure
the device there's obviously other
laptops out there and we can do
comparisons with those if you want to
see that let us know in the comments
down below give us a thumbs up if you
liked this video and I'll see you guys
