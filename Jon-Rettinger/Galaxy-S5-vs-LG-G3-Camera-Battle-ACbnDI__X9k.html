to you by Dollar Shave Club what's going
on guys Oh Marklin sangyoon from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be taking
a quick look at the LG g3 and the
samsung galaxy s5 and see how the
cameras on both these devices compare
and we'll be seeing some low-light shots
ease of use and see the performance on
these two bad boys and we're going to
see who wins first up is LG g3 if you
haven't seen a review for this device
already we just want to quickly
reiterate how incredible it is design is
terrific the screen is great and the
entire experience is one of the best
we've ever seen the camera though is
what really impressed us the LG g3 comes
equipped with a 13 megapixel rear facing
camera with optical image stabilization
this function helps reduce blur and
shaking and ensure your photos come out
crisp and clear and even in low-light
situations
the g3 also sports a laser autofocus
which is used to more accurately and
instantly measure the distance to your
subject this allows for the fastest
possible autofocus giving you the
ability to take photos quickly there's
nothing more frustrating than a camera
that struggles to focus the g3 has no
issues whatsoever also beside that 13
megapixel shooter is a dual LED flash
which promises better illumination and
even more natural tones digging a little
deeper to the g3 it's also capable of
shooting video of course including 4k
Ultra HD the galaxy s5 on the other hand
sports a slightly bigger 16 megapixel
sensor along with a single LED flash
Samsung doesn't include oh I as though
the company does provide digital
stabilization which uses software
enhancement to provide shake free video
and crisper images it can film in 4k too
which is where the digital stabilization
really comes in handy
Samsung also promised a faster autofocus
along with the real-time HDR processing
selective focus that allows you to lower
the background in a more improved
interface but where the s5 really shines
is in a future Department there's a ton
of options and customizations including
best photo best face eraser drama shot
and many many more basically anything
you can think of was included so we give
Sam some credit for offering such a
robust experience filled with plenty of
cool features despite all those features
the Galaxy s5s user interface is
actually fairly intuitive and pretty
easy to navigate the g3 scammer app
isn't all that bad either
has a great interface it's very
simplistic and reminds me a bit of the
stock Google camera app but with a bit
more of LG skin over it all the menus
and settings are pretty easy to swipe
through to all the necessary settings
and shooting modes are just a click away
it doesn't come with quite as many
shooting modes and options s5 but it's
still very impressive and the simplicity
of it all might make the overall
experience less daunting on paper the
galaxy s5 seems like the better camera
but we've learned in the past a higher
megapixel count doesn't always equal
superior quality just look at the iPhone
5s as 8 megapixel camera as an example
more megapixels stuffed onto a smaller
sensor can often result in greater your
pictures and poor low-light performances
it's often a fine line when a company
bumps up the megapixel Cal the g3 has a
sensor size of 8.4 millimeter while the
galaxy s5 is slightly bigger at nine
point seven millimeter but size doesn't
always matter
the g3 packs a slightly smaller
megapixel count on a smaller sensor
giving it about the same low-light
performance as the galaxy s5 and in real
world testing it seems that the g3 0 is
really helps in low-light situations the
camera can shoot in slower shutter speed
and a lower ISO to give it a nicer and
cleaner look low-light shots on galaxy
s5 seems to have more noise and image
and the color reproduction doesn't seem
to match what we naturally see in person
or produced by the g3 when it comes to
different lighting conditions like out
in broad daylight the galaxy s5 is up to
par if not better than the g3 I find
that some of the shots seems to be much
sharper while colors are more vivid and
there's not too much contrast compared
to the g3 super contrast the images the
auto white balance on these two cameras
are completely different to both the g3
and the galaxy s5 can vary in different
lighting conditions sometimes the g3 s
camera tends to showcase a much more
warmer tone while the Galaxy s5 has a
bit cooler look to it and vice versa
let's take a quick break from this video
and thank our friends at Dollar Shave
Club buying razors suck right you got to
walk to the store pick out a razor and
shell out $20 for some ridiculous shave
tech you don't even need fortunately

Dollar Shave Club and it couldn't be any
simpler for a few bucks a month Dollar
Shave Club ships amazing razors and
other bathroom stuff right to your door

price they've also got dr. Carver's easy
shave butter to make your shave even
more buttery smooth shave time shave
money join now at
dollarshaveclub.com/tekzilla follow
that's dollarshaveclub.com/tekzilla flow
performance-wise these two devices can
take some pretty quick photos which is
super helpful with quick moving action
scenes the laser autofocus on the g3
really speeds up the process of taking
multiple photos at once while the s5 is
no slouch either a lot of shots I've
taken on the g3 seems to get the proper
exposure it's not too overexposed and
not too underexposed
while the galaxy s5 on the other hand
seems to be over exposing some shots and
the images tends to get a bit washed out
though in broad daylight they're both
great when it comes to video both
devices are pretty much identical they
can both film in 4k Ultra HD and
slow-motion 720p video but I find that
the g3 once again dominates in this
session thanks to its oh is there's less
camera shakes and the gel of effect
isn't so noticeable the mic on both
these devices are pretty good too
they're not the best but definitely
still good enough for everyday use we
already posted our 4k video tests on our
channel so we'll leave a link down below
to both camera tests in full 4k so you
can see for yourself the overall quality
to these two devices output so to wrap
things up I'm definitely going to have
to go with the LG g3 on this one it's
got great autofocus speeds it's got the
optical image stabilization
even though has less megapixels that
really shouldn't matter to you guys
since you're not printing anything and
you're just going to post it online so
what do you guys think of these two
devices which one would you prefer let
us know in the comments down below and
as always a märklin segment
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys in the
next video hey thanks for watching this
