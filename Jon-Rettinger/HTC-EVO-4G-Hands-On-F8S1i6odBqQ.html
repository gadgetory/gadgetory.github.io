HTC evo 4g it was announced at ctia it
will be available this summer some
highlights of night on the product first
it's a 4.3 inch screen it's actually the
largest screen size that will be on the
market 4.3 by the way is about thirty
percent larger than what you've seen
from other products sorry to do that to
you it's actually got a snapdragon
processor which is a 1 gigahertz
processor the thing about that is it
just is blazing fast in terms of the
processing speed it uses android to dot
1 the latest android operating system
which gives you a host of new
capabilities and what you'll see with
HTC is they have something called sense
and sense allows you to really
personalize the device and you can have
up to I think it's seven different
screens so you can have a personal life
of business life it's it's like your
computer and your PC where you can set
up different different home screens so
what you see right now is just the front
of the product you'll actually see
because of the video experience we
actually have a kickstand so you can set
it up and watch video show you that if
you also see on the back that you've got
an 8 mega mega pixel camera with flash
it's also got zoom as well 8 megapixel
camera again will be the highest
megapixel strength on the market today
we did that because we want people to
take caps really capture and then share
precious moments and so you can't do
that with a lower end camera and it's
also a camcorder so one of the things
you can do with with 4G and that's
really the big news obviously is this is
the first 3g 4g device on the market is
you're going to be able to share very
quickly you can capture a video and then
share it very very quickly ok the other
thing that's unique about the product is
on the front it's actually got a
one-point
1.3 megapixel camera so we've actually
got two cameras and lots of people say
well why would you put two cameras on
the device it will again with 4G what 4G
really gives you is ten speed ten times
faster than what you currently have with
3g so it enables a lot of video
capabilities so video chat for example
is something that can be utilized on a
product like this now there's not a
specific application today but we
announced a developer toolkit just this
week at CTA so you have lots of people
that develop things whether it's virtual
reality stuff whether it's video chat
but they'll build and take advantage of
the dual cameras so let me show you how
to show you easily kind of swype this is
again I talked about that the HTC Sense
I've got multiple different screens and
here's a good example of a product
called quick quick is really exciting
and that what i can do is actually take
a video showcase that i'm taking a video
and this obviously video in just this
room so not that exciting but think
about it if I were taking a picture of
my daughter's dance recital and what's
great about it is you can see you are
live at quick calm I can actually
broadcast via streaming I can broadcast
whatever I'm showcasing so whether it's
my debt my daughter's dance recital and
I want my parents to see it that live a
thousand miles away they can they can go
to that website and see it I can also
capture it and share it and when I share
I can share to things like Facebook so
what it's enabling is is really
providing a video experience unlike any
other both capture and then share
can you demonstrates whether key
features from the mobile hotspot out
what I can do is just probably talk more
about the mobile hotspot because it is
one of the unique capabilities of this
device in addition to it being a multi
multimedia experience it also is a
mobile hotspot so think about it like a
mobile broadband card but what's
different about it is it actually acts
as a centerpiece so you can enable up to
eight Wi-Fi devices those Wi-Fi devices
so think about it being a PC you can
actually think about it being an itouch
can use Wi-Fi to come into the device
and the device will actually provide out
either 3g if you're in a 3g market or 4G
speeds so it really is providing you a
broadband connection that's that's dsl
like so i could sit this down in a room
have three people on their laptops and
they're literally having a broadband
experience running through this device
that pretty much takes up the size of
the device yeah
you can see that we're operating in 4G
move you to a video go faster
termination
you mean es support yeah so you have
Exchange ActiveSync contacts and
calendar joan as you know we're
currently in 27 markets Houston San
Francisco New York they all in 2010
yesterday we have to announce additional
seven markets including Miami and LA so
it's me so we'll be reaching around
under 20 million pop targeted by the end
of this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
