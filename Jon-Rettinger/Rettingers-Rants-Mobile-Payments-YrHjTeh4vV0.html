to you by netflix welcome back to the
episode of rettinger Frances to show
where I rant and rave on anything for
the world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside of it of this week I
want to talk about mobile payments I was
all jazzed up to get my blackberry z10
with nfc-enabled and I saw that there's
yet another form of mobile payments
enabled on this guy and it's pissing me
off let's go ahead and get started so
when NFC was first introduced since are
becoming mainstream and phones we were
promised mobile payments now certainly
mobile payments been a very polarizing
subject for some it seems like an
awesome incredible thing no need to
carry Walt anymore just carry your phone
for others it seems like a security
nightmare potentially a way for a thief
or criminal to totally empty your bank
account I probably lie somewhere in the
middle but I'm more on the tech side
really I just want to try using mobile
payments so enter Google with Google
Wallet especially in the u.s. they said
hey we are standardizing this we're
gonna make sure that the terminals that
are already in existence can support
google wallet go ahead and check out our
galaxy nexus phone and get your payment
on I was super excited and I tried to
use it at one store then accept it
Jackie does another store didn't accept
it Trek used at a third store didn't
accept it store after store after store
that have these quick pass terminals
were not accepting google wallet or it
was turned off overwhelming the reason
that i heard was people were scared
there's a ton of misinformation people
thought that if you walked by the
terminal with the phone in your pocket
something all your information would pop
up so we have not seen mobile payments
take off now it's gotten even worse now
we've got mobile payment fragmentation
we've got google wallet you've got the
US carriers here with Isis you've got
paypal mobile transfers you've got at a
credit card mobile payments you've got a
ton of different options they're really
tough for any mobile payment system to
take off until we can standardize one
doesn't matter what it is and there's
still a big elephant room about what
Apple's gonna do there's been rumors
that Apple is gonna introduce their own
mobile payment system and of course it's
gonna throw another giant monkey wrench
into the how do I pay with my phone
business and I know that's not unique to
the US
a lot of the Asian countries NFC and
mobile payments are really the most
common way that people pay you don't
need to carry cash or coins anymore just
carry your phone with usually have with
you anyway so I want to see something
get standardized be an Isis or be it a
paypal assist ever be at Google Wallet
somehow could just get this standardized
so we can find a way to pay we can
address security concerns and we can try
and move on to a modern era I don't know
why I feel so strongly about this but
I've always wanted to use my phone to
pay impresses the geek and me and the
cool factor just being like i just paid
with my phone i know in some cities
google wallet is accepted more than
others i've been in san francisco and
tried to pay in cabs and says Google
Wallet enables but it didn't work when I
tried it and i keep getting disappointed
you guys agree or disagree you care
about mobile payments are you as worried
some people are about security you wish
you could put a thumb print on it some
sort of other biometrics or just a pin
code good enough for you write about
people and like try and spoof your
account number and trying to discover
your PIN I really want hear what you
guys have to say I definitely feel you
on the security concerns and I think
that if I was going to use mobile
payments as my regular mode of pang
there has to be some sort of extra level
of securities to where I felt
comfortable using it well see what
that's going to be done hopefully that
will get address as well in the near
future let me take a minute from the
rants thank our friends and sponsors at
