pen gate strikes the note 5 and we ask
Siri for a hint I'm r % / TechnoBuffalo
and this is definitely a video that
you're watching on the Internet hello
friends and welcome back to another
episode of a show that I am making that
we are making together thank you all so
much for your suggestions you were super
enthusiastic about coming up with a name
and we have narrowed it down to chew and
I would love for you guys to vote and
see which one you think is better and
that is what we will name the show so
the finalists are the Buffalo breakdown
or the Buffalo down you can hit the link
to the pole in the description or you
can click on it right here in this
vicinity you're my hands in this magic
area right here and you can definitely
make sure your voice gets heard
hopefully this doesn't start a bitter
rivalry that will echo through the ages
but I am looking forward to seeing what
you guys all pick i also got all your
feedback loud and clear and it seems a
lot of you do want me to cover some of
the more broader things and what i would
kind of consider nerd culture so i'm
including a few gaming and entertainment
stories this week i'm planning to just
kind of keep everything still tech focus
with a smattering of gaming and
entertainment but if there's enough
demand it might make sense to break them
out into the road shows or do their own
section in this one so thankfully i know
you guys will keep letting me know what
you think in the comments so we will
keep the show fluid for as long as we
need to all right let's get into it
first up Cortana is now available for
android in public beta if you're not
familiar with Cortana it is the little
personal assistant just like Siri or
Google now but it is usually on Windows
Windows 10 and Windows Mobile which is
all going to be the same thing now
Cortana even lets you replace Google now
as your voice assistant of choice
forcing Google now to take that back
seat question is whether or not it's
going to be smart enough to stay there
so you can go ahead and give it a try
for yourself you can grab that beta or
you can check out our video right here
on TechnoBuffalo detailing cortana and
what she can do while we're on the topic
if you've ever felt weird about how much
facebook knows about you get get ready
to
weirder Facebook this week announced and
their very own digital assistant that's
powered by facebook Messenger David
Marcus the VP of messaging at facebook
says that M will be powered by an AI but
it'll also be supervised by humans M is
going to be able to find and buy
products for you book reservations
secure travel arrangements all that kind
of fun stuff it is currently in testing
so it's still going to be a little while
before it launches at scale but you
could wind up with it on your device pop
it up saying hey you're a beta tester if
you're lucky after months and months of
drooling at least for me the u.s. is
finally confirmed to be getting an
official release of the Pokemon fighting
game pokken tournament it is made by the
team behind Tekken and pokken tournament
pits your favorite pocket monsters
against one another in glorious HD and
they're coming to the u.s. in spring of
2016 will be able to battle with the
best of them on the Wii U I cannot wait
to see a complete roster and start
diving into the mechanics of this game
Plus after seeing what its gonna look
like it makes me pine for the day that
we finally get a fully realized pokemon
MMO for those of you with a brand
spankin new galaxy note 5 i'm going to
need you to set the device down and go
read the manual because otherwise you
risk doing major functional damage to
your device the flagship feature of the
note 5 otherwise known as the s-pen
apparently fits a little too comfortably
into its slot when it's inserted
backwards unfortunately it doesn't come
out quite as easily while it can still
be removed appliers if you insert your S
Pen into your no.5 backwards it will
permanently disable the sensor that
detects depends presence which means
that any functionality related to
removing the pen will cease to function
properly while this is certainly a huge
oversight on samsung spark come on guys
pay attention to your pen put it in the
right way alright I'm gonna need a
minute for this story I'm still kind of
reeling from the news but Instagram now
supports photos of all dimensions that's
right square photos are no longer the
only option for Instagram the
facebook-owned company said in their
blog post that was announcing the chain
that the visual story that you're trying
to tell should always come first of
course the photo will be cropped into a
square for viewing in your profile grid
but your friends will be able to see
that panoramic selfie in all its
landscape oriented glory speaking of
Instagram Star Wars footage hit our
retinas this week via the film's
Instagram page the 15 second clip shows
ray with bb-8 in a forest and finn using
what we believe is luke and or / or
Anakin's lightsaber and a little bit of
dialogue there's been an awakening
have you felt
if lens flare Abrams is pedigree is to
be trusted we should be in for a treat
come December eighteenth which is when
we should be seeing Star Wars Episode
seven the force awakens lastly of course
it is that time of year again and Apple
has sent out invites for their upcoming
event on September 9th in San Francisco
the invite reads hey Siri give us a hint
iphone users you can actually ask Siri
hey Siri give me a hint and you will be
greeted with a cryptic statement about
the date we will certainly be there
covering all the sweet news for you and
in case you're not sure there is a crazy
good chance that we'll be seeing the
iphone 6s but the question of one more
thing still remains alright kids you've
been informed thank you so much for
watching if you have thoughts questions
comments mean things to say I don't know
you can comment below or tweet me over
at mark be as usual you can hit that
subscribe button if you would like tiny
else to deliver videos directly to your
retinas and finally thank you for
watching be kind to each other and I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
