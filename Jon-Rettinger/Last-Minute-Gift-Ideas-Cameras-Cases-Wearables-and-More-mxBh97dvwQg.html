to you by Linda calm what's going on
guys a m√§rklin sanger from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be giving you guys a
bunch of last minute gift ideas for
friends loved ones and even yourself
christmas is just a few days away so we
hope this little video could help you
out now before we begin we're gonna have
a few different categories to choose
from we're going to talk about streaming
sticks headphones battery packs
wearables cameras subscription services
and phone cases most of these gifts are
fairly affordable and will make great
last minute stocking stuffers so let's
start off with streaming stick store a
bunch of notable ones on the market
right now including the google
chromecast Roku streaming stick and fire
TV stick these streaming sticks are the
easiest quickest ways to get into the
world of content streaming and require
very little setup if any each stick has
its own perks if your begin to Amazon
and you have prime membership and with
the fire TV stick you'll get access to
Amazon's awesome instant video service
but if you're more into Google's library
of content and won a mirror stuff from
your computer screen or smartphone to
your TV the chromecast is the way to go
if you want a powerhouse streaming stick
with access to more than 1000 channels
then the roku stick is an awesome choice
all three are priced between thirty to
fifty dollars and you can't go wrong
with either one moving on to headphones
now I'm not an audiophile whatsoever but
we can recommend some great headphones
that we enjoy using there's a jaybird jf
three monster DNA's the Bose
QuietComfort 25s and the JVC HAF x 1 x
now these headphones vary in prices and
also vary in sound quality if you're on
a budget you can't go wrong with the JVC
HAF x 1 x there are only thirty dollars
in the sound quality and bill quality is
amazing now if you don't want to deal
with tangled wires and want something
wireless that jaybird jf three is an
awesome choice it features the Bluetooth
connection for music and calls it
provides about five to six hours of
battery life depending on how you use it
and sound quality is solid for sixty
dollars now if you're not so much on the
budget take a look at the monster DNA on
your headphones for a hundred fifty
dollars you're not only getting some
really stylish headphones but you get to
choose from a variety of bright colors
Ron uses them on a daily basis and he
absolutely loves them they're both
comfortable and the sound is incredible
offering good base with good highs and
mids as well now if you want something
that will sit comfortably for hours I
mean plane rides the bose qc25 s are the
way to go they're a bit pricey at three
hundred dollars but you have an awesome
rechargeable battery that it lasts for
days again depending on how you use them
and they also come with noise
cancellation which is incredible I'm
still using the older QC 15 s from Bose
and I love them they're not overly big
where they look silly using them in
public but the sound and comfortability
you get from them is top-notch battery
packs are getting more and more popular
these days and it's because their
smartphones don't last as long as we
need them to luckily there are some
really affordable options out there
anchor offers a bunch of options that
vary in different battery sizes and
prices and we think the anchor efore
which only costs thirty dollars in the
e6 which costs sixty dollars are the
best bang for the buck from anchor it'll
be able to charge your device for days
and that's really awesome to have it's
only as big as the note 4 or 6 plus
maybe just a tiny bit longer but the e4
offers a 13,000 milliamp battery while
the e6 offers a bigger twenty thousand
eight hundred million battery now if you
don't mind spending that extra thirty
dollars to get a bigger battery then go
for the e6 bill quality may not be the
best feature its glossy plastic but if
you want something higher quality yet
one a good amount of juice the mophie
power station XL which comes with a
twelve thousand million battery is going
for a hundred thirty dollars if battery
life means more to you than bill quality
then you've already made up your mind
2014 was a year wearables really made an
impact on the market and there are a
bunch of there you can choose from from
fitness gadgets to smart watches and if
you're into tracking your activity the
jawbone up24 is an awesome device that
will count your steps track your sleep
and also act as a reminder or alarm if
you've been sitting down for too long
it's a great device if you want to
improve your health and be more active
and it's only going for a hundred twenty
dollars you can download the up 24 epes
and see how many steps you've taken or
how many hours of sleep you got last
night and so forth but if you don't care
about all of that and want more of a
timepiece and something that will feed
you notifications
we recommend a pebble and or any of the
Android wear devices if you're using iOS
the only SmartWatch that's available
right now that'll feed you notifications
and such is pebble there are a few
different colors and options to choose
from there's the pebble steel and a
regular pebble and the price difference
is about a hundred dollars so it just
depends on your preference in style and
budget you'll be able to view
notifications see who's calling control
your music and in both this year's model
and last year's model will last about a
week without charging now Android wear
on the other hand only works for Android
devices running Android 4.3 or higher
and you'll be able to receive
notifications just like the pebble
though integration with android devices
is tighter and more powerful using place
or apps and Google now you have a color
display on any Android wear device
compared to the e ink on a pebble though
battery life isn't as good as the pebble
while the price difference is also
pretty big the regular pebble starts at
just a hundred dollars while the
cheapest Android wear device starts at
one hundred ninety nine dollars for the
Samsung here at live however the Moto
360 starts at 249 while the pebble steel
starts at one hundred ninety nine
dollars which is just fifty dollars
cheaper it just depends if you want a
watch that you can control with your
voice or one that has a battery that our
last for a few days moving on to camera
there are a lot of awesome pointed shoes
out there on the market but i finded the
gopro hero the latest one that retails
for 129 dollars is an awesome buy for
those who are looking to get a starter
camera and a go pro series you'll be
able to shoot 1080p at 30 frames per
second and 720p at 60 frames for a
second it's also waterproof up to 131
feet so you don't have to worry about
breaking your camera underwater and
GoPros are usually used for video and
not photo but you'll still be able to
take 5 megapixel shots with the GoPro
which isn't too bad and you'll get an
ultra wide field of view compared to
other cameras in its price range now for
photos i think the sony rx100 mark 2 or
mark through you are great choices both
cameras will be able to provide you with
DSLR like quality videos and photos and
will sport medium the telephoto lenses
with great optics from Zeiss the rx100
mark 2 or mark 3 will retail for about
six hundred fifty dollars to eight
hundred dollars respectively and if
that's out of your price range check out
the samsung nx300 if you choose an aps-c
crop sensor an interchangeable lens
system Wi-Fi and a touch screen display
the nx300 as of now is only going for
four hundred dollars within 18 to 50 50
is
lens and it's probably one of the best
portable DSLR cameras you can get right

again that's el y and the a.com slash
TechnoBuffalo now if you still can't
think of anything to buy think about
checking out a subscription for services
like Spotify and Netflix Hulu or Amazon
Prime these four we believe are the ones
that are worth it I personally use
spotify premium in amazon prime and
they've been great for me i listen to a
lot of music especially if i'm driving
or when I'm editing and I use amazon
prime so i can give two days shipping
for free for an item that's eligible for
prime shipping you also have amazon
instant video and music which don't
really use all that often but the
options are there if you want netflix
and hulu are awesome services as well
and if you're more into watching movies
rather than the latest TV shows go with
netflix but if you're more into watching
TV shows and want to see the latest
episodes right away go at hulu spotify
is going for around ten dollars a month
for a premium service and netflix and
hulu are going for eight dollars a month
amazon prime on the other hand is going
for a hundred dollars per year last but
not least let's not forget about the
cases of course not everyone's going to
be using an iphone or a note for or a
nexus 6 but companies like spigen
provides a variety of cases for a
variety of devices not just the ones I
mentioned now these cases in screen
protectors range from fifteen dollars to
sixty dollars and you can also check out
case-mate they offer a bunch of iphone
cases and some other Android devices and
so does incipio that relatively well
made cases and offer some of the best
protection on the market now cases
typically aren't very expensive so price
shouldn't be much of an issue especially
if you're on a budget now of course
