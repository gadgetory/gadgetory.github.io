you by full sail university welcome back
to the episode of rettinger shreds to
show rant and rave on something that has
to do with technology so this week I am
continuing my top 10 smartphones of all
time last week we did 10 through 6 this
week we are going for the gold with 5
through number one these are all phones
that meant something to me that either
affected me kind of personally or my
career just have a very warm spot in my
heart so if you didn't see last week's
episode you should watch it let's go
ahead and start with number five this is
the motorola razr which came out in 2004
i always remember i was living in Los
Angeles I waited in line for this phone
I wait to the AT&amp;amp;T store can open this
one had been rumored to be coming out
for a while and finally came I saved my
money for so long to get this phone I
could not believe that a phone could be
that thin even the keypad looked like he
was an etch screen it was just
absolutely incredible everything about
the device was awesome and it screamed
cutting edge and that was one of the
bones that again started my love affair
with technology it was just incredible
early was on the flight but Motorola's
designs in my opinion one of the best
looking phones of all time number for
the nexus one the phone that ushered in
the neck sign pure Android experience
released on January fifth 2010 if you
remember this guy had a 3.7 inch
agreement at 480 x 800 resolution
shipped with android 2.1 eclair which
goes back quite a while I loved this
phone I loved HTC's design grabbed a
little scroll ball right in there I
still have one in the office this is an
incredible phone actually represented
the developers device for google the one
that all developers could code for the
reference phone and it kick-started the
whole nexus revolution and secured spot
at number four so this next choice might
be a little odd to you you might not
even know what this is but number three
is the sidekick color really any phone
the sidekick line I loved the sidekick I
remember I just graduated college in
2003 I'd come home and the sidekick was
everywhere I had a cell phone already
but I just wanted that service I want to
be able to I am
it had a browser built in it really had
apps before apps are available on a
phone the keyboard is absolutely
incredible remember I just wanted to
have a I am taeyeon my friends I waited
I God had a separate data plan and I
have to used the heck out of this thing
it had a cool swivel screen it was built
by danger which don't like her that
anymore is used on tmobile service
really with t-mobile's flagship device
the sidekick line is kind of since been
killed they tried to revive it with
Android this phone was incredible it did
everything and phones they really do
that stuff back then so that definitely
got the number three spot in my list
number to a sick with tmobile the
t-mobile g1 also known as the HTC dream
released in 2008 this was the first
android phone to ever hit the market had
at 3.2 inch touchscreen remember this
guy launched no multi-touch was enabled
on it you could download eventually a
second browser that you could sort of do
multi touch with I didn't even have an
on-screen keyboard service screen
swiveled out and you could use the very
first version of Android and in fact
hackers were able to get this phone to
run almost the most current version of
andhra i believe they got it all the way
up to the last version of jelly bean
those was an incredible device it might
not have been the best phone at the time
the keyboard was average the specs were
ok but what the phone represented it was
absolutely incredible this represented
google's foray into phones and really
started the whole android revolution it
really pushed all phones forward and now
let's count down to number one can I get
a drumroll please this is the original
iphone at least in 2007 now before
everybody gets caught up in iphone vs
Andhra 2007 Android wasn't even a thing
this was the very first real smartphone
out there that revolutionized the whole
world blackberry dominate at the time
this phone brought multi-touch to the
masses abroad on-screen keyboard to the
masses they didn't have to use a stylist
to tap on thinking of that it brought
capacitive screens to the masses and
most importantly to me the original
iphone kind of launched my career when
it came to mobile phone reviewing I
remember I went to my local apple store
he was 10 p.m. that night I picked up a
phone I couldn't put they still had him
in stock able to try it and use it and
it really was the first of all and I
reviewed that I did update Don as I used
it on it really against or helping me
tone and get better at doing reviews to
watch his original iphone reduced they
were not very
good Google and Apple it's really pushed
each other forward I think that was a
phone that really brought this whole
modern era of the smartphone so the
iphone definitely gets the number one
spot in my book do you agree or disagree
