enger' here and I want to give you a
head-to-head comparison arguably the two
hottest smartphones on the market right
now the iPhone 3GS for AT&amp;amp;T and the Palm
Pre for Sprint
about two weeks ago I did a head-to-head
comparison of the iPhone 3G with the
Palm Pre but that would be so fair since
the 3G was running about a year old
hardware so the 3GS is about just about
a day and the three and the palm has
been out for a little over two weeks
this is a more apples to apples
comparison the screens have been dimmed
on each of these have to show up a
little bit better on the camera so to
unlock an iPhone slide to unlock and
unlock of Palm Pre you slide that up so
I rely very heavily on calendaring I
forget appointments left and right so
for me a calendar on a smartphone is of
utmost importance so let's launch two
calendar apps on each of these and see
how quickly they load try them both the
same time and the iPhone 3G clearly
launched that much much faster
what close both of those and for those
of you that may follow me on Twitter you
know I do a lot of tweeting so let me
launch to third-party Twitter apps on
both phones can see how completely loads
it's certainly not the same application
so this might not be the most fair
comparison but it does show you the
speed of to native applications that do
the same thing so we're going to load
Twitter rhetoric on the iPhone and we're
gonna load tweet on the Palm Pre today
the hardest thing is pen hit these
button at the same time okay so Twitter
ethic is already loaded tweet is still
loading up and there it is loaded up so
you can see that the 3GS was noticeably
quicker and yesterday I did a comparison
of the 3GS versus the 3G you can see the
S really does stand for speed let's go
ahead and close both of these
applications and to close an application
on the palm you push the home button and
you throw it off the screen so the next
thing that
I want to show you guys is screen
rotation that's a very important thing
both feature accelerometers so as you're
using it and you are looking at a
webpage or whatever you turn the device
you want to be able to rotate relatively
quickly so let me go ahead and show you
that on a webpage and then we're going
to do a full browser comparison on each
of the devices so I'm going to load up
my YouTube page on each of these I will
do a full browser comparison in just a
moment so there it is on the Palm Pre
and there it is on the iPhone 3GS so
let's see how quickly both of these
rotate I'm gonna zoom out just a bit all
right and we're off and the Palm Pre was
faster let's try it the other way make
sure that was accurate nope the pre was
faster again try it one more time and
still the priests pastors when it comes
to screen rotation the Palm Pre actually
is a little bit quicker so since we've
got the browser open on each of these
let's do a browser speed test and we're
going to compare 3G and Wi-Fi 3G speeds
are gonna vary depending on where you
are but Wi-Fi is going to be a constant
so right now these are both running on
the same Wi-Fi network so we're going to
refresh both of these pages on my
youtube channel and see how quickly they
load over Wi-Fi they will do
head-to-head over three weeks let's hit
the refresh button on each of these
let's see how quickly they load and then
we'll try and tie the new web page as
well one that wasn't already loaded onto
the device so go ahead and hit on each
trying to at the same time there we go
and they're both off looks to be
relatively close the 3GS is done almost
the exact same time that the Palm Pre
was done let's go ahead and launch a new
webpage that's not stored in the memory
on either these I've cleared it and
let's see how this works so I've got
pocketnow.com
ready to load on Wi-Fi on both of these
devices so let's see how quickly each of
them do it okay they're both off both
are almost done so the 3GS finished just
barely before the Palm Pre so now let's
go to 3G signal strength and I've got
five bars of signal strength on the 3GS
and I've got five bars of signal
strength on the pre so may go ahead and
turn Wi-Fi off we'll come back and
continue the testing so Wi-Fi has been
turned off and I'm guiding gadget comm
queued up and ready to go
let's see how quickly both of these can
do it okay they've been hit at the same
time and they really seem to be very
very very closely matched in speed less
far but they're really no clear-cut
winner and the 3GS is already done and
the pre is still loading this is one of
the first tests we've actually seen one
of the devices finished that much
quicker and now we're finally done so in
this case on a website that's fairly
graphic intensive and has a lot of text
the 3GS was noticeably faster so one of
the things that I tested in my 3G versus
3GS video text message came through was
the ability to scroll without having the
page need to refresh and load and for
those you that are using a 3G or an
older iPhone you'll know that as you
scroll down kind of get those blue and
gray checkered bars let's see if that
happens on either of these so there it
is on the pre and nothing on the iPhone
3GS so the 3GS can handle the faster
scrolling clearly right there the pre
cannot so something definitely something
to keep in mind the 3GS definitely has a
little bit of a faster processor than
the
pree does so as you guys can probably
guess I love YouTube and I like to watch
youtube videos on my phone and both of
these devices come with built-in YouTube
viewers so let me show you what each of
them look like so there's YouTube on the
iPhone and let's launch it on the pre as
well and we'll do a speed test to see
how quickly each of them launch although
they are different applications try it
one more time okay so both are launching
their YouTube applications and you're
very limited with options on what you
can do with the Palm Pre on the iPhone
you can view most viewed featured you
can do it by today this week or all on
the pre we're very limited to just
popular most viewed in history I don't
have the option by viewing it by day or
week it really doesn't tell you how its
grouped and if you view popular by day
on each the videos don't match up so I'm
not sure what sort of algorithm the pre
is using let me show you what videos
look like on both you can see they don't
match up here so let's try video quality
on YouTube and this is just over 3G
we're not over Wi-Fi so this is what I
would look if you were out on the road
and not at home
and I'll turn the volume all the way up
Wow that was annoying
um but speaker is very loud and the
quality is actually very strong over 3G
so let's try the same thing using the
Palm Pre to get a very different load I
will turn volume all the way up okay
that was enough of that I do have to say
I've been very impressed the speaker on
the Palm Pre it crushed the 3G speaker
but the 3GS speaker is just on par so
speaker wise both of these are very very
very loud you're going to get really
good volume and I think pretty decent
audio fidelity out of each so the big
difference about each of these phones
and the things that really I should
mention is that the Palm Pre lets you
multitask meaning I can open the phone
application and I can go and open my
Twitter application and while I'm doing
that I can go and open let's say YouTube
I have the ability to multitask and I
can manage my applications using what
Palms calling their card system so I can
scroll through different applications to
find what I want to launch just tap it
if I want to close one I just wipe it
off the screen and multitasking really
is fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed
using it on the Prix and there's a lot
of times when I thought that I wouldn't
use the ability to multitask I didn't
think it was necessary
but the more I had to pray the more I
realized that I was using it much more
often than I expected so the other big
difference with the Prix and the iPhone
is of course the slide-out QWERTY
keyboard
the Palm Pre does not feature a
on-screen keyboard like the iPhone 3G
does so you're relying entirely on those
keys which definitely take some getting
used to they are a little bit small and
relatively flush but you will get used
to it the only problem with the keyboard
on the pre is that there is no
autocorrect I would expect palm to
update that in the near future
but you are gonna make a ton of mistakes
the keyboard on the 3GS now goes in
landscape and auto correct so I'm
actually much more accurate now on the
3GS keyboard named on the physical
keyboard of the pre so the iPhone 3GS
now has the ability to record video
using the three megapixel sensor the
camera on the back of the pre right now
does not record a video they'll be
something to keep in mind the 3GS also
gives you a compass the video editing
ability and a few other features but for
the most part smartphone for smartphone
you are getting a lot of the same
benefits although you are getting
different networks I will say at least
in my case I've been very happy with
spreads network the signal strength has
been strong the voice quality has been
great and I really liked using Sprint's
built-in navigation service for it
navigation right now the iPhone 3GS does
not have turn-by-turn navigation
although it was promised to be coming
relatively soon from TomTom so the
question is to which one you should get
really is going to be up to you you can
see that speed here really wasn't that
big an issue between both devices they
are both very very fast if you like the
iPhone 4 let's say it's elegance on
screen keyboard or huge huge huge app
store organ already on AT&amp;amp;T the iPhone
3GS is absolutely fantastic the Palm Pre
if you're don't get brown if you don't
get good AT&amp;amp;T service where you are or I
know a lot of you just don't like Apple
the Palm Pre is a fantastic platform and
it really is in its infancy seeing as
this is it's only its first three beasts
so I can recommend actually both devices
I can't really give you a clear-cut
winner unfortunately I will say they are
both powerful feature-rich phones I
don't think you can go wrong with either
one so guys for exclusive
denne sure to follow me on twitter
twitter.com slash john for lakers you
can ask me all the questions you want
about the Palm Pre or iphone 3gs I'll
put a link in the sidebar and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
