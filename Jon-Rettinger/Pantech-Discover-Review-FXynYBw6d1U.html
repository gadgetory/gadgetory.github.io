technobuffalo here at the 40 of you for
you of the pantech discover this is a
really nicely SPECT mid-range phone and
offers a lot of bang for the phone
buying buck let's go ahead put it
through its paces see if it's worth your
hard-earned money alright so here is the
pantech discover we're gonna break this
review down into a few different parts
we're gonna talk about call quality
hardware build quality display
performance software battery life and
then give this sucker a full review
doesn't really matter what's powering
this phone if it's not going to make
good phone calls it's not gonna be that
much he used to you call quality is with
most modern smartphones now was actually
pretty good my 20 call test I didn't
have any dropped calls I had no white
noise and a call on the other ends had a
hard time telling i was on a cell phone
that does have some cool 3d ask
speakerphone ability it's one actually
one of the best speaker phones that i've
tried so don't worry about getting the
pantech discover for call quality it's
going to work great signal strength when
it came to LTE and HSPA+ is on par with
almost every other AT&amp;amp;T phone i've
tested something notable either great or
negative one way to report there alright
so let's run through the hardware this
guy it's packing some pretty premium
esque specs so first it's got a four
point eight inch LCD screen at the
resolution of 1280 by 720 that's going
to give it 306 ppi it's running android
4.4 they've been powered by 1.5
gigahertz dual-core chip gig of ram 16
gigs of internal storage expandable via
microsd it's got a pretty beefy 12.6
megapixel camera on the back we'll talk
a little bit about camera as we get
there 2 megapixel shooter on the front
Wi-Fi is the dow pretty standard 802 11
b g and n 20 100 million of our battery
it's got NFC on it as well it's going to
weigh at 4.7 six ounces and overall it's
a pretty nice package a little bit of a
different design here on the side I was
designed that I wasn't fond of on first
blush it's got these two giant chunky
corners here on the top of left and top
right but actually fattens be really
useful to pull the phone out of my
pocket if I put the phone in face-up is
really
easy to grab these and pull it right out
several people notice the sort of had a
nexus feel to it pantech has really
nailed the build quality here it's a
fantastic feeling phone with a bit of an
odd design so it's flat in the middle
then a hump on the top and a hump on the
bottom and then curved edges on the side
display is also curved on both sides of
one we'll talk about that in the next
category they really done an incredible
job to build claw here if you were
worried about picking up a pantech
because you've used maybe one of their
lower end models I don't let build
quality a reason to deter you this phone
feels excellent the volume rocker up and
down have a really nice push through it
nothing on a comment on very often but
these felt great the power and lock
buttons really well pronounced
everything about the phone I actually a
screen pretty premium build quality so
hats off to pantech for that the other
major important thing about a phone
though is the display and this is where
the phone starts to fall a bit short so
I mentioned we got a resolution here of
1280 by 720 perfectly suitable screen
and pretty commonplace what we see on
most mid to high-end phones but we soon
take this phone outside or you hold it
at a slight angle the viewing angle
makes this thing almost impossible to
view even at a slight off angle if
you're viewing a website for example I
could have a really hard time seeing
anything images were relatively washed
out here as well and video just looked
kind of blob tested a lot of phones over
the years and this one was really
unremarkable in almost every ways from a
display stand point this isn't
definitely not one of the better phones
all rights go from displayed to
performance this guy's being powered by
a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor it's
a Snapdragon ID and sometimes it feels
pretty snappy sometimes it doesn't for
those you quadrant nuts out there to get
a pretty solid quadrant score 5551 but
sometimes launching web applications or
really any applications there was a huge
lag so for example right now I'll close
everything that I had opened up here one
out of every five or six times when I go
ahead and try and open the web and I tap
touch the browser between the time that
the keyboard showed up sometimes was
very quick like you just saw in
sometimes towards a maybe a five to six
second delay now injury representative
of throughout the phone sometimes things
were very fast and they were
they worked really well but it wasn't
consistent throughout the entire
experience of the phone that I might be
due to some third party after I tried
not being coated the best but you're not
going to be using just first party
google apps as use the phone something
to keep in mind if you're looking for
really the fastest phone out there this
is definitely not going to be for you
but when it comes to doing stuff once
it's open you know browsing and things
are just as as you'd expect
pinch-to-zoom work just as you'd expect
everything else about it you know just
works like a regular Android phone
albeit not the fastest one out there
alright let's talk about software pentax
done quite a bit of twiki and
customizing to the android 4.0 point for
that it's built on so first let's talk
about this launcher down here the first
thing i do when i start using a new
android phone is all pretty much
download on nova launcher it's a custom
launcher this one is very similar i love
that stock out of the box get the option
to scroll and place more shortcuts and
folders here on the bottom if you choose
if the irregular 5 here is enough for
you so i really like that pantech has
done that i like they've opted for the
soft buttons as opposed to physical
capacitive buttons at the bottom so hats
off to them as well but things get a
little bit cartoonish throughout the
phone much more cartoonish even than
Samsung's already sort of almost
childish looking touch with look at the
phone for example go ahead and see what
the dialer looks like icons are very big
bold and bright and that's certainly a
personal preference that's not my
favorite but something to bear in mind
authentic ascents with cool stuff here
well when it comes to picking widgets so
as opposed to stock ice cream sandwich
when you want to get widgets and go to
apps and go to widgets which are
narrowly be living up there that's not
where they are if you long press this is
sort of old-school Android you get a
whole bunch of options for you can pick
the pick from I love that settings is
right there and easy to grab and go
ahead and grab widgets the icons show up
right here on the bottom you can see
about as much as you can on the regular
version of Android but you get a smaller
preview if there's some cool animations
to as you scroll through I didn't mind
this very much but it's something to
sort of relearn if you use previous
versions of Android phones thus we have
to go for widgets sort of other niceties
here as well on the drop down you've got
some colors here in the quick set
go ahead and scroll that guy back up
when you're in the browser for example
as well you get a little drawer you
could pull up and go and pick up some of
your most used book works found to be
actually really useful feature overall
though I really didn't mind the tweaks
that pantech had done in fact a fan to
be one of the more useful it didn't
appear to be overly resource heavy
either which is quite nice I would have
really liked to have had android 4.1 in
here and had the awesome new google
search in google now but that is not to
be had hopefully at some point though
this phone will get that upgrade alright
so let's talk about battery life this is
a 2100 milliamp hour battery and it
wasn't half bad actually I was able to
get through easily a full day of weekend
use with about two hours a phone call
some admittedly very intensive Twitter
Instagram and Facebook use and a lot of
browsing about 15-20 minutes of video
with about forty percent of battery life
so despite not being the largest battery
in the world it really did a nice job
when it came down to how long the
battery could last and the use of the
juice that it had worked actually very
very well so battery life was definitely
thumbs up for this phone so what's the
final verdict on the pantech discover
it's not a bad phone may fetch the
imaginations at fifty dollars is a
pretty nice value we look at phones that
are maybe fifty dollars to a hundred
dollars more and starts being tough to
justify this certainly saving a couple
bucks up front is nice over the course
of a 2500 $3,000 two-year contract at
fifty bucks savings doesn't mean that
much 18 he's got a lot of great phones
in this lineup the optimus G the HTC One
x+ iphone 5 Lumia 920 HSE a 28 x name a
few all of which were thin that fifty to
a hundred dollars difference in price
becomes tough to figure out why you
would go and get this phone I give
pantech credit for trying to get out of
that sort of submarket free phone brand
and try and get to that premium standing
and they've done a relatively nice job I
would have liked the screen to be
improved and performance me a little bit
zippier another hand though I like their
tweaks that they've done the software
wise and I like to build quality and
these two little humps on the side I
really started to grow on me so this is
by no means a perfect phone but by no
means a bad phone either I'm looking to
get a budget phone with some pretty
preemie
spec's the pantech discover is going to
be great choice for you overall this
gets a 7.5 on the TechnoBuffalo scale
what do you guys think do you guys agree
disagree i'd love to hear your thoughts
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you guys next video
