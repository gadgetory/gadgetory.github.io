so happy birthday Google pixel blow out
your candle make a wish and it's time to
revisit you abusing it on and off is my
daily driver for the better part of the
month I solve some of the same issues I
had at the beginning and really it's
things that the phone doesn't have any
sort of waterproofing or wireless
charging if that's important to you then
this is not the phone for you
I so wish for the price it was included
in the pixel but I'm gonna go past those
and talk about the phone itself and
what's included so this one I mention it
in the review but the more I use a phone
the more it stood out to me the phone
does not get warm which is strange for a
phone even if you're watching me 3040
minutes of video you put the Snapdragon
820 one in there the phone does not get
warm suppose other devices I've tested
where they feel really hot their
prolonged period of time the pixel much
like Samuel Jackson retained its cool
I'm still not the biggest fan of the
design in the phone especially the chin
and the combination of aluminium and
glass on the back but I'm going to give
it a giant pass for looking a tad fugly
because that glass enables way way way
better antenna reception and this thing
gets incredible reception I popped my
own SIM card I'm using it as my daily
driver with AT&amp;amp;T and everywhere I went I
was getting LTE or as my wife who's on
an iPhone was sometimes pulling down 4G
even dropped to edge on occasion this
thing maintained a consistent LTE signal
also true with Wi-Fi in my garage for
example most phones don't get Wi-Fi the
Pixlr was pulling in loud and clear
there's almost getting full speeds on
the pixels I would get if I was right by
the router when I save pixel know what
I'm talking specifically about the pixel
XL the 5.5 inch screen still looks nice
to me my opinion on that hasn't changed
daydream is come out though since I did
the initial review and it's really nice
to have I'm still 900 percent sold on VR
but the UI that daydream offers in
combination with the pixel phone is
really nice in the month I've been
testing I've had no speed issues I've
had no slowdowns I've had no lag I've
had no issues with Android showing its
age it still behaves as quickly and
fastly fast vastly
as fast as fast as it did on day one
I've also been impressed the battery
life if 3450 milliamp hours easily gets
me through a day in fact if I pushed and
turned out a bright
I could probably get to two days my
opinion on the camera hasn't really
changed much in the twelve point three
megapixel sensor is still very good and
amongst the best of any smartphone we've
tested at this point you're kind of
nitpicking you're talking about the
camera on the pixel or the iPhone 7 plus
or any of the galaxy s7 line the phones
that haven't been recalled the cameras
are all outstanding if you need to rely
on a phone as your main camera the
pixels still gonna be impressive in fact
abusing the pixel to take pictures of my
kids my family when I travel that's all
I have that's my smartphone usage and
the pictures have always come out
awesome
in fact I've even gotten a few printed
in larger sizes and they still look
really good again if you want more
information anything I talked about I
want to know what I think about the
button placement or how they feel or the
call quality and definitely check out
the full review we did it's more of an
update to that I really like the phone
in fact I think I like it more now and
even get on my initial review still it's
not a cheap phone I don't think it looks
very good but though this objective and
price depends on you know how much money
you got in the bank and you know what
you can afford and if you can't afford a
phone and if you happen to like the way
that pixel looks or at least you can
tolerate the way that pixel looks pick
one up although I do recommend picking
up and black ink that looks the best it
octa me disappointed in fact the pixel
is still gonna have a place in my pocket
for at least the next month and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
