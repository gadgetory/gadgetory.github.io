general I'm pretty excited guy but some
I get beyond jazz 4 and you game
consoles are those they happen like
twice a decade we've got the latest from
Nintendo this is a switch it's a
combination of everything they've
learned from the original NES all the
way on down past the Wii U which I guess
you could kind of call the original
switch so what we have right here this
$300 portable hybrid console which I am
unhealthily excited to play which is
mostly at this point my Sablan just like
a $300 Zelda machine which we've got
because I've really jazzed to play that
and also I know you see it in the frame
I have the strategy guide for Zelda here
you can judge me but it's open-world now
so okay enough of that
here is the Nintendo switch box so two
different versions you can get one with
neon joy con and joy con is when Tendo
is calling the little controller things
on the end of the console that come on
and off open it up and looks kind of
similar like a tablet unboxing which I
guess it is here is the switch itself
and tend to switch on the back it's a
6.2 inch LCD display
it's 1280 by 720 so it's a 720 screen
but when you throw it in a doc you can
get your gameplay up to 1080p your games
are gonna be stored on 32 gigs of
internal storage in here but also you
can pop it on micro SD card and be good
to go ah it's surprising how light and
thin this thing is for what it does
that's being powered by a modified
version of NVIDIA Tegra x1 battery life
is like all over the board Nintendo
claims from their own site two and a
half hours to 6 hours so it's a big
shrug emoji for how long this is gonna
last but you want to charge it you can
do it via USB type-c so no more weird
proprietary connectors from Nintendo
let's keep digging in
we've got Greyjoy con number one and
these are teeny tiny little controllers
and first impression they feel really
good there's nice responsiveness buttons
have nice click eNOS but man they are
tiny everything feels pretty good so the
idea behind these controllers I'm sure
you guys know at this point
mostly this is my first time really ever
kind of holding a switch is you can play
them like this think of them as like
evolved tiny
remotes they've got buttons on top
there's also gonna be a dock inside you
can connect them too but you can throw
them right on the side of the console
itself which I will do here very
satisfying
clicky noise which is important to have
your clicking always to be satisfying
and you can serve a game like you could
on a any sort of tablet or or iPad or
Android tablet with controllers on the
side you can take this with you it also
the kickstand so you can prop it up and
use some gaming if you want to pull off
the Droid condom use it as a screen you
can do that we got more in the box
wrist this up to leave you care about
maybe don't we'll sort of haul through
this we can get the important stuff this
is the dock and you should be able to
tell it does cuz it's called the dock
tend to switch goes inside of here
screamer's on the outside and it drop it
in and it pushes in pretty easily and
then this could connect to your TV and
use like a traditional game console also
inside we've got it's like a holster and
you can connect the joique on to this
thing and do some gaming normally but be
aware this is not going to charge your
joique on if you want to charge these
you can this is a theme of the switch
didn't those happy to tell you an
accessory that looks like this that will
charge a joy con otherwise these are
only gonna charge and they're connected
to the dock and the polar droidcon out
push it but on the back slides out do
that here as well you can also obviously
buy more joy con I've got the neon
options you can buy as well let's see
how this feels when you go in here
that's gonna give you more of a
traditional game experience it feels
Michael normal controller stuff like
you'd get with an Xbox or a Playstation
a little bit on organ ama if I
definitely see this working and again if
you want to use this the switch ought to
stand you know it's been stand out you
could be good to go
dan comes out like that and then you can
just get get your gaming on other things
in the box quickly we got this thing
these are little straps for your joy
comm we got that thing it's another
strap okay Jim my cables and USB type-c
mostly I just want to get to playing
Zelda which is a hole for me the whole
point of this thing right now the the
console itself kind of looks
unremarkable I would take away this it
is really thin and really light and it's
kind of cool at the games now on game
cards kind of like cartridges from from
years past but again if you want expand
the storage if you don't want to buy the
cards you can just buy a a SD card and
also kind of cool to bear in mind if you
buy a game car like I've got here for
Zelda it's not gonna like install on
your console you actually play off the
card so like if you buy a game for an
Xbox or ps4 s you have to install and
take up storage not so here with the
Nintendo switch so you guys for watching
I know you guys every choice of intend
to switch unboxings thank you for flying
Southwest and for watching TechnoBuffalo
unboxing and tennis which I am just jazz
this as a fan of Nintendo and a fan of
gaming I'm really excited for from my
ricard I were sent him in a launch title
but I think Zelda will tide me over for
a while I'm gonna get let me get playing
thank you guys for watching hope you
enjoyed these video thumbs up if you are
a fan of Nintendo til next time
I'm John Ranger
