from technobuffalo here any new apple
products usually littered with rumors
and I'm back now with the phone I
guessed I was formerly known as the
iphone 6 e the iphone 7 c is now back
with a new name being backed up by
allegedly three sources may introduce
you to the iphone 5 e the folks at CN
beta mac odhikar and my drivers are
off-putting independent sources most of
us working at Foxconn the folks en beta
have a pretty nice track record actually
the Alpha rumors they were the first one
to show us with the iphone 6 xbox we're
going to look like but they are not 100%
they incorrectly predicted the a8
processor is going to clock over two
gigahertz so they're good but nobody is
ever perfect let me tell you about the
iphone 5 e the e meaning enhanced first
same color scheme as the iphone 6s you
love all the colors you want to want to
get your rose gold off you have the
option to do that it's going to look
like a much thinner version the iphone
5s cozily more along lines with the six
generation ipod touch look like on the
spec standpoint same 4-inch screen found
in the iPhone 5s we will allegedly have
NFC added for Apple pay support the same
a megapixel camera on the back the same
one foot to medical center on the front
where we get some divergent reports on
the processor most are saying 88 with 1
gig ram although one report is saying a
9 with two although with an alleged
price point of 500 bucks I put my money
on the a eight and one gig other nice
additions those who have support for vol
T calls or volte for them high def call
that you haven't heard those yet it
sound pretty cool 16 gigs are sticking
around that will be the starting storage
but also be a 64 gig option so overall
we're looking at just a little I guess
better version of the five ask for
what's not a low price point five
hundred bucks is still a really huge
amount of money to pay for a phone that
is far from flagship specs but if this
interests you suppose we build a pick
one up in the februari March timeframe
so not much longer to wait and because i
believe in balance of the force what
Apple would be complete without a
samsung rumor on its opposite side and
let's talk a bit about the s7 supposedly
and into to benchmark was released on
the Chinese side Weibo that was spotted
by French blogger Steve hemmer stop
for hopefully I pronounce that name
correctly why don't know what the antutu
score was we do have a better sense with
the specs are going to look like
following up on the design leak we saw
last week so now we'll know what it
looks like and what's powering it it's
going to keep this guy humming is going
to be the Snapdragon 820 at least for
the u.s. supposedly for international
audiences will see Samsung's own Exynos
88-90 powering this guy the device in
question is supposedly the US bound
variant because packing the Snapdragon
820 you have a 5.1 inch qhd screen four
gigs of RAM 12 megapixel rear camera 5
megapixel front and of course running
Android marshmallow with Samsung's
TouchWiz on top is hopefully thinned out
now we've got a pretty good picture
about what the s7 is going to be we know
it's going to look like we know the
specs and now to top all that off we
also know what Apple is going to be
doing so I guess we're just waiting on
LG to drop some g5 rumors we can sort of
round out the flagships for the year
already what like 10 days into January
every guys what do you think when you
excited about not excited about do you
want the 5e do you just want to drop
kick it to the curb as seven catch your
fancy love to hear what you guys think
about it mash that thumbs up but we
always appreciate it until next time
