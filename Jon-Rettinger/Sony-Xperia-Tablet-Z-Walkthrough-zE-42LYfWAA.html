technobuffalo I'm here in Spain at
Mobile World Congress and this is sony's
brand new tab would see it is super thin
and I am super impressed by it moving
around there's not much on the bottom
looks like micro USB charging possibly
there's the big screen hold on I have
the specs all right there's a huge
screen and the specs include a 10.1 inch
Reality Display with Sony's Mobile
BRAVIA Engine 2 it's 1920 x 1200
resolution so everything's really really
sharp in text and videos and everything
so at 8.1 megapixel on the back with
exmor r technology so that's pretty cool
no flash though but support for HDR
you've got a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera there for video chat it's running
on a quad core processor and it has two
gigs of ram and it'll ship with either
16 or 32 gigabytes of storage but it
does have a you SD card slot for
expandable and of course NFC plays a
major role here so here is an NFC logo
and it can be synced with this speaker
here which also has the NFC logo so if
you're watching a movie or have audio
playing you can quickly jump back and
forth whoop and now we've set off the
alarm
okay that's okay and now my friend here
Annette is going to help us go through
some of the features right oh yeah we
are okay so as I started just describe
the design is very very thin and this
tablet also have and water resistance
and the dust resistance as you can
actually dip it in the water so we can
spill on it yeah you can take a shower
on these as well then we have all the
Sony application as the Walkman and here
as Todd described before you can hear
the music and just transfer it by having
this one touch and now it's disconnected
I'm sorry so we were gonna head it was
already connected that's really cool up
you can hear the music through the
through the speaker instead and you also
have the movie application
where you can see really how bright yeah
let's see this HD screen in action here
nice I was out flying oh yeah you're
gorgeous cool yeah and also one thing if
you have a tablet you probably would
like it to last us as well and then you
can go into them settings a power
management and there you have the
stamina mode which is also a new feature
that we have this actually the stage
disables the data traffic when the
tablet is asleep so you activate it by
pressing this you have an estimated time
wow yeah we're is this will change
depending on how you use your tablet yes
and you can also go into this and add
applications that you would like if you
would like to have your email stores
yeah exactly then you just customize it
the way that you would like to have it
then you have a list here do you know a
pricing or a release date for the show
it released it is not really set yet it
will be late to the screen okay pricing
is also dependent on the market do you
think we'll see it on US carriers and
could be okay all right thank you very
much Annette and this is Todd hazleton
