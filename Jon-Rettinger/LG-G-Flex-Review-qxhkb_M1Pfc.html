TechnoBuffalo here it's a full review
for you of this guy the bendy LG G flex
all dolled up for 18 TI put it through
its paces let's find out if it's worth
your smartphone buying buck so we begin
this review as I do all of our phone
reviews with a disclaimer I use this
device for 6 days as my daily phone on
AT&amp;amp;T in Southern California Todd who did
the written portion of the review also
used it for 6 days if you want to see
more detail and camera samples hit the
link down below to go to the full
written review so let me jump in and
give you a quick refresh on all the
specs in case you forgot what this crazy
bendy phone is rocking so first is a six
inch flexible screen at 7:20 so that
means it's 1280 by 720 and if you can do
a quick math they 245 PPI powering it is
it pretty beastly 2.2 60 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip it's a
tried and true we've seen a lot of
device that's fast and works well two
gigs of ram 13 megapixel camera on the
back and a 3 megapixel sensor on the
front 32 gigs of storage but you're only
gonna get 24 0.12 usable space
let me jump right into the big story
here at the G flex and that's the screen
I'm not gonna go too far into topic of
bendable screens but I do want to get
one thing clear and out of the way
there's a huge difference between curved
glass it sits over a flat display like
we saw on the Galaxy Nexus and the
curved display that's employed on the G
flex the former screen is still flat
while the deflects itself is actually
bent into the curve as you can see on
the device so LG says the material used
is a plastic substrate it's more
resistant to cracks and damages than
glass obviously though it's also more
flexible than glass that we've seen
another smartphone before it also the
angle of the screen is supposed to be
more inviting when viewing media
specialist photos or videos and regular
flat displays aren't as all-encompassing
and rounded LG also says it applied a
real RGB stripe pixel structure instead
of the pen tile layout used on other
OLED screens so let's offer more
accurate colors and alleviate distortion
while viewing photos alone all honestly
I didn't really notice a huge difference
comparing the phone side-by-side at the
Galaxy Note 3 looking at exactly the
same picture LG claims better body
contours and holding it up to your face
and some microphones it's sort of closer
to your mouth you can also put the phone
in your back pocket without fear of
breaking it I tried it and it super
freaked me out and so I've actually
broken phones that way but it did work
it wasn't all that comfortable but for
you it might be so no you can put this
in your back pocket LG says it's totally
fine with all that bendy flex action
you're still looking at a 720p screen on
a huge sickness play so low resolutions
generally means that I cons and texts
aren't as crisp as they are on 1080p
screens also the plastic substrate that
LG used has some weird artifacts if you
have to display on the low brightness
even on high sometimes you can still see
particles it almost look like hairs on
the page of a paper even I tried to blow
on and wipe it off they were not hairs
found it actually detract it from the
overall sharpness pretty significantly
one caveat here though it's my job to
look at phone screen so my eyes are
getting pretty used to 1080p displays if
yours aren't yet you might not notice
that much also some apps don't adjust
the screen appropriately even though
there's a setting there that should fix
the aspect ratio for example Rayman
Jungle Run wouldn't adjust properly
landscape mode at all these aren't
deal-breakers benefits the imagination
but keep in mind that our situations
where the screen just doesn't work as
well as a flat one so the mortal here
the screen is more than a gimmick it
worked in some situations and doesn't
if you watch a ton of video you're
probably going to love it if you read a
lot of text though you might want to try
it and store first before you pick it up
next let's jump into hardware LG seems
super committed to the rear button
things there's not really much else add
here aside from it really helps with
taking selfies I'm not really a huge fan
of the layout on the back my finger just
didn't naturally find the lock button
although I do like that iluminates if
you don't get notifications on it you
can tell it you've got something
fortunately though
LG's got a killer knock-on feature lets
you DoubleTap the screen turn it on or
off so my home button concerns didn't
really matter that much
on the software side LG's pretty UI
heavy so things like their qslide app
that you are gonna get third-party
support their own voice command system
which doesn't even hold a candle to
Google search they got a video it on
their picture editor there's a lot of
software built it and they aren't all
bad at all I got used to it pretty
quickly as the poor first stock Android
LG has done a relatively nice job here
so it's a crazy fast phone you won't
notice any stutter slowdown or anything
like that doing pinch-to-zoom doing
scrolling it's going to work really
quickly it's got a Snapdragon 800 after
all so it's going to be fast answer to
lag you might have seen on your last
phone you are not going to see here at
all because I know you guys want to know
we did run it through a quadrants core
which isn't the most scientific test but
you use as a benchmark for all Android
phones and I've got a score of 23
thousand seven hundred ninety four so
pretty solid
so next let's jump into camera at first
I was really excited to use the G flex
camera because I think LG did a pretty
awesome job on that front with the g2
then we learned that the G flex has a 13
megapixel shooter it does not have the
optical image stabilization found on the
GT 2 and other phones like the Lumia
1020 which sucked we had some mixed
results that erected when you checked
out the full written review down below
to get a full camera shots and see
Todd's impressions on the camera of note
though the camera defaults to a wide 10
megapixel shot right out of the box so
you need to switch it to the 13
megapixel 4160 by 31 24 by three aspect
ratio take full resolution shots it's
also the case with most right screen
phones so I just want to make sure
everybody sort of knew that also the
video camera defaults 1920 by 1080
although you can use it to shoot you HD
in 3840 by 2160 so pretty beastly of
course though it's only 720 so you can't
take the benefit of all that on the
phone itself but as we move forward you
HD screens become you know the thing I
do have a nice feature proof camera
already at your pocket the point here
though the camera is pretty average but
not on par with the g2 don't trade in
your DSLR for the G flex but if you want
to take photos you know if your kids or
have a plan it's gonna work but it's not
going to be the best camera out there
so I'll admit I was a bit concerned
about battery life after all the phone
is curved and does have a curved battery
buddy
turned out it was really really
impressive it's a beastly 3500 milliamp
hour battery I was able to get through a
full day with easily thirty five to
forty five percent so my full day
usually goes like this take it off the
charger around 7:00 in the morning I'll
put it back on the charger around 10 11
o'clock at night usually it's on Wi-Fi
either at home or at the office pulling
down to email accounts all the time
about an hour and a half to two hours of
phone calls on it some pretty aggressive
YouTube viewing I'm always checking
social media Twitter and Facebook and
such I don't do default screen
brightnesses I don't let auto it Jesse
should I keep it to about 80% I like a
bright screen so that's sort of my usage
so it's easily able to get through a
full day if I tweet brightness I could
easily get through two days so LG really
nailed it on the battery side here
so what's the final verdict on this
crazy bendy phone it's pretty impressive
doesn't do everything great things like
the camera on a low resolution screen
I definitely tracked it overall it's
really a nice package it gets a very
solid 8 on our TechnoBuffalo 1 to 10
scale if you read a lot of text though
you're gonna want to try it in store
because you might get some distortion
with the curve if you watch a lot of
video though you might be super happy
it's a smaller version of those curved
TVs that are all deranged at CES I like
the phone the phone is kind of neat it's
got the screen you can sort of bend a
little bit it's got a self-healing back
which if you scratch a little bit and
you go ahead and rub your finger over it
gets a little bit of heat it essentially
will heal itself it works pretty well I
would have liked if I'd expandable
storage but not a big deal at all if
it's at 32 gigs onboard LG did a very
nice job with this phone the next
iteration improves the camera and gives
it 1080p screen looking at a real winner
here but for right now you can sign your
name for a two-year contract I feel
pretty confident with the LG G flex it's
going to serve you well thank you guys
