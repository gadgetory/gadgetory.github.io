Buffalo show I'm I've your to host heard
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazelton hey everybody I
didn't have my mic perfectly adjusted so
excuse the squeaking hey how are you
doing this week Todd I'm good good whoa
okay that was interesting just as we
started I see a message that Roku has
just announced a new $25 streaming
device it's at the SE I don't know I'm
opening it up yeah the Roku SE Black
Friday discount yeah $25 wow that's a
bargain anyway well that was unplanned
ah there's more and more not brought to
you by Roku it's really not just well
you know Roku reached out to me the
other day why let's talk about the
blackberry prib so yeah that that's
gonna be where we're going to start this
week is talking a little bit about the
blackberry prib now as always let me put
the disclaimer in that this is not our
official review that is coming within
the coming days yeah but Todd you've
gotten to spend some time with the
blackberry prib is it to save your
blackberry needs that's the thing I I
don't think we can go that far because i
don't think anyone phones gonna save any
company i think it's going to take a lot
more than that but it's a really great
phone so far I'm I've run into some
issues so I'm holding it up for people
that are just listening to audio I've
run into some issues with software um
but i'm working with blackberry on that
some of the software has been early so
you might have seen those that another
reviews and some of the issues i run
into you this is an 18 teen unit i
actually bought it myself in an ATT
store some of the issues I've run into
have not been present on the review
device that has newer software which is
kind of weird because it's like well why
do I this is the one shipping to
consumers you know why doesn't it have
latest but i assume may be going through
AT&amp;amp;T but but the bugs aren't terrible
what I've run into are some stalls here
and there I can even show everybody want
on a calendar when I go to switch
default calendar crashes every time so
it's it so you know I can replicate
every single the screens washed out
unfortunately so it crashes every single
time and I'm going to talk to
BlackBerry's support today actually try
to get to the bottom of that keyboards
really nice androids great on it yeah I
don't want to spoil the review but it's
I don't think you'll be upset if you buy
now if you could hold it up again for a
sec can you slide out the keyboard I
really haven't seen anyone actually do
have you brightness to you but um you're
just pops up like that real nice
engineer face and how is the keyboard
keyboards great I've actually gotten
used to typing on it already which is
weird cuz I haven't really gotten used
to that a long time you know aside from
when we do our blackberry reviews so
it's different I chat a lot with my
friends and you know I've forced myself
to use the keyboard instead of the
digital one but the digital ones pretty
good too the on-screen keyboard touch
sensitive um what else I really like the
back it's like the soft they call it
like a glass we've it's just kind of
grippy it feels almost like rubbery so
soft touch back the speakers are pretty
good nothing crazy but that's what runs
along the whole bottom here so I'm
showing that just shown right now and an
expandable storage is also awesome if
you listen to show you know I really
like that so it has that so I put in 128
gig card in addition to 32 that comes
preloaded on it yeah a lot a lot to like
so far my only complaints are like I
said it gets a little buggy the screen
doesn't get as brightest I would prefer
to you know I'm used to these galaxy s6
chief Ward and effluents and stuff so
they get really bright and then that's
pretty much you know it without giving
away the whole thing I don't want you
talk about the cameras little slow but
might be about to well we have a
question here from jeff k
do you think the price justifies what
you are getting with the probe we can
get our hands on such awesome phones out
there for cheaper yeah I mean it that's
a heart really hard question answer it
actually has been sort of very difficult
now that we've talked about this too
with our reviews as we dive in you know
we're looking at phones that cost 500
bucks like the Nexus 6p that's a really
great phone and then you're like well
this is 700 you know seven hundred and
forty bucks after taxes that's another
two hundred forty bucks isn't worth it
well no probably not but for folks who
want a blackberry and I was talking to
John about this yesterday and he brought
this up Upton's really good point for
folks who want a blackberry and i've
wanted android on a blackberry you know
all this time and i said i can't wait
for that then this is the phone for you
you should buy it they finally done it
you know stick to your guns you've been
asking for it and yeah it's a little
expensive but I think it does a really
good job of delivering Android and the
blacker experience that people really
like in terms of the keyboard folks who
want blackberry 10 obviously probably
don't want an android phone so I think
in regards to that they didn't really
they didn't skip you know any corners
here I think they did the best job they
could and I think it shows I think I'll
end up recommending it in my review the
only issue like I was saying is that
there are some early bugs that I've seen
on my unit I assume other AT&amp;amp;T users
users are seeing some similar bugs but
hopefully those are fixed well we've got
a couple more questions here about the
perp from Britain Franco is the battery
removable it is not so the entire I
can't even try to like take it off but
the entire body you're like the back is
one unit that can't be kind of opened up
so you just work with the sim card
expandable storage on the top that's
supposed roofing off a back cover or
something like that and from cam door
does the slider seem like it will hold
up for two years yeah it does it feels
really sturdy like we used to see on the
blackberry torch and stuff I don't know
if you like
me probably did this a lot clicking it
back and forth it feels really really
sturdy the only thing is that it kind of
creeks a little bit when you're holding
it or like this i can feel you know that
it's not one solid unit and when i was
talking to john about that yesterday we
both agreed that you know it's probably
what comes with the territory of having
that slider if you have moving parts so
it's a little creaky but feels pretty
good and i think it'll go hold up cool I
look forward to finally playing with one
I have no burning desire to run out and
buy one but i'll gladly play with one
yeah yeah yeah i mean it the keyboards
not for everybody that's the thing well
then you know no it's not it's not don't
go spend seven hundred forty bucks on it
just because you'll just cuz of what it
it like there are better phones out
there if you don't care about a
blackberry or keyboard but if you want a
blackberry that runs android has a
keyboard this is really good fun for
that if that makes any sense no it makes
total sense and that there aren't that
many androids anymore with keyboards i
mean there were a few that tried here or
there but it never really seemed to take
off but with the blackberry brand name
that's a lot of what you're purchasing
is the keyboard yeah exactly though well
the other topic we wanted to touch on
this week was t-mobile's uncarrier 10
announcement that was made yesterday at
the LA shrine auditorium mm-hmm if I see
one more person complain about the fact
oh it's only for ATP I think it's a fair
complaint though I I know is it's it's a
and I agree the verge had a post on this
I agree it's a very dangerous place to
be going where you're talking about free
content getting people on board with
approved content that crosses your wires
and limiting limiting the resolution of
that content and I get it there are
people are going to be like oh it's free
it's awesome and I I see where you're
coming from there's also a terribly
scary thing out there where
they're limiting the possibility of
these providers Netflix YouTube well
YouTube's not even included Netflix HBO
Go all these other providers they're
capable of sending 1080p 4k content
through these signals and yet it's still
being put down to 480p that's what
scares me I don't care if it's free
because me I buy a great phone with a
great screen and I'm gonna pay for the
data and I want the best content coming
through it I don't want 480p and I
wouldn't that's why this plan for me
doesn't mean much well I here's the
bizarre example of where I'm coming from
I I'm currently a something I've always
wanted to do because I remember it as a
child and it's considered a classic and
you know everyone sites I've been going
back and watching all my all in the
family from episode one oh nice I've
finished five seasons now i'm watching
them on DVD they're at 480p on a 70 inch
4k television and yeah it's not you know
crystal clear but it's totally watchable
hmm you know and that's just that's what
it was shot at that's you know the
transfers they have that's why I you
know I'm fine with that if I'm just
burning through a TV show I'm fine with
480p I just I I see what you're saying
it there there are some questions about
who's the gatekeeper to the content I
give that that's what worries me yeah
that part I totally get but at the same
time and for instance Roku once again
we're not sponsored by Roku there are
hidden channels on roku they are they're
pretty much break down into two
categories or three categories I'd say
either illegal content in the form of
its rebroadcasting something that
they're not allowed to rebroadcast
pornography because Roku doesn't want
pornography on the roku
and number three being their video
quality isn't up to Roku standards one
of my favorite channels is NHK from
Japan which is broadcast completely in
English but their video quality is not
the best of times hmm so should we be
angry at roku for being a gatekeeper not
allowing an HK onto the chain onto the
device because it doesn't live up to
their video qualities no because it's
not a service provider it's a box that
connects to the service so it connects
to your internet connection that's
offered up by Comcast or whoever the
word I can see what you're saying there
the point the thing that I worry about
is this sets the precedent for people to
say for tmobile to eventually say okay
here's here's free binge on you know and
you get these services but if you pet in
this sets of precedence this is
happening now but if you pay more two
bucks more a month let's say you can get
1080p unlimited you pay a little bit
more we'll give you 4k on the minute now
that's where you're starting to get into
a scary territory of saying pay more for
better quality even though it's fully
capable of serving that up to you right
now models like here's the hypocritical
thing that happened yesterday and I
should write an editorial on it t-mobile
is standing on stage saying we have the
best network out there verizon AT&amp;amp;T get
out of here who cares you know it's
awesome don't worry about speeds and
then they say here's unlimited video but
484 ATP as if they're not confident in
their network to deliver that they can't
deliver you 1080p and if they could why
is it for 80 and then that's the scary
part why is it limited a for those of
you listening at home I am saying here
contemplate in contemplation of what
Todd is say so those of you watching the
show can see I'm kind of got my head
tilted back well like that's the other
thing too is like it's scary because
it's good for
some customers but that doesn't make it
the right thing to do right and I i I'm
getting that I think where I'm coming
from the the problem you have with a
person such as myself as I am just a
content consumption machine so the idea
that I can kid watch whatever I want
whenever I want for free is appealing
that is the feeling but see here i am
i'm on AT&amp;amp;T i have 60 gigs a month i can
watch more video than I want to do in
the highest resolution on any of my
devices and I'm still not going to use
up at 60 gigs just because that's that's
how much video I watch and I have a hard
time believing there's a large
percentage of people out there that
would consume that much data in fact I
think the average smartphone user as of
a year so it goes like three gigs a
month so now you're tossing in 480p
video but they say it takes up you know
three times less data or something like
that I mean this doesn't make any sense
to me just just get a huge bucket of
data on another carrier and get all the
data you want and i'm not paying out the
wazoo either i have four lines where
each pay in 64 bucks so that's a
comparable to t-mobile's prices I mean
unless you look at their new 120 140
dollar whatever option for for well
playing playing devil's advocate the the
formerly three gig per month plan which
is now six gigs is the first level at
which been John kicks in right so for
somebody who is on a budget say a
student or you know somebody with a
limited income however you want to view
it this could give them the opportunity
co they can't afford that bigger data
Beckett hmm you know so I can Boyd that
this is a stickier situation that I
originally thought it's good for them
but but if t-mobile's network is so good
why are you giving them 480p video I
can't you just give
1080 that's what my point is but at the
same time it's kind of like saying a
rester instance my father's a veteran I
right before the show I emailed him a
list of all the restaurants giving free
food to veterans today and a lot of them
are giving limited menus or a set menu
he wouldn't be able to choose what he
wanted well it why aren't you giving me
your most expensive dish right I I think
the problem is I don't see if I don't
see truly nefarious motivation behind
this move oh I don't think its various
and so I don't feel like t-mobile Saturn
going well just give them for ATP and
then I want to pay us more I I dude
closer to that in regards to business
strategy than it is to yay we're the
best out there and consumers love us and
we love consumers they way they the way
they'd have you believe it's not like
that you mean llegara isn't completely
sincere and everything he says on stage
right well I think that needs to be said
I don't I don't buy that you know for a
minute um sure it's nice to have these
streaming you know free plans but for
him to go on stage and sake you know
people like me saying I'm throwing away
money because i'm not using all my data
that doesn't make any sense at all of me
what's then what's an unlimited
subscriber you know who uses two gigs
doing and then what happens when
t-mobile yells at the people that are
trying to consume two terabytes like
there's a middle ground that's who I am
mm-hmm so I don't know and I would never
like I can't imagine paying t-mobile a
monthly bill and then getting 480p video
content all the time and then when I
wanted 1080p I'd have to honestly go to
their web portal or call them up and say
hey give me the better stuff you can
just to be fair you can also use the t
mobile app
or the app but that's crazy I would
never I'd rather have the best stuff I
can get all the time and then you know
when i hit my cap then they switch on to
480 in the midst of it but here's the
fun part of this whole argument i have
unlimited data with t ball so it doesn't
even impact me yeah i do like the idea
that it also works on tethering because
i do tether my ipad to my phone every so
often the fact that they're doubling my
tethering bucket and you know for
unlimited customers we are getting a
doubling of our tethering bucket and
this won't count against the tethering
bucket so that is somewhat appealing
yeah I mean I think it's appealing I
just think everybody needs to sit step
back a little bit think about what's
actually happening as opposed to
cheering t-mobile because I I think it's
slightly dangerous oh that's a good
point I folks this is a good example of
Ty and I do not preach Todd I have like
a 30 second discussion what topics you
wanted ok and that's the entire preamble
to us getting ready for the show hmm but
uh so it's it is interesting this is
you've given me some definite things to
think about Todd there there's a first
time for everything such a baja Lasky
would you use t-mobile's bed John I
don't see why not it's there Todd does
have a good point it samee annoying to
have to go in and flip a switch you know
I I do like the fact that Ben John
automatically suspends if it detects
Wi-Fi mm-hmm so you know if you're at
home you're not going to have to worry
about every time going into the app and
flipping a switch yourself so I don't
know it's a lot to think about it's uh
I'm just gonna be so upset afraid if
some form of this trickles over to AT&amp;amp;T
where right now you know I have whatever
I want I by 60 gigs of data a month it's
not expensive
I hope it doesn't mess with my stuff to
do whatever you want I I hope it messes
with you horribly but uh uh let's see
here all we got a lot of questions that
came in so let's dive into some of them
here from aerial palette Nick what will
be after fallout 4 Maya some shouldn't
be fallout five yes I guess seated I I
honestly Ariel I I don't mean to make
fun of you i just i i don't quite
understand the question i would assume
fallout five now uh for Benjamin
McDonald pure bang for buck 1 plus x vs
1 plus 1 remember NFC well at this point
i would say the oneplus x yeah you know
the one plus ones already a year old I I
feel that the company has worked out
some of the issues they had with the
oneplus one because let's face it that
phone was not perfect it was great fun
but it was not perfect i say i don't
think i would even consider the oneplus
one at this stage yeah i don't think i
would either and i know the oneplus X
has older hardware in it too like
Snapdragon you know one uh I'd probably
go with that and I know you're saying
remember at FC but well let's be honest
I wouldn't go either one of them but i
haven't used the oneplus X and for 250
it seems pretty compelling but and
that's the reason i buy it is because i
haven't used it that's probably the only
reason here here's a hot button question
from Jeff Jeff k I almost called you JFK
sorry about that from Jeff k so now the
6p bending seems well legit should I
return my device especially with the
back screen supposedly spider webbing
I'm really considering sending it back
and waiting for the LG g5 because I'm
probably an idiot no I don't think
you're an idiot Jeff I think you're a
conscientious you know consumer I have
some real problems with this spider
webbing issue kind of like a last week i
believe it was last week you at night
we're discussing the silliness of the
bending but the spider webbing to me is
a little suspicious yeah simply because
it does not appear to be happening to
any phone prior to it being in the
consumers hands right i I've not seen
any reports of it being spider webbed
upon opening the pack opening the device
I'm suspicious that being said mmm
that's a tough question I think what you
need to do is try to get insurance on
the phone if you don't have it already
and sync with the six BD I mean I again
it's I haven't used it that much but I
think it's been largely reported to be
one of the best android phones out there
we loved it in our review I mean I
wouldn't worry about things that seem to
be affecting a small percentage of users
and can hopefully be fixed through a
warranty of some sort I'm not saying I
mean it's kind of unfortunate if you
have like a device replacement then you
got to play a hot box that's you know
annoying for a brand new phone but I
would if I would personally if I on the
6p just stick it out and then you notice
when the g5 certainly coming in what
it's going to feature and stuff like
that I mean when you think about nexus
devices to the nice thing is I mean Sean
you just bought the Nexus 6 and that's
still a great phone here the other year
later and the successors already out so
you know you're going to get some nice
time with the 6p assuming it doesn't
spiderweb ornate my partner now I'm
really happy with the the sex i just
bought very up everything um I don't
know if it makes you feel any better I
didn't buy the 6p but if I did I'd
probably not have returned to my hell
just kind of rare yeah Todd not return
something that would be a miracle uh-uh
from such an Baja what do each of you
guys have in your cell phone plans well
like I just said I'm well I have two
lines with t-mobile I have my personal
line which is on
and then I have my work phone which is I
think 10 gigs a month it's not that
heavy aid so you know if I need to look
something up on it while I call they won
phon my personal phone it's more about
the phone number i use it for almost all
the data when i'm out and about since
it's unlimited good yeah Todd what sir
playing I've AT&amp;amp;T for two of my personal
lines and then I have to family lines on
it as well and again we share this
bucket of data that the t-mobile loves
to bash I have no problem with it I mean
60 gigs is a lot of data for four people
yeah every time I hear someone say
bucket of data I just immediately my
head go bucket of chicken yeah it's kind
of like a bucket of chicken it's just
just not as tasty pieces of chicken um
and I really like it so you know I see
these things that's why I guess it's
hard for me to because I'm like the
outsider you know so like if somebody is
on t-mobile and there you know and every
month are kind of going over their data
and all this stuff and like uh and they
really have these overage problems that
t-mobile you know says is affecting you
millions of people out there then then
this is great but you know I think my
breakdown monthly for four lines is like
60 bucks a person and I have to I'm so
mine's like 120 I've access to the hump
of the 60 gigs and I don't have to worry
about you know low bridges or anything
like that and i use my phone's lot so i
think there's two two sides to these
stories you know i just wish we didn't
have to have so many lines it's so much
fun going through customs in England
because they have this rule about every
item has to be charged so that it can be
turned on if they request it hmm you
know so I'm staying there you know going
through the security line I'm pulling
out all these phones yeah like six
people love me in the security line but
oh good grief let's see here we got some
other questions from jeff k how does
tmobile tell which data is streaming
videos what if i happen to stream it on
the browser well first off the the video
is currently limited to what was it 24
services yeah 24 services so those
services have identifier Xin their files
that will trigger you know the the been
John sensors so if you're on YouTube yes
it will be able to tell it's a video but
it will also tell it's not one of those
24 providers so i also i have a feeling
in most cases you know it's things like
netflix vudu hulu those are running apps
so that'll be super easy for them to be
able to tell from Alex Walters can I
make you some YouTube banners and Archer
send them over as you can see my twitter
name is right there on the screen at
Sean piane so feel free to post them
somewhere and send me link uh let's see
here from brazen Franco isn't that what
the internet Fastlane is all about how
can they do that with the new FCC ruling
yeah yeah that's that is a big question
because they say they can do it because
everybody is able to participate so
they're not saying like oh MSG's that's
true and they're not as they said
yesterday which we're going on their
word that the companies are not paying
for access to Ben John right that's the
difference between this and the fast
lane because the fast lane was pay for
that access so you know and while
everyone chuckled at somebody getting up
and asking about could porn companies
join binge on that was a very legitimate
question yeah it's like the top stream
service
exactly so if if Legare had set up there
and said no we're not going to let porn
that would have caused the problem so
yeah by the fact that it's been John is
open to any video provider that changes
things quite a bit for the fast lane
such what I think present you bring up a
point that I was trying to make to is
that a this opens up the fast lane
possibility so that you know t-mobile
could say hey pay two bucks and you get
paid EPD element or if you think about
it we already do have the fast lane
right like that's the fast lane is the
one that's consuming your data blockage
and and the the slow lane is the one
that gives you unlimited like sure it's
not the speeds but it's the quality of
the video like that's kind of the
problem here is that it's being created
in a very you know consumers love us we
love consumers scary way and before we
know I mean Carrie I'm just playing like
we should be cautious cards here because
I think things like this happen before
we know it these fast lanes are going to
be all over the place but they're not
going to be the fastenings we thought
they were they just exist through you
know these kind of situations all right
I see your caution card and I'm going to
have my mana and play it's a free card
hey I don't know it's our job to be
critical so that's why I mean it didn't
it in some uh from such Mahal how would
you guys feel about Google making its
own smartphone their own internals of
everything and we've got an article I
think it's already up about that um I
think Google has a bad track record with
making their own hardware like a really
bad track record I would be very
hesitant to jump on board with them only
because of the track record it could be
the greatest phone ever but how long are
they going to support it you know I what
sort of supportively going offer there's
a lot of questions and you look back at
Google glass which is it seems to me
like Google gets really excited about
something if it doesn't immediately take
off they lose interest super fast hahaha
yeah they're like oh that was just a
test which i guess it was but yeah
google seems to easily get bored yeah
and so putting my my smartphone future
in their hands would concern me I don't
think it's necessary I mean you look at
it and I can see where it would make
sense right you have apple you have
microsoft doing their Lumias now from
Nokia's division and then you have you
know Google whose partnering the way
Microsoft used to kind of closely with
Nokia before purchase that's vision and
I think it makes sense in regards to
like google selling its phone but how is
that going to be so much different from
the Nexus program I mean I guess it's a
way for them to make money directly if
they're not making like I don't know who
makes money in these situations with the
Nexus who is bought through and what the
margins are but I think it seems to me
to work better this way at least for
consumers I don't know unless unless you
know they're gonna really acquire a chip
maker and do the same kind of thing that
Apple's son with a 9 or they could do
you know the microsoft way and just
source chips from Qualcomm like
Microsoft it with the Snapdragon 810 but
sashan you're asking if they make the
internals and everything which just
seems like way too much work for for
what like what what's the benefit versus
what they're already doing now well
speaking of Qualcomm we have a question
from brazen Franco should I be concerned
about my future purchase of the v10 now
that Qualcomm announced Snapdragon 820
no no I actually really like the v10 I
gotta do some coverage on that probably
after the blackberry but it's a nice
phone it's just a it feels to me like a
better built g4 and the same problem
happens with all technology it it's just
like you know your car starts to lose
value the second you drive it off the
lot
the second you purchase a phone or a
tablet you're on the countdown clock to
the next upgrade and you just have to
finally at some point go this is where
I'm pulling the trigger right like yeah
exactly that's why um you know people
people like to get angry and say like oh
new iphone it's crap you can't do
anything with it there is one thing
about buying a new iphone you know
there's not going to be another one for
another year yeah like there's some
redeeming quality to that versus I can
feel exactly what you're saying brezin
you're like oh like this is awesome
phone but in two months there's gonna be
another one and that's the problem I
mean it's a problem in the sense for us
as buyers it's actually really exciting
and awesome in every other target but it
is it's just like oh man I just bought
that now this is out and you know it's a
constant I just I thought of this just
now I brought it up briefly before like
whenever I go in a carrier store it
always amazes me to hear the
conversations excuse me I wonder if we
should do like a undercover
investigation one time where one of us
just goes and sits in a carrier store
for an entire day and what and just
listen I starts get kicked out of course
get the permission of the store I would
love to hear exactly what consumers are
actually discussing because yeah your
brains that you bring up a very valid
point about you know okay this the
Snapdragon 820 has been announced how
does that impact your your purchase but
there are people that are going to walk
into a carrier store and they'll buy the
v10 the day before the v 11 comes out
because they have no idea right right
right right you know and I there there's
a certain amount of I would love to be
that person fly on the wall yeah just
just by just walking go yeah that looks
like a good phone yeah it's like buying
a car probably yeah yeah I true story
I've actually never bought a car
yeah I mean I guess I haven't eat well i
have used cars not new cars but no not
even used cars i have never had anything
but hammy dance like so i mean there are
car owners out there that would be like
oh man you have the snapdragon 800 in
your car okay i'm sure and and the other
thing with things like the snapdragon
820 any time a new chip comes out how
long does it take the app developers to
take full advantage of that nude ship
yeah I think they were saying with like
the iphones for example that it's like a
year before it's like worth it for
developers to actually take advantage of
the chip because there aren't that many
like out there in the wild i mean when
you look at it for example we were just
covered the ipad 2 as the most popular
ipad still not the ipad air 2 with the
ipad 2 what's up it's a question that
I'll pull up next okay so like so that's
my point is that you know you have these
awesome processors out there but and
actually you're just saying it's true
it's like developers aren't really
taking advantage always of these things
because their user base isn't on that
fastest processor so yes there are a
couple of games and stuff that really
pushed the limits but when you look at
like I was just saying the most popular
iPads the ipad 2 which is why over my
head on that's why there's no I patty or
three yeah and it shows that people
aren't upgrading so i think it is like
this year long thing we're like sure
it's a snapdragon 820 but what can you
really take advantage of and the
immediate answer is you know things like
quick charge three point out things like
you know the support for i think it's up
to twenty three megapixel camera it's
faster LTE radios that kind of stuff
you'll see immediately as phone makers
ship the newest phones but you know in
terms of what you're taking advantage in
power usage of apps that takes a while
yeah exactly uh here's the question that
made me start laughing I'm sorry about
that done from Jeff k why is todd's
placed so nice but you
like you're stuck in the back of a
walk-in closet my place someday I
will clean though that it what is behind
the sheet folks for for new viewers of
the show or some shelves and also an old
back issue comic book rack from when i
had my comic book store neither of them
are pretty they're disorganized and so i
just threw the sheet up there to cover
them up so you didn't have to see the
ugly shelving units someday I will sit
down and clean all that up and remove
the sheet so everyone can stop thinking
that you know it's where I keep dead
bodies a literally got a chest question
a serious question what it what's in
your crosshairs for black friday i see
sales popping up left and right well i'm
in an unusual situation in that i will
be landing in manchester england at
lucky yeah black friday but i gotta say
when we did that we're in you and I were
looking over that best buy black friday
ad yesterday wow there's some good deals
yeah i'm tempted by the chrome books and
TV is just cuz i want this right here is
the 32 inch TV it's just cibo on and i
want another cheapo one of my desk as
yes there's going to be a hundred-dollar
chromebook but at best buy on black
friday I i personally love Chromebooks I
have a chromebox I have a couple
Chromebooks I love them you know no I'm
never going to do any heavy lifting with
them but if I just need to jump on for
half a second and do one thing they're
on there I get it done and I'm done it's
great it for a hundred bucks but that's
crazy I did find it hilarious the best
pie is breaking down the fifty-dollar it
was on fire tablet 235 and now that was
awesome $35 you said it's nice I I have
it I I do have the fifty-dollar tablet I
like it it's not I mean no it's no iPad
it's no rio
transformer or whatever it's just a nice
little tablet you know if you just want
to check your email or do a little web
surfing in bed or you know whatever for
50 bucks it's a great little deal for 35
it's insane yeah I i I'd buy him and
just toss them out like party gifts you
going go into the club and make it rain
yeah it's crazy 10 4 350 bucks which is
like the starting price of an ipad mini
I think an older or maybe you know what
think about right now you can get six
for the price of five over at amazon so
it's two hundred and fifty dollars yeah
so you can buy six of them through this
deal for what is that that's two hundred
and ten dollars that's crazy it's not I
just like the idea of being in the club
making it rain with tablet yeah anyway
um no I I think there's gonna be a lot
of great deals for black friday i found
this really funny i just read an article
yesterday as de which is a chain in the
UK which is actually walmart just under
a different name they can I brought the
concept of black friday to England they
had some problems last year with the
black friday sales with you know people
being stupid so this year you know
there's all these companies announcing
their black friday sales and as those
gone nope we're done dealing with that
headache nope as does out by friday game
that so they infected the entire country
with this concept they've dropped Alice
it's crazy I me Jeff k one of the things
we were you know there's like all these
deals but every year we talk about like
the the TV's look awesome but then they
have like one each team I port right or
like to what you two is fine you know
for me I could deal with 21 not so much
and then like they're missing features
insta board there's like three in stock
so if there's stock that's what I'm
going after
but there's not that yeah and that's the
problem so many of these times you know
they're like you know a redound the fine
print limited plenty of two per store
location yeah remember when Amazon had
that sale we were all like ready to go
on something they're gonna fry egg yeah
Prime day and it was clear there were
like ten units yeah oh I don't it was
not for the internet know and the thing
it was I had some knowledge of items
that were coming up and I checked on one
item and in the morning you know how
amazon has the thing like 08 left in
stock yeah I checked one item it was
like you know six left in stock and like
an hour before it was supposed to start
it the message disappeared oh wow I was
like ah ah so there really was no stock
so that's the problem with these hills
too yeah exactly um oh boy the the time
has flown by today yeah let's get
another one more question and then we'll
then we'll that will do two more
questions because I want to get to this
one on a personal level from such Mahal
off topic did Amy guys watch mystery
science theater 3000 what do you think
of the Kickstarter are you going to back
it I was a huge mystery science theater
3000 fan I actually the last vacation I
took before i joined TechnoBuffalo was
in 1996 and that was to go up to
minneapolis on Labor Day weekend for the
commish econo Rama two electric boogaloo
which was the MST convention and because
I had a press pass i actually got to to
tour the sets and stand up on the
satellite of love and awesome huge fan
of the show yes I back the Kickstarter
not going to say how much but no wasn't
it I wasn't the 10,000 or 15,000 dollar
guy and I did back the Kickstarter let's
see here we'll take one more and then
we'll get I here for the day 22 uh-huh
we have to end on this one from Brisbane
Franco once you return this week Todd
and we're on
cute well real quick i'll say we're done
schottky John Q John Q is working i
canna customer died oh that's where he
works now and he's designed he does a
lot of stuff arm-based designed this
really cute little pigeon mascot they
had I saw that on Twitter yeah yeah I
named Amy who he's putting on or page or
something there yeah he puts a memory to
see anyone yeah oh he's learning
animation now so now he's got a man
walking places that's what I stuff
anyway John Q is good I still talk with
John Q great guy we love them mm-hmm
what your turn this week Todd uh well
Preston I don't know if you were here
last week when i returned the apple TV
cuz I didn't have the question I didn't
return anything yet however one
blackberry is going back we ordered we
have a review unit we ordered one direct
from blackberry and then I went 18t
bought one because we needed sooner than
the one that shipping and still hasn't
shipped so one of them will go back
that's the one that's going uh all right
well anyway sorry we did not get to
everyone's questions I'm going to take
one more because that this guy it looks
like he is desperate for information
here from June kit does iOS updates for
the older phones really help or or are
the updates just for show because even
the IP 4s iPhone for us is getting the
latest update unlike the Samsung i'm
using forgotten after two years and i
doubt my gs4 is getting Android M hmm
that's a good question so uh sometimes
the iOS updates actually slow things
down but they do yeah any features it
but not all the new features and so on
it's nice that Apple you know doesn't
forget about devices as quickly as other
manufacturers and I think that's I share
the frustrations with Android devices
you know not getting updates as quickly
as others yeah I I said I totally agree
Theon that it's amazing how fast some of
the Android manufacturers forget their
phones yeah that's the thing that that's
troubling and I liked it out of those
into that but on the other hand you know
just because you get the update doesn't
make everything better
alright folks well that is going to
bring this week's episode to a close
again we will be here next week the week
after that's questionable and the week
after that I'm we're definitely gone but
we'll we'll keep you abreast of the
