TechnoBuffalo here at the full review of
the Motorola Droid 2 a sequel to the
phone that really started the Android
craze on Verizon let's see if it lives
up to its name so before we talk about
keyboard screen and specs let's talk
about the call quality of the device
since it is a phone doesn't make good
phone calls no matter what else it does
it's not gonna be much use to you and
typical two varieties lineup of phones
called quad is excellent I experienced
no white noise on my end the caller
experience no white noise on their end
wasn't any popping in xx call test a
while driving for half of those I
experienced zero drop calls other
reviewing here seems to be on par with
average devices generally I can pull in
about two or three Barnes EVDO Rev a in
certain areas and this pulled in almost
exactly that no more than no less so
it's got an average radio if you should
get pretty decent signal strength if
you're in verizon network alright so
let's go ahead and talk about specs this
guy is being run by a one gigahertz TI
OMAP processor it's got a 3.7 inch of
course the positive touch screen at the
resolution of 480 by a 54 so pretty high
resolution and the display supports up
to 16 million colors it's got bluetooth
2.1 it comes with eight gigabytes
installed on the phone sort of soldered
in there as well as an eight gigabyte
microSD card and does come with Android
2.2 that's Froyo right out of box no
need to wait or worry for an upgrade of
course it's got Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS rest
of stuff that you would expect alright
so let's talk a little bit about the
design care about the design of the jury
to that at least referencing the Droid 1
let's go ahead and bring that guy in
here just for a minute if you can
remember my initial review of the Droid
I was a big fan of it Android when it
was first launched in the joy particular
when it came to Verizon I hadn't
achieved that much success that had been
sort of a fringe operating system loaned
it to one carrier on the US and Verizon
really embraced
OS and the Droid was a first offering it
was a huge success
I loved away the phone work I loved the
way it felt one of the things that I
really didn't like about the initial
droid was the slide-out QWERTY keyboard
it had a very very very large deep at
here which took away a lot of the key
space the keys were separated but it was
not a very easy typing experience
definitely one of the worst physical
QWERTY keyboards that I've ever used so
now let's talk about the Droid 2 they
fixed that keyboard issue so you don't
have that d-pad there anymore that
almost looked like a fingerprint scanner
replace it with just 4-way navigation
arrows and they got rid of the key
separation so each key looked different
and actually felt different it's almost
cut differently now we've got sort of a
single membrane on top of all the keys
you can see that a little bit raised
makes for not much improved typing
experience that actually was very
disappointed I've tested a lot of full
QWERTY phones this is probably one of
the worst keyboards that I've ever used
so if you're thinking about picking up
the phone because you wanted a corded
keyboard I definitely recommend going to
try it in a Verizon stores you may be
disappointed with how it performs
that being said Motorola does have one
of the best sort of on-screen keyboard
augmentations to the sake Android one so
you can rely very easily on the
on-screen keyboard although if you're
picking up a Droid 2 did on the
slide-out is really a nice feature so
you're really missing out on one of the
primary selling points the Droid 2
another sort of small gripe is that the
keyboards not spring-loaded meeting when
you slide it out doesn't sort of launch
I have to push it all the way a very
small complaint something that I missed
and that I've seen on other slide-out
QWERTY devices the differences again
between the Droid 1 and the Droid 2
you're from a physical standpoint this
big pronounced chain which where the
antenna resided it's a little bit less
pronounced that you can still see it a
little bit there it's more of sort of an
evolutionary little streamlined design
the new Droid 2 is running Motorola's
redesigned UI still sort of being called
motoblur so get a little bit different
button to write you've got that sort of
four square grid which will just pulled
up a menu button for me places the
traditional menu button found on Greg
Android devices and that's really it
from an aesthetic standpoint of course
you've gotten more of a chrome feel or
chrome look as opposed to the black from
the past so this is running a 1
gigahertz TI on that processor and we
started heard that 1 gigahertz ember
quite a bit Ryan's got a few of them for
instance these samsung fascinate running
Samsung's hummingbird chip you've got
the droid incredible running a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor sort of
stack all through processors up the ti
processor running in the droid 2 the
Snapdragon the hummingbird this would
definitely be the slowest of the 3
although it's very capable phone so
let's talk about some of the specs of
the device the well sort of show how the
specs come together from to a full
package so let's jump right ahead and
take a look at the browser this is an
Android 2.2 device I mean it does have
support for flash 10.1 which does work
very well really using the browser's
where I've seen Android phones either
excel or really fall flat a processor
time and rendering time often times are
a bit slow when using multi-touch
browsing so when you zoom in it's not as
quick as you'd like
although it does appear to be relatively
fast on the droid 2 so the processor can
more than keep up with that I should go
ahead and rotate it of course you've got
a landscape view as well
browser wise approach exactly expect
from a very powerful Android phone that
works well I've done a ton of browser
reviews on many different phones I'm not
gonna rehash it here
it just works well and it does have
Flash support so if you're looking for a
phone like I started to do that look no
further than the Droid 2 now I want to
sort of wrap all this up and put things
together into a full sort of value type
a cage with you as phone's gonna set you
back just about $200 least at the time
this video was filmed and it's hard to
recommend this phone not because it's
not capable because Verizon has so many
other great phones for the same price
the excelling point here for me would
have been the full QWERTY keyboard which
I thought to be very unusual so that's
gonna mean what other phones in
Verizon's lineup can you pick up well
the samsung fascinate can be the same
price with that faster hummingbird
processor
and no full corded keywords you're gonna
get a much thinner package if you like
motorola sort of enhancements they're
blur as features need to look no further
than the Droid X right here which is
recently just updated to Android 2.2
Froyo as well you're also going to get
physical buttons which are not
capacitive what some people might prefer
can get a larger 4.3 inch screen for the
same price so from from a value
standpoint something it's a bad phone
when it said Verizon has so many other
great options in their lineup that makes
the joy to very hard to recommend one
other sort of small gripe is a camera on
the back first of all does not record HD
video at 720p like the other phones they
just brought in does have a dual LED
flash the pictures are not very good
they look grainy and gray not very true
to their actual colors battery life
you're gonna have about a 1400 milliamp
hour battery they will say the Droid 2
does very well with battery management
I'm very easily able to get a full day
out of it
which is not something I could say about
other Android devices something to sort
of bear in mind as well so overall I
recommend the joy to not really and
again just because there's so many other
great phones and Verizon lineup if this
phone existed in the vacuum so there
wasn't a joint credible there wasn't a
samsung fascinate wasn't enjoyed
absolutely any other Android phones on
Verizon this would be a fantastic buy
it's a fast phone it's got a lot of
great features a little bit on the thick
side because that QWERTY keyboard but
because there are so many other choices
it's gonna be a hard sell there so on a
one to five scale just based on this
phone itself
I do give it a solid four losing out on
the keyboard and the camera I really
what prevents it from getting a five and
my book so do you agree or disagree over
here what you have to say I'm John Rhett
