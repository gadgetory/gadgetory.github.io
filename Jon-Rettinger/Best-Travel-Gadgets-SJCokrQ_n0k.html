technobuffalo here admittedly i'm a bit
of a dork and when i travel i travel a
geek style so it's summer and people are
going out of town they're going on road
chipster flying thought i'd be a great
view to talk about what sort of tech you
bring when you tremble I'm not you're
going to Canada for two days in from
California that's a long flight I
started to pack in my bag isn't finding
someone like comics inside that I want
to bring with me that would make a real
cool video topic to talk to you guys
about and see what's were things you
brainy just depend how long you're
traveling for so for my just few days in
Canada let me show you what I'm ring
first gotta bring the iphone to my way
to get online it'll probably be my gps
well tomorrow i'm going to get crammed
for roaming charges gotta have it also
since i'm going to be flying i'm going
to put a ton of movies and TV shows on
the iphone it's a long flight from the
west coast this dates to really up the
east coast of Canada so i'll put some
movies i'm thinking about maybe watching
the shield levin seen it before but i've
heard good things so i put you know the
first season of that on here and because
i'm going to be on the iphone quite a
bit i'm gonna be busting out the I power
battery backup to make sure I got an
abuse on this also I'm a big reader some
of the times when I'm not rotting my
brain watching movies or TV shows I'm
going to using the kindle to read a book
too in addition I'm also going to be
bringing the macbook because well I
can't be that far away from a computer
for that long I know that sounds bet say
but I'm sure a lot of you are probably
the same way so let's sort of stuff do
you bring with you when you travel you
bring an old school game boy a PSP a
Nintendo do not bring any technology you
want to get away from it what do you
guys bring when you go on the road hop
on a plane or just go anywhere thought
it'd be very interesting to see what you
guys have to say anyway I will see in
the next video for exclusive content be
sure to follow me on twitter twitter.com

about technobuffalo check out twitter

you in the next video I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
