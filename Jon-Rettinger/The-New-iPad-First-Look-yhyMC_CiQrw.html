with thin bezels and touch ID today was
was not a good day for you but you're
waiting for a lower-cost iPad with last
gens processor you might be pretty happy
today at an educational event in Chicago
Apple and built are calling just a new
iPad not iPad pro it's a nine point
seven inch tablet that looks like a
regular iPad with the touch ID sensor
right in the middle and giant bezels
galore
so I'd say nine point seven inch screen
you're also gonna get an 8 megapixel
rear camera a FaceTime HD camera
it's the a10 fusion power in this guy
that was the same chip that was in the
iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus up to 10 hours of
battery life should be able to keep
going and going and going it's gonna
weigh one pound which sounds light when
you consider that the 10.5 inch iPad pro
weighs 1.0 three pounds realize it's
it's not that light colors are pretty
typical as well it's silver space grey
and gold storage little on the smaller
side about 32 gigabytes and the big one
here is price what would you think would
be the killer price point for me under
200 bucks for consumers would be pretty
awesome
Apple priced at $329 for consumers 459
for cellular if your schools are looking
to buy these things it's gonna be 299
bucks
the good news though they're available
today shipping this week with the bad
news no smart Keyboard connector they've
been lovingly eyeing Apple's keyboard
cases you are a bit out of luck which
seems weird cuz you probably won't do a
lot of typing on this thing above course
bluetooth keyboards will work as well
Apple is sweetening the deal a little
bit though giving free 20 gigabytes of
cloud storage also coming out
announcement third party pencils because
the new iPad to support the Apple pencil
of course I was happy to sell you theirs
for 99 bucks but they announced a
logitech crayon for 49 bucks so half
price you're getting Apple pencil
support it looks like computer labs are
getting way more advanced that was in
school it was all Apple two E's and
Apple 2 C's pretty awesome and I've had
to take note for a lot of things they
can do with the reality a lot of support
for teachers to monitor what kids are
doing you can do a lot with a tablet but
their price point can also do a lot with
Chromebooks but they're not school
decide to go Apple ecosystem go for less
expensive
Chromebooks and the onslaught of
Chromebook tablets that are coming me
pretty interesting
but the Gettys are available to
consumers they're available today is it
enough for you to go out and pick one up
are you waiting in line I'm like
legitimately curious at this price point
is killer for you the lowest price iPad
pro is that's 250 bucks Oh half price
you are still getting a really nice iPad
one of you guys are going to do and get
any fun to see us review one let us know
in the comments down below till next
time Jean Ranger detective Buffalo
