to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader in
remote support what's up everyone john
retinue from TechnoBuffalo here we get a
ton of product every year to review most
of them no need to be charged via a
micro USB cable we've got something
special here that not only gets us out
of the office plus let's do something
pretty fun we're taking a look at the
Seaboard pro it is an all-electric
skateboard and it is all awesome so a
few weeks ago the folks from Z board
reach out to see if we were interested
in taking a look at their Zboard front
of course my first reaction was hell yes
if thirteen-year-olds media this is
gonna exist I would be super excited I
foolishly ran home told my wife we're
getting an electric skateboard too what
she said you to wear a lot of protective
padding then this came in and I tried it
I realized it's really easy to use and
seemed surprisingly safe if you're not
super klutzy or stupid so let me take a
little bit about this guy so there are a
couple versions of the Z board available
we've got the Z board Pro there's a
regular Z board as well this guy starts
at nine hundred forty nine dollars it
can go up to seventeen miles per hour
which is pretty fast you can get up to
ten miles of range with it it weighs a
pretty reasonable 25 pounds plug into
this a regular 110 wall outs can take
about five to six hours if you want to
opt for the classic though it's a few
hundred others cheaper at 649 Z board is
actually a crowdfunded project it was
asking for $100,000 they raised two
hundred and seventy eight and I can
totally see why so let's take a look at
the board and then I'm just gonna hop on
it and start writing so a few things to
take a look at down here you've got two
pads stepping on this one essentially
your go pad when you put your foot on
this it starts to move this one is going
to serve do a reverse thrust which could
be your brake or just going reverse to
make sure you're safe at night they also
have three LED lights on the back so
anybody can't see you being electric and
I've enjoyed that instant torque I was
really worried this is gonna feel like
when you step on it but you
gradually you're not suddenly thrust
forward and the more you step on it the
more pressure you put the facts are
gonna go so you can still control it you
don't have to use any silly sort of hand
control to make sure you move plugs in
really easy there's an adapter right
here it's three prong that plugs into a
wall it's got a power switch to turn
that sucker on and you are good to go
you can hear a light hum and you're on
your way so enough about me talking
usually you see me with phones you're
gonna see how coordinated or not
coordinated I am and I'm sorry
sweetheart I'm gonna ride to the board
stands pads let me stop my gnarly shreds

rate boom so the kid I used to ride a
skateboard but I'm certainly no skater
and it's been quite a few years since I
last stood on one of these so let's give
it a shot and I'll show you what it
looks like it's powered on I can wheel a
little bit again the back one's gonna be
reversed the front pad is gonna be set
you off to go so I'll go ahead and step
on it
and you start moving really gradually
you can put as much pressure as you want
and you just move and write it like a
regular skateboard it's really natural
to ride and you can go like I said it's
got a range of 10 miles you can go
pretty far on this thing go ahead and go
a little faster you can turn anything
you can do on a regular skateboard
so it's really simple that's all there
is to it they made this daddy easy for
anybody to ride put your foot on the
front you go forward take your foot off
you'll slowly Coast or tap your foot
back a little bit and you're going to
stop super easy so this thing might not
have a 4k screen it might not have a 12
or 16 megapixel camera the optical image
stabilization might not have a
Snapdragon 805 this thing has a lot of
fun this is probably one of the most
enjoyable reviews I have ever done we
ride this thing around the office for a
couple weeks now just going from room to
room just riding it around because way
more fun than walking Z board nailed
this one hit it way out of the park
you've got the money it is a worthwhile
investment it is a ton of fun great way
to get around a college campus a great
way to just get from place to place if
you take a bus to work and you want to
get there and back it's light enough
that you could just sort of carry at 25
pounds it's not overly heavy handle
makes it way easier it's got some
cushion on it and just an enjoyable
thing to have it's a fun toy and the
kiddin me can't believe I got an
actually review this for a job thank you
