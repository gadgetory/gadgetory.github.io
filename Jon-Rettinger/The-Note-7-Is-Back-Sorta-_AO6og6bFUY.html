office for saying I've got good news and
bad news for you so feel free to have at
it and that me in the comments but I've
got good news and bad news for you if
you like me are still sad that the
Galaxy Note seven was just pulled out of
your Android loving hands I've got good
news and I got bad news for you
according to the Korean economic daily
via our friends at Android Authority the
note sevens kind of coming back but only
in emerging markets they mentioned
specifically Vietnam and India so the
story goes they'll be refurbished units
not gonna start making brand new note
sevens but they've got a ton of notes
evans laying around with a smaller
battery down from the 3500 that
originally shipped with that had all
those damn issues that you guys know
about supposedly it'll be down to about
three thousand and thirty two hundred
this one should also be a little bit
hard to find there Clemmy are gonna be
doing it kind of a limited run so a bit
of a sad mark there but if you live in
one of those countries you're traveling
closed markets it should be available
sometime in june i still missed a note
seven
I love the note seven I love Samsung pay
on and I love the screen I love the
s-pen
I love the ip68 of the way my glacier
blue looked I love the camera the retina
scanning I love everything about the
damn phone except the fact that it's
smoked sometimes and occasionally caught
on fire but in all fairness
almost all phone kind of potential to do
that the note 7 was evidently just a
little more prone than Samsung other
government agencies were comfortable
with so it looks like smaller battery
less less problems so kind of brought to
the question if Samsung did this on a
mass-market in the US or where you live
would you buy a refurb note 7 I'm pretty
sure I would but this close to the
galaxy si and the s8 plus orders had to
call a larger version I don't know maybe
I'd probably just wait and just looked
in at 7 long you'll remember our good
times can you see I can ex-girlfriends
those Facebook updates and just like I
remember that time that was fun good
times and then you wish them well the
rest of their life and and the new
husband and kids was that too of like a
like too much like that exact story for
you so note 7 maybe coming back
won't do real quick TV news to straight
that story with you and what's the ass
like would you buy one I think I would
specially came at the right price gonna
be 250 or 300 bucks I
an absolute steal for the Galaxy Note
seven so our comment of the day comes
from our last video will the s8 beat the
iPhone eight come from Brando who is a
twitter handle's Brandon Russell works
right there by me this is different
Brando who says he'll know LMFAO
you should slap your own neck we've been
making a video like this lol you waited
for that so common today when that got
slapped I don't know if that means slap
your own neck but Ralph did it so if you
want to be featured to come into the day
leave a comment will feature one trying
to check out Brando wink to him down
below so you get featured and people
subscribe q so step one get featured

episode of TV news
