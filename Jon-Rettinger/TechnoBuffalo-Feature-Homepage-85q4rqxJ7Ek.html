here last week Brandon I introduced you
to technobuffalo and we discussed the
three main parts of the site the
homepage the sub blogs and the social
network and during the course the next
ten days or so we're going to be making
videos that are going to explain each of
those categories a little bit more in
depth today I want to talk to you about
the main homepage the maintenance
clusive Lee on technology related
original content and buy original
content I mean it's not going to be
regurgitated stuff that you find on
other tech websites we've got a team of
hired professional writers whose only
job it is is to put solid content right
on technobuffalo for you to read so
it'll follow tech trends it'll be
editorial it'll be late breaking news
we'll have live shows from keynote
events and from big product
announcements in addition to the
standard text and picture format that
you've seen on other tech sites we're
going to be focusing very heavily on
video so we'll have scheduled shows will
have unboxings we'll have live streams
and other live interactive shows and you
be able to follow when those are coming
out I've got a calendar actually built
right into the home page so you can see
what days your favorite shows are coming
out should be very cool and I should
make these professional writers not to
be confused with the sub blogs which
anybody will be able to create and
monetize by monetize I mean you be able
to put in your own Adsense or add code
and be able to make money off the sub
blogs completely separate from the main
homepage so I wanted to clarify that
just a bit so back to the main homepage
you'll also be able to talk to all your
technobuffalo of friends using our built
into messaging client right on the right
hand side we're going to have daily
polls so you can see what's going on at
a tech world and make your opinions
known it heard we're going to have
featured articles we're going to
featured video content we're going to be
featuring sub blogs we're going to be
featuring members to help our
technobuffalo as followers and people
that are using the site get some more
exposure we're really very excited about
the original
it's going to be on technobuffalo we're
hoping that it's going to separate
itself from the rest of the tech sites
really by the quality of writers and a
quality of the video content that will
be coming up we recognize the
interactivity of video how porn it is to
show a product if there is something new
coming out you can see it a lot better
on the video we can walk it around and
do size comparisons really than you can
in just standard pictures so
technobuffalo is going to take the tech
site in the way that you look at the
information sort of step it up so we're
very excited to show you this in the
very very very near future so guys just
wanted to walk you through and tell you
what's going to be on the main
TechnoBuffalo homepage in the coming
days will be making videos telling you
about the social network and the sub
blogs in particular to sub blogs how you
can create it it'll be free and open to
everybody and any age and how you build
to even make a couple bucks from
TechnoBuffalo so guys for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com watch TechnoBuffalo and for
technobuffalo news follow twitter com
sailaja technobuffalo and if you guys go
to the landing page right now which is
currently just at technobuffalo com
you'll see a ton of fan-made wallpaper
it's been fantastic the work that you
guys have done we've got some of our
native images up there you can pull down
and create your own and if you add reply
send us the link to twitpic or if you
posted it will get it added to that
flickr carousel that we have featured on
the homepage so guys until the beta and
a launch stay tuned for more information
and i'll see you guys in the next video
