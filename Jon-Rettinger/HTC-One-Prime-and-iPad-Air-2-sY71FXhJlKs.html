to you by godaddy what's up everyone
John render from technobuffalo here and
welcome back to episode of rumor roundup
this is one of my favorite shows because
I love to know what could be coming what
might be coming what possibly could
definitely possibly probably be coming
tells of cool to see what actually ends
up being released and sometimes it lines
up perfectly and sometime it is way way
way off up this week we're talk about
and iPad air 2 and the 3rd gen ipad mini
if you just bought a brand new HTC One
and make think you got the best HECS
gonna offer for the year I might have
some bad news for you so you might just
want to ear muff it during that part and
we've got an upgraded LG g3 that's going
like the t1000 and going metal this
rumor roundup let's just start round
them up like pokemon so if you're just
objectively looking at the ipad air and
the iPad Mini retina display you're like
I wonder what's going to get upgraded
for the next generation the first thing
that should probably come to your mind
is this maybe not like mine but I your
thumb touch ID make sense it's on the
iphone 5s and it's not on the flagship
iPads that are very very expensive so
this shouldn't come as any surprise to
you at all obviously aside from probably
speed increases maybe some more RAM and
battery improvements according to the
chinese site web to be they claim taiwan
semiconductor manufacturing company
which is just easier to say TSMC is
already manufacturing fingerprint
sensors for you guessed it ipad air 2
3rd generation ipad mini also iphone 6
was the 5s has it so the six probably
i'll have it too but it's not about the
iphone 6 the new iphone 6 rumors here
for once so the latest rumors line up
with earlier reports from KGI analyst
ming-chi Kuo who believes in new iPads
will also include the new AAA processor
and I'm created 8 megapixel camera which
you should never use don't be a person
of the concert holding up the iPad just
don't don't be that person use a front
facing camera for chatting whatever else
you guys might do with the facetime
perverts so we were a bit surprised and
the fingerprint scanning technology was
included in
generations iPad oh like what I wish I
had that it's possible it might have
been issued is producing necessary
materials for the redesign home button
and they chose to give it to the phone
but we should know soon enough wdc is
coming up I got work at anything there
but if you're looking to get a new iPad
it might be a time of year we just wait
a little while to see what might be
coming I personally I love my pet
minions right now it's what I use all
the time and honestly I always try and
unlock with my finger and then I get an
oh I did I can't so that'd be nice
certainly speed improvements are great
that was really good at that but
wouldn't expect any sort of giant design
changes other than the fingerprint bunts
probably a little metal ring around it
and be able to just do your finger I
told you spit was talking slow motion so
I pads they are coming so this whole
prime things starting to happen all the
companies trying to release like prime
versions of their flagship so like
flagships the flagships so Samsung might
not be the only company prepared to
unleash a prime and model agc is also
big tap introducing upgraded model later
on this year with evidence of an m8
Prime supposedly showing up in leaked
terminal code remember that it's kind of
a between HTC sent out about buyer's
remorse well m8 owners might themselves
have buyer's remorse if indeed the new
is a new one on the way that was kind of
a knock towards Samsung and Apple but it
might be knocking themselves so John
you're probably saying what are the
specs of this prime models I going to
transform into a tractor-trailer no
there's not but the specs are pretty
beastly 5.5 inch quad HD that is 1440 x
2560 the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805
processor which is five better than 800
processor out there three gigs of ram
and storage starting at one terabyte
I've that one probably not true but just
damn I don't buy that storage part of it
but the rest suspects could very very
well be true so according to the same
report the prime model will support the
same dual camera introducing the ma put
up the megapixel accountant 25 for the
main camera and a teeny megapixels for
the second sensor which records depth
data so a hot damn so when's this twice
coming probably I don September which is
a familiar time when Apple is probably
going to say here's your iphone 6 HDC
clearly does not want to be left out and
wants to
the biggest firepower the biggest guns
to the gun show this year we got tickets
to the gun show we've yet to hear really
anything else about this device but
rumors are circulating and I would
probably say it is like eighty to ninety
percent certain will see a prime device
we take a quick break from the rumors to

check out the website for all the
details no back to the rumors not to be
left out of the crazy super phone
category LG who i think had a sleeper
phone last year with the g2 is gonna get
some upgrades to its very appropriately
named g3 could swap out the old plastic
which is old and busted for some new
hotness which is metal so a new photo
obtained by our good friends and pretty
much all early Karev leaks shows what
appears to be a brushed metal back panel
and a close-up of the LG g3 the alleged
picture reminds us to the back of the
HTC One m8 and it's brush metal design
which could definitely be a nice look
for LG's upcoming flagship phone we do
see a slice of the down volume button
which is still on the back along with
the LG logo doesn't really differentiate
that much from last year's g2 design
supposedly it's going to be qhd again
5.5 inch display three thousand million
power battery 13 megapixel camera we're
going to know a lot more cuz LG's going
to announce the sucker on May 27 so
that's going to be super soon when you
watch this video maybe you already know
what it is but the phones are coming the
super phones are coming you should run
through the streets and hang on one
Lantern up in the window because they
are coming they're coming soon so many
choices and then guys let's hear your
thoughts what you think about all these
phones or you just super annoyed that

phone something new is not just coming
