Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here
with the brand new Galaxy s6 and wanted
to show you a quick comparison next to
the iPhone 6 plus so see obviously the
screens differ greatly in size 5.1
inches but quad HD super amoled awesome
looking display on this first time
around and notice the home buttons here
obviously touch ID but this time around
you'll be able to hold your finger
instead of swiping it across the home
button you just hold it for mobile
payments and stuff like that samsung
said so moving around the device you can
see both aluminum samsung finally
adopted a full aluminum body going
around the device and on the front you
have Gorilla Glass 4 and then on the
back you also have Gorilla Glass 4 and
it's already getting pretty fingerprint
II and I kind of want to show that
because I've noticed this in my first
hands-on two brand new camera there 16
megapixel sensor and then you have the
heart rate monitor and everything like
that - the LED flash and I believe UV
detection not positive though and on the
right-hand side here the power button on
the iPhone similar layout actually then
on the bottom you can see some
similarities there to set a lightning
port of course there's microUSB but a
similar speaker layout similar layout
for the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top however things get a little
different here you have the IR blast
here which don't have obviously on the
iPhone and then there's also and I'll
just bring this over real clear I can't
wireless charging built right into it so
you could pop it down and charge
obviously something not on the iPhone
six-plus but anyway I just wanted to
give you a quick look see how the two
phones sac up to one another this is
