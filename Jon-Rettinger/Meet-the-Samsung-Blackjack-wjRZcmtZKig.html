unboxing for you of the samsung jack
this is a windows mobile 6.1 standard
device on AT&amp;amp;T it'll run you $99 after
$100 mail-in rebate on a totally awesome
two-year contract so without further
adieu let's go ahead and meet Jack this
package is straight from AT&amp;amp;T push it
back to the end and we'll hack into it
using the obligatory back there we go
take out the box no PR server anything
in there and here we go the Samsung jack
you can see the front of it is a very
familiar form factor it's a candy bar
Cordy style similar to the Samsung epics
trio pro blackberries all of them
keyboard down below with the screen up
above so this is letting you know it's
got Wi-Fi GPS it's actually assisted GPS
which means it'll use the cell towers as
well as the satellites in this guide to
help get a quicker more accurate signal
email and camera package content samsung
jack battery we'll see what's in the box
in a minute here we've got smartphone
specs let's go over the specs and see
what we have here windows mobile 6.1
standard so that means non touchscreen
it's got Wi-Fi 802 and B&amp;amp;G tri-band UMTS
HSDPA that is your 3g it's also a quad
band ed so it'll work worldwide it's got
a really fast processor 520 in maegor's
it's actually pretty impressive
it's 4.4 by 2.4 by 0.5 inches 256 Meg's
of ROM 256 Meg's of RAM it's got a 2.4
inch display 320 by 240 and the rest of
the standard windows mobile stuff
although they are saying talk times
seven hours and standby time up to 12
days Samsung does include these massive
batteries with their phone so let's see
if the same thing holds true with the
jack and this is the success
sir spiritual successor I should say of
the blackjack line so the initial
blackjack the blackjack - and keeping in
mind with the samsung epics this is the
next in the blackjack family oh they got
rid of the black part and now just
calling it the jack so without further
ado let's go ahead and take a look at
the device you're getting started Guyot
how many guys actually look at these I'm
not a ton of phones come through I don't
think I ever look at these getting
started - guys I think figuring out how
to use the phone is part of the fun of
getting a new phone so here is your
getting started spewed windows mobile
6.1 software includes active sync music
sing Windows Mobile Device Center
warranty information and your end-user
license agreement so this will have your
user guide on it in case you have any
questions the sealed stuff information
that one in Spanish but just some more
user guides and here is the good stuff
here is the phone itself as always we'll
push this off to the side for just a
second while I see what else is in the
box we've got the Samsung wall charger
with their sort of flattened proprietary
port you've become accustomed to seeing
on samsung devices and the standard
standard Samsung charger two other
accessories they include so the USB
cable that you get in all Samsung
devices
it looks like Samsung is finally
including a the proprietary port to
leave a 3.5 millimeter headset jack
which is very nice of ashley is on the
past's and i know a lot of people have
asked for Samsung to include these on
the device that's that's very nice and
I'm guessing this will work on most
Samsung devices as well so it's nice
that day finally including it and the
hefty battery we're talking about it is
relatively thick let's see if we can
tell what the milliamp hour batteries
and there's a reason it's so thick it is
a fourteen eighty milliamp hour battery
so that is quite a bit of heft to it but
the battery has two doesn't matter as
long as it fits into the device nicely
so let's go ahead and take a look at
the device so here we have the Samsung
jack push all that stuff onto the side
I'll go ahead and zoom in a little bit
so it's letting you know on the top it
does have the six windows 6.1 standard
sliding panels they can scroll up and
down and left and right I've done
several videos on 6.1 standard let's do
a preliminary test the keyboard and see
how it feels
does have a very blackberry bold as feel
to it which is certainly one of the
better keyboards out there so that is
very nice the spacebar looks a little
bit on the small side but you can
probably get used to it on just a first
blush let's say the keyboard actually
looks to be very nice it's definitely
one of the more usable that we've seen
let's look at the buttons and the
hardware real fast
you've got your send and speaker button
we've got a very interesting array on
the side of the d-pad here you've got
your home button and when your dedicated
hard keys soft keys and the back button
and your other soft key and your lock
and hang up button you also have a ton
of shortcuts on the bottom which are
very nice got internet shortcut GPS you
can change the profiles camera or email
see what's on the side of the device
here I think you got your volume volume
rocker right there and you also have a
power button on the right-hand side on
the left hand side rather on the right
hand side you just have the Samsung port
Universal port for charging and
listening to music the back of the
device just uh looks relatively standard
does have that nice metallic strip it
gives it a more of a professional feel
although it is covered the sticker let's
see what the back feels like it's made
of any of the soft touch or which is
plastic go ahead and peel this off and
it's just a hard plastic but it doesn't
appear to be very slippery which is nice
there's a little bit of Ridge on the
side that holds nicely in your hand so
I'm gonna go ahead and pop in the
battery and we will boot this thing up
for the first time so I just popped in a
SIM card and I noticed that there is
micro SD card slot on the back and that
is right below the 3.2 megapixel camera
with video capabilities and a
self-portrait mirror right there so
let's go ahead and put in the battery
know might as well do this live on
camera so go ahead and pop it in and
definitely add some weight to the device
but it makes you feel nice it's got a
very nice weight to it and it feels very
good certainly not too heavy so we will
peel off the front of the sticker here
it's always a fun thing to do if you get
the whishing noise or peeling it off
yeah
very satisfying it's got a nice glossy
looking screen so let's power this on
see if it came with the charge usually
they do there we go get the Samsung
splash screen generally the first power
up is the longest for most devices
certainly Windows Mobile is not the
exception so I've gone on record and I
am a fan of Windows 6.1 standard not the
biggest fan of the professional of a
touch screen version with the non touch
screen with the sliding panels I think
it's a very nice implementation you've
got the very loud 3G logo the 6.1 splash
screen pops up looks like there is a LED
indicator light there and that's it
we're good to go searching for service
recognising the SIM card and that's it
and a d-pad does feel very nice it is a
five-way d-pad so you can go left and
right and select in the middle sim card
not provision off take a look at that a
little bit later so anyway guys this was
just a very quick actually not that
quick but an unboxing for you of the
Samsung Jack let's do a relatively
robust size comparison here I need to
zoom out and show you what this looks
like next to some other similar form
factor devices here is the big brother
Samsung
Epic's you can see the jack is
significantly smaller and thinner as
well despite that fourteen eighty
milliamp hour battery so that's very
nice we've got the trio Pro this is the
unlocked version but there is a version
available for Sprint the dimensions are
the same relatively similar form factor
trio Pro is it's a little bit bigger
thickness wise they are relatively close
and for comparison purpose because most
people know what an iPhone looks like
let's do an iPhone size comparison this
is the iPhone 3G the jack is definitely
a little bit slimmer and looks to be
just a little bit wider so guys here's
the Samsung jack for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers and if
you like what you see here this phone is
available through AT&amp;amp;T I'll see you guys
in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
