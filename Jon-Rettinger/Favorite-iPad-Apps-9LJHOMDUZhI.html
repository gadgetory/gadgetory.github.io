TechnoBuffalo here there are a ton of
ipad apps that have come out from
devices released just a few days ago I
wanted to share with you some of my
favorite and show you what I've been
using on a regular basis and as the
device sort has been out longer and
longer and more apps get released I'll
do an update to this video let's go
ahead and get started the first
application that I use quite a bit is
the kindle application I'm a big reader
and it gives me an opportunity to get a
chance to read all my books I downloaded
on my Kindle to which is now completely
irrelevant here i'm reading
superfreakonomics I which is a fantastic
book go back home and get access to the
full kindle store which actually doesn't
pull up a store actually launches
amazon's website show you what that
looks like and you can go ahead and
download book with your credit card just
as you would on amazon com and they get
delivered right to the kindle
application you don't get the fancy
animation when you turn pages like you
do in iBooks but it's a very capable
ereader the next application i download
this doesn't actually come on the device
is I books soon as you launch the app
store on the iPad it prompts you to
download it but when you buy it and turn
it on it's not going to be there it is
another ereader with certain some cool
animations this is the one that Apple
actually built at the library sir it
looks pretty neat with the virtual
bookshelf and it's got a store very
reminiscent of the app store or iTunes
go ahead and buy books prices are a
little bit higher here than they are on
the kindle store under releases
generally her about 12 99 as opposed to
999 from amazon so we'll go ahead and
keep going on pages is one of the
applications I've actually found myself
using quite a bit this is a word
processing program this is apple's
answer i gets to a microsoft word but
this sort of mobilized for the ipad you
could pick all the templates that you
want we'll go ahead and take a blank one
and it's a relatively full featured word
processing program you get the body bold
underline italicize you can choose the
text layout insert pictures
you can do have quite a bit amount of
word processing on here and you can
actually pair the ipad with a bluetooth
keyboard so you can type up a full paper
or report whatever you need to do right
on your ipad there's also a spreadsheet
and a presentation application as well
let's go ahead and keep moving along on
netflix awesome awesome awesome
application gives you full access to all
of Netflix's on-demand content the same
stuff that you'd get on your xbox or ps3
or now we you can watch right here so
here are some comedies Ghostbusters to
go ahead play and it authorizes it and
just starts playing it's fantastic HD
quality if you have a good internet
connection I'm just works and is really
broaden the appeal of the iPad beyond
the native applications and turns it
into a full media player you can see
that things just start playing right
there and you can rotate it and watch it
in landscape mode they actually saw how
quickly a full hour and 48 minute movie
queued up so go ahead and get out of
Netflix hearing access to movies TV
shows a ton of really cool stuff I'm
speaking of streaming video another
really great application is ebc player
this one actually gives you access to a
tongue of EBT content including others
last night episode of lost V Dancing
with the Stars a ton of other shows go
ahead and pick what you want and you go
ahead and start playing it so there's a
cougar town you go ahead and just hit
play and it starts playing you get a few
commercials and it'll play in widescreen
streaming content so there you go you
can go ahead and full screen or come
back so this is the EBT puller and stay
free download I should mention the
Kindles free pages i believe is 999
Netflix is free assuming you have a
netflix subscription that you have to
pay for ABC players free facebook
application is the same facebook app
that is for the iphone it's just
enlarged quite a bit and yours may be
able to see that i'm a big reader i love
my newspapers so I've got the Wall
Street Journal application here now this
has been a bit
ki the application itself is free but if
on a subscription can run you anywhere
from four to two dollars per month to
rent an article on TechnoBuffalo about
how to get this for two dollars a month
actually doing a certain of a promotion
right now so check out TechnoBuffalo com
if you want that information so we can
go ahead and pick newspapers you can go
back to just about a week so this is
today's paper and actually if there's
been new articles they've been posted
sort of things that are going on since
the paper went to print so go ahead and
pick one you can access this content
actually when you don't have a Wi-Fi
connection assuming it's already
downloaded and it looked just like the
regular paper you can scroll through
pick an article you want to read it
opens up and some ads do pop up like
right there you can go ahead and do
sections so marketplace and a reading is
actually very easy to do on the ipad i
thought i was gonna get a bit of eye
strain from the screen that has not been
the case it's been a very nice
experience so this is a Wall Street
Journal free application New York Times
editor's choice sort of they pull out
what they think are is the best content
of the day and they sort of push it out
to the application here and it works
very similarly to the application we
just saw the wall street journal you can
scroll through pick an article that you
like I look here you don't get access to
all the content like I said just the
editor's choice and go back to news pick
your seconds at the bottom business
technology opinion or features and next
another free application USA Today
another newspaper I don't always read
all three of these times like pick and
choose some content and this is a
relatively similar looked like the USA
Today you can go through you can pick
your section by tapping USA Today money
sports life and you go ahead and read an
article that you like so here's one
about exedy exec and some of the cool
things about these e newspapers that
some of them have videos embedded in it
next you can watch the video right
inside the article or they have more
than one picture and he actually flipped
through creates a bit of a more
immersive environment if you want to go
to the next page just sort of keep
scrolling down so that is USA Today
those
some of the let's say more boring
applications the periodicals so I've got
some games on here as well smule the
company that made ocarina also made a
really cool app for the iPad called
magic piano this is made just for the
ipad let me show you what this looks
like so I don't need to allow at my
location essentially I can't play the
piano I was on blessed with any musical
ability for the sort of fun just play
around with da da da da nunno and we see
how many fingers response the multiplex
yeah I've got now 10 and they're all
responding at once you can sort of play
the piano I have no musical ability like
I said but it sort of a fun way to play
and mess around to get some more options
you can compete with other people you
can play a duet you can pick songs or
solo or make a game out of it i just
wrote a fun way to kill some time
alright so go ahead and keep moving
along go ahead and rotate this back the
weather channel sort of some of the
features that the ipad was missing that
the iphone or ipod touch have as a
weather app so enter the free weather
channel which gives you just a ton of
information let me show you what this
looks like does take a little bit to
launch so you get sort of a grid across
the bottom you can view maps which well
right here in irvine california at 78
degrees and sunny it's actually a
gorgeous day outside I can get radar you
can see rain actually can play some
information about the weather which is
kinda neat q ended up I'll show you what
that looks like
like I said this is a very full-featured
application but it's not the quickest in
the world you can see when you're on
math to get local video service social
and even the weather channel on TV so
I'm going to go ahead and stop this so
go ahead and check out local and we'll
jump to right where we are right now
irvine california you get to the next 36
hours you know what the weather is going
to be like which is kind of neat and get
a full hourly report right there 10-day
forecast even play some video exceed
there's some animations things start to
move you can see it's going to rain over
the weekend and little raindrops are
moving around and go right to their
radar if their web cams in the area
stormwatch or even get to the weather
channel on twitter and even some traffic
video just weather videos and social you
can talk to them on twitter not that big
a deal but it is nice to know what the
weather is so go ahead and jump out of
that next I've got a I am or instant
messaging program for the ipad it's just
an instant messaging program nothing
really to see it pulls in some social
networking feeds I haven't really even
used it but I guess it'll be nice to
have also missing from the iphone is in
use from stocks application actually the
bloomberg app is one that I used on the
iphone it really liked it a great way to
manage your portfolio I haven't
configured it yet for my portfolio this
is what it looked like when you download
it you get a lot of options here let's
get an example of where it takes
advantage of screen real estate you jump
right to news you can see all different
news go back and people it network
indices you can pick one so Jones it's
look like today's been the best day sort
of teasing with 11,000 yeah you can
rotate it and sort of get some more
stock information if you hold your
finger over and do this on the other one
it pulled up more information and this
will work too with all of your
individual stocks so there's a lot of
information to see here my stock
equities commodities currencies bonds
pod cash even go right to Bloomberg all
right so let's go ahead and keep moving
along with some of the apps skype it is
exactly the same sky pack that you've
seen on the iphone it's just enlarged
great
week so the next and sort of one of the
I guess don't a flagship games that
launched with the ipad was need for
speed shift I think I'm gonna do a full
video on ipad gaming let me show you
briefly what this looks like go ahead
and launch up and it's sort of one of
the examples where I think it's a little
bit loud the ipad is a positioning
itself is a very nice gaming device sort
of an eg capable screen and some
beautiful graphics you get a really nice
racing experience here so I get some
music plays it's good we're gonna turn
that down here so it's actually it's an
accelerometer based game pretty decent
graphics and you go ahead and just drive
it's going to walk you through a bit of
a tutorial all right you can see it I
just turn turn it down rotate any way I
want there's a brake pedal that I can
tap to break and I just sort of turn
graphics are actually really nice the
steering wheel coming take an Xbox
controller which is a bit weird a lot of
fun I'll steer into a building C get
some gauges on the top you can tap in
different views it's a relatively fun
game actually one that I've enjoyed
playing so sort of shows what the power
the ipad is going to have for gaming
this is one of the first really high gap
games has been released sort of in the
coming months you can imagine developers
get more access to it and come to our
familiar that's only going to improve go
ahead and exit that switch this back ok
the next application is one that you may
have seen demonstrated on technobuffalo
it is a remote desktop actually let me
access my desktop directly it's remote
client Brandon did a full video
demonstrating what it looks like it's
pretty neat i'll go ahead and give you a
quick demonstration here good launch it
oh and it play and type in a password
here and i can show you my computer
so it's actually asleep right now but
this is my desktop you can see the mouse
moving right there actually does do
multiple monitors wealth was asking for
my password to go ahead and put it in I
will do that so you guys can see what
this looks like Brandon did a full video
around if you want to show you that it
works and actually works pretty well in
you can stream video over this just kind
of neat so we'll go ahead and exit out
ok the next application is analytics HD
lets me access google analytics n chily
looks like google analytics on your ipad
no need to what to show that next is a
free game it's called tap tap radiation
some of the games that I didn't think
was going to be that fun i found myself
sitting there playing with it for a much
longer than I probably should have so go
ahead and check new game and i'll show
you how this works go ahead and win a
pic track will all turn the volume down
and get a date copyright with things
here pic little medium because that's
how i roll if you've seen any of the tap
tap games tap tap revenge or evolution
it'll be probably pretty familiar with
essentially what you got to do these
little balls come shooting down they go
right into the circles and you gotta tap
it right as it hits the circle you can
sort of see the gist yeah and that is
the end of the game there's music
playing budget turned it off it's
actually pretty fun game this way to
kill some time another omission from the
ipad is any built-in calculator so
actually downloaded one here is 99 cents
it's just a calculator you don't have
any sort of scientific functionality but
sometimes don't want to do simple math
and then go ahead and do it right here
you can rotate it and the whole thing
just moves around you don't get any
additional functionality the next
application is a crew of a pretty cool
drawing application actually created by
one of the users on TechnoBuffalo it's
called draw it and i believe it's about
299 you can pick drawing graph paper
drawn a notepad will draw on graph paper
go ahead and pick a color that you want
to draw with to the blue you can pick
guess whatever kind of graph paper that
you want pick some pictures you have
there you can draw right on your
pictures you have saved and it's
probably as you expect sort of a drawing
application fun way to sort of doodle
and pass the time so let's see how I can
draw a 3d shape I just sort of pull up a
fresh canvas here and just a fun way to
do it'll think even guess probably be
take some notes with your hand edge bump
to bring I'm spoil it fresh page bring
candy always you can remember to bring
candy so those are sort of an overview
of the applications that i have that
i've downloaded rue the one that I used
probably more than anything is
twitterrific I know people prefer
tweetdeck or the Twitter application
this is the one that I prefer the most
it just shows everything in one long
list and on the ipad is huge and really
easy to use so i definitely my preferred
Twitter client of choice so you can't
send pictures from here quite yet
pictures that you may have saved on your
library or suck over and it works when
rotated as well you can view your all
your tweets your messages your favorites
or any of your @ replies go ahead and
rotate that back so just a quick
overview of all the applications that i
have on my ipad and as sort of more come
out and i start to learn more and play
with more i will do an update video so
did I miss any applications here there's
some that I you must have that I haven't
downloaded yet leave a video response or
text response down below i'm really
curious to really use the I package full
potential and know some cool apps that I
may have missed take me guys from jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i will
see you in the next video bye bye
what's up everyone jon rettinger from
techno hiccup what's up everyone jon
