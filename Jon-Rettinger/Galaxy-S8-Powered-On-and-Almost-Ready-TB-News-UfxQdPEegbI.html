think we love phones as much as you do
and these TV news videos are quickly
turning into me just changing the
conversations that I have with people
here to sharing them with you we're
talking today about one of the upcoming
phones the galaxy s eight maybe you've
heard of it there by a company called
Samsung they put out a few phones in the
past something pretty good some some had
some issues but they're hoping the s8 is
going to be the killer device it's gonna
bring everybody back the Samsung and if
the rumors are correct it looks like it
will we did a whole video of a theme you
can expect from the galaxy I say but the
reason I want to talk to you is we got
pictures a little vice turned on which I
made me excited I love phones and this
is one of the flagships and it looks at
least if the pictures are true
surprisingly badass so the first thing
you'll notice is audios physical buttons
Samsung is going for on-screen buttons
zoomable you'll be able to move those
around to feel like the order may be
like your back but on the left or the
right but soft buttons on the screen we
haven't quite be able to see the back
yet but the rumor goes and this seems
like living in the future tech tech that
the screen itself will be the
fingerprint reader which I think would
be pretty badass we don't know much
about the screen size referred ranges
from the s8 and the SI plus anywhere
from five inches all the way up like 6.3
so big phones it's tough to tell the
aspect ratio by looking at the leaked
images rumor also has it might be going
towards that 18 by nine or to buy wool
and i like to call it 36 x 18 so they
give you kind of two squares with a
little bit of extra real estate on top
it's also resolution that the rumors of
LG g 6 could be going so that might be a
standard that we see across the board
but who knows it's all just rumors at
this point other specs should be pretty
powerful Snapdragon 835 in the US where
I'm numbers been all over the board to
four to six gigs I think we'll probably
see for to try and save some costs this
phone is probably gonna be crazy
expensive there's a ton of sensors the
top suma blade ones for an iris scanner
and better optics for the front-facing
camera but other than that it's like a
big shrug we have pictures and it's
probably pretty awesome qhd screen to be
where Samsung settled they were testing
internally a 4k screen which see
was like an unnecessary amount of pixels
unnecessary battery drain which could
make said battery get warm and maybe
have positive negative ends touch and
four stories about bad things happen
when you're positive and you're negative
ends touch could end up with sa minis so
real purposes video is pictures of the
phone what do you guys think is this
what you wanted is this what you've been
waiting for i'm excited i got high hopes
for samsung i'm putting this gonna be a
pretty cool device but of course I don't
know assuming get an A in the opposite
test I don't have to wait that much
longer we shouldn't be announced at
Mobile World Congress the next few weeks
probably have to wait about a month for
now before that device comes out let's
jump to our comments the day comes from
a name that might sound familiar to some
of you markland sangan we know that guy
