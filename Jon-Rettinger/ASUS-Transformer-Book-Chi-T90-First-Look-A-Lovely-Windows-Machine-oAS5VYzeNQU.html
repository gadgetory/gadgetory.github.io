from technobuffalo I'm here at CES 2015
checking out the brand new asus
transformer butchy this is the t90 chi
is the entry-level model of the three
that were announced today as you can see
itself a smaller 8.9 inch display that's
wxga so 1280 x 800 pixels intel HD
graphics under the hood that support for
DirectX 11 you can see we're running
Windows 8.1 to get a full version and
Susan even going to throw in microsoft
office 365 personal for a full year it's
pretty nice here now so the whole idea
with these Chi books is that they're
both tablets and keyboards and so it
kind of doubles it's like a notebook
computer here this is very much like
netbook of yesteryear and then we'll
just move around real quick on the back
you can see right there the 5 megapixel
camera up front there's a 2 megapixel
camera right over here on the Left
wireless controls right there on the
keyboard as for the tablet itself it's
micro USB charging you know speaker
grill right there pop this off power
button volume controls on the left hand
side here looks like you have expandable
storage that's a micro SD card slot
otherwise you can buy with 32 gigabytes
or 64 gigs of storage and it comes with
onedrive Microsoft onedrive in a year of
a terabyte or that and then the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack there so it's
really really light actually 400 grams I
believe and then if you pair it with a
dock at 750 grams so really nice thin
and light portable thing you want to
take it on the road with you and use the
keyboard you can in case that's a quick
look here at the asuste transformer book
