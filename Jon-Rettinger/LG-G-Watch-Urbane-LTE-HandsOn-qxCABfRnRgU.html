isn't it from TechnoBuffalo checking out
the brand new LG watch urbane LT aids
LG's first SmartWatch that it's being
built itself instead of putting android
wear on it has its own custom software
you can flip through it here actually
tap on the various buttons on the side
there we go you get it won't happen you
here and this is really similar to what
we saw with the Audi partnership at CES
all this time it's not in a partnership
without any but go through you have a
health app calendar emails everything
that keeps you connected so you actually
have your own LTE connection that
doesn't require the smartphone at all I
do not hear but so far there aren't any
carrier partners that I've heard it
announced the u.s. I'm not sure he's
going to sell it without to eat but you
have a 1.3 inch full circle plastic OLED
display here so classically was also use
on G watch are those of a Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor it's this after
iron 400 clock and went to gigahertz one
gigs of ram 1 gig of ram full 700
million power battery which should
hopefully had a lot of get you through a
day a lot better than what we see with
Android wear the past and again LTE its
own Wi-Fi 802 11 egn NFC which is
actually really cool so you can use this
for mobile payments wherever you go and
loyalty cards and stuff like that and on
the back of the heart rate monitor so
nice metal design stainless steel will
be sold in I believe gold and the silver
color it
different dance this one's kind of
lasting memory with that class to end
there but pretty quick look here at the
LG watch urbane LT movie star isn't
available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
