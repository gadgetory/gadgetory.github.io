to you by audible on this episode of
TechnoBuffalo we're going to talk about
what nokia has up their sleeve we're
going to define iCloud we're going to
talk about my cell phone showers raining
from the sky and we're going to answer
all of your questions from the world of
technology let's get started welcome
everyone to another edition of ask the
Buffalo this is a chance where you get
asked me jon rettinger any question you
have from the wide wide wide world of
technology with a little dose of awesome
sauce to spice things up you can ask
your questions in one of two ways first
you can go ahead and send it to me on
twitter at john for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo just you have to use a
hashtag ask the bee you can ask anything
you want otherwise you can check out
TechnoBuffalo calm once a week we will
post an article up on the site asking
for your questions you can leave those
write down in the comments so let's go
ahead and jump into question number one
so the first question comes from twitter
user infinity park 003 asked John do you
think that the Nokia partnership with
Microsoft is going to be a success we
got the first super secret sauce sneak
preview of the device codenamed see ray
Stephen Elop asked everyone to turn off
their camera phones as he showed them to
the world so now I am going to just ask
everybody to put away your cameras and
of course that's code for everybody
please turn on your camera phone and
record if you'll notice that I'm
actually using a Windows Phone 7 device
to hold this up I whether or not you
love nokia or hate nokia it's been very
hard to ignore their super awesome build
quality and they're fantastic industrial
design so nokia bringing those two
awesome things coupling it up with a
really solid windows phone 7 OS like
we're going to have a really nice recipe
for success on our hands not to mention
Nokia's really
credible distribution channels and there
wait for it market penetration in the
rest of the world especially outside of
the US is tremendous they are one of the
biggest smartphone manufacturers in the
world even if their market share has
been dropping steadily their name and
brand recognition is tremendous put
microsoft resources behind it and i
think you're definitely going to have a
winner so i think we're going to see the
number one smartphone OS being windows
phone 7 to the next couple of years
certainly not but i do think we're going
to see a really solid third place and a
great option right behind iOS and
Android so if I think it's going to be a
big thumbs-up pneus the answer is yes I
most definitely do especially when
you're put in a little slice of mango in
there it's going to be an absolutely
delicious combination and I'm looking
forward to getting my hands on the first
Windows Phone 7 nokia device hopefully
that helped answer your question our
next question comes to us from
technobuffalo user Austin Childers who
asked John you think the droid bionic is
completely canceled or you're going to
be called a different name we first saw
the droid bionic if you remember back at
CES 2011 at verizon's awesome don't ask
us about the iphone keynote when they
announced some really cool 4G LTE
devices which have already come to
market including the LG revolution sorry
new phone so little chumps they're all
from verizon guys slow down I got the
trophy will do that one later it's the
LG revolution in the droid charge and a
few of their mifi devices but what we
haven't seen is the Bionic which is
supposed to be the first dual core
that's two for the number of cores
smartphone of forgy capable on verizon
right now the 4g devices are only single
core and the only dual core device does
not have that fourth G in the motorola
droid x2 so the resource have already
seen the release of the droid bionic
quick kept hearing it got cancelled and
cancelled and cancelled and delay in the
way in fact we won the first sites it
actually reported officially on the
delay however Motorola is now taken to
Twitter to say the droid bionic is
indeed coming probably going to be a
little bit retweet from what we
initially saw at CES but it's going to
be here
so if you want some dual core action on
the nation's largest LTE network you're
going to be able to get it hopefully all
the bugs that they had have been worked
out so you can get through a full day of
battery life and if you want to get your
benchmarking on and your fast downloads
on stay tuned for more information on
the droid bionic all right our next
question comes from TechnoBuffalo
website as well from user Tanner e who
asked John do you think that the cell
phone industry will become completely
smartphone or do you think that the dumb
phone will have a chance in the business
I'm dumb phone did necessarily mean a
dumb phone for dumb people it was just
the term smartphones is becoming so
widespread is something that was
completely juxtaposed a smartphone let's
call the dumb phone doesn't mean that
it's any less special doesn't ride the
smartphone short bus to school it rides
in a regular car just like everyone else
but the era of phones that just make
phone calls is very quickly coming to an
end we can hold the eulogy in the
razor's honor alright it's been
eulogized smartphones are doing more and
more phones and cells are doing more and
more it's almost next to impossible to
find a phone that doesn't have a
calendar built didn't you can't check
email on every flip phone you can buy
from every carrier now has that
functionality built in so the era of
just making phone calls and perhaps just
using the jitterbug like your grandma
might use to make a phone call is coming
to an end everything is becoming smarter
things are evolving phones are getting
more complex so we're done unfortunately
you just want to make a phone call
you're gonna have a hard time finding a
phone to go out and pick up a razor on
ebay or craigslist while you still can
not to say every phone out there is
going to be android webos you know iOS
Windows Phone 7 they're also going to be
simple phones both the operating system
met the simple phones are running are
becoming more and more complex so that
was a crazy convoluted answer that was
my hand signs for convoluted to say that
yes this dumb phone as we know it is
changing everything is becoming much
much much smarter the next question
comes to us from the TechnoBuffalo for
users saifi who asks John he explained
to you what I cut it
I really don't get it that's a question
I've been getting quite a bit what is
iCloud why am i hearing about iCloud
everywhere I go what is a cloud am I
going to lose my data if it rains if
there's a wind it is not what's in the
sky if you're nothing to do with the
actual cumulus thingies that might be
above you right now what a cloud
essentially means it's just shared
server shared hard drive space on a
server somewhere else not stored locally
not on your home not on your computer so
what Apple's iCloud is and that's sort
of the baked in cloud computing that's
in Apple's new iOS we're going to say to
integrate into the next generation
operating system called lion essentially
it takes all your information under
contacts musics fdf stored on iTunes
backup of your phone and it puts it up
into a cloud puts it up into a shared
server another T pulling information
down regardless of where you are so you
don't have to be plugged into your
computer to get that information you
don't have to be tethered to any
particular device anywhere you are you
have access to that cloud the reason
it's sort of called the cloud if you can
access it anywhere no matter where you
are outside you can look up see a cloud
and get your information sort of a
simple way to explain it but it's just a
shared server in the sky lets you access
your information completely wirelessly
and iCloud essentially does all of that
and you'll sink all of your information
with stuff that's been stored on a
remote server that Apple has so over
simplistic explanation but I hope that
you found it useful so I'd like to take
a minute to thank our friends and
sponsors at audible.com the best way to
get audio books on your mp3 player
choice including iPhone or iPod touch I
actually just finished freakonomics took
me about four days in the car this book

chance to actually sit down and read the
actual book audible com lets you catch
up on all your reading while you are
driving walking anywhere that you have
access to an mp3 player if you want to
check out free economics or any of

catch up it's super convenient it's fun
and you get a chance to use your cell
phone or your mp3 player another cool
thing you can do is electronics so thank
you again to our friends at
next question is probably one of the
most popular questions I get it comes
from user Dan who asked John what do you
do with the phones after your review
them contrary to popular belief I don't
take a smartphone bath I don't roll
around and smartphone once telephoned so
many unfortunately 99% of the phones
that we get have to go back to the PR
firms that sent them so when I work with
verizon sprint 18 TM t mobile their
public relations firm send us a device
when it comes out or just before it
comes out and i come to the loan
agreement so we sign a loan agreement we
get the phone we can review the phone
for generates about three weeks to a
month let me get to send the phone back
if it's a film that i want to keep for a
little while longer if I need it for
comparison purposes for other devices I
have to request an extension for that
phone which usually does get granted and
I can get another one or two month
furlough with it then those devices all
have to go back to the PR firms or one
exception being Apple all the Apple
products that you seen us review by
TechnoBuffalo have had to be bought so
that's how it works we get them just for
a quick period then we got to send them
back the same is true with all the
tablets that we get our hands on
hopefully that helped and demystify a
bit what goes on behind the curtains at
TechnoBuffalo and tech reviewers in
general and speaking of the entire tech
reviewing industry that ties into our
last question who comes to us through
Twitter this is user Tom of action who
asks is it possible to be professional
as a reviewer while being non biased if
so then how man this is a question that
I really have been getting quite a bit
how do you not be bias or why are you
biased unfortunately people have become
very very strongly adamant and pushing
whatever smartphone operating system
they like so if I'm reviewing something
by Apple and I like a feature that Apple
has immediately you're called a fanboy
if you're doing something that Android
has you like something to Android has
immediately your game called an android
fanboy and what if you happen to put two
phones head-to-head in the afterlife one
more immediately you are considered bias
unfortunately that's just the way it
goes if you want to be a tech journalist
you want
get into the field you have to have an
opinion that's what you're being paid
for that people are watching you for you
have to have an opinion the best advice
I can give is try and put all prejudged
opinions out of your head so if you're
an iphone using reviewing an IFO and
look at it with a fresh set of eyes
you're an Android user look at your
Android device the fresh set of eyes how
might someone else interpret what you're
looking at and no matter what people are
going to disagree with what you say if
everybody agreed with your opinion
wouldn't be much fun to read or watch so
don't be afraid of the comments don't
worry about the feedback be honest to
yourself give a fair opinion for what
you think is the best result for your
comparison or your review and that's all
anybody can ask and that's why people
are looking at your channel 4 or reading
your website for so a bit of video
making or tech reviewing advice just be
honest yourself and the audience will
respect it hope you guys enjoyed this
