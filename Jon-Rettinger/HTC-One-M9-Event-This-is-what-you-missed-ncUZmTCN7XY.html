from technobuffalo I'm here in Barcelona
at Mobile World Congress and HTC just
wrapped up its press conference where it
made a lot of announcements probably the
big one was the one m9 the one we've
been waiting for for a long time 5-inch
screen snapdragon 810 processor and they
also added a 20 megapixel camera on the
back replacing the ultrapixel model that
they had previously and the ultrapixel
camera that was on the back is now up
front for better low-light selfies also
on tap was the HTC grip which has the
branding re which we first saw with the
recamara so it's the HTC regrip or just
HTC grip it's their first wearable it
was built with under armour and so it
syncs up with under armour software
provides all kind of data on your on
your exercises so you could be bicycling
you can be walking you can be running
all kinds of stuff like that it has a
curved display 0 lead and it's a
touchscreen too so you can swipe between
different apps works with iOS and
Android has a neat neon green color at
least the flagship model does although
others should be available later and
it's launching for 199 dollars a spring
in the United States first and then HTC
had one huge surprise at the end they
announced the HTC vive which is their
virtual reality headset it's not like
the gear VR so it doesn't use your phone
and plug into it and stuff like that and
said it's more like the oculus and they
promised it's going to be the best
solution out there and really
importantly HTC announced that they're
partnering with valve on this which is a
huge name among gamers and it also means
we're going to see a lot of content
probably games and other media HBO is on
deck is a partner Google lionsgate films
so lots of content should be made
available and you'll be able to play
games photos watch movies all kinds of
fun stuff like that HTC said that the
developer edition is going to launch
this spring and then we'll see a final
release to consumers they're promising
by the end of this year all right that
was a quick recap of HTC's event it was
huge there's a lot of stuff stay tuned
for lots of additional coverage we're
here in Barcelona for Mobile World
Congress so we have plenty of press
conferences plenty of hands-on videos
tons of stuff coming this week if you
like the video give it a thumbs up and
be sure to subscribe thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
