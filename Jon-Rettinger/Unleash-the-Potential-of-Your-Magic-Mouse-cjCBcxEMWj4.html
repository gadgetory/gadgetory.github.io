TechnoBuffalo here I've had the magic
mouse in the first came out and overall
I've been very happy with it but I have
found it lacking in the feature
Department the outgoing generations
Mighty Mouse had buttons on the side for
additional capabilities you could push
in the scroll ball for better or worse
to access new features however the
multi-touch magic mouse while capable of
a lot more doesn't do all that much
other than scrolling up and down and
back and forth on some websites well
there's an application out to take
advantage of the multi-touch it's called
magic pref so i'll put a link to this in
the sidebar or for watching it on techno
but float down below that lets the magic
mouse to live up to its potential all
the stuff it should have done out of the
box this enables it to do so the place
you want to go to download this is vlad
alexa.com / apps / OS 10 / magic prefs
and once you finish downloading that
what is it going to do it's going to put
a little icon up here I'll show you what
your options are you listen to the
middle and really anything you can think
of that you've wanted to do with your
magic mouse you don't have the
capabilities to do so it's broken down
into three categories clicks and taps
swipes dragon pinch and right here we're
on clicks and tap and you can see what
you can do one finger click in the
middle axis and there's a picture to the
side that shows you what it means let
you set it for anything you'd like to
finger click you can set it for and that
you like and all these options you can
pick and you can see off to the side
what it wants you to do three finger
click you can set it to do something
different so here it can be expose or
whatever else you'd like space is
dashboard terminal or set it for
anything else you want using the custom
targets I mean you want to use something
you just turn it on I'm going to turn
these off right now taps if you just
want to tap the mouse all these
different ape ability is that you can do
swipe for the one that I find most
useful on the Mighty Mouse I used to use
expose and spaces all the time and I had
to use now hot corners with the magic
mouse and no longer do I have to do that
you can set this to do a ton of things
that you like so here I've got three
fingers swipe up for expose and
three-finger swipe down for well expose
again would essentially hides my desktop
and brings
cup but actually is a pretty cool thing
so i'll show you what it looks like and
go down and go back up and shows just my
desktop really makes it sort of handy to
use you also have dragon pinch so you
can now and drag and pinch on
applications you can see you can drag
the tail to hide things you can drag the
tail right to do something else to
finger pinch in to finger pinch out
there's just so much that you can do and
some of these may be little bit more
difficult you can see it says
potentially hard to use did you get a
little convoluted of the options but you
can do anything you want with the magic
mouse this is a must-have application if
you have a magic mouse and if you've
been holding out on buying a magic mouse
because you want the more capabilities
this is really going to suit you well
you can also adjust the tracking speed
and a touch sensitivity as well really
it's a fantastic application it's
completely free takes just a second to
download and is completely worth it and
then guys hope you enjoyed i'm kind of
curious to what you set your magic mouse
to do you see I haven't sent might do
that much just a few things that I
really needed hope you enjoyed and for
