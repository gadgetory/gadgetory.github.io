technobuffalo here and i want to give
you example of one of the really cool
features found in iOS 4.2 for the ipad
and is going to be permeating as well to
the iphone 4 this is airplay let me show
you something cool stuff that it can do
so one of the most exciting things i
think about hair plays ability to throw
content essentially from one device to
another let's say you rented a movie on
your ipad and you want to finish it on
your television well now you can do that
without having to worry about syncing
content or streaming content from a
computer then running downstairs
wherever your computer or television
might be you can out do it directly from
your mobile device using airplay so I've
got my television right here hooked up
to an apple TV which is of course an
airplay capable device let me get ton of
other peripherals I'm going to
demonstrate this with video but it will
work with audio as well so I've got a
YouTube video up right here is a video
that I uploaded just a day ago about the
dual screen laptop the toshiba libretto
in the bottom right hand corner now
there's a new icon right there if I go
ahead and push that getting given the
option to push content I want to push it
to my apple TV now go ahead and watch
what happens i'll push play right here
and the content is going to show up
right on the apple TV i won't say the
quality looked very nice I've got the
volume muted right now it's not to make
you guys deaf you can control the volume
with your main media remotes in this
case it'd be my television remote but
you can control the scrubbing of the
content right on your iPad or
fast-forward using whatever remote
you're using so in this case would be
the Apple TV remote it's really sort of
nice way to get your content back and
forth as opposed to having to redownload
it or or do some sort of complicated
streaming this makes things just very
easy quality of the content is really
very very good it's not going to be a
tremendous drain on battery like it
would be if you're watching and moving
on your iPad or your iPhone it really
just makes life I think just a lot
easier and it's a really fun cool
feature you can see the video playing
right there and things you just work
very well
so airplay is one of the things I am
most excited about in the new iOS what
are you most excited about do you like
airplay something you might use or not
use and this is going to be an awesome
thing to have especially when
entertaining if I want to push music
from my ipad right to my apple TV and
use my home speaker system for music
it's gonna make that just much easier
that just that much easier anyway guys
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo
wants to give you a quick demonstration
of this see you guys in the next video
