technobuffalo here Apple unveiled the
latest iteration of their mobile OS iOS
8 at WWDC over a hundred new features
are included I want to give you a
highlight though with some of my
favorites I've got it loaded up here on
my iphone 5s who take a look at the
eighth iterations iOS 8 introduced
hundreds of new features obviously I
can't show you all of them in the big
caveat here this is in no way a review
this is just the very first beta of iOS
8 so I'm sure more features will come
more features will be sort of tightened
up so don't take this and all of the
review just an illustration of some of
the highlights of iOS 8 so one of the
new things that we've gone here is group
messages so there's a ton of options you
can do inside of a group message so
there's one that my sister sent me about
her daughter so you can see all the
people that are involved in it you can
send your current location you can share
your location you can now do not disturb
to get that sort of loud thread for
texting every three minutes you can go
ahead and take it out you can see all
the attachments there's a picture of my
niece you can actually leave this thread
as well which is really nice you want to
leave the conversation that's something
that I've been very excited to have also
in tech messages you now have active
notifications if inside of a nap and you
get a text message that comes through
you can reply without having to jump in
to the SMS app so here's one from Ron
hey John if I just pull that down I
could now see it and I could type my
message and be on my wife and do that
inside of any application which is
really helpful you now have third-party
widgets not on the home screen but in
the notification shade so they'll show
up right here under your today screen
and scroll all the way down go into edit
and then you can go ahead and add them
right here more going to be showing up
obviously it's just invaded but they're
showing one with ESPN SportsCenter which
to make it really helpful to get sort of
other non-apple things to show up right
here it's probably a widget e as we're
going to get in iOS you now also have
third-party keyboard which is nice we go
into Ron's message here I go and take a
look at keyboard you can now have
third-party keyboards I can show up your
they showed swipe for example but the
main keyboard which is available right
now is sort of new and refreshed so now
you've got words that are going to show
up as you start typing and the
earn what you're typing so if you have a
business one will show up your business
words or it's more casual or show more
casual words which is a kind of a neat
thing to have so they start type hey it
starts to populate their think I'm I
dang hey day hey house and start to sort
of populate hi how you can start to see
it just goes has pricked of tech
something we've seen on Android and
other OS is quite a bit you can now so
we'll go ahead and do that you can also
reply using a voice which is kind of
cool so go ahead and go back in here
I'll send that off to Ron and I get a
notification a little microphone right
there if I hold that down you can tap
and hold it put it up to your ear record
it put it back down and I'll start to us
a message for you automatically we'll
just kind of neat but can't really show
that here because we are camera down now
there's new favorites as well previously
if you double tapped you would get just
your list of open applications but now
your favorites show up here as well so
it's going to show the people you called
most recently or text in those recently
you call over to the left it's going to
show your favorites it's going to be the
reverse order though the way you've got
your favorites on your phone so whatever
she's up at the top is now going to show
up at the end so I've got my wife for
example top of my list but now it's at
the end here on a favorite so bear that
in mind kind of cool to have it and go
ahead and select somebody's name and you
could go ahead and call whichever number
you've got on for them so I got mobile
at home or if you want to just send the
text or face I'm we do that right from
here as well which is kind of handy a
lot of new additions to mail which is
quite nice and go ahead and jump in
there and show you so now if you swipe
on over it'll go ahead and mark it as
read or unread depending on what it is
if you swipe the other direction you can
now pick if you want to get more options
flag or archive both very handy if you
go ahead and jump into an email and
somebody you don't have in your contact
you can now add them to contacts right
from the mail app which is a sort of a
very nice addition to have other sort of
standards on applications you've got
health which is kind of a real looking
icon just the heart of that so we're
going to bring in all of your health
paraphernalia that you've got that
talked about Jawbone's and fuel bands
and that kind of stuff there as well so
one on the future that didn't talk about
but I did notice is in the camera you
can now pick how long it's going to take
before it snaps a picture so three
seconds or 10 seconds thank you get
yourself all set up you select it look
at your countdown right on screen
and then it'll go ahead and select the
picture and speaking of pictures also
new photo editing stuff here as well so
go ahead and show you that jump into
pictures here's one of me giving a
thumbs-up so go ahead and go into edit
and now you've got just crazy options
for you can tweak your light in color so
you go ahead and sort of move it any way
you want and sort of see how it affects
you can serve even boil down even more
if you want to exposure highlights
actually see what it's doing as you go
through to a picture very cool I'd also
ton in addition to spotlight as well
you've got to Wikipedia search sort of
and other third-party searches can now
show up here in spotlight it's really
there's just crazy new stuff it's more
of an evolution of iOS 7 they fix some
of the issues they had with ios7 add
some the features that arguably should
have been there before but it looks to
be a very nice evolution again this is
still in beta so by no means a review
but things are working pretty smoothly
so my first you know 12 ish hours of
using it what do you guys think about
iOS 8 you're going to try it not try it
is it enough to sort of get a new iphone
and iphone 5s with iOS 8 on are you
going to wait for the next year version
