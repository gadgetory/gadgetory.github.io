from technobuffalo here Apple took the
wraps off the first beta of iOS 10 and
there's a lot of things that are new
here let me give you guys some of the
highlights let's start with the lock
screen here you get notifications and
they are now interactive go ahead if
you've a text message for example do a
3d touch and now you can go ahead and
reply right from the keyboard and boom
you're good to go that's not the only
secret though on the lock screen or
nearly you could just swipe to unlock
but now if you swipe you're greeted with
a new today view it'll show you whether
what's up next Syrian app suggestions
give you news you can jump into any of
these that you want and you can edit
them as well and change what shows up on
top or if you want other app to show up
here you go ahead and do that and well
you can see you've got a ton of choices
but I thought the only thing here if you
swipe the other direction quick access
now to your camera so kind Evan and you
were good to go so my thought was how do
i unlock the phone evidently you press
the home button and then you're going to
be greeted with the phone and once
you're here things are new as well I
swipe to the side and you get that same
view that we had before from the lock
screens of today's view if we pull up
what used to be control center now has a
new looking feel and guess still is
control center got the same icons yet
before but now a new look and feel swipe
over you also now have a new apple
claims very clean way to manage your
music when you are playing Apple really
was emphasizing how clean and easy it is
to access music so there's a ton of
other changes here as well new news app
a new home app but the big change as far
as I'm concerned what I'm going to use
more than anything else is messages they
open that sucker up and show you so
first I notice things look very
different here what you ordinarily would
have so to send messages you can just
type your message and make you quit on
early and you're good to go you've got a
blue arrow to the right of it go ahead
and give that a press you get new
effects and you can see it's invisible
ink to center with invisible ink and the
person who gets a swipe away and go
ahead and send a gentle nudge you can
see it sort of gets smaller and then
gets bigger again it'll give it a real
loud look it'll get big and then get
small and maybe you want somebody
actually see you can send it to slam you
can also do full screen effects as well
you can see you got bubbles that will
show up in a few other options here as
you go ahead and scroll you've got some
confetti action
just really want people to look at you
like you're in a club discotheque
fireworks they can do some other things
here as well let's go ahead and exit out
of this you'll notice you can get quick
access to your camera you're going to
see what your camera sees right there so
mix life while using an access to other
things that you've shot like an ordinary
camera we've had before so get a live
view of your camera keep swiping you can
jump right into the camera or into your
photos other ways to interact you can
sketch and draw pictures if you want in
a variety of colors and they'll show up
as you drew them like it happens on the
Apple watch alpha made a big push with
the mode Jesus that will automatically
fill in emojis let's go ahead and give
that a test hey I'm happy let's get
tacos so as I type you can see the emoji
start to fill in if I go ahead and hit
the emoji keyboard it automatically
highlighted some letter so it's said
happy if I go ahead and select that I
get different happy emojis tacos it
picks out the taco emoji go ahead send a
never have to worry about using words to
your friends again just to highlight
some of the things that are going on
here in iOS 10 there's a ton more but
those really the visual things you can
tell it is it very different Oso I
presumably this is built with the iphone
7 in mine so and that comes out in the
September timeframe you should see a lot
more going to give you guys a first
glance what do you guys think what's
your favorite feature of iOS 10 I want
to hear thoughts I don't leave a
comments down below till next time jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
