TechnoBuffalo giving you the TLDR the
too long didn't read or i guess the TLD
w the too long didn't watch on the WWDC
keynote today it's a two-hour long
keynote so if you don't have the time
here are the bullet points on what you
missed it was a jam-packed keynote Tim
Cook took the stage gave us some facts
and figures on all of the money they've
been giving to developers they've got
built 50 billion app downloads I mean
just billion was thrown around a lot
during the keynote and then he wanted to
talk about OS 10 the newest version of
max operating system will be called OS
10 Mavericks they have offered us
multiple display integration that allows
displays to act independently of each
other so if you've ever found yourself
wanting to use Mission Control in one
window but wanted to stay with your
browser open in another window you can
now do that another big piece of news
for OS 10 users was tabbed finder so if
you've ever found yourself with multiple
Finder windows open you can now have one
cohesive Finder window with all of your
different areas of note in tabs you're
going to be able to tag files very
helpful for anybody who's ever wanted to
search for files across time but with
the same theme so maybe I want to find a
picture of CES from a few years ago I
can do that now with tags we also saw as
we normally see at WWDC hardware
refreshes and this time around it was
the macbook air so the macbook air a lot
of people were crossing their fingers
for a Retina update we didn't quite get
that this year but we did get a huge
increase in battery life so the 11-inch
MacBook Pro is going to go up to 9 hours
of battery life as opposed to five
before and the 13-inch macbook pro
because it has a bigger battery is
actually going to go up to 12 hours of
battery life as opposed to the seven it
had available to it before that's a
pretty big leap and leads me to the
conclusion that it's pretty obvious
Apple is actively working on bringing
retina
to the macbook air it's just going to
take time because they have to make sure
that the battery life is sustainable for
something like retina there was also a
hardware unveiling something I was
hoping to see this year at WWDC and
Apple made my wishes come true the Mac
Pro a new refreshed Mac Pro finally
showed up at WWDC and it's kind of
insane it's amazing it's this little
tiny thing they showed its 18 of the
size of a regular mac pro which is a
huge Tower and they have added
Thunderbolt ports they've got the you
standard USB they are rocking two video
cards by default in there by AMD it is
going to be incredible they showed off a
little bit of the specs it was a sneak
peak so they didn't give us the full
details I would have bought one today if
I have the ability to but unfortunately
we're going to have to wait till fall to
check out these super powerful and super
tiny Mac Pro and of course the big news
the most anticipated part of WWDC this
year for many of you iOS 7 was unveiled
we got a pretty big taste of it it is a
lot flatter for sure jony ive has busted
out the steamroller and he's also
removed all of the brushed aluminium the
felt the wool the stitched leather it's
all gone you will not see any of that
stuff in iOS 7 as I mentioned in my
expectations post last week it was a
subtle shift and a subtle change in some
ways if you've used an iphone for a long
time it will be a big change for you I
think but if you have used android or
windows phone it might be a little bit
less of a shift it might be something
you're a little more use to finally
multitasking you have these lovely
notifications everything's a little bit
different Siri now has men and women
voices which is really cool I would like
to see Apple license glados's voice I
would like to see GLaDOS telling me how
to run my iphone but I don't think
they'll do that but if you do Apple
you're welcome for the great idea apple
also announced iTunes radio it is a
radio service similar to pandora they
also have the same
similar sort of fee structure but it's a
little bit different so if you have
itunes but you don't have itunes match
that's 25 bucks a year you will get an
ad-supported version of iTunes radio if
you subscribe to iTunes Match which is
25 bucks here you get an ad-free version
of iTunes radio so it's sort of a value
add to itunes match the real question is
is the functionality and the service
similar to pandora and can genius
provide an equivalent algorithm to
Pandora's Music Genome Project those are
the two big questions about iTunes radio
I'll be really curious to try it out I'm
sure we're going to be giving it a test
run as soon as we have access to it so
stay tuned for that but at the end of
the day it will be really interesting to
see how many users leave pandora and
come to iTunes radio because they're
already using iTunes Match that's it for
the WWDC TLD w i guess too long didn't
watch we will see you guys for recaps
all over III show floor but for now I
got to start saving up from a mac pro
