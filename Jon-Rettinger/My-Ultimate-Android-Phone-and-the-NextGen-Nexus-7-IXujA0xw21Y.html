to you by Full Sail University what's up
welcome back to their episode of ask the
buffalo as you could tell something's
different about me I got a new shirt I
read the comments all you guys say I
never get any new clothes I wear the
same thing in every video so I took a my
but shopping and bought some new clothes
which is not something I do very often
so boom also yeah I got this problem it
sounds like I swallowed 17 frogs so with
a voice like this it seemed like only
one thing would make sense that's right
now it won't be distracting because this
is the voice I'm supposed to have so up
this week we're talking about Apple CEO
problems some Google i/o news talk about
what my ultimate Android phone is going
to be this is ask the Batman let's go
ahead and get started first question
comes from Steve hey Batman recently it
has been rumored that gapless CEO
shopping in your opinion what is Cook
doing wrong what in your perspective the
Steve Jobs have that cook does not have
from a business perspective so that's
interesting question we don't get many
from a business perspective questions
here so Apple stock price has gone from
their all-time high to what has been now
a few year low even dropping below 400 a
few months ago it has not been all rosy
for the house that jobs built in my mind
one of the things Steve Jobs had it was
an intangible claudette you can't teach
it was a fire and a passion Tim Cook's
me more of an Operations guy getting the
gross margins up so Apple can make more
profit without focusing on the
innovation side of things one of the
things I loved about Steve Jobs when he
would talk about mobile flash and saying
we're not gonna support it it's you know
you get angry it's ridiculous and I
didn't always agree with that but it was
fun to see and people can respond and
rally around serve at dynamic CEO when
he said we're gonna go thermonuclear on
Android it was awesome to see a CEO that
kind of passion Tim Cook does not have
that it was a very smart man with a very
good business minded but he lacks that
passion and you can't teach innovation
you can't teach design C Jobs had really
some
don't think any other CEOs going to have
that eye for design
now rumor has it that Cooke is relying
much heavier on Johnny I've sir the
brains behind a lot of apples design so
I give him credit for doing that I love
what Google is doing with Google glass
by developing out in the open perhaps if
Apple developed in the opening said
listen here's what were thinking about
working on what do you guys think oh it
certainly helped carve his own path as
opposed to asking what would Steve Jobs
do I think Tim Cook need to ask what
should I do
Steve trusted him to run the company and
I think he just needs a little bit more
time so if we that helped answer your
question Bain so the next question comes
from Tony Salmons st with Google IO
Batman how soon after i/o do you think
Google released 4.3 do you think that
Nexus 7 will get it immediately or the
next generation Nexus 7 get it first so
Google i/o is Google's big developer
conference it is going to be going down
on Wednesday lease it's when the keynote
happens we're expecting to see a slew of
new devices including the next
generation Nexus 7 a new Nexus phone and
the next version of Android which we'd
all thought was going to be key lime pie
Android 5.0 but looks maybe another
iteration of jellybean codenamed 4.3 I
will say though I didn't think the next
generation Nexus 7 is going to get it
but in the current generation Nexus 7 is
going to get it to probably say sometime
next week I think we should see it
Google's been really good about rolling
out those OS is as soon as they are
right - their flagship devices dent and
our last question comes from Vanguard
lockness who asks hey Batman what
specifications and what build material
would your ultimate Android phone have
if you were to build your own that is a
great question when actually I thought
about recently my francon phone what it
would have if I could build my beautiful
phone from the ground up so first I
would have HTC do the design I love
their aluminum build that solid build
quality I'd love to see octa-core on
there just because I think it's cool to
say I got an octa-core Samsung's Exynos
I think would be the perfect fit for
that I would throw three gigs of RAM on
it I would just make a redonkulous
screen I love big screen phones I would
make probably a five and a half to six
inch 1080p phone Samsung connect the
display because I do a really incredible
job with that I would have sense be the
UI but the option to turn it completely
on or off and you stock Android or these
turns some features on top I think would
be really cool that would probably be my
dream phone no of course never see that
at the same
you see don't get along but perhaps
we'll see something similar the next
generation note 3 where maybe HTC is
going to jump into the phablet game what
do you guys think would you want to see
HTC in the phablet game and what would
your dream phone be leave them in the
comments right down below Rachel let me
thank our friends and sponsors at Full
Sail University app development is the
new gold rush and if you want to get in
Full Sail University of degree program
for you in this program you'll end both
the programming and business side the
mobile development so that you can
concept develop deploy and market an
application from start to totally finish
you'll explore advanced programming
languages visual frameworks usability
principles app development for iOS and
Android OS s so pretty cool through full
sales project launch box program
students receive a macbook pro preloaded
with industry software plus ios and
android devices did you've got
everything you need to start coding so
between the App Store and Google's Play
store over 50 billion apps have been
downloaded with no signs of slowing down
ready to Maastricht technology and
software to compete in this rapidly
growing industry visit Full Sail edu
slash TechnoBuffalo learn more about the
online degree program again phone led
you slash TechnoBuffalo thank you guys
for humoring me and watching another
episode of ask the buffalo hope you guys
enjoyed and had a laugh or two of my
ridiculous voice i'll see you guys
hopefully sounding better next week
