to you by 23andme well hello there
you're expecting me to say what's up
welcome back to the episode of Rhett
enters rents to show her a rant and rave
on something that's going on or in this
case might be going on in the wide world
of technology up this week let's talk
about the facebook phone supposedly it's
coming and coming very soon so soon in
fact by time you watch this video you
might already know when it is and what
it is and what it might have packed
inside of it i think a facebook phone is
a silly silly silly idea i don't need a
phone that does what an app can do but
that's just me this is right in jerz
rants let's go ahead and get your auntie
Zin a bunch so there have been rumors of
the facebook phone for years in fact we
saw a little tiny bit of fruit fall off
the facebook phone tree a few years ago
when we saw the HTC status or the very
silly named cha cha as it was called
internationally now admittedly it had a
pretty awesome keep everything else
about it was super ba down smiley face
it had a facebook button on it that you
could update your facebook status with
and easily upload pictures but the
facebook app does that in face because
now we're really tightly integrated with
core o essa so you can upgrade pictures
right on iOS or android makes life a lot
easier but supposedly Zuckerberg and
company said we learned our lesson and
now we're gonna release the real
Facebook phone supposedly coming soon
and allegedly called the HTC first with
a lowercase F like the Facebook logo so
there aren't any confirmed details
available yet but according to android
police HTC first because originally
codenamed the mist don't get all excited
about a super phone because it's super
mid-range specs it's gonna have a 4.3
inch display with a 720p resolution a
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor gig of
ram 5 megapixel rear camera and 1.6
megapixel front-facing camera so nothing
here is huge a revolutionary Facebook's
event supposed to take place on thursday
or put forth at ten a.m. pacific at the
company's Menlo Park campus and that's
this week coming up so Facebook phone
makes no sense come on I don't need a
phone again that does what my app can do
what could the facebook
phone possibly do that my current
smartphone your current smartphone
already can't well I'd be able to tag
people right from the camera application
not a big deal not buying a phone just
for that feature so what do you do on
Facebook here are the big one so you
upload pictures you tagged photos of
friends you stock people you look at
their news feeds you check pictures and
you just sort of passively check out
what's going on on facebook you can
already do all of that on your phone
it's Facebook gonna announce some crazy
new feature that only this phone can do
I cannot see any reason to sacrifice
every other phone experience to try and
just use a facebook phone so allegedly
it's gonna have a crazy facebook e skin
on it it's going to do things very
easily why not just release widgets that
Android users can use why do I have to
use this special especially a mid-range
facebook phone it's gonna lastly
presumably a two-year contract just
makes absolutely no sense to me and I
don't want a specialty phone for each
app I don't want an Instagram phone I
don't want to Twitter phone I don't want
a facebook phone I don't want a
Foursquare phone I don't want any of
those kind of phones especially like you
don't need one device that just focuses
on one thing their phones and their open
source especially if it's gonna be based
on Android just make it work with all
devices and call it a facebook skin
people can download make a facebook
launcher publicly available people can
download don't release it on a crazy
mid-range spect phone and expect the
world to get super excited Mark
Zuckerberg cuz it just ain't gonna
happen so a facebook phone I've said
that a million times you guys want to
see that you've any interest in a
facebook phone are all excited and
jumping up and down for a facebook phone
I think you might be for google
announced the next version of android or
apple releasing iOS 7 or the iphone 5s
i'm certainly not but i'm getting jaded
so maybe i don't maybe i'm wrong i want
to hear from you so let me step back
from my rantin and my raven to thank our
friends and sponsors at 23andme have you
ever wondered what you might learn from
your DNA I know that ever since I saw a
giraffe spark that little dancing DNA
molecule came up I've always been sort
of curious 23andme enables anyone to
explore their own DNA that's kind of
neat so actually based on a salai of
analysis of over 1 million data point in
your DNA customers will receive over 200
personalized reports that cover health
risks physical traits carrier status for
conditions that
be passed on to children and more so
think about having kids and you might
think oh grandma whoever at X is easy
why don't know if you might be a carrier
for it can really be a useful tool as
you start family planning 23andme first
offered the Personal Genome service in
november two thousand seven for almost a
thousand dollars and provided only 14
reports but today you can get over 200
ports all four ninety-nine bucks that's
the evolution of technology right there
so it might sound kind of intimidating
to have to get your whole DNA sent to
you i'm a 23 and they actually makes the
whole process for example first you just
buy a DNA kit online then you mail in
your saliva sample their postage is all
included and after a few weeks you
receive over 200 health trait an
ancestry reports so what are you waiting
for get started go check it out at
23andme calm / TechnoBuffalo to learn
more again that's 23andme calm / deck no
buffer oh you guys agree disagree leave
your comments down below give this video
a big fatty thumbs up we certainly
appreciate it I check us out at
TechnoBuffalo compilation greatest tech
news I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
