it's been about two months since our
review actually hit and I bought a
galaxy a plus for Verizon for myself and
in between testing of their phones it's
been my daily driver for almost every
day or that eight week period if you
watch our new show review you'll know I
really loved the phone but they can
changed a little bit since then so some
general thoughts about the galaxy I say
first I'm still in love with the design
the screen still looks like a sticker to
me it does even look like a real screen
Samsung's technology is absolutely
awesome
and the review I said I didn't mind it
an outdoor sunlight the more I used in
outdoor sunlight the more I took it to
the park to try to take pictures the
more I was outside the less awesome the
screen got in direct sun left turn the
brightness up to a hundred percent you
get a warning from Samsung and telling
you not to do that and this one gets
incredibly warm I just keep my
brightness around 50% so in direct
sunlight it has not been as good as my
initial sort of first week impressions
with the device so bear that in mind
also not as good initial ethought
battery life typically getting through a
full day now it's like 20% down about
five ten percent of my initial review
perhaps I'm using it a little bit more
perhaps I have more apps open in the
background I don't have my brightness
set to serve auto brightness I keep it
again at 50% I just like it there I can
get through a full day no problem but
still not as strong as initially thought
the other little knock on this phone and
I'm a big wireless charging guy and
before Yelp man oh it's not Wireless you
gotta plug the the cheap pad and I
understand that Wireless for the phone
phone goes on it the contact point for
the phone really small and oftentimes if
I put it down I turn the phone off I
move it a little bit sir my phone
background the more I notice it wouldn't
have been fully charged so small
annoyance is there the last thing that
still annoys me is the fingerprint
reader and I read the comments our
review it was overwhelming
John's put a case on it and you can find
a location I don't like to have a case
on this phone I loved where this one
feels the designer for me is part of the
appeal of the device I feel like you
lose that with the case
so let's get the SI plus the larger
version I don't think I've ever used the
fingerprint redrafted
you may be to like login to some apps
but that is essentially it have anything
the retinal scanning in the face getting
come locket and seems to be working
pretty well
those are negatives those things that
have changed I still love this phone
Samsung pay for me seems like magic when
I use it I love the fact that little may
fit out a magnetic field for swipe cards
tap it I love the way the phone feels a
design quick charger has been incredibly
awesome
so my go-to camera taking pictures and
my kids it's my go-to video camera
taking videos of swim lessons or
anything that I'm doing I've even used
it at events I even maybe clicked it to
Apple's WWDC and take pictures on the
open and I got some dirty looks from
certain company employees but the camera
is absolutely awesome and there's a lot
of reasons still want to buy this phone
I've never had any speed issues the
phone is so incredibly fast I know like
you guys may be a little bit worried it
only had four gigs of RAM but it's still
quite a bit no performance issues I'm
able to get through and to get through
of use less split screen multitasking
and it's still been really smooth I
don't mind the change of themes like
main care to mind the on-screen button
but have a phone that looks this good
that's this pin that's powerful and
he'll has a headphone jack which I've
used quite a bit it's really nice to
have I could go back two months I would
still spy the phone again it is a huge
onslaught coming of competition you've
got the essential phone coming you've
got whatever Apple is going to do next
coming you've got the old GB 32 one plus
five there's a lot of competition for
this premier smartphone dollar I really
like the phone and also I have not once
used Nikki I have zero point zero use
for it and that unnecessary button I
know you can remap it just haven't done
it but the moral being I still love this
phone I would buy it again in a
heartbeat
still a fingerprint magnet I wish it
came in different colours in the US but
I love this device apart of my favorite
phone that ever tested perhaps aside
from the Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 6
plus also my favorite phones I've ever
used it's a great device if you want to
buy a phone and the price and it going
to turn you off really look at the
fate and na+ I don't think they're
disappointed so immoral two months in
things have changed a little bit so I
like to do the revisited videos
generally in a week double use test
devices it is a good enough time to get
a broad sample of the product but the
more you use it obviously things can
change an opinion to change so what are
your opinions on the film did you buy
one as your battery life gotten a little
bit worse since you bought it is your
phone get really warm when you're doing
you know mobile tethering like like mine
does you wish you bought something
different let me know leave a comments
down below this video a thumbs up if you
like to be visited views we'll keep
doing them the next time genre injured
from TechnoBuffalo so we're about to hit
upload on this video but I got something
to add went on a bit of a family
vacation to Las Vegas when I took my
Galaxy s8 plus with me I wear some
shorts with a bit of a narrow pocket and
the phone fell out I was sitting down
and breakfast screen cracked and knots
like a little bit of cracking it was a
giant crack almost the whole upper left
part of the screen got destroyed and I
was really sad I just mentioned that I
thought it was pretty durable I know any
phone can crack depending on on how it
happens but I was bummed actually it's a
first screen that I've cracked that I
can remember
so repair process there's a little bit
interesting you don't have like Apple
stores but there is a Samsung store
actually in LA we take the phone and get
it repaired almost same day so I did
that dropped it off on a Friday night
picked it up on Monday but it would have
been available later on that night I
tried calling Samsung and it gave me a
prepaid label to send the phone back and
we were taking a few days to get it done
so bear that in mind if you want to pick
up a Samsung device lives are one of
those stores it's really nice to have as
well and the repair cost came out to be
about 220 dollars after taxes so with a
tough tough pill to swallow
I'm not through sure how I stand on the
break ability durability and not going
to crack it of the Galaxy s8 and s8 plus
now I know I should put a case on it
with my own dumbass fault I'm still not
sure I'm going to pick case on it which
is also still my fault when I break it
again
maybe I'll get insurance plan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
