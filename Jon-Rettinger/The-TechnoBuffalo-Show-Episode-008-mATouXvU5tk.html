TechnoBuffalo show online your three
huster this week Shaun ani
editor-in-chief of TechnoBuffalo i'm
joined by executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody and executive editor
of gaming joey davidson so guys what uh
don't you dare oh why not let's bring
the 90s back wasn't that wasn't that
like his son Budweiser like the son of
CEO of the CEO Budweiser that everyone
hated and thought was a total mess came
up with that was up campaign really yeah
it was like a story about that man like
he was like the eternal partier frat guy
everyone wanted him out of the company
and then he was like I have an idea for
a marketing campaign and it made them
chameleons like mr. D's yeah yeah man I
would thought about that moving along oh
well anyway on this week's show we're
going to be discussing a couple
different things starting off with the
announcement this morning of the LG g3
press conference Todd want you discuss
what we're going to be seeing from LG
yeah so the press conference I guess is
happening on May 27th in New York London
in San Francisco than other parts of the
world too and I think what we'll see is
probably the g3 right like they LG
already confirm that it's coming during
the second quarter which it is right now
what we don't yet know is if it's gonna
launch that day like HTC did with the
HTC One m8 they launched it the day they
announced it or if it's going to come
later UQ two stretches till the other
cute so it could happen then to don't
like it when they announce stuff
following I I hate to throw us off yeah
do you like it when they launch stuff
like right after the announcement I mean
that seemed I think it's cool be good
because if you look back at like palm
and then HP sort of what killed webos I
think was that HP would announce these
devices and even i forget the president
the time he would say like oh we're
gonna get them out now sooner you know
right after we
they'll hit the market and of course
they never did so that was sort of one
of the big problems for something like
when they announce something they're
like here it is go buy it now though
it's like it's starting the hype train
and then boarding right away yeah
exactly first is like oh here it is and
then I think it kind of like I guess it
go to fold right like people can get
really excited but as a standout feature
and this is supposed to have a qHD
display which would be a standout
feature so in that case that could be
good people are talking about there
waiting and then I go buy it but I think
in a lot of cases when you announce a
phone early and then wait a couple
months people early and I don't really
care anymore or I mean you really coming
up to September you kind of get in
danger zone too because people are like
you start to hear iphone 6 rumors and
then yeah I think that's yeah you have
to stand out really yeah yeah so I think
it would be a good strategy of LG to
sell it right away but I've got a little
come soon if not that day you know by
the image here still and i think we're
still going off weeks so it sounds like
we're going to see a similar sort of
back side to what we saw on the g2 the
volume buttons and stuff and hopefully
like an edge-to-edge display looks kind
of cool and if it does have qhd it'll be
but you're probably well I guess one of
the sharpest on the market so so out
there as to why you'd need that but yeah
because I think that's sort of what
we're expecting from LG right now and
then and we can go into like Nexus 6
which we didn't report on in the home
page because I don't really know the
source but there's a rumor that the
nexus 6 is going to be based off of the
g3 that sort of follows there it kind of
counterpoints what we saw from the
information yesterday a website that
published information that says we're
going to move into android silver
devices and Google's going to move away
from the next yeah what was that and
that was a weird yeah it almost sounds
like if you think about nexus silver on
they're saying they're working with
manufacturers and actually we said
wireless carriers number four which was
interesting Google right now goes direct
to consumer on premium high-end devices
which today that sort of the google play
edition device
where you spend you know 650 blocks and
get the HTC One m8 or any of the other
phones versus the Nexus program where
you spend you know 350 you get a nexus 5
but sort of lower I don't want to say
lower quality but I think Google is
trying to say that they want these super
premium quality phone see it sounded to
me android silver drives home the idea
of metal I don't know why um and to go
after why I mean clearly but I don't
know with like for example you look at
the galaxy s5 there's no metal involved
and then I started thinking to myself
well does that mean this galaxy s5 is
prime the one that we keep hearing about
this metal version or something is maybe
an Android silver device I have no idea
yeah but there's a lot to think about
right now we're going g3 and then into
the Nexus either well we actually have a
question related to the g3 right now
from future game dev hey Todd what do
you think LG will have to do to make the
g3 you really take off and stand out
from the market um that's a good
question and LG we just saw that I'd
have to bring it up but IDC had a report
today they're behind now and have been
for a while but Samsung Apple huawei and
Lenovo on the global smartphone market
so they're really not shipping the
quantities that anyone else is there
Eloise behind huawei yeah on the global
scale I blame China for that right i
mean exactly so the smartphone market in
china start taking out so i would say
and actually will to stand out you know
they can do anything they can toss it a
quad HD display on this on the g3 and
stand out but for LG to stand out in
general it's really i think was it has
to push the L Series three phone so it
has out now a lot harder in markets like
China because if you look at where
Samsung success is coming from I'm
according to IDC it's in the low to mid
range smartphone market and that's sort
of where LG's putting its focus we
learned that whole world congress and
now the g3 really its flagship but i
think yeah well you can do anything on a
flagship and make it stand out that
doesn't mean you're gonna I thought I'd
Mabel some anecdotal here that would be
worth feet
off of but and I obviously I have the
less out of this phone call even I have
infinitely less phone knowledge than you
guys do but as a consumer with passing
interest in the market space and also
wanting to partake in it myself I
couldn't name currently an LG flagship
phone I could five years ago mm-hmm but
right now I couldn't and I could name a
motorola phone I could name a samsung
phone and an HTC phone and all that with
LG I couldn't and I think that that is a
problem yeah that is especially because
the the flag should out right now sort
of it's the g2 and it's still really
great phone these about amazing phone
and so it actually is kind of crazy that
they're replacing it already but I think
LG feels a need to now at the s5 and the
one that made her out right they want to
keep pushing the boundaries but I think
there's a misconception out there among
consumers and some smartphone fans that
a flagship makes the company because
that's not true at all I mean in the
case of Apple yes because they only
really I mean they push their flagship
model and kind of sell the lower and
wants to but when you look at successful
market leaders in the smartphone market
like Samsung and Kwame and what HTC is
trying to do an HTC is not even at LG's
level crime is trying to push really
compelling phones in every market
segments so low and low and mid-range
are really popular too right well we as
enthusiasts look at the G theorem like
you know if it flops we would say oh you
know LG is dead or something like that
that's not true you can't really I mean
so the g3 can do whatever it wants but I
think you know it should be a great
device that needs to be a great device
issue that LG still pushing the
boundaries i love my g2 there you go but
i still am not a fan of these buttons
yeah you never get on board with them
either what's on there I don't know that
that's the the buttons the volume and
the power on the back Joey oh why I feel
like I'd hit those all the time I do do
they they said they felt it was a more
natural way of holding your phone and
that's where your finger rests when
you're on the phone well yeah and that
means I hit those buttons all the time
when I'm talking yeah you don't want it
to be in the natural location you want
it to be in a location
you have to reach for and they said that
was market research to which I have a
hard time believing I mean yeah right
hold the phone like this right and I
want the volume right where my thumb is
I don't know yeah cuz I mean when I hold
the phone yet my finger my index finger
goes on the back here and that means I'm
right on top of the power and volume
buttons at all times now my middle
finger sister I'd on the volume rocker
actually lies yeah well that's the thing
my middle finger this show is getting
very weird your phone on today's episode
how to hold your phone this isn't the
apple vodka all your boy Oh 2 points the
time of it antennagate now I think the
g3 I mean the pictures we've seen you
know should they be real which I think
they are you know they're keeping the
buttons there they look a little bit the
lower profile so maybe they won't be as
easy to hit when you don't mean to so
Todd is it our sean is it a screen size
preference is that reason why that's
still your your your daily driver yeah
it is because I really really consider
going to the Moto X but I just I like
the screen size of the g2 yeah right
make sense yeah gorgeous job Owen mm-hmm
well i mean i do i also have a galaxy
mega 6.3 and i do use it but like when
I'm in England that was the greatest
phone ever for traveling because you
know I had the you know I I went bought
a local sim card so I had UK data and if
you're walking around the city you don't
know that screen size was awesome for
Google Maps yeah yeah sure yeah but I
don't carry this the 6.3 on a daily
basis even if you know I'm 6 foot 4 and
even for me I'm like this phone is way
too big Giants exactly it's it's the
phone designed specifically for
Shaquille O'Neal you know I saw speaking
of large
bones which which is crazy I saw my
sister on Easter and she was saying that
people look at her one m7 or like what
is that a tablet and I'm like this thing
you know I only got one a4 4.7 inch
display yeah the sevens knowing makati
yeah so that's crying you know you know
people are used to nerds yeah well Joey
you also had a whole lot of unexpected
news this week from Nintendo what's
going on over there which part man the
last few days they've just they've just
kind of like dropped a crapload of info
on us so monday was it monday or tuesday
i can't remember at this point to
history Tuesday was when the treehouse
was announced okay so nintendo announced
their e3 plans again they are skipping
the stage presentation in favor of live
streaming and this is awesome they are
holding their their first-ever nintendo
officially sponsored smash brothers
invitational tournament for the new game
which is sweet this is a company that
has a history of for better or worse
ostracizing the tournament community for
smash like they don't do things that
help the tournament community and now
with the new smash brothers they
announced the final destination stages
they announced the forgot our for glory
for fun modes and now they're saying
like a d3 the biggest week in the games
industry we are giving the best smash
brothers players in the world the
spotlight in the nokia theatre and like
live streaming the match that's awesome
they're also doing a thing where anyone
who wants to try smash brothers globally
and lives close to a best buy will be
able to go out and play the game for
themselves during e3 week so that's an
awesome idea it's really good i mean
they did it last year with the wii u as
well there were several games at the
kiosks this year they're just putting
smash on the kiosks i'm now that's all
that's been announced so far i I
wouldn't be terribly surprised if they
also put the zelda tech demo on those
kiosks as well we'll see what happens i
know that there's going to be a new
zelda announced at e3 it's just a matter
of what it is but it will be for wii u
so beyond that i mean people were really
pissed off the nintendo skipping the
stage presence
again and I'm personally not i don't i
think it's an exorbitant waste of money
for a company that really can't afford
to waste it and the way that mainstream
media covers III now has changed they
don't worry about the press conferences
they just put out one or two articles
recapping the stuff on the show floor
and that's it so nintendo will be there
for me there there's a two-fold reason
why i prefer them not to be on the stage
number one being yes it's got save them
a ton of money i don't see the point to
your hiring flo rida aisha taylor to
come in and you know wow you know and
i'm using air quotes there wow you guys
when you're saying there the second
thing is there's no way to write when
you're in that event no yeah i mean
they're you could you could I've done it
before it's awful although so you're
getting a couple years as coverage from
press when you have a stage show like
that doesn't help anyone yeah well last
year you know you tried you know working
from inside I think it was the Sony
presentation your wife I dropped out in
seconds yeah it's bad out there I was
there once yeah so Ron Eric and I were
covering remotely so yes we had a
presence in the theater for the sony
presentation but Ron Eric and I were
actually the ones doing all the coverage
from the live stream because you
couldn't connect to the internet at all
right right right even my even my 4g at
the time was totally blown up on itself
yeah I think you got like three texts it
through to me throughout the entire
presentation there Sean dying send help
it's crazy how companies do that these
days you know like yesterday I was at an
acer press conference and I walked in
about 20 minutes before it started no
seats left you know and like I'm just
sitting in the back like why didn't you
know there's no reason for me to be here
there's no purpose for this at all and I
think that's a salute lick and then
afterwards you know you mostly there for
the hands on stuff and afterwards they
even have hands on I mean most of the
new products that were cool weren't even
there here's how it went down last year
if you're curious for Nintendo and I
imagine will be the same thing and and
maybe this is why I'm not
the upset or disgruntled by the news the
press conference will be at the same
time as it always is 9 a.m. pacific time
tuesday that has been like rock solid
for the last 10 years so instead of
being a press conference on stage it'll
be a live stream video that nintendo
digital event they've added YouTube
that's good news no more you stream
which was such the silliest platform to
do this on was ustream YouTube's a
little bit better and more stable so
immediately after that I get on a bus I
go to the e3 convention center before
the show floor opens and I have two
hours with of hands-on time with
everything that it that they announced
and then every 15 minutes in between
demos they gather the press up around a
table the developers come out and talk
to us to like I own mother guy who
directed Zelda he's out there Miyamoto's
out there last year he was out there for
Pikmin 3 it's awesome and then I just go
about my business so we still have the
same hands on we still have the same
presentations and then this time they're
doing they're going the extra mile and
making it so that the fans can play the
games that they want to play that's
awesome yeah that's great I think this
is the more logical way to do it I mean
as you wrote in your editorial yesterday
Joey I mean especially when it gets to
the car games a what was it last year
the year before the guy that went on and
on about his love of cars oh that was
last year they got from forza 5 all
right he was gonna take the car out for
drinks afterwards right yeah her head
together I mean I get it cars are cool I
like cars too but like I don't I'm not
all I need to see you gush for 15
minutes over the rare McLaren on stage
like I don't care you know yeah i did it
i didn't moment i thought it was going
to become an adult's only show i
disturbing turn the lights down bring
out my candles oh shoot so do you come
here often there now and so I I have no
problem you know and they bring out your
these celebrities and all that I don't
care i'm i'm watching these e3 live
streams
were the games I'm watching them for the
demos I want to hear the news I want to
hear about the new ip's i want my gaming
information i don't want bad jokes from
Aisha Taylor or flo rida you know coming
out singing for just dance and so I
think Nintendo's handled this perfectly
I mean they're their shows are always
concise yeah they'll throw in a tiny bit
of humor but it's not anything ever over
the top and it just flows and you get
all your news and you're done yeah mmhmm
yeah I don't get it I I don't understand
why people are upset that they're not
going to be live on stage the game
informer ran an article yesterday kind
of like right after my article went up
actually I'm not just coincidence but
yeah um their stance on it was that you
don't get to hear the audience reactions
and you don't even you don't need a
laugh track to know whether or not
something is funny you know yeah exactly
I I don't need a guided if I like
something I'm gonna like something I'm
not gonna like I'm not gonna like it
doesn't matter what the audience is
doing right exactly so and to be
completely honest when Flo Rida was on
stage if you I was in the room for that
at UB sales presentation if you watch
the video like it turns to the audience
and everyone that isn't a Ubisoft
developer is just like sitting there
like god kill me I actually I saw a clip
of it again yesterday and when the girls
ran up to the front and they're like
trying to get everyone to clap all the
press is just say they're staring at him
cuz it's like why am I clout like I
don't I can't clap hey nice man dude
that's like when you're on the yesterday
when you're in a press conference with
all the employees and they're the ones
clapping you're like oh come on yeah
yeah that debt I don't know if you guys
know this the guys watching but nine
times out of ten the huge applause that
comes from those press conferences is
from employees yeah library used to be
famous for that all of what he's doing
orrible about that EA they have an
moving against da I'm just is just an
example they have EA wraps peppered in
through the crowd and they just like
everyone claps so that that raucous
cheering you're hearing isn't normally
coming from the press yeah yes look at
that photo oh my god meanwhile you
currently trying to take pictures right
notes yeah yeah I mean whenever I've
gone to like CES and I've been in you
know the press conferences I'd like I
see people clapping I'm like I'm
juggling a camera in writing a note and
I'm like I might stamp my foot once in a
while I'm sorry it uh uh Joey for from
future game dev will you be in the smash
brothers tournament Joey yeah I'm not
one of those 16 players no I'm certainly
i'm sure i will play the game over the
weekend or the week but definitely not
in that tournament scope ya know I as
much as i admire Joey's gaming prowess I
I don't see him being one of the 16 that
smash rather Invitational now you know
well we have a third topic for this week
and it's a little out of our normal area
there's tons of questions about it
already noticed that that's why I'm go
ahead and moving us over there so the
big news in the geek world yesterday was
the announcement of the Star Wars
Episode 7 cast and Joey who is very fond
of constantly telling me what the giant
nerd I am dude don't shun this is it
today this is my coaster on my desk well
I I always know you say very lovingly I
know it's never out of being any sort of
bowling or meanness Oh is laying hey so
yes the Star Wars Episode 7 cast was
announced I I will admit this I tweeted
it out so I can admit here I got a
little choked up seeing the picture yeah
that was my childhood coming back
you know that saying you know Harrison
Ford and Carrie Fisher even Peter Mayhew
and Anthony Daniels and Mark Hamill all
sitting there and the fact that I know
I'm going to get another story in this
universe even though the prequel sucked
even though I know I should at this
point going I don't trust you I still
was just unbelievably stoked I uh it was
surreal it was it was it was completely
surreal yeah I mean Sean you you
probably heard me the other night
gushing with my buddy Mike about it just
just you know it's Star Wars played a
huge role growing up for me I'm sure for
you guys too so seeing that was crazy
crazy well you have to remember and I
saw it I didn't see it until September
of 1977 so I was already 6 and the
reason i did not see it until September
was because the lines oh yeah remember
at this time theaters were one screen it
was September 77 we got to the theater
at 6pm we didn't get in till the
midnight showing whoa right yeah now and
September in Phoenix sitting outside for
six hours is awesome why did you use
down yeah yeah toilet I just helped now
here's here's the funny part Todd I
still to this day have no clue how my
uncle did it I had a pirated copy on
beta by Christmas Wow nice about what's
funny is it because beta tapes were a
certain length it was split on 22 tapes
so the scene where obi-wan feels the the
disturbance in the force in Luke talks
to him that's where I had to switch
tapes so even to this day I'm like is it
time for a bathroom break this way oh my
gosh that's where I would swap the tapes
out I yeah it was a huge part of my
childhood now Todd I know before the
show you were saying you didn't have a
whole lot to say about Star Wars I
watched as a kid like with my father
who's a big star Wars fan but I don't
know like I guess I didn't watch it as
much as some
people i stopped counting how many times
I saw a new hope at four hundred eighty
five times whoa a little bit more than
me yeah and that was when it was still
just me watching the pirated tape yeah I
I just finally one day stopped counting
I was like oh yeah I don't know
somewhere over 500 now and yeah I it for
me it was life-changing it was you have
to remember in 1977 there was nothing
nothing that it looked like this and you
know I can remember walking out of the
theater just my mind exploding and yeah
you know I i I'm sorry for the kids
today because they'll never have that
experience because there's so many
amazing looking films now but you know
for those of us that have been around
and grew up with this still the idea
that we're finally going to see what
happened after Return of the Jedi is
just mind-boggling yeah yeah the funny
thing is though last night my mother
asked me she part of the reason she felt
I was disappointed with the prequels was
because I had 16 years to think about
what happened in those three of films
and she goes the same thing is going to
happen to you with seven eight and nine
I said actually no I never really gave a
whole lot of thought to the seven eight
nine it was one through three that I
always thought about well your brain
naturally I mean six could have been the
end of the story period your brain
absolutely naturally decides that one
two and three needs to happen yeah yeah
I I think what's what's interesting
about Star Wars for a lot of people is
that the end and someone asked I've
sashing Bohol's such in bohol City Hall
ah asked on the side something about the
which one being our favorites and stuff
and I know that it fluctuates it goes
all over the place but what's
interesting about Star Wars to me is
that that amongst most Star Wars fans
and I'm not counting kids today kids
today
uh the prequels are like universally
hated it's different layers of disgust
and different levels but most people
hate them and I I don't think JJ Abrams
is the most talented creator in the
world but I do think he has the ability
to return Star Wars 2 it's simple
popcorn flick status that's all it was I
mean people who try to elevate it to
something more crazy it wasn't anything
more than just a summer blockbuster with
really pure and simple characters and
then the prequels came in george lucas i
think was drinking his own kool-aid oh
yeah and just decided to go balls out
like this is this is going to be amazing
this is going to be amazing amazing
faster more intense Yeah right up I just
I just I don't see I don't know yes
which ones are favorite film I Sean why
don't you start that I you know I I know
everyone says empire strikes back
because it was actually the strongest
writing of the series but it for me it's
episode for a new hope simply because
that was what introduced me to this
universe and these characters and set my
imagination on fire right if you go back
to episode 4 and that that's such a
simple line about you fought with my
father in the Clone Wars my brain
exploded at train fare out what the
clone wars were yeah I obsessed about
that as a six-year-old you know and so
yeah I episode 4 is my favorite simply
because of what it set me down a life
path essentially Todd you now you say
you know you haven't you you're not as I
do you don't even know like I honestly
don't even good I've watched them but I
could I don't think I could like walk by
a TV like that's this one Wow yeah III
don't know if I've ever met anyone well
no Drive no no
are people that were like oh yeah I've
seen him yeah like yatra media was just
sort of like like I said my dad would
watch him growing up and I watch him
with him so I seen them all for sure I
just like that's sort of where it
stopped watch them again all right guys
but I'm still catching up on the wire at
the wire first yr to express it in we've
got a question from future game Deb
about not knowing anything that's in the
books I is there anything the writers
are following or are they writing this
from scratch they actually are following
Lucas had written 20 page treatments for
seven eight nine and they're working
from those treatments and what a
treatment is basically just an outline
it's not a full script so it says you
know it's like the story beat CEO this
is going to happen then that will lead
to this and this will set this up and so
on so forth and Lucas is consulting but
he is not writing he's not directing
both of factors which I'm thrilled for
yes so so they are working from George
Lucas's original notes but they are not
working from any of the Expanded
Universe novels which I'm also thankful
for because a lot of those were really
bad some of them are real good too there
there were some that were good but the
majority work yeah but the yeah I'm
there working from that and yeah I ice
also here in a question I'm not sure
where went here there was one about a
are they going to introduced Jaina solo
and that was from viola minium I guess I
think I saw yeah thatthat's it's
technically no but we're not sure what
Daisy Ridley is playing and from her
placement in the cast photo sitting in
between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher
the assumption is that she is Han and
Leia's daughter but that does not
necessarily mean she's Gina from the
novel I would love it if she was on and
lay his daughter and she was the main
character I've talked about this before
already but that would be amazing
ya know I I think she is definitely
there kid but we just simply don't know
to what level she's playing in the movie
but I'm all for her being the main
character I have no problems with that
yeah it'd be sweet none yeah bring it on
you know and that's the thing I mean
there was a lot of talk yesterday about
the diversity of the cast and all that
and Joey you and I talked about this
offline and I agree with you a hundred
and ten percent we can't judge anything
yet we don't know what's happening yeah
i mean it is it i will admit that it is
troubling to see only two females in the
cast and one black guy that's
problematic but the rest of the cast has
not been revealed and we don't know what
roles these people play yeah just seeing
it just seeing a billing list doesn't
mean anything no you know it doesn't
even tell you it we have no Harrison
Ford could be in the movie for ten
seconds he could be like Steven Segal an
executive decision yeah para gone first
five minutes yeah exactly exactly yeah
it's we have absolutely no concept of
what's happening we don't know to what
degree the original cast is going to be
in although the fact that Peter may
who's there kind of makes me think it's
gonna be more than 10 seconds I mean to
bring Chewie back for yo and chewy walks
through the scene but out it's gonna be
interesting i I'm excited I you know I
will more likely walk out of the theater
and go oh it could have been so much
more rats yeah it's still it's part of
the Star Wars saga and that means I
automatically will watch it yeah we got
a year and a half so yeah I know now I
just got to try to find a way to be an
extra yeah I told you I tried Parling
that painting that one dime into an
extra roll it yo now darn it Lucas isn't
in charge so I can't you know use that
as a bargaining chip now but darn it so
we're going to open it up to questions
to the floor here as we usually do at
the end of the show we've got a
bunch coming in here let's take a look
here hey Todd from Sasha Mahal what are
your thoughts on the Samsung Galaxy K
zoom you've actually gotten to play with
a little bit was it it's cool samsung
was really specific to say like this is
not the galaxy s5 zoom they're trying to
break away from the mentality of the
sort of the galaxy s4 zoom was a galaxy
s4 product so what they're saying is
this is basically a phone first with the
gray camera and I think it lives up to
that name from my 10 to 15 minutes with
the phone it's cool it's not sort of a
powerhouse like the galaxy s5 you make
sacrifices in the way of the screen and
stuff like that it's also still pretty
bulky and and yes I saw some comments on
the YouTube video from our hands on
every time you're going to take a
picture the whole lens pops out and
everything so it's a big device and sort
of in my opinion more of a camera than a
phone versus what Samsung saying but
it's cool no plans for the US and it
should be launching elsewhere soon
though a question here from techno geek
which is actually something I forgot to
talk to you about Joey and I mentor
superior thoughts Oh guys love the show
and the site and over the weekend I hear
that the Atari et games are found what
are your guys reaction Joey how did you
feel about them finding the ETS I mean
it was inevitable right like it's
something that a lot of companies do
getting rid of waste is what most
corporations have to worry about on a
day-to-day basis I think it's awesome I
think it was great that they're in such
pristine condition relatively speaking
but now I wasn't surprised not really at
all I I wasn't surprised either it just
it was kind of gratifying to have the
urban legend finally confirmed yeah i
mean i buy it I totally bought that it
happened I knew I was just convinced
that they were actually buried out in
the desert desert get all companies get
rid of stuff there was the in the
forties when universal and the other
film companies they used to burn
movies not just because they didn't have
the storage space to keep them and they
weren't going anywhere so they just burn
them companies do weird stuff with it
wasn't entombed in cement I don't even
know I've not heard if it did have the
cement layer on the top of the from what
I've heard though the Atari manager that
was on site said that yes they did put a
cement cap on it and it was simply
because they knew kids were sneaking
into the garbage dump to get the games
when they were first dumped yeah hmm so
I don't know I saw it there were some
people that were like this has to be
fake there's no way they could have
survived in this condition if they were
at the bottom of a pile yeah it's
totally possible in the desert in an
arid climate underground they'd be fine
yeah well it's just like why the
airplane graveyard is out in Arizona
because the planes are kept in great
condition due to the climate mm-hmm no
so it's no different with the video game
not the one cell to sonya's
davis-monthan air force yeah yep and
that's good oh it's I I've driven past
I've never been in it but yeah it's
amazing just lines and lines and lines
of yeah it's not but yeah it was
interesting to see it finally happening
and looking forward to the the
documentary and the shock of the worst
video game ever designed which is a
matter of opinion yeah it's not there
it's up there but I've played some
pretty pretty sucky ones as well from
rockster 103 do you think wearable
devices might be more successful in the
future Todd what do you think yeah I
think so i think right now we're in like
the very start of seeing what they can
do and I think that's because the chips
inside the processors and stuff are just
now taking off um I can measure steps
although not accurately which is really
annoying like if you see you up
Brandon's here fit review he talks about
how the inaccurate was and neither
galaxy whatever s5 and the one I made
you can like when you install the apps
you can just shake them and get the get
the footsteps so
they need to fix the inaccuracies to
make them really useful and in case you
that's in case of fitness right and I
think for alerts and stuff yeah I mean
look at what couples do it done a
fantastic job and I hope that anyone
building devices in Android wear it sort
of usually using that as a model for
moving forward yeah I that is a prior
just shaking I mean they have to be more
accurate you can't just sit there and yo
look I'm making I'm walking steps i'm
walking steps yeah exactly sounds that
that son Brandon was saying the
discrepancies were like thousands of
feet a day I mean what's the point if
you really are you walking miles or
you're not walking miles and if you're
not then that it's useless right it
tells you the wrong calories burned and
everything so but I think that's what
people are attracted to write the
fitness idea i think is what for is what
attracts me to wearables I like the
pebble but I don't like all the constant
notifications I'm more attracted to just
learning about myself question from
rahul / top cadet Chompy ani are you
wearing the pebble smartwatch yes I am
how is it I love it it's I I honestly I
mean I love it it makes my life easier
is it something that I think everyone
needs to run out by now I I enjoy it's
nice you know to especially like when
you're driving at that this is somewhat
horrible while you're driving yo if I
get an alert you know if i get a text i
can just go like that real quick and see
the name of the person and then I know
if I need to pull over which I do pull
over if I need to text but that way I
never have to pick up my phone or
anything deal so that's nice but yeah I
enjoy it but it's not anything that I
think the mass consumer needs as of yet
a couple generations from now I think
it's going to be a lot better I see at
first I loved getting those
notifications and stuff and then they
started driving me nuts sort of like
blackberry back in the day you know like
it's just constantly buzzing here like
leave me alone I took it off and I think
that's sort of my issue with wearables
like I don't want them they're not
intrusive in terms of their form but
they can be intrusive in terms of their
feature set that gets annoying from
Sasha Mahal is a traditional for
technical buffalo staff to wear a hat
during google hangout yes sure there no
they're episodes of me not wearing a hat
I don't yeah yeah there are there
episodes of and here by may or so I'll
stop wearing those I don't have warm
weather which will make John extremely
happy as he hates the set why I don't
know he absolutely despises this hat and
thatthat's just you know the way it is
it's my favorite head and I word a lot
future game dev wants to know how the
Hermit is living behind my sheet I
forgot to feed him last week so we'll
see you still there let's go my coffee
let's see here what else do we have some
of these we've already covered a little
bit guys last I was just flipping
through someone asked about the macbook
air what did ya thank you like at yeah
I'll find the question while we're here
it is from rockster 103 what are your
thoughts on the new macbook air oh the
price I mean 899 that's awesome I think
people have been looking for apple to
enter that price target for a long time
and me 99 for macbook air is a great
deal I mean you're getting 11 inch
screen so it's like the lowest and only
128 gigabytes of hard drive right and
that's what i have right so you think
about the macbook air that version of
the macbook air at least as a more
casual consumer might think of it i know
my wife right now is really on the
market for a new computer she's been
weighing a Chromebook but she's always
had apple stuff that might be attractive
to her right and she could give a rat's
about 128 gigabytes of storage space its
basis by our internet book sweden france
the book machine what what do you think
though Joey will she think about the
screen only being 11.6 inches she will
not care really she does not care my
wife does not care about anything she's
like a two hours of battery life that's
what bothers me I have a 2012 model and
it's got about two hours of battery life
she does not my wife died I think a lot
of consumers don't care as long as the
price points in their wheelhouse their
golden for me for you Todd Sean we
probably look at that thing and go not
enough yeah but it's not for us you know
it's it's the budget line app it's that
it's the iphone 5c of MacBook Airs yeah
and I think Apple Apple could use one
and it's very it's ridiculous that all
of their laptops even even that laptop
is cheaper than my gaming PC yes that's
silly the fact that i can go build a
top-of-the-line gaming pc for less money
than their cheapest macbook is why Syria
saying you're seeing the other way ya
know I I think though it's great that
they're finally again you know the the
plastic macbooks have been gone for a
while but you know finally we have a
macbook again that is under a thousand
dollars truly under a thousand dollars
you know it's been a long time since
we've seen that and yeah for your
average consumer I just the screen size
really more than the hard drive space
the screen size is why I'm like it's
only eleven point six inches yeah that's
kind of hard did you work on at least
for me 13s is where on that you gotta
remember that that this is the same
marketplace that actually was excited
about the netbook you know and and
that's really a silent in netbook sure
I'm not knocking in that book I'm just
saying that I don't think screen size
matters as much to to normal people as
it does to us like it they just don't
care the normies admit will use a 17
inch pro right yeah I have a sub
advantage but I couldn't even deal with
that man 3904 travel and stuff I can't
see it it's too big yeah well I and look
I got it right as
were about to announce that the 17 was
dead I didn't realize it when i bought
it and so i'm glad i got in under the
wire and i'm going to use that thing
until it's on its last absolute breath i
mean yeah that's where I am with my 13
inches it's a mid-2010 and still whoa
yeah dude i upgraded the the ram 28 gigs
once and haven't touched it since wow
i'm on a 2012 arrogance on its way out
oh no man i take care of this this
thing's been all over I guess not enough
yes it's best oh its center Oh Santa see
Apple back in this market vo this price
range so it's going to be interesting to
see what it does I think that now Joey
here's a question if your wife is just
concerned about the 0 facebook machine
or whatever would she be better off with
the tablet no my wife likes my life
likes a keyboard and and all that stuff
why has a tablet you know but she
doesn't she uses your tablet for work
stuff and for reading and games that's
like all she does on it and it's also
our toddler distraction device enlarged
but like the g she likes having a laptop
and I don't blame her do it is a lot
harder to be productive on a tablet than
it is on a macbook no I totally agree
but i'm just i'm curious to see you know
as we get further down the road if we
really are going to start to see tablets
cannibalized that casual market of
people that are only interested in email
and social i think they already have I
think that's why people are calling the
pc market day well that's just the pc
market is not as we know just to clarify
the pc market isn't dead it's just
shifting exactly yeah especially for you
when you define it as personal computer
i mean then he order the smartphone
that's right my buddy dave has totally
kicked his pc to the curb and he just
has that he just has a phone he has a
galaxy s4 and that's it no he's living
the dream so what does he know some
people dream of you
cord-cutting he he went way over the
book oh no but he does have cable and
running water right and running right
cut that one yet that'll be a foam
blocks at on yeah picking up foam blocks
we have a well do one more question here
and then we'll we'll be at the end of
the show for today from rope row top Deb
what are your thoughts on ghouls project
ara and foam blocks we've covered this
in previous episodes yeah I'm so first
right so go back and find that episode
first cuz that we had a whole episode on
it yeah I talked about yeah I'm still
excited yeah me too and no development
since our last episode so mad I almonds
still excited nothing to account I'm
hoping you will hear some more at Google
i/o so I hope it doesn't it I hope it
doesn't turn into like their google wave
or even their cars program it's just
becomes like vaporware remember google
wave yeah plus is pretty much on its way
out it seems like right the guy who
created google+ is gone but still no
there's talk that they're gonna replace
like their Universal login with just
Google log instead of google plus and I
don't know it's 480 depart the thing
that stinks is like photos inside
Google+ is amazing it's really cool dude
I don't know if you guys I did not know
this existed i just have a quick
anecdote over the weekend my son who is
two and a half going on three was at a
birthday party with another
two-and-a-half going on three year old
they're like best friends they do
everything together in daycare um
they're like there's just this moment
when erickson the other kid is getting
ready to get his cake and I'm trying to
get a picture of both of them and I
don't know if you've ever try to take
pictures of two-year-olds it's like
herding cats why can't i gotta can
really like say cheese one of them says
cheese one of them is like completely
oblivious XO i took like five pictures
in a row just like trying to get them
both a smile at once and it didn't
happen auto-awesome whatever nighttime
happens crash out wake up in the morning
I'm checking my computer and he'll pop
up from google that's just like hey your
smile photo is ready so Google took all
those pictures found the one like ones
where they both had good smiles and then
merge them into one picture yeah auto
awesome it's really cool dude that's why
it does it makes like panoramas for you
to like you did notices that you think
the only thing Todd that it's ever done
before for me is it detected that I was
taking a picture in snow and it added a
stupid Oh flakes gif that's terrible I
was like this is not auto awesome this
is Otto awful yeah that's awesome awful
but it does really some awesome stuff ah
the smile thing man I was like this is
the creepiest and greatest thing that
Google's ever done that is pretty darn
cool that it was able to merge them like
that alright well that brings episode 8
