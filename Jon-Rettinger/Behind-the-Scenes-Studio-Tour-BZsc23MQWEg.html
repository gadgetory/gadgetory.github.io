TechnoBuffalo here we did our office
tour I gave you a tour of our studio
that was at the time totally incomplete
our sets weren't built it wasn't dressed
it is now all done wanted to show you
guys what we shoot with I'll talk about
all of our equipment also show you it
looks like behind the studio door and
also I got this thing on my head
it's a co pro hero4 we're gonna try and
do some POV style shots for this video
so that's that's what this thing is
come on I'm alright so this is our
studio we got soundproofing in here and
on the outside so we don't really bother
anybody so come on in
we've got a few sets here I'll set up
I'll talk about the sets first then show
you some of our equipment we just
upgraded all of our equipment so the set
that you used to see quite a bit is
right here this is sort of a wood wall
actually our managing editor roy troy
bilt he cut each one of these pieces
diet and stained them and glued them up
here we've mounted some fly board behind
it or some plywood rather behind it to
give it something we could hook it on to
it just creates kind of a cool effect
they're all different sizes and we've
got some lighting down below we'll sort
of light it light it up to create that
sort of shadow effect that you see the
table that we're standing at we're not
fitting we use this it is an up desk the
standing desk so actually can adjust the
height up and down makes it a lot easier
for different sized people and that kind
of stuff so this is set number one the
other set you might see is behind us
also done by our handyman
Roy Choi this is essentially just little
cardboard squares that we mounted on the
wall our initial idea is that we have
serve colored LEDs below to serve items
different color but it never looks the
way we planned it looking so we just
sort of use it as a white wall user for
Bureau and sometimes I will shoot in
front of it so you can see it's actually
pretty big but to the left of it we've
got a bit of open white space think
about maybe using that for a green
screen set perhaps down the road when we
shoot our B roll and sometimes for
unboxings you'll see that we're at sort
of a dark wood table that's this and you
can see we got sort of stuff set up the
sort of juxtapose the dark color with
some bright colors that we set up a lot
of people have asked about this guy this
little glowy cube I think we just bought
it from Amazon
the clothes doesn't look much in real
life but on video looks really cool the
colors are pretty vibrant but not so in
real life when you're shooting b-roll of
phones and sup with you as a stand makes
a lot easier than me holding with a
shaky hand some of the pictures we've
got a lot of Star Wars stuff we've got a
blue Yeti here this ridiculously
complicated Rubik's Cube an old video
camera and just some colored notebooks
and stuff to create sort of an effect
and then have a cool white and black
chair that actually we took from our
kitchen to use gigantic kind of just
juxtapose the colors we thought pretty
nicely this is the set that we use the
most and I like it because it's most
relaxed set that we have just a simple
couch with the obligatory I'm going to
stab myself in the butt when I sit down
a knife on it
a simple couch we went and bought some
stuff that kind of added some color and
pop to the side of it so that's where
that white ball is with a black fake
plant and that little blue table came
from we dressed a shelf behind it we've
had some stuff from the office we want
to use again for bright colors we got a
giant Android guy of an older camera
we've got the now-defunct Nexus Q Goku
and an old service developed camera that
is not Polaroid we're gonna put a
picture up behind the lamp too to create
a little bit more color and just Andrew
couch lot people have asked if this is
actually my my home which is not we want
to create more kind of like a homey
feeling more relaxed settings what
you're talking about tech don't you take
it duh you know all that seriously so
that's all I get a couch and also I just
like to sit down so what we are filling
with or what Ron is filming with right
there is the sony fs7
it's our new 4k camera we haven't
uploaded 4k yet if you notice we'll do
some sort of quick zoom in shot that's
actually using 4k dextra resolution
that's in there
we'll start uploading some videos though
actually in 4k resolution for tripods
you've got a Manfrotto 504 HD makes life
a lot easier got some quick release on
it this is usually what we do for for
static shot what we've got here for our
b cam is one of the new sony a7s is
we've got all Sony this time around
we're all Canon before this is a sweet
little camera that can do for k-chat
external recorder and for external we
are using the Adam
Sjogren's which has been absolutely
awesome and we've got it all in a cage
what it's sitting on those two my
favorite tech here this is a simple
edelkrone slider with some really neat
modules on it so a slider if you don't
know we just use it for panning shots
what a lot of her panning shots are used
but when doing it by hand you don't
always have that constant speed so these
two modules of do some really cool stuff
let me show what they do we've got two
modules on the edelkrone the action
module and the target module both are
using a simple canon batteries so the
extra let me show you what it does so
you pop in to Canon batteries we can do
some settings for speed go ahead and
turn the sucker on and as you as I hold
this down or set it to go on its own you
can see it starts to do sliding at a
consistent speed so we can really keep
it our shots looking consistent we can
just the speeds and get some slow ones
or fast ones depending on what we want
this guy is also kind of cool it's tough
to show on camera though what it's going
to do it's going to turn the camera as
it starts to pan to keep whatever you're
shooting in focus area creates a really
cool effect and these both go on the
side of the edelkrone
so when you see any of our sort of panic
shots that's what we're using we've got
a table here we put all of our charging
stuff I teleprompter setups pretty
simple it just has sort of a mirror and
a dock for the iPad and that's about it
and one iPad controls the scrolling the
other one just shows what we're talking
about we've got a clock down here
because sometimes I can talk and talk
and talk to talk this sort of keeps me
on track and then just for storage the
rest of our lenses and stuff inside of
this case so if you guys enjoyed this
sort of updated studio set as we do more
stuff I'll be sure to share it it's kind
of cool to be able to show what we're
doing we've been working on
you might not know if this took a long
time to set up the tide to pick the
color blues we want to pick the color
grey white wall to create sort of
different effects sets I'm really proud
of the studio and sometimes Katyn
believe that we even have studio and go
back when I was just filming in my
one-bedroom apartment with my messy bed
in the background I just makes me happy
the seeds or the growth that we've had
thank you guys for watching the videos I
hope you enjoyed if you want to see more
check the Buffalo videos you want to see
more behind the scenes stuff good video
a thumbs up it'll let us know that you
do this kind of stuff and of course the
big subscribe button to the latest
technical buffalo videos
until next time and take my POV cam go
back to work you stop the video just
real fast to thank our friends and good
peeps at Lenovo you guys thought yoga
was just about cat Crowe and dog poses
you my friends are terribly mistaken let
me tell you bout the yoga tablet 2 pro
so this thing's got a built-in projector
it actually can put up to a 50 inch
image on any wall or screen essentially
just mobilizing your home theater it's
rocking a 13.3 inch 2560 by 1440 pixels
ploy front-facing stereo Dolby surround
sound speaker and powered by Intel's
latest atom processors this thing is
absolutely perfect for work and play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
