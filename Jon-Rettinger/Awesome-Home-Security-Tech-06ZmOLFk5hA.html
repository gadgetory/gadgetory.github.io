almost everything that we had was stolen
all of our computers were taken all of
our phones were taken
we had nothing to run the business with
we had up like a little webcam didn't
have any sort of dvr cloud recording on
it when I came to the office that
morning the camera which is unplugged
and on the floor so doing what we do
with this kind of technology security is
important and i feel like i fear monger
too much but like it's a skin medley a
scary world
so whatever I can do to protect my
business I want to do the way they got
in the way the robber got in there just
to open the door essentially with the
screwdriver it was very frightening and
maybe want to evaluate security a little
bit more so a few years ago we did a
video on the Ring Video Doorbell
essentially what that is is it lets you
see who's at your front door
even if you are not there a lot of
robberies occur so I'm gonna ring the
doorbell and see if nobody comes to the
door if no one's there then that was
probably empty and they can kind of go
in and potentially steal your stuff
the reason i liked Ring was in our
office anybody here who has the app can
not only answer the phone
but can use for a two-way communication
to talk to the person they're like UPS
gotta go okay we'll be right there
somebody we don't know they will be able
to see them talk to them decay
you are good or not good I also like the
camera record the clouds the motion
detection so somebody walks by it maybe
looks fishy or keeps walking by and
casing the joint like we've had happen
seeing as my business and my livelihood
depended on security keep everything
here
I want to take a look at it the folks at Ring
now something new it's called the Ring
Stick Up Cam and design is going to
look pretty familiar and the name kinda
says it all it's a stick-up can think of
it as like the Video Doorbell without
the physical doorbell button on it you
can put this guy pretty much anywhere
you want it's an outdoor Wi-Fi security
camera and got that same two way audio
and motion detection and the clouds HD
video recording and my favorite feature
night vision you can catch some raccoon
doing some crazy stuff
so setting this thing up it's pretty much
just plug and play it's going to cost a
hundred nitety nine dollars if you're
interested in setting up
it's really easy it also could have a
five thousand two hundred mAh
rechargeable battery because this camera
is meant to go outside you might have
easy access to power they got a Solar
Panel for you
if live view is your then Stick Up Cam has you covered so you can chat
and talk with your delivery guy and tell
him to leave your package
you're busy the Ring Doorbell got a
pretty identifiable trying to it but if
you live in a big house you got a big
office they sell a little accessory
called the Chime you plug it into the
wall outlet and you'll get the ring so
you'll know that somebody's got your
door if you don't have your smartphone
with you so you're covered
and no matter where you're at so for me
the combination of security actually
having a doorbell to keep our office
locked here was really important
there are a lot of reasons to to want
something like this and why don't you
guys usually the comments down below in
video a thumbs up you always appreciate
until
the next time jon rettinger from
technobuffalo .talk to you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
