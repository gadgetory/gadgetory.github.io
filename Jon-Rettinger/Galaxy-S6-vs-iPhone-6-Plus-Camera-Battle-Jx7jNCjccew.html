to you by harry's what's going on guys
Markham's hanging from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's video we'll be comparing the
cameras on these two flagship devices
the iphone 6 plus and the galaxy s6
we'll be comparing photo quality video
quality and talking a bit about the
software and ultimately see which one
has the better camera cameras on
smartphones get better and better each
year on paper the galaxy s6 seems to be
the far superior device here with a 16
megapixel shooter in the back with oh is
and an F 1.9 aperture it also features a
5 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens in the
front with the same f 1.9 aperture the
iPhone 6 plus on the other hand features
an 8 megapixel sensor with oh is N and F
2.2 aperture now a front it has a 1.2
megapixel shooter with an F 2.2 aperture
we took a number of photos indoors and
outdoors to get the best idea on how
they perform in different situations
taking a look at the outside shots first
the photos we were getting from both the
S 6 and iPhone 6 plus were great photos
are detailed and properly exposed but I
notice that the shots we were getting on
the 6 plus looked a bit faded compared
to the s sixes more saturated in
contrast the images the dynamic range on
the s6 is far better - there are more
details in the shadows and the colors
aren't as dull as the iPhone 6 plus now
talking about indoor shots I thought
both phones did really well in terms of
image quality however I did notice that
the galaxy s6 tends to shoot on the
warmer side of things the white balance
on the s6 can sometimes be a bit of a
hassle when shooting by a white wall or
at a table now with the iPhone 6 plus
we've never really had that problem
before the white balance was always on
point and we've never had to worry about
correcting it in post talking about
low-light shots next both are equipped
with oh is to prevent you from taking
blurry shots
now since the s6 has a larger aperture
at F 1.9 the photos we were getting were
definitely brighter not necessarily
better but just brighter
there's noticeable grain and noise
throughout the photos from both phones
and certain shots the iPhone 6 plus
seemed better but the s6 wasn't far
behind now talking about the front
facing cameras next the iPhones 1.2
megapixel camera is surprisingly good
despite the low megapixel count images
aren't over processed to me and they
look good that is until I played with
the s6 is front facing care
as an ultra wide-angle lens and an F 1.9
aperture and a 5 megapixel sensor like
the iPhone 6 plus shots were an over
processed but on top of that you can
still apply random effects and filters
just like how you would using the rear
camera having that ultra wide-angle lens
really helps a ton when taking a group
picture and it's also nice to have that
ability to crop in thanks to that bigger
5 megapixel sensor so overall in terms
of image quality as much as I love how
the iPhone process is an image and how
it handles white balance
I'll take Samsung's much better hardware
and software over the iPhones camera any
day the shots we were getting are far
more detailed and I can crop in on a
picture and the front-facing camera
features a wide-angle lens that just
looks incredible now moving on to video
quality most of the newer Android
flagships have been shooting 4k videos
for quite some time now and Apple hasn't
really joined in on the fun yet however
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus does shoot in a
very smooth 240 frames per second 720p
video now this is probably my favorite
feature on iPhone 6 plus
now I rarely shoot videos on my phones
but when I do I love shooting them in
slow-mo the galaxy s6 has a slow-motion
feature too although Samsung hasn't
disclosed the frames per second on the
s6 to me it looks like it's shooting at
120 frames per second it may not be a
smooth nor as good-looking as the iPhone
6 plus a slow motion video but I applaud
Samsung for trying just like the iPhone
6 plus you can choose where you want the
video to slow down which is something I
really enjoyed on iOS and I'm glad
Samsung put that on here as well so
going back to 4k videos the s6 can shoot
in 4k whereas the iPhone six-plus can
only shoot in 1080p now I'm not sure why
Apple hasn't gone 4k yet when other
flagships have had it for a while for me
having that extra resolution is great I
can crop in I can reposition the clip
and stabilize it while down scaling it
to a 1080p video so in terms of video
capabilities and quality the galaxy s6
wins now with all that 4k detail in mind
you're going to want to make sure your
face is looking sharp lucky for you our
friends at Harry's are here to help
shaving yo face can be pretty expensive
nowadays especially if you want to buy
top-notch razors at the stores well this
is where Harry's comes in they care
about the shaving experience so much
that they bought a German blade factory
to build some of the world's highest
quality blades their starter kit starts
at just 15 dollars and adding
whose eraser three blades and your

Shaving for just $10 use the coupon code
TechnoBuffalo to save five dollars off
your first purchase at Harry's com so in
terms of software and performance
samsung redesigned to you why on the
galaxy s6 and made it simpler much
faster and more efficient there's less
bloatware and settings to toggle on and
off and overall it's really simple very
much like the iPhone unfortunately on
the iPhone 6 plus you can't really do
much in terms of tweaking the camera
unlike the s6
what-you-see-is-what-you-get basically
there's an exposure slider that'll pop
up when you tap to focus and you can
then adjust how bright or how dark your
photos will be there are also a few
filters you can choose from to make your
photos pop but nothing too drastic here
on the galaxy s6 on the other hand
there's a few different shooting modes
that will let you refocus an image take
full control of the focus ISO and white
balance and there's also different
filters on here that you can apply in
real time just like on the iPhone 6 plus
there's also a new feature on the s6
it'll track your subject and keep them
in focus automatically in terms of
camera performance the galaxy s6 is
definitely much faster from launching
the camera to taking pictures it's super
quick and will launch the camera by
pressing the home button twice in about
0.7 seconds which is crazy though the
iPhone 6 plus isn't far behind it's
still relatively fast and taking
pictures is good enough to capture the
right shots at the right moment Samsung
has done a really good job enhancing to
user experience and quality of their
cameras over the past few years and I
think it's really hard to beat what
Samsung's doing now Apple on the other
hand hasn't done much over the last few
years in terms of hardware and software
but I'm hoping that will change in the
future you do have the ability to
download third-party apps on iOS that'll
allow you to take full control of the
ISO focus and white balance but I think
Apple still needs to enhance its
hardware and software to step up its
camera game if it wants to compete with
Samsung I know I've been harsh with
Samsung in the past with a software and
camera hardware but Samsung did a
complete overhaul to turn things around
it's the best camera phone of use it's
fast it's sharp and I can't wait to see
what else Samsung has in store for us in
the future if you guys want to see a
full gallery comparison between the
galaxy s6 and the eye
