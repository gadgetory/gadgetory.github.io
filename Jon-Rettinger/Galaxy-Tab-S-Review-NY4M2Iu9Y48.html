to you by go daddy what's going on guys
i'm m√§rklin sanger from TechnoBuffalo
and today i have these two beautiful
devices from Samsung the Galaxy Tab s
they're both equipped with beautiful
screens but is that enough to put down
your Nexus 7 that's what we're here to
find out let's get on with the video the
Galaxy Tab s comes in two sizes one with
an eight-point four inch and the second
one with a 10.5 inch screen instead of
using traditional LCD technology both
devices support identical Super AMOLED
displays allowing Samson to make an
incredibly thin and light not only that
but Super AMOLED also promises 70%
better color reproduction rate compared
to LCD with a resolution of 2560 by 1600
the screen looks absolutely stunning
probably the best we've ever laid eyes
on
that's 288 PPI for the 10.5 inch model
and an even higher 359 PPI for the 8.4
inch model the Galaxy Tab best features
this new adaptive display to
automatically optimizes the color range
saturation sharpness for certain apps
such as gallery camera web browser or
even when you're watching the video or
reading a book if you don't like the
super vibrant colors at the Super AMOLED
displays Samsung took care of that by
including three different screen modes
to choose from there's AMOLED cinema
which is a default look as if you're
using adaptive display but without the
software changing the settings
automatically it's got really vibrant
colors and is very contrast II there's
AMOLED photo that has a more subtle look
it's not too vibrant and the colors
aren't washed out at all the last one is
basic mode it sort of mimics what an LCD
screen looks like the colors aren't
vibrant and it lacks a bit of contrast
somebody liked this look and some may
not but then again you can choose from
two other modes that are just keeping an
adaptive display and leave the color
adjustment to the software now I
mentioned earlier about the size and
weight of these two in the beginning
these two tablets are only point 25
inches thin now that's really really
thin when they're in your hands both the
10.5 and 8.4 inch models hardly weighs
anything at all 60 Ria's still made out
of the same simple back that we saw with
the galaxy s5 just over a much larger
canvas these two tablets are less than a
pound with or without the cover that you
can buy separately and speaking of
covers you can get two different
variations the simple cover which covers
just the screen and the lower
the device and the book cover which is a
folio type case that could be folded in
different angles they're held by these
two small buttons on the back of the
device and click in two places they're a
huge pain to put on and take off taking
them off makes it feel like you're
breaking the device in half especially
with the noise it makes when you finally
take it off now when it comes to
performance it depends on what version
of the Galaxy Tab s you get there's an
LTE version and there's a Wi-Fi only
model the Wi-Fi model which we reviewed
is running octa-core exynos five and
it's crazy fast it's able to handle just
about anything you throw at it yeah
except for Google Chrome which for some
reason is really sluggish but other than
that we got a pretty good performance
from these two tablets it has three
gigabytes of RAM which is plenty enough
for a tablet it has 16 gigabytes of
internal storage but there's also a
microSD slot for 128 gigabytes the
galaxy tab bass has two cameras one 8
megapixel in the back put a single LED
flash they can record up to full HD
1080p and 12.1 megapixel showed up in
the front they can also record up to
full HD 1080p like any new Samsung
smartphones the Galaxy Tab best features
majority the new camera settings that
can be found on mobile like Beauty face
HDR and dual shot and will have a
gallery up on our site with sample
images so be sure to check that out so
with these new Galaxy Tab s features the
new fingerprint scanner that was
introduced with the galaxy s5 when we
did our initial testing with the galaxy
s5 it just wasn't working very well this
on the other hand was a bit better than
the Galaxy s5s fingerprint scanner it
seemed to recognize my fingerprint more
accurately why we don't know but it
works surprisingly well still it's not
as responsive as iPhone 5s is touch ID
let's take a quick break from our Galaxy
Tab s video to thank our friends at

now the Tab s 10.5 has a seven thousand
nine hundred milliamp battery and it's
really really good I use it for an
entire day which included web browsing
Netflix binging an occasional gamer to
clash of clans anyone we got about
twelve or so hours on a full day of
views in about fifteen percent battery
life although there's also a new ultra
power saving mode that you can enable to
make the battery even last longer if you
don't use a tablet all that often the
better you last a few days with no
problems it just depends on your daily
usage now with software the galaxy
Tabitha's running android 4.4.2 kitkat
out-of-the-box but since this is a
Samsung device it's running a TouchWiz
skin over it now we're really like what
Samsung has done with its new TouchWiz
skin for its latest devices both of the
devices are running the new magazine UX
from Samsung and it's just beautiful
TouchWiz have previously featured a very
cluttered UI complicated menus and color
schemes that were just all over the
place
Samsung has really toned it down over
the last few months and it introduced a
very simplistic and modern UI look to
TouchWiz I definitely like where it's
headed although you still get the
horrible bloatware that's in every non
stock Android device multi-window is
still present here and you also get the
options for kids mode for those who are
thinking of purchasing for their kids
Samsung also included a new software
features such as side sync which lets
you control your supported galaxy phones
within the tablet you've made calls send
messages and basic control the entire
phone however when you start using your
Galaxy phone side sync disables itself
automatically and you have to lock your
phone in order to start using it again
so there are definitely some quirks in
addition Samsung also offers a slew of
galaxy gifts stuff like one free year of
gogo in-flight Wi-Fi and some paid
subscription from sites like Bloomberg
Wall Street Journal and New York Times
just to name a few just definitely a lot
to like with both the new Galaxy Tab s
10.5 and 8.4 inch model there's a
beautiful vibrant screen that I'm sure
every consumer is going to love and the
design is top-notch but of course
there's also some caveats with the Tab s
the audio isn't all that great and the
speakers can be blocked easily the 10.5
inch model has this weird volume button
glitch where you press the volume up and
the volume goes down instead the price
is also a point of concern you can pick
the 10.5 inch model for $4.99 and a
smaller 8.4 inch model for 399 now
that's on par with Apple's iPad air and
iPad Mini with Retina but there's also
other devices on the Android Market such
as the Nexus 7 that only starts at 229
these are definitely Samsung's best
tablets this year the design is great
specs you're beefy and the screen is the
best we've ever seen better than the
Apple's iPad air and iPad with Retina
overall I give the Samsung Galaxy Tab
best device a solid 9 out of 10 what are
you thoughts of the Galaxy Tab s which
size would you choose let us know in the
comments down below as always we'll see
you guys in the next video
