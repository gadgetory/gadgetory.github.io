John for lakers calm here I'm back from
vacation so thank you all for the
holiday wishes the same back to you hope
you guys are going to have a nice
holiday with your family and friends
holidays and new years are coming soon
so it's a good time to remember what's
really important technology and all that
stuff is just fun but you know family
and friends are really what matters most
so while I was gone so interesting
things happened I danced with her some
elves evidently i'll put a link to that
in the sidebar definitely worth checking
out and I saw that Apple announced that
Steve Jobs won't be presenting at this
year's Macworld and in fact this will be
the last year Apple will be a Mac world
both of which are a little bit sad so
first from Steve Jobs not presenting
standpoint you know that was bound to
happen eventually it's a disciple of
CEOs I suppose and maybe his time is
winding down it perhaps he wants to be
less in front of the camera and half his
health less scrutinized every time he
shows himself there's always rampant
speculation about his well-being and I
can imagine that takes a toll on a man
so what I thought that's the case I
don't know but you know what makes it
does make sense me as Apple no longer
presenting at macworld and think that
makes sense for a few reasons first of
all Apple is no longer a niche product
they don't need these grandiose
bi-yearly conferences to show off their
products anymore you know used to be
Apple was it's you Mac one in every
hundred computers now you go to any
college campus or graduate campus and
you probably see forty to fifty percent
apples and those students are going to
assume be business men or women that are
going to use Apple products and the
marketer is going to continue to grow
you know they don't need to grandstand
with these events anymore you know also
they were forced to develop products on
our product life cycle that coincided
with Mac world and worldwide developers
conference now they have little more
flexibility to develop products that
perhaps you're more complete and perhaps
aren't under their self-imposed tight
deadlines anymore to release new
products at the specified time frame it
kind of become victims of their own
success you know whats app we're going
to do this year how are they going to
top last year's and when you do that
eventually you're going to end up
diluting your brand with new products
don't help just for the sake of putting
out new products unfortunately Apple
hasn't fallen victim to that yet but
they may very well if they keep having
to do these conferences every year and
have to WoW the audience if they don't
while the audience ends up hurting their
bottom line their stock price so they
really were becoming again victims of
their own success also another reason
they don't need these big conferences is
Apple can very easily send out
invitations to the press two weeks in
advance and held their own events for
particular products they can hold an
event like they did a few months ago for
the new macbooks in a few months prior
to that the new ipods you can still hold
these events that are product specific
but when the products are ready to be
developed ready to be shown not when you
know to january what's apple going to do
so just kind of my random thoughts and
musings I don't know if you agree or
disagree leave your comments down below
I got a ton of videos coming up for you
guys Xbox videos phone videos more Apple
videos coming up real soon back from
vacation energized so stay tuned for
those and I'm wishing you and your
family a happy holiday see you guys the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
