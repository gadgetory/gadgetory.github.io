technobuffalo here some of you may know
that last week I got to spend a few days
in Canada and first let me say I
absolutely love my time in Canada I was
only in Toronto but it's clean city that
people are nice there's so much to see
and do people were polite when I was
driving and my blinker on people
actually let me go overall I really like
Canada been to a Vancouver I've been to
Toronto and I've been to some places in
between and overall my experience has
really been positive but that's not the
point of this video while I was there
obviously I brought my main phone my
iphone with me and I was roaming on the
rogers gsm network there and while i was
in canada happen to wander into a Roger
store and I start asking some questions
and really was at that point that I
realized that Canadians get screwed on
mobile data and devices here in the US
we take for granted are a limited data
we get a limited data on AT&amp;amp;T you can
get it on verizon you can get unspread
get it on tmobile really most smartphone
plans come with unlimited data in Canada
not the case you are paying through the
nose for data and often time you are
only gets a a6 gigabyte cap now six gigs
is a lot of space but if you do a lot of
YouTube viewing over if you're an iPhone
user or another YouTube mobile phone
user that you go through data very
quickly especially if you're over 3g and
you can hit that six Gib gig cap very
very very quickly in fact some plans or
even lower than six gigs 501 gig to Gig
three gig and they are paying through
the nose for these plans so I'm really
curious as to why and in addition to
these really outrageous data costs
Canadians aren't signing a one-year
contract for a subsidy on device not a
two-year contract like we do in the u.s.
they are signing three-year contracts
which is insane especially when you
consider the lifespan of Technology a
three-year contract if you got the
original iphone you still be under
contract for another year before if you
got the iphone when it first launched on
day one you'd still be under contract
for almost another year to get the
iphone whatever 3gs to whatever might be
called next year
it is absolutely insane so I'm wondering
why as it just that Canadians are used
to paying more so the cell carriers
there can charge more and I'm looking at
you you know Rogers Bell Telus Fido what
other what other other can you networks
you are or there are is it just
Arcadians used to just pay more is that
why they're doing this or there may be
Canadian laws that don't allow for as
many cell phone towers or maybe they
have to pay a certain tariff for these
towers that have to offset to the
consumer to cause these higher prices
I'm just wondering why into Canadian
viewers out there man i'm sorry that
really sucks the signal strength was
great in the big cities i was in i
didn't turn on data cuz i didn't want to
get you know charged through the nose
but it's my data was pretty strong there
especially in the country where
blackberry is founded you know research
in motion rim is based in Canada and
Canada is such a high-tech country
figured they would have a better well
maybe infrastructure or at least better
rate plans so Canadians do you guys
complained you accepts your three-year
non limited data fate does it bother you
does it not bother you or you just use
to it you know let me know leave a text
or video response i'm really curious and
to those you've not in canada in the US
Europe or elsewhere what do you think
what are your data rates at your pain do
you get a limited data for not in the US
just kind of curious to know what you
guys think anyway for exclusive content
