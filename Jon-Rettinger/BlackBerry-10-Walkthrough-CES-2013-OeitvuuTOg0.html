is todd Hazleton from technobuffalo
checking out BlackBerry's dev alpha b
unit and it's running in alpha version
so this isn't final hardware or final
software that'll be revealed on january
thirtieth although we do have a good
idea of what's going on here as you lift
up the lock screen you'll be able to see
what's available on a homescreen if you
swipe left so blackberry hub in this
route you're going to see Twitter
messages facebook messages your emails
notifications and then you can search
and compose directly from there so it's
always available here's the Browse we
already have it open it's html5-based
rim is telling us it's got the highest
scores of any html5 browser we've got
technol Buffalo loaded it's moving
really quickly actually everything's
really quick the camera is really cool
with your finger down let the focus on a
specific spot then tap and go there's
also a time future so today we want to
take a picture of that we grabbed it the
memory was low but that's okay so now
this will move back in time and if you
look closely you'll see it's actually
grabbed photos from before and after I
took the picture so say your focus on
blackberry that actually that one looks
better grab it and you've got it saved
so it's great for if somebody has your
eyes closed now if we go to a photo you
can quickly share it using NFC Bluetooth
dbm or other social networks now the
cool thing about NFC in blackberry 10 is
for things like adding a blackberry
contact in BBM you can tap your phone to
easily do that which is really cool as
opposed to in the past where you had to
maybe enter in the BBM number manually
familiar icons the new things is
blackberry world no longer blackberry
app world because it has music and video
as well and games of course here you can
see the highlights of new movies that
are out and reveille label and that will
always be changing top grossing apps and
games carrier building is supported as
it has been in the past but in-app
purchases are also supported with
carriers with in notifications there
will be a feature called blackberry
bound to let you quickly switch between
work and play modes so if your IT
department wants specific applications
that will limit you to them and then
you can always have your applications
now the cool thing about that is you can
actually on the weekends lock the work
mode so that you don't see your work
calendar events your emails and can
actually enjoy time off that's a quick
look here at blackberry 10 this is Todd
Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo again not
final software not the final hardware
will bring you that on january thirtieth
we're on location at CES 2013 in Las
Vegas hanging out at the Ford booth no
one likes getting lost when you're
driving you're having to ask for
directions ford vehicles with sync and
optional voice-activated navigation help
solve that problem get turn-by-turn
directions over your car's audio system
so you know where you're turning next to
save time you can even plan your route
ahead by saving an address as a favorite
or searching through your previous
destinations thanks again to Ford for
powering this TechnoBuffalo CES special
and for giving us a behind-the-scenes at
CES 2013
you
