and landing restrictions Buffalo
bulletin time hello internet and welcome
to the Buffalo bulletin where we recap
five major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story mention on the show
check the description for links or click
on the graphics for each story if you
have annotations available and toggle on
I'm Ashley sceva this is my dog Bailey
and here are your top stories Google
kept to their word and unveiled the
highly anticipated Nexus 5 yesterday
squeaking just under their expected
October launch deadline even better
there's no waiting around the thinner
faster beautiful Nexus 5 is running
Android 4.4 KitKat and it's available
right now at retail shops and on the
Play Store with 16 and 32gb white
variants for 349 and 399 dollars
respectively however we can't guarantee
they'll be in stock so we hope you
bought one already amazon is getting
into a charitable spirit in time for the
holidays launching amazon smile this
week the initiative promises to donate
point five percent of all new purchases
to the charity of each user's choice you
just pick your charity and you start
shopping via start amazoncom to donate
there are a few exceptions in the
program Kindle e-books and any
subscription purchases don't count
toward the smile program but overall
it's a smart business move with some
heart behind it some gamers were upset
this week when Sony released a huge faq
about the playstation 4 and confirmed no
external hard drives would be compatible
with the console apparently sony's
concerned about piracy so they made it
unable to use external drives but you'll
still be able to install a larger
internal drive if you want more space
the ps4 comes equipped with 500
gigabytes of internal storage at launch
but if you plan on buying and installing
lots of games that may not be enough
Telltale Games revealed the sequel to
the critically acclaimed game The
Walking Dead with a season two trailer
that suggests season 1 protagonist
Clementine might be in some trouble
Telltale's press release says we'll be
taking on the
clem surviving in the zombie apocalypse
there's not much to go by from the
trailer which was a short teaser but if
season two is anything like the first
season we're in for another excellent
installment of the franchise and finally
our grab bag story of the day comes from
the FAA who released a statement
yesterday saying it's now safe to use
electronic devices like smartphones and
tablets from gate to gate no more
shutting down your iPods Kindles or
PlayStation Vita's during takeoff and
landing but cellular service is still
prohibited the rules should go into
effect by the end of this year but it's
up to each airline to implement them
based on their own rules so we'll see
what happens that's the Buffalo bulletin
