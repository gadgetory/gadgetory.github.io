to you by Gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of a rumor
roundup I'm real John written Jers to
show where I hoard all the rumors all
your rumors are belong to me and I serve
them up to you so you know what you
missed and know where the technology
what might be coming in the coming weeks
months and even years of this week it's
all about the me toos HTC is looking to
build a SmartWatch LG's looking to get
into the curved smartphone market and
the galaxy s5 might get a pretty beastly
60 megapixel camera mr. Miranda let's
get started so if you use the Galaxy
gear and you thought I'd like you galaxy
gear about it like you much more for
your built out of aluminum well looks
like the folks at HDC you might have
your answer according to Bloomberg
they're looking to get into the
SmartWatch world and not surprisingly
run Android and have a camera that was
the leak it'll run Android to have a
camera I could have told you that
but beyond it's camera the alleged
SmartWatch is still in development an
interview earlier this week CEO Peter
Chou who's been pretty outspoken said he
wouldn't release SmartWatch unless it
could meet a need but with Samsung going
pretty much balls-to-the-wall and
wearables HTC is obviously feeling some
pressure to follow quickly or risk
losing on a potentially profitable brand
new market so not to be outdone by the
galaxy round LG is getting into the
curved phone game so the leak comes
courtesy of Argentinian journalist
Frederico et who somehow God is a hot
little hands on the rumored phone so
like Samsung's handset the galaxy round
Eenie is reporting that the G flex is it
going to be called to lunch exclusively
in South Korea boo you sent a ton of
pictures to the verdict reveal that
device buttons are also on the back
similar to the g2 so kind of boo to that
the curse smartphone also supposedly
features a 13 megapixel camera 6 inch
OLED display curved on its vertical
access so I get it that it's good of a
kurd phone but I have yet to really
understand what the point of a curved
phone is maybe it's in your pocket
better perhaps there's some crazy new
thing I haven't thought of I know
Samsung's Galaxy round you can sort of
tap it and make it wiggle and menus pop
up I just
waiting's was more like that hey we can
do it the more we should do it I don't
know what the advantage of a curved
display is other than being like boom Lu
should be jelly a mouth bone or oh your
phone is flat
sucks for you I don't care if you got a
Snapdragon 800 mom's got a curve in it
the Samsung Galaxy s5 is getting a 16
megapixel camera the Samsung has already
got some pretty baller phones out there
and they have pretty awesome specs
galaxy note 3 and the galaxy s4 boasting
pretty substantial and decent 13
megapixel cameras but the company made
to keep improving if it wants to remain
competitive into 2014 so new report from
et News which is a pretty decent track
Requin it comes to Samsung rumors claims
at the next-generation probably named
Galaxy s5 will Rock a 16 megapixel
camera which if you can do math is
double what we already got things will
allegedly take shape around the end of
the year because the camera module
sample tests have not yet been completed
however its Samsung insider from the
company's Wireless business division
reportedly told ichi news at the galaxy
s5 could launch in early 2014 so january
