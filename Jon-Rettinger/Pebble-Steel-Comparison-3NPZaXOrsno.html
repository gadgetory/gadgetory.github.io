technobuffalo here we've got the pebble
steel here in the office I thought it'd
be fun to put it head-to-head in a
little mini comparison against its
younger brother the original pebble
let's bash these two together and see
which one your SmartWatch buying bucks
pick up first let me talk about
functionality both of these are pretty
much functionally exactly the same they
both have the same five to seven hour
battery life both have the same screen
size both have the same OS and apps
support with OS to point the same watch
faces you're not looking at a quad-core
processor here versus dual-core here the
internals are exactly the same you're
not getting crazy new features with the
pebble steel they both have the same
five automated teller machines of water
resistance waterproofness I know it
doesn't stand for that they have the
same water resistance level so you're
good with either what it really comes
down to is design the design of the
steel is a bit more industrial some
would say a bit more professional more
grown-up as opposed to the more casual
playful whimsical look of the original
pebble that being said original pebble
does come in way more colors there are
five different options you can get
including black red white and I wish I
could just pull in orange and pull in
gray this is our pebble collection you
can imagine if these were orange a grey
what that looked like to get way more
color options here as well pebble steel
low does have some color options of its
own you can get it in brushed stainless
like we have right here there's also a
black matte option available whichever
one you get they're also going to come
with black band so you can choose if you
want the black leather or if you like
the sort of metal look of the pebble
steel if it gets called steel I like to
steal look but there's no accounting for
taste so whatever you want you've got
the option for so let's talk about
intangibles because these watch it again
functionally pretty similar so the
original pebble is just one hundred and
fifty dollars you to pick whatever color
you want so a bit more of the impulse
buy type price range the watch bands are
standard and you can pick whatever watch
band you want go to the store and you're
fine you have to worry about what chips
with did it feel like the way it looks
you
put a white bands on a black watcher of
black band on a white watch you can go
crazy if you want to because it's a
standard size so no problem there at all
on the steel front it's an extra hundie
two hundred fifty dollars is not a cheap
proposition I want to come into a smart
watch especially sort of an unproven
platform pebble start as a start-up
that's really proven they're going to be
successful but whether or not you want
to spend ten to fifty dollars on a
SmartWatch you know that's really going
to come down to your own income or
disposable income I should say it does
have some improvements though first it's
got an improved magnetic charger this is
one of my knock on the original pebble
when I tried to charge it you really had
to make sure you move it at all or
charge would fall right off this one
though it snaps right on and you can
hold the whole watch by it if you go to
the original pebble and you use the
original charger both magnetic they're
not interchangeable though so you have
to sort of use the charge that came with
your watch put it on there you try and
pick it up it falls right off and falls
off very very easily it's did not make a
very strong connection so if that's a
reason to want to get the steal you've
got that option as well also we've got
two plugged in on this deal you've got a
hidden LED indicator right down there in
the bottom left-hand corner so you know
when charging it's an RGB indicator
which is kind of a nice feature to have
you can't see it when it's not
illuminated you've got marine grade
stainless steel on the case and the
watch band you've got steel buttons here
as well there really isn't much of a gap
between them they feel really nice look
at the buttons on the original pebble
they're plastic and they're spaced
between them I found the ones in steel
actually easier to use you also have
gorilla glass 2 on here so if you drop
it if you scratch it not gonna have to
worry too much about it's not going to
scratch at all if you put in your pocket
for some reason if you put your watch in
your pocket you're not going to worry
about the little nicks and dings that
you might get on your original pebble
but it's not without its problems I do
not like that pebble branding right
there on the wash you don't have that on
the original pebble I wish I didn't have
to advertise for the product that I just
bought another issue that I've had the
particular pebble steel is actually at
the border around the watch if you see
where the metal meets the screen there's
a bit of
lip on the top and bottom there and it's
a sharp lip so if you drag your finger
over it drag your finger up you're going
to catch your nail or catch your cuticle
it happened to me it's actually is very
very sharp so if you think this might be
a touch screen you drag your finger over
a lot even though it's not going to be a
touch screen be aware that there
definitely is a bit of an edger maybe
it's something that we saw with the
first batch of pebble seals it might get
fixed but ours definitely has that right
there also I don't like that eases
proprietary bands no more standard watch
band size hello to pebbles credit they
did release a three rendering of the
watch so third parties can make separate
bands for it but we don't have any of
those on the market yet presumably they
will come soon so which one should you
buy for me if I was looking to pick up a
pebble and I really liked the pebble
smartwatches I think I'd pick up a
pebble steel extra hundred bucks for me
is worth it i could wear the watch in
more business settings and not feel a
little self-conscious of what's on my
wrist but it's really just pure
aesthetic when it comes down to this
point functionality wise they're both
exactly the same I like the black watch
I think it's a little bit more
understated here so it come down to me
between the black pebble and the matte
black pebble steel if we don't have in
the office so this issue here is really
personal preference you want to play for
watch you don't watch more professional
I prefer the more professional
significant feel of the pebble steel but
you guys might disagree I'll give your
comments in your thoughts and what you
think about the two watches which one
did you pick up I think about the new
pebble platform of course we'll have a
full review for you of the pebble steel
coming very very soon until then I'm
