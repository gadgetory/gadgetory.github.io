brought to you by Jackthreads hello
there folks is John Q here from
technobuffalo hope you guys to do an
absolutely swella rific fantastic
wonderful wonderful happy happy welcome
to another episode of whats the apps
today we're gonna get our to do on with
an app called Claire hit man to make an
application groundbreaking I think the
number one challenge is to design
something that's paradoxically
innovative and different but at the same
time keep it familiar and intuitive the
guys at real mac software have
definitely done this with clear and it
shows unlike the traditional iOS UI
where navigation flows horizontally
between menus and items clear takes on a
pure vertical approach not to mention
the app is also purely gesture-based you
can swipe down to add items hold items
to move them pinch to add items in
between items swipe to delete pull up to
clear pinch your list to condense it
hold down to move between menus and more
it takes a little getting used to but
once you've mastered the rather
simplistic system you flying you fly in
man the sounds also very intuitive not
to mention insanely awesome progression
base sequences trigger melodic scale
which is not only intuitive and also
very very pleasant for the ear but it
also gives you an overall genuine
feeling of oh my goodness look at me I'm
accomplishing so many things today you
know that kind of warm feel good feeling
Claire also has some hidden secrets
easter eggs if you will within the app
my research and development team AKA
google searching has informed me that
you can also unlock secret themes for
example downloading the path application
will unlock this wonderful light theme
which I think complements white iOS
devices quite nicely I saw this
application while back but to be honest
I didn't really give it any second
thought as that was quite happy with
remember the milk however due to raving
reviews I thought I'd give it a shot
after testing it all out I gotta say I'm
equally as thrilled as I am disappointed
the app is just so crazy good but it
hurts me that it's only available for
iphones and ipod touches services like
remember the milk or wunderlist provide
web apps that means i can edit tasks
anywhere they also provide
cross-platform applications that i'll
synch up
push down from that wonderful cloud
stuff that everyone so cray-cray about
also clear simplicity is like a
double-edged sword and not no regular
double-edged sword know it's gonna be
one of those awesome ancient
one-of-a-kind sores from Game of Thrones
or something the only thing you can do
when you add items is enter in the title
you can't set due dates priority levels
tags repeats notifications nothing Siri
fans also won't be able to add items
like you would with remember the milk
because of all these cons I simply can't
make clear my stand alone to do that but
it's just too awesome to delete so I
guess my remember the milk app it's
gonna have a little sidekick for a while
and speaking of Awesome I'm gonna take
some time to thank our friends add

of their killer hookups go now overall
clear is clearly a winner see how I did
that no all right its innovative
approach to managing items and getting
things done is fantastic not to mention
its vividly simple graphics and it's
quirky fun sounds are outstanding if you
don't need a multi-platform cloud-based
sync service power to do system then
clear will be perfect for you but if
you're like me and you need a more
feature pack to do system then clear
isn't really going to cut it which is
why I give it a 3.5 out of 5 for now
well I hope you guys enjoyed my review
of clear this was john q from
TechnoBuffalo thank you very much for
stopping by and i'll see you guys next
time let us
