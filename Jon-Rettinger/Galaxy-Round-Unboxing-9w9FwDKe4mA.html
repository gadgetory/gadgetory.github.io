TechnoBuffalo here if you looked at your
smartphone recently no matter what size
specs it's got and been like oh man
you're flat you're so boring
you're outdated well this is your answer
this is the world's first curve display
phone is the samsung galaxy round if you
couldn't guess by the title it's round I
really take a look at it I've been
holding this box dying or poking this
plastic let's go ahead start the
unboxing so here is the box for the
galaxy round looking all two-dimensional
not round like on the front this is
essentially the same specs as the note 3
so it's got pretty baller specs
including a Snapdragon 800 chip a
ridiculous three gigs of ram and a
pretty awesome 1080p screen let's go
ahead and open this sucker up this is
now only available from one carrier in
South Korea SK Telecom but our friend
that Negri electronics of course have
the hook up they've got these guys in
stock so check them out and never
electronics comics want to pick up this
phone or really any unlocked phone that
you want to check out so we get all our
stuff from so here is the box for the
galaxy round go ahead and slide this top
off and there is a round phone which I
have never ever seen in my life
it feels round and a little weird push
it off the side for just a minute and
we'll see what else we've got in the box
we've got a cardboard tray which does
nothing underneath said cardboard tray
we've got things written in Korean I
assume that as a get started guy but I
don't speak Korean so I cannot translate
that we've got an external battery
charger is kind of interesting it's got
a 2800 milli amp hour battery that is
flat which apparently Samsung is
essentially saying we know it's not
going to last you a whole day so here's
an extra battery charger for it please
don't be mean to us so that just goes in
and it charges Samsung now has
technology to do curved batteries but
apparently they did not when they were
putting this guide on the market so
old-school flat batteries all around
else in the box continuing the trend
with the note 3 the charges really the
second phone I can think of that charges
with USB 3.0 if you
now though the other end of that also is
essentially microUSB so you can use old
accessories if you want to charge your
sink your phone just won't sink as fast
we've got earbuds with noise cancelling
mic and a way to control volume on its
we've got a power cable here which I'm
guessing that is the South Korean power
adapter push all the stuff off to the
side that's not why you're here year for
this crazy round phone I'm going to go
ahead and pop the battery and I'll do a
whole quick tour of ours antha phone's
got so the back of the phone has a
similar look to note 3 meaning that it's
or that fake leather look with this faux
stitching around it but it's got more of
a tactile feel to it this is a much
better feeling phone a little stickier
on the back then just a hard plastic
that is on the note 3 but it is still
plastic on the back it's sort of little
thicker though than previous back 15 on
Samsung devices as I mentioned the
battery is flat so that means a battery
compartment is also flat so go ahead and
pop that in it's got the same a spot for
expansion that you find on other Samsung
devices those have 32 gigabytes of
storage built in though then your SIM
card goes right below that put the back
on and I will power the sucker on I'll
run through all the specs of this phone
case is pretty well SPECT out so power
button lives right there on the right
that's where Samsung does with most of
their devices and then we've got samsung
galaxy around it is a curved 5.7 inch
print resolution of 1920 by 1080 giving
it do the math in your head 386 ppi LTE
a sk telecom and it's running Android
4.3 at launch it's a super flexible
Imola display for whatever that means a
snapdragon 800 processor so pretty
beastly trippin here three gigs of ram
32 gigs of internal storage but of
course you can up that with more storage
it's got a 13 megapixel camera moving
right down the back of course takes
1080p video that's got a 2 megapixel
shooter right up there on front Wi-Fi
pretty much everything's here 802 11 a
BGN an AC bluetooth 4.0
it weighs 154 grams or 5.4 ounces and it
comes in two kind of calling it brown
but it looks it looks black to me and
that 2,800 million
battery coupled with Bluetooth 4.0 so we
get the role of Start screen stuff and
take a look at the phone alright we've
got the round all set up here and I got
to say first impression it feels really
nice it's a very subtle curve it's not
like a giant huge curved phone it's not
that big but it really feels nice you
continue to scroll along maybe just it's
a novelty and they'll wear off but these
first impressions are definitely
positive here with the galaxy round all
of us the stuff you'd expect from a
modern speck sampling device or here
especially a top-of-the-line so you've
got and you can run two apps at the same
time if you feel so inclined you just
sort of drag it drag it okay yeah you
can serve do things on top or the bottom
depending on what you want to do I can
do all kinds of cool things with that so
essentially the design is very similar
to the note 3 or galaxy s4 we've got one
big power button flanked on the left and
the right by capacitive back buttons and
many buttons left hand side a volume
rocker up and down on the right you've
got your power and lock on the top 3.5
milimeter headset jack ir and microphone
then your USB 3.0 charging port on the
bottom so the first question I had when
I picked up the Galaxy round was how is
it going to feel in my pocket so let me
show you what that looks like to have a
round phone in your pocket so here is
the galaxy round I'll put it with the
curve facing my leg and just make the
most sense and it certainly feels really
nice you don't get that giant sort of
bold you get with a flat device it's a
little more subtle however turned the
other way looks odd and you feel it
pushing up against your leg I'm just
wearing normal dude jeans so definitely
noticeable if you keep it the right way
that's really subtraction the giant
footprint of a 5.7 inch phone so we'll
have more coverage here on the galaxy
round unfortunately our time with it is
going to be very limited but we will
have some verses videos to show you what
it looks like versus other devices you
can see how the roundness of the phone
compares to other flat device it's
pretty much every other phone out on the
market whether or not this actually adds
anything is more of just sort of a
novelty for novelty sake and we got
please give the video a thumbs up let
stuff we appreciate it
