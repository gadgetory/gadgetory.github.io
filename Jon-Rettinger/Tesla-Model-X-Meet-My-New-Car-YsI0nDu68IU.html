if they did this would be the one I am
most excited about ever today I'm taking
delivery of my brand-new Tesla Model X
it is a 75 D blue on white actually I
let my my son pick the colors and I
can't wait take a look at it I went for
the X as opposed to an S I got two kids
and maybe a third the next few years
sawed the extra room would be helpful
plus I kind of like the doors so I got
it on a your leased and I'm excited to
take a look at it so let's take a look
at the Model X and if you want more
Model X coverage for the video a thumbs
up to let us know I'll be doing more
mini videos on the car on my other
channel inside Jon's mine link will be
down below
so let's get the car it looks like a
Model S that kind of got jacked up and
kind of smushed into a minivan s style
but a few highlights up and kind of
adding some of the coolest things about
the car let's start the key fob got it
protected already oh those doors so
those are called Falcon wing doors they
have choose different hinges on it so
you've got a hinge right here when they
open and the hinge here as well so it'll
articulate up and out at least I they
claim to get out of cars that are next
to you will see it in all tested
actually see if it does that but it
attacked obstacles or cars that are near
you and I'll kind of work around them
for me as you probably tell I got one
car seat in there and later on say
another one's going to go in it's really
ideal for trying to get kids in and out
of the car and my wife who has back
problems I'm hoping it's going to be
helpful for her too because now you can
stand and walk right up to the car this
particular car is a six seater you can
get it up to seven seats with the seat
in the middle I wanted to have some
faced four legs that kind of thing but
the seats are all on their own pedestal
there's a lot of attention to detail
here so you can fully control the seats
it'll move up the front row and also you
can attach lat child seats to the back
too as well you can kind of tell where
my priorities are here and I got white
and I know it's kind of weirdly to do
with two kids this is not real leather
it's a vegan leather and according to
Tesla and other videos that I've seen
this is actually the most durable
interior out of all the different tear
offs that Tesla has I'm dubious white
like that can't quite be true but
supposedly it is and all these separate
videos detailing how the white is
holding up the fact if you want to see
more Tesla videos give the video a
thumbs up and let us know and I'll do
more sort of mini videos on my other
channel inside John's my link to that up
here and down below if you want to
subscribe so you control the doors three
different ways you can do it from the
fall by pushing the buttons on the side
because the fob itself looks like a mini
version of the car again got it all
wrapped up and you can control
everything directly from and including
the doors the front trunk is
trunk in the front so I'll show you and
the back hatch in the closed doors push
your button and the doors majestically
closed I'm not sure how this is going to
hold up to three year lease on the car
we'll see over three years how it
performs a few things you'll notice
different than maybe some older versions
of the Model X we've got camera sensors
all around the car now I've got here
here and then you've got three cameras
up front this is what test is calling
autopilot - so this is enabled for fully
autonomous driving doesn't do it yet in
fact does even have the features of
autopilot one quiet that's coming
sometime in the middle of December where
if I watch this video it'll probably
already be here and fully autonomous
should calm Tesla says by the end of
2017 so we'll see if it if it actually
happens but in theory this car should
just just drive itself when features do
come over the air you can expect things
like summon so you can summon the car to
you and of course autopilot which may
kind of Tesla famous for pioneering
autonomous Drive if they're coming
around the back back hatch opens up I've
got some stuff back here the third road
goes down first one drops the headrest
second one exit to push the seat down
you can do that push back up so we got
extra room for storage probably keep
this down I think ultimately I've got it
up just so I can carry more people uh
and then if I move all this stuff we've
got more storage underneath here as well
so lots of lots of storage for for space
you can get a lot of stuff in this car
and option it up to the crazy amounts of
money I didn't do a lot of that stuff
you get features where the driver side
door automatically open up when you get
to it on its own I got the smallest
battery pack that's offered and the
smaller wheels
so I'm actually it's got a front trunk
it does I'm sure what that looks like
and you can just store stuff it comes
the tow itch because you can oddly tow
things an electric car up to five
thousand pounds can make a lot of noise
I jam on the brakes so sitting inside of
a model act is very similar to sitting
inside of a model a steering wheel looks
the same and all the bunny configuration
looks the same as well but a few things
are different in the Model S the center
console is removable this one is built
in all these separate videos showing the
center console if you guys want to see
it so let me know down below also I need
a name for this car so if any
suggestions were to name it because it
has to to name it in the app let me know
also down below again I didn't get the
Premium Package but if you do the doors
will close themselves when you walk in
but right now the doors are still
automatic so if I want to close the door
I don't have to actually old school I
guess you know lean in and pull I can
just put my foot on the brake that's
going to close the door for me which is
still kind of weird you open it up so
things stop beeping and it'll kind of
open up on its own you can also control
all the doors and the seats now from
this 17 inch touchscreen so I control
the Falcon wing doors how high they open
as well as opening the passenger and
driver's door so go and close both
Falcon wings drafting here and then
thing start to close seats as well like
I mentioned you can control the position
of the seats right from here so again
convenient you have kids you got to
reach back to grab something you can
control that right from the touch panel
so we can control pretty much everything
from the car one of the big changes
though of the Model X versus the Model S
is this kind of helicopter inspired
windshield I'm hoping it never cracks
now to replace it but this thing goes
all the way back it's like something
right out of like Jurassic world you get
a very immersive strange view of the
road and and what's up above you it is
tinted and then we're in Southern
California so I don't know how much
heats gonna radiate through this onto my
head but I don't update that too and let
you know I wanted this video because I
was really excited to have been sharing
about on social media and I don't think
there's a bigger piece of techne
ecology than this car this is a piece of
tech its software upgradeable it's got
LTE connection it's going to get better
with time like our mobile devices do so
I'm excited to share my experiences
anything you guys want to seek about the
car again in particular let me know and
I'll do videos on it hit the subscribe
button to see those videos and of course
check out the other channel inside Jon's
mind for for mini Tesla coverage help me
name it again guys any advices
appreciate it I got I got nothing right
now until next time I'm John render
TechnoBuffalo I'm gonna dream on red
