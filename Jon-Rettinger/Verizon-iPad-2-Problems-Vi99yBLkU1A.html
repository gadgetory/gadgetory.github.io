John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here and you are looking at a very crude
angle of a iPad 2 on the verizon network
or at least it should be on the verizon
network from day one with my verizon
iPad 2 I have had connection issues I
thought this was going to be just unique
to my particular iPad 2 there have been
many reports coming out this is a
widespread problem with Verizon iPad 2
customers I'm gonna go ahead and show
you what happens this is not the case if
you have an AT&amp;amp;T or if you're outside of
the US the GSM version the iPad 2 just
the CDMA variety when you turn on the
cellular data it doesn't connect you
actually have to reboot the device a lot
of times in order to get that cellular
data to hook up so I'm gonna go ahead
and zoom in quite a bit I'll show you
the upper left-hand corner so you can
see right now we're connected to just
Wi-Fi I'm gonna go ahead and turn on the
cellular data right now so go ahead and
jump it to cellular data now oftentimes
the fix trees I thought the fix was
going to be we just turn on airplane
mode on and off but that did not work
unfortunately so go ahead and turn
cellular data on and we're nearly you'd
see the Verizon logo pop up right there
or if this was the 18 t version you'd
show it pop up but you'll notice nothing
is showing up at all and this is all in
real time and I'll show once again that
the cellular data is turned on and it's
not working
boy genius is said they've gotten their
hands on an early build of OS 4.3.2
which opposes a fixes this problem which
as it stands right now I don't know way
to fix is to turn it off so a lot of
people have said or what about airplane
mode as I mentioned doesn't work let me
go ahead at least just show you so
airplane mode is now turned on to go
ahead and turn airplane mode off and
earlier this is where you'd see the
Verizon network hook up and you're going
to be left with this searching for many
many many minutes I've left it for up to
2025 minutes and you still just keep
getting that searching searching
searching and unfortunately will not
find
the network here I can leave this on let
you guys see I can put the footage at
the end but this is going to just keep
on searching so if you want to get this
to work at least at the most current
version of the software which is four
point three point two point one or
really any version of four point three
that came with the iPad 2 the only
solution right now you can see it's
still searching it most definitely
should have found the network by now is
to turn off your iPad 2 and I'll do all
this for you in real time go ahead and
turn off alright so it is powered off
let's turn it back on and now I'll be
connected to the Verizon network I
thought this is something that was just
unique to my iPad but evidently there
are many users out there I haven't seen
a video that's being demonstrating I
wanted to share it with you as you guys
were deciding which iPad might be right
for you
Apple is claiming there's a software fix
coming I've been very happy with the
speeds on the Verizon iPad using the
Verizon network however this has been a
huge inconvenience something you might
want to consider or at least wait to
purchase until you know that the
software fix does address the issue
so it's booting up and there we have it
connected to the Verizon network kind of
interesting anyway guys i am john r
Ettinger from TechnoBuffalo
and i'll see you in the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
