TechnoBuffalo so a couple weeks back the
guys at 3d robotics sent us their new
drone the iris plus this runs supposed
to have auto piloting features follow me
like with GPS tracking it supposed to be
crazy so over the last couple weeks we
got to fly it test it shoot some footage
and so we have our review for you guys
today so the first thing I was really
interested in personally as the video
guy here a TechnoBuffalo was the ease of
use and how this would film so I'll kind
of separate the two in terms of ease of
use it was a little more complicated
than I would have liked out of the box
setting it up wasn't exactly very
straightforward the battery had two or
three different cords I really didn't
understand why the charger was also like
that and plugging the gimbal in which is
an additional add-on for the drone that
had like the weirdest pin connection
it's not a huge deal but it definitely
was something that annoyed me a little
bit they have awesome tutorials on their
website so I would definitely recommend
checking those out if you do pick up
this drone a make setting up way easier
and way faster one of the issues we did
have before going out to fly was that
the drone actually is GPS the GPS is
used to hold the drone in place if there
are like crazy winds or something or
when you stop operating it'll hold it in
one place so you don't lose control or
at higher altitudes we didn't have some
problems getting GPS lock maybe is
because of where we are around office
buildings we've also heard people have
problems around like a lot of like
taller trees and stuff like that so just
something to bear in mind that being
said once we did get it up in the air it
was frickin awesome you do need to start
out a little bit slower kind of ease
into it so you're not kind of all over
the place the controls are very
sensitive but once you kind of ease in
ease out take off all that stuff with
the joysticks it you get the hang of it
pretty quickly and it is really really
fun oh we did our first flight without a
gimbal without the GoPro on it because
they say they recommend it for some
reason for safety issues as I assume
overall I'd say manual operation with
this drone was as expected it was great
it was smooth the drone is really really
powerful
there's controls to actually point where
the gimbal is facing so once you do have
a GoPro on there you can choose where
you aim the camera one of the additional
add-ons they actually have is GoPro Live
View so it allows you to see what the
GoPro sees on the remote control itself
we personally didn't use this what we
did instead it was just used the app
available for iOS or Android for GoPro
which we love so that was pretty awesome
well that pretty much summed up the
manual control it was really interesting
about what 3d robotics did here with
iris plus however as our the autopilot
features and the Follow Me feature now I
don't know how I felt about this but
after using it a couple of times my
conclusion is that it's a really cool
feature but it's more of a novelty from
a filmmaking and video aspect rather
than it is actually a professional tool
it's kind of like autofocus and cameras
it works and eventually you'll get focus
but you can't really use it for filming
purposes and the reason I say this is
because the follow me feature works
perfectly you know we had a tablet and
we had follow me and if we'd walk around
it would follow us in the gimbal with
tracks and that sort of stuff but the
thing we noticed was with it it's a bit
jarring like the the drone will fly the
camera will be a just a little fly
readjust fly readjust and so for any of
you who do video making you know that
that's really not an ideal situation you
want your camera moves to be smooth
fluid which there really weren't so
again it definitely works on paper but
it doesn't work in the most executional
of ways the autopilot features were
pretty similar they worked really well
with the tablet you can set an unlimited
amount of points of where you want the
joint of fly the altitude you want to
fly at which is really cool if you
personally feel a little sketchy about
controlling the drone yourself it'll
even land itself which is a great safety
precaution but again for filming
purposes it doesn't really work that
well it's still too jarring to really
use for regular footage one of the
oddities is actually at the app for the
autopilot and the follow me functions is
only available for Android so we did you
have to use an Android tablet for this
but it is not available for iOS devices
something to bear in mind if you are
planning on picking up this drone
another weird quirk was actually the
battery door in the back this whole
thing is made of plastic but the battery
door on the back was pretty difficult to
close because the battery has some
thicker cord so you kind of have to jam
it all in there and just like snap it
shut which sometimes feels like you
might almost break it but you just got
to be careful with that that was
something I thought could have been
better in terms of build quality in
terms of price in the iris plus stars at
750 dollars now that might seem really
cheap compared to DJI phantom 3 or
something but it's actually not they
actually match up pretty well in terms
of pricing because you do have to buy
your own GoPro the DJI comes with its
own camera and you also have to add on
the gimbal just the drone in the gimbal
alone add up to 950 dollars so you're
hovering
about the same price range so final
thoughts I think this dorms really cool
I mean we had a great time with it it's
a really fun device now if you just want
to draw in a flyer on and mess around
with this is amazing if you're using for
filming or video purposes it's really
good but drones are in their infancy as
we see them right now so they will
improve auto piloting will get better
the follow me feature will get better
with newer versions of this drone right
now I don't think the autopilot features
are good enough to use them on a
professional filming level but they're
certainly a fun novelty to have if you
do manual operation you get really good
at it I could see you getting some
really good footage out of this drone
you know coupled with the GoPro 4 like
we had for example in 4k its overall
really fun it comes in at a really good
price point so we're definitely fans
over here that's it for this video guys
let us know what you thought what do you
guys think of this drone would you pick
it up or would you go with something
like the Phantom 3 why or why not leave
