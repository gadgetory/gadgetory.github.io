like their playground they would try new
stuff dual screens Dax and see how
things worked and eventually that would
make its way into the flagship line the
G line of phones they're scrapping that
whole method now and the V 30 clearly
sits atop of their portfolio and this is
kind of what the G 6 should have been
we're still testing the be 30 before we
do a full review but I've already found
a lot of stuff to really like about this
phone so as you guys decide what phone
you want to buy or think about buying
here are five reasons of e 30 doesn't
suck so I was gonna go in reverse order
and start with five and worked my way up
but I'm just gonna jump right into
number one the screen holy crap that
OLED screen looks insane I didn't think
that I was gonna find a display that
looks better than Samsung Super AMOLED
panels on the no date the SAT si plus
but damn LG did it this looks better
than the Samsung display OLED looks
insane on a phone LG's makes awesome
OLED TVs but seeing it on a smaller
phone form factor a six inch screen it
looks so good so the black levels
obviously look awesome you expect that
with OLED what surprised me was actually
the visibility in direct sunlight
that's not where old legends I can still
see this in direct sunlight your screen
gets crazy bright if you're in a dark
room and turn the brightness all the way
up it's like burn your retinas bright
you like the Eclipse glasses to look at
it so that has been really surprising
colors also obviously look really bright
and vibrant but you can see a difference
with OLED maybe it's psychosomatic I
don't know actually excited to see an
OLED phone but hotdamn is a screen look
insane good job LG number two so a lot
of people were annoyed with the g6 in
the US we got wireless charging other
mah career markets you got a quad DAC
you didn't get both LG righted that ship
here
you now have quad DAC and you've got
wireless charging with the V 30 so if
you plug in compatible headphones gonna
take advantage of the full audio
fidelity wall wireless charging which is
really nice to have number 3 battery
life I don't know Ola is using less
power
LG software's just gotten better
by the 3309 power batteries pretty good
so by comparison on my s8 when I plug in
my phone into the night genuinely I
meant like twenty to twenty five
sometimes thirty percent at the v3 and
the same usage
I met thirty to thirty five percent so
I'm getting pretty good battery life
here it's something I'm really happy to
see with LG I wasn't the biggest fan of
battery life on the g6 so it looks like
the trend continues they fix the machine
with the g6 the V thirty can last you
easily all day so I don't mean for this
via the turns like a g6 bashing but
number four is speed the GC kind of
Snapdragon 820 one for a lot of things
didn't matter but where it did matter
was using LG's multi window and trying
to do two things the phones tend to slow
down oftentimes stutter especially well
one of those windows with streaming
video 8:35 on the v 30 same four
gigabytes of RAM and the same issues I
had with the g6 are gone with the V 30
same four gigabytes of RAM are here but
the Snapdragon 835 make things way
quicker than I had with the g6 no
slowdown no stutter for doing exact the
same test that had at the g6 so speed
pretty good
and number five intangibles so I just
finished playing with the essential
phone and that phone is really solid and
sewn right but it's missing some stuff
LG checks almost all the flagship boxes
that you'd expect so you've got quad DAC
you've got wireless charging you've got
expandable storage you've got fast
charging and you've got USB C you also
have IP 68 water resistance things
you're missing removable battery and an
IR blaster if that's important to you
bear in mind but it does check almost
all the boxes for flagship phone that's
nice to see and all that stuff plus a
headphone jack makes a V 30 at least
appear to be really solid choice looking
to get a new phone over the next few
months
if screen is important to you you gotta
take a look at the OLED screen maybe
it's not gonna sell you on the phone
itself but damn
does it look really good the screen is
super important to me and LG hit this
one out of park so the V 30 it's pretty
solid phone we're still doing our test
though anything you guys want to see us
check out in the full review leave it
down below and let us know mashup thumbs
up button really appreciate it or if you
didn't like the video there's
button for that so next time I'm John
