to you by Full Sail University what's up
everyone welcome back their pursuit of
Retton Jers riffs i'm heroes john Retton
tears to show where i talk about
anything that's going on in my mind
world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside of it up this week i
want to talk about waterproof or
water-resistant phones and what they do
to those gorgeous gorgeous HD screens
I'm not a fan let's start riffing so for
this video I want to put Sony clear in
my crosshairs I haven't been that high
on Sony smartphones in the past the
Xperia z1 then the Xperia z2 which just
announced they were fine phones that
respect well I think Sony's UI is pretty
well done but the screens always look
dull and washed out like I put on like
17 matte screen protectors on them it
just didn't look as bright as a screen
should Sony's got incredible screen
technology they got really true deep
blacks I got their Bravia Engine these
screens should have looked absolutely
gorgeous but they didn't because Sony
decided to make them waterproof ish
water-resistant so there's a whole layer
that sits on top of the screen and then
I saw the Xperia Z ultra that
ridiculously giant monstrosity had
probably one of the best-looking screens
I had ever seen and I knew what Saudi
was capable of I wanted to know why make
it waterproof just let us have the
awesome gorgeous stunning beautiful
screen and hope like normal people we
don't drop our phone in a puddle or make
a waterproof variant for folks that are
maybe more accident prone or those that
live a more active lifestyle or live
from where where it rains and looking at
you Seattle can have a phone for them
but it just diminishes that gorgeous
screen technology also and maybe this is
gonna make sound petty I hate to have to
just undo little flaps to charge things
and open little flaps to plug in a
headset there's so many little water
resistant flappy things go into these
Tefo ins
I'm finding it very annoying galaxy s5
same thing it's got that water-resistant
stuff you have to have a flap to charge
it which I will probably just rip off I
haven't yet seen in person with a screen
looks like Todd is in Barcelona covering
it for us so you got a chance to do the
hands-on with it but I'm hoping the
screen still ends up looking gorgeous
but it's all waterproof
creig's I hope goes away of the 3d phone
craze of about a year ago where it's
sort of there in your face and forcing
it on you and then it kind of dies
slowly waterproof cases if in your
waterproof phone and you choose to have
your screen look less than awesome fine
with maybe I'm way off base here
maybe I don't leave to go anywhere I
forget my phone wet can pretty much go
from the office to the house to back
again and various degrees of grocery
shopping in between so I don't have much
of a chance to get my phone necessarily
wet but if I'm wrong tell me why I'm
wrong but I just think Sony's screens
are so gorgeous
and they're not living up to the
potential it's like getting a Ferrari
and they're taking out a fourth gear you
know it's there you know it's got the
ability to be awesome but you never used
to its full potential
I gotta interrupt this episode with a
quick a little shout-out to Full Sail
University obviously apps are huge right
now they're absolutely everywhere and
followed those little ideas that make
you stay I should totally make that and
code it but then you realize I don't
know how to do that well Full Sail
University's online mobile development
bachelor's degree program can actually
teach you how to actually make that app
from concept to post launch and even to
all the market and it goes into it even
better you can do the whole thing from
the comfort of your own home sit on your
couch in your jammies with Full Sail
University is online education program
with full sales mobile development
program you come in both sides of app
development for iOS and Android creating
your app with advanced programming
languages and launching and managing the
business of your app once it's ready to
go
but John probably ask yourself I don't
have a good enough computer to do all
those crazy lines of code it's from 1997
and it's like a Celeron plus it's all
expensive do you I say don't worry about
it because full sales project launchbox
program gives students a MacBook Pro
preloaded with all the industry software
plus iOS and Android devices ready to
make that killer app and you're
interested in learning more about full
sales online degree program head over to
Full Sail dot edu slash TechnoBuffalo a
back to the show so Sony maybe don't
make all your phones waterproof maybe
make normal variants for those of us
that might want the beautiful screen
instead I'm just saying please do me a
favor and I guys if I'm wrong which I've
certainly known to be from time to time
leave it the comments hello
gated right down where Lucy is can't see
her she's sleeping down there hope you
get your thoughts anyway guys until next
time I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo
