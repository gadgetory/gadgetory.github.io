brought to you by hostgator while how's
it going there jeez it's John Q here
from technobuffalo and welcome to what's
the apt hope you guys had a fantabulous
Halloween and if you didn't celebrate
Halloween that hope you guys had a
fabulous October thirty-first and it
happened to be a birthday that day then
a happy birthday today we are going to
be focusing on an application in the
productivity category my favorite
category so without further ado you just
sit back relax and get ready for some
WTA wonderless goodness oh yes I
mentioned Wunderlist in a previous
episode as an alternative to remember
the milk after that I started using it
in oh man is it wonderful wonderful
smell that you instead of an oh because
you know these just like one illus
that's you in there I did that because
I'm so witty smart clever and cool one
enlisted basically a cloud-based to do
and reminder system that can be accessed
via your phone tablet laptop and or
desktop the apps themselves are
wonderfully designed that simply scream
of elegance and web two point onus I
think it just made up a word right there
tasks are very easy to add and customize
under lists which of course can be added
renamed and or removed the absolute best
feature okay in my opinion would be the
ability to star items which more or less
works as a priority marker or a flag
very handy and micro organizing your
items for your day what I love about one
or list is how uniform all the different
platforms look which really helps
provide you with that sense are using
one single application however once you
strip away all them fancy designs and
customizable backgrounds oh wow I got
wood as my background I'm so fancy fancy
you'll start seeing a few shortcomings
firstly one of the biggest things for me
would be that the tasks do not have a
due date by default you got to manually
set that sucker a very small thing not a
big deal at all but but sort of a big
deal especially considering that the
badges only show do items versus you
know all items secondly you cannot set
recurring items meaning you can't set
something to repeat every day or every
week it's a bit of a bummer for me
because I like reminders
right then and there to you know take
out the trash attend conference calls or
do my daily 33 minutes of hot yoga this
one isn't really a big deal for me but
Wunderlist doesn't support tags which
can come in handy if you want a group
certain items such as videos air and
hamburger time and so on and speaking of
that oh so subtle reference to a show
called metalocalypse I'm gonna take some
time to thank our friends at Hostgator

at the checkout again that's hostgator
com and the coupon code TechnoBuffalo
techno is in the music and Buffalo as in
that big wonderful furry animal back to
the review overall even the one or list
isn't that feature packed at something
like remember the milk it's still an
amazing app and platform unlike rtm
wonderless doesn't have a feature
restricted free version or an annual
subscription based pro version you get
all of the features for free so with
that I'm gonna give this app a 4 out of
5 and did I mention how pretty this
application is man is a gorgeous well I
hope you guys enjoyed my review of
wonder list and if there are any
applications out there that you would
like me to check out let me know by
