technobuffalo this video I don't have a
phone or any tablets nothing's going
head-to-head but I do want to share some
site updates with you and I want to make
a pledge to you the past few years we've
grown tremendously and with that growth
I think comes responsibility now I know
we're just talking about cell phones and
tablets consumer electronics you know
we're not dealing with rocket science
your life and death information but
there's a lot of integrity both personal
and the integrity of the company at
stake so I want to make you guys a
pledge and a promise that any device we
review will always let you know how many
days we used it so if you read our
battery test for example you'll know
that we spent the time to make those
tests complete and to make sure that we
know how long a device actually lasts we
can learn the nuances of a phone or
tablet without having a rush review and
I've always done this we've always been
not first with our reviews because I
want to make sure I know how a product
works but I want to make sure you guys
know how long we be using the devices as
well so beginning with our last review
the HTC One will always disclose how
long we tested it so you know when we
talk about battery life that we put it
through the proper tests you know when
we recommend you don't recommend the
device that we used it and we understand
now this approach in the past has cost
us thousands of page views hundreds of
thousands of video views perhaps even
millions but it really it's something
that it's important to the company and a
tentpole of the integrated organization
now we don't have thirty thousand
dollars worth of camera equipment well
do the best we can to make the best
video quality that we can as far as
production value but the quality of the
content that goes into it the words that
are expressed and the words that are in
the article are really of utmost
importance when you read one of our
reviews I want you to know that we use
the device you can trust what I say what
the writers on TechnoBuffalo say that is
really important to me and if you don't
get your views from technobuffalo that's
fine but I challenge you to any other
site that you read or any other videos
you watch you challenge those video
creators or you challenge those writers
to make sure they disclose to you as
well how long they're using devices
there's a huge rush to get posts up
first to get video reviews of first for
SEO and I understand that that
translates the dollars for a company but
it's not fair to you it's not for the
consumer you're making purchasing
decisions based on things you read that
might not be
accurate you might read a phone review
on another site that claims battery life
is bad or good but they didn't test it
doesn't matter how long I can play a
video consecutively it matters how he
handles and everyday usage how it does
handling emails playing games and the
such and that's really what I want
technobuffalo to be about so I will make
that pledge to you that every video that
we put up do it the product or review
you will know how long we used it if we
do a versus video that versus video
should not come out before the review is
done you don't know a phone before you
review it we could put out HTC one vs 19
phones the date we got that first HTC
One but those are inaccurate and those
are dishonest to the audience and we
will never ever do that I use a phone
for a few days before I review it that's
fine but you should know maybe you
should put less stock in what I'm saying
or what that person might be saying and
I want you know that everything you read
or you view from technobuffalo has gone
through proper test that's important to
me and I want to make that pledge to you
guys and again I challenge you to ask in
the comments every video that you read
every article you read make sure that
author disclosed hell on the user device
so you know what to do with that
information whether or not you want to
put a lot of stock in and earn a little
bit thank you guys for watching thank
you for indulging me i am jon rettinger
from technobuffalo and i'll be back with
devices next time in the next video I'll
see you in the next one bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
