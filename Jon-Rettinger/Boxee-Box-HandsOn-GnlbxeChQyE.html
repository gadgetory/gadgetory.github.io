I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo what is in
the box this box is actually starting to
unbox itself so I had to kind of push it
back together to get it going in the box
as a box it's a boxy box
it's the Boxee Box from d-link the first
piece of hardware to run the Box II
software the d-link boxee box thanks to
the folks of dealing do you think system
C for sending this over review loner
psyched to have it part of my old series
we're doing on connected TV did some
stuff from the vizio tv with the V Apps
check that out very cool stuff couple
couple bugs couple flaws with it but
pretty pretty good implementation there
on an embedded system on a TV set here's
the reviewers guide also have an Apple
TV in the house and playing around with
that did not do an unboxing because John
already did a bunch of coverage on the
Apple TV but I will be doing some
coverage on as well you didn't need an
unboxing video but here's the Boxee Box
been out for a little while now a couple
months two hundred bucks is the street
price and new version of the software
just came out I believe some have to
check that I think they have Vudu now
which is pretty cool but the Boxee Box
on demand TV huge movie library play
your own stuff so you can load up your
own media on it as well as the streaming
media it's got a social component and
you know get tons of free entertainment
well we'll have to see about that
but the Boxee software has been out for
a while I actually hacked I mean hacked
I didn't do the hacking I just followed
the directions online somebody else did
the hard work on Apple TV first get
Apple TV a while ago and put box C on it
but there wasn't I don't know there
wasn't a whole lot that the platform and
then the implementation on the Apple TV
there wasn't a whole lot going on there
I was interesting to check out but not
too much there but now with the Boxee
Box its own dedicated hardware and then
of course the new software very curious
to check it out here's the box itself
very small it's again it's made by
d-link it smells like oh it smells like
like all sorts of plasticky chemicals
with the fluorescent green and then you
know meant to sort of stand if we can
get this on camera here
we use the black men to kind of stand
this way
so kind of a strange looking device here
but you know very eye-catching for sure
and then on the back you've got your
ports so you've got an Ethernet port for
land connectivity two USB ports HDMI out
optical audio out and left-right mono
audio out as well as your your power
input and then also in the Box in the
Boxee Box box we've also got the
infamous remote so you've also got your
power brick and then you've got your USB
cable
I mean HTMI cable rather kind of nice
think Lou did that so you don't have to
go buy one protip kids buy the cheap
hdmi cables it's not it's not worth
getting the fancy let's just get the
real cheap ones so here's the remote and
the remote is a piece of work it's got a
full QWERTY board on the back full
QWERTY thumb board and then on the front
it's got you know kind of your I mean
slightly more standard you know still
doesn't look like a normal TV remote but
from the future kind of a d-pad set up
here with a select button in the middle
play pause button and then a menu button
on the bottom but then full QWERTY
underneath and when I was doing the
Visio I guess some of the something you
commented on on YouTube and on Twitter
and stuff that the more expensive vizio
tv is the larger ones have a slide-out
QWERTY remote I guess so I could have
used that for sure on the one I was
reviewing but the Boxee Box with a full
QWERTY remote here so let's get this set
up on the TV power it up and see what's
going on with the software on the box
box and it looked like the the
resolution flashed from 40 P to 1080i
back to 40 P so we'll see what's going
on here let's get it started up here's
the remote again
korte side non qwerty side so we use the
non qwerty side will start so already
I'm enjoying the qwerty side of the
keyboard makes it much easier to type in
your password no numbers on the keyboard
no dedicated numerical keys I should say
instead you've got these alt keys so
your numerical row across the top which
you know too bad but also for safes a
space saving purposes probably makes
sense so we'll connect to the Wi-Fi
there is an Ethernet jack I don't have
it connected via ethernet right now just
because it was easier so we've got a
size this manually which i think is you
know I gave Google some grief about this
when I reviewed when I check out the
Google TV box for my own blog before I
start with checking a buffalo and you
know I'll get boxy the same grief here I
don't know if Apple can create a system
granted I know there's no web browser on
the Apple system so maybe that is part
of it but if Apple can create an auto
detect system for Apple TV you know I
think these guys should be able to as
well but what are you gonna look good
alright so new user create an account
here alright so account created all set
they just sent me a link to confirm my
address all that stuff so I may have to
go on to my email and I do that update
well update required I guess we better
do it always great when you get a new
gadget and you plug it in and you go
through the whole setup process register
all that stuff and then the first thing
you have to do is update it but it'll be
worth it I'm sure
alright so software update installed
took probably about three minutes I
didn't time it I should have timed it
but in but it took like three minutes I
don't know I ran back to the computer I
found the email that Boxey had sent me
all right we're in 720p now I found the
email box you sent me to activate my
account so I click that and Boxey asked
me to put in my name first name last
name in a photo or to connect via
Facebook so I kind of give me a Facebook
and then I got the thing about posting
in my wall automatically and stuff and I
was like well what if I start watching I
don't know like old Sesame Street videos
on boxy do I want those automatically
posted what if people think I'm weird
because I watch Sesame Street videos
or something so I may go back and change
those settings there any rate let's just
go through here
what I watch most start from the web my
own files or I'm not sure well always
choose I'm not sure alright so here's my
home and shows movies apps files watch
later friends sorry I wouldn't kind of
random order there but shows is
highlighted and so I thought of that
first got some videos down here
voodoo now available on box II which is
great
tekzilla is feature daily shows featured
Ted is featured the Jim box flicker
alright let's go to movies see what
we've got most popular movies Despicable
Me Inception social network now I'm
imagining social network is under voulu
yeah so you can rent or buy from 399
downloading the okay so now I have to
download the Vudu app alright well we're
not gonna do a full review here we're
just gonna do kind of a quick sort of
unboxing hands-on kind of thing so you
know I'm connected over Wi-Fi it is
connected to a cable cable modem my ISP
cable cable modem through my ISP I
generally get around 15 mega megabits
per second down so should be fast enough
for 4 HD video content let's watch the
trailer so it shown me only SD I'm
guessing that the trailers an ST
apparently I messed up with the aligning
the interface because that green box was
certainly off yeah and you can see over
on the side here
we've got more of a black bar over on
this side so currently I messed up with
the alignment probably when you were
watching the video of this unboxing
video just now you saw exactly where I
messed it up so I'll go back and fix
that oh it's a Radiohead cover alright
well there you go
okay let's go back and the nice
interface there on first glance so we
will go to let's see if we type in
TechnoBuffalo of what we get
oops I hit the okay so what this is
happening a few times now while I was
typing my fingers naturally resting on
the back here on the d-pad or the Menu
button and I accidentally pressed it
when I was just sort of gripping to type
so maybe I'm more of a spaz than you are
but that's something I'm gonna have to
get used to hopefully that's not an
issue
with the two side remote accidental
presses of the back while you're you
know thumb typing anyway hopefully darn
issue for you apparently an issue for me
so let's search hey look at that there's
John so is this like every TechnoBuffalo
got 13 videos powered by video so I
don't even know a video store Fizz so
here's the intro review the intro video
that we did introducing me to you maybe
you watch maybe you didn't maybe you're
still wondering why is this guy in
John's Channel so let's let's just see
what happens here it is not I don't
think it's really warm where I am it's
not 73 degrees here I don't think so
it's the YouTube website but now the
videos popping out interesting
I've got volume control just I'm
clicking the remote here and I was able
to fast-forward you can see the the
scrub bar down there on the bottom and
volume control that's kind of nice
wanted to mute that while John was
talking about my big bald shiny head
pause menu so okay so then I can stay
leave go to bright let's go to browser
and there's the the web browser so
there's a WebKit compatible browser are
compliant rather WebKit compliant
browser in I've got a cursor there I
built into the Boxee Box so I can just
use you know the Boxee Box as a as a web
browser if i want to instead of doing
the whole bhakti bugs thing but let's go
back and so now we're back into the
Boxee interface yep let's leave the
video and we'll go back here's the where
we were in boxy with the social network
so let's go to shows and see what's in
shows so all right How I Met Your Mother
where is this coming from is this coming
from CBS now I've got three episodes
from season six and they're random
episode 3 episode 6 episode 14 I'll fan
cast
okay so fan cast I believe is comic or
Comcast is now calling their websites
confusing they've got Xfinity they've
got Comcast and they've got fantastic
so ad-supported hit the button see what
happens
yeah so now it's taking me to the
Xfinity TV website
I have Comcast a lot of I'm on Comcast
ISP here my cable modem is the accom
cast so that's why I have access to the
fan cast site here even though it is ad
supported so that I have to manually
click I would assume yeah so I manually
click and now it pops out oh no now it
took me to iTunes Wow
oh I see I clicked on The Amazing Race
ad and it took me to the iTunes site ah
interesting
alright I'm gonna have some I'm have to
dig in here and get used to the Boxee
Box because there's some things that
seem intuitive some don't I think that's
just the nature of web the crazy world
of web videos right now we've got Apps
YouTube Leanback Pandora Vudu VEVO rev3
Ted all that stuff wired see net very
interesting those of you who've used
boxee box before can you tell I'm a
sports that I'm going to nba.com instead
of geek brief with Cali Lewis what's
wrong with me right but you know
whatever
those of you who've been using boxy
bucks for a while and it's old
incarnation like I said earlier you know
I hacked it onto my Apple TV I use it on
my laptop you know my first gen Apple TV
like a year or so ago but I haven't used
it in awhile but those of you who are
used to it you know love to hear from
you in the comments on the website you
know Tecna Buffalo comm wherever on our
Facebook page with your insight into you
know how you feel about the changes in
the Boxee Box UI here the Box see you I
should say not just on the box but in
the meantime I am going to go get
comfortable with boxee box with how the
software works or anything I'm seeing a
lot of you know UI overlay that kicked
me out to the website a lot of Reliance
here on the on the web kit and
apparently flash compatible website I'd
like to find out a little bit more about
you know what the deal is with that and
and where you know get a better handle
on where I'm staying within the it's a
UI and the video shows up part of boxy
box versus it's the
you I and I click and now I'm on the
website and then I have to figure out
how to make the video go fullscreen kind
of thing but I'll make this go
fullscreen we'll leave you with some
inside the NBA
EJ's Neto stat of the night and get this
fullscreen fullscreen
go there it is alright so next time my
name is Noah look much much more on the
Boxee Box and all the other connected TV
stuff we're doing over on TechnoBuffalo
and of course lots more than just TV
stuff and Tecna Buffalo believe you me
as some old pro wrestling favor mine
used to say till next time thanks for
watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
