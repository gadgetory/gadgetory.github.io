technobuffalo here it's been a very
Android heavy past few days I thought
I'd sort of continue that trend one more
day this is going to end the Android
coverage of the week but I wanted to
show you google earth that was just
released for android 2.1 currently the
only supported android 2.1 handset is
the google nexus one but if you have
unofficially upgraded your phone to 2.1
i suppose you have access to this as
well it was came out i believe yesterday
which was a 22nd and it's a free
download in the android marketplace let
me go ahead and jump right in show you
what it looks like so there is a google
earth magic had an iphone or ipod touch
you've had access google or for quite a
while first time that it's come to
android devices perhaps surprisingly
sings that's a Google product so what
you'll see is a very familiar with
Google Earth with the pinch and zoom
there's your globe you can spin it
around we've got the ability to fly in
two different locations i'll show you
some of the menu choices so you can
search my location settings layers and
help i'll show you what those are as
well if you pick something like my
location you can see it sort of in
effect can see all the fly-ins I really
takes advantage of I think the graphic
acceleration in the nexus one and you
can see right where you are and of
course you can continue to pan around
sort of the globe format there's a
compass at the top to sure to help you
through orientation you can see the
horizon right there go and chase on the
other options that you guys are going to
get you want to search you can go ahead
and search for whatever you'd like i'm
running a strange sort of cooked rom
here so when i try and search something
my spacebar is not there but i assume if
you're running a standard android 2.1
build build a search for whatever you'd
like so there's an example pizza you can
search you get sort of the google maps
functionality built into google earth
let me show you what else your choices
are go back you also get pulling some of
the layers from google maps so places
businesses panoramio which actually
pulls in pictures of points of interests
and landmarks wikipedia kevin pulling
roads borders and maples and terrains
are your standard mobile google earth
stuff if we go back one more
you can check out some of the settings
which aren't as much as you'd like you
can click clear your data or about
Google Earth now you don't have let's
say the tilt and zoom functionality that
you get on the iPhone their iPod Touch
versions but you are getting a nice
Google Earth experience I'm not sure the
utility of Google Earth on a mobile
device it seems more just something fun
to play with you do get access to them
at 3d terrain and that kind of thing
it's nice to sort of fly over but
outside of that not too sure what the
usefulness of it is and of course will
rotate into landscape mode as well it's
fun you can sort of see directions I
guess in a different way but what I run
out and download this or try and force
my phone to get 2.1 to get access to
Google Earth Noah I definitely would not
it's just one more compelling reason to
one more sort of bit as to why you
should Hollinger carrier to upgrade your
android device officially to 2.1 there's
a lot of features that you get with 2.1
that you should be entitled to so anyway
that's hope you enjoy this a real quick
overview here of Google Earth for the
nexus one hope you've enjoyed the
Android coverage of the past few days
i'm jon rettinger and i'll see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
