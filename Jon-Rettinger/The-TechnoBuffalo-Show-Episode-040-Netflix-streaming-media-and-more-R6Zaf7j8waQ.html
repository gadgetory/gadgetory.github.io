Buffalo show as always I'm I'm your host
for this week Shaun ani editor-in-chief
of techno Buffalo and i'm joined by
deputy managing editor Todd Hazleton
everybody are you doing today Todd I'm
good you tehe good yeah I was just gonna
say you you have a new addition to your
family i do i just got a mini dachshund
puppy and she's in my lap in case you
seen anything yes sleeping that's the
only reason I wanted to bring it up in
case you see Todd looking down a lots
because there's a very small puppy who's
asleep right now yeah but so on this
week's episode and just for a little bit
of clarification Todd and I you know
each week we talked the day before the
show you about what we want to discuss
and we will be bringing up the s6 and
the s6 edge but the reason we decided
not to make them the focus this week is
that we've already talked about them
extensively so we will be bringing them
up but we wanted to do something a
little bit different there's been a lot
going on this week and last week as well
about the state of the streaming media
industry and you know there's been all
sorts of new studies and I find it
fascinating what one of the facts that
came out there there was a big study
done by Nielsen where a lot of this
comes from and one of the big facts that
came out that just blew my mind was that
netflix has that now more subscribers
than HBO yeah that's unreal I just blown
away by that and the numbers estimate
that there's 40 million Netflix
subscribers and there's 30 million HBO
subscribers and that puts Netflix in
thirty-six percent of the homes in the
United States yeah I that's just
mind-boggling to me because I mean you
know as I go out I talked to people I
often do you ever have anyone say did
you catch such and such on Netflix not
often but i think the latest i've heard
is like have you seen you know peaky
blinders it's on netflix no go watch
that but i haven't had like no like
where i guess you could say house of
cards but nobody really says that it's
always like oh like HBO Game of Thrones
you know it's weird exactly
he's getting popular because sorely
getting in that market yeah because as I
think back you had shows like The
Sopranos of course the wire uh you know
now Game of Thrones you know you hear
people talking about those all the time
but you and yes you heard yes like the
reason I bought each view yeah house of
cards is the exception you do hear
people discussing that but you don't
really hear very many people discussing
like peaky blinders or which actually
will now see peaky blinders and just to
get all correct hear first hand grinders
was Netflix here in the US it aired on
television in the UK right right right
right and whenever I go over there you
know around Christmas time they put all
these DVD sets out for massive discount
sale for the Christmas season man were
they pushing peaky blinders last year I
couldn't go in any store without seeing
the peaky blinders DVD set wow that's
interesting because you know I never
even heard of it until someone here was
like it's on netflix pretty good show
they stumbled across it yeah I haven't
had a chance to watch it at my folks
watched it and they absolutely loved it
yeah lucky but uh I did I just I watched
all of unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt um
which I really enjoyed that one
fascinating me because that that's a
great example of Netflix being a whole
new system that was a show that was
supposed to be on NBC had been announced
for MVC and was put on the schedule and
then they pulled it after the pilot
episode and released it oh say you know
go do what you want with it we're not
going to pick it up and Netflix
immediately swooped in and said we'll
give you two seasons right and so that
was now technically a netflix original
it was not developed by Netflix
interesting you know what's really neat
to about this and you can see why
Netflix is taking often it's because it
costs you know 79 98 99 whatever a month
and you don't obviously you don't eat
cable but with HBO until they made that
announcement with Apple during the
spring forward event in the Apple TV you
know you had to have cable and then you
could buy HBO unless you get somebody's
HBO Go password
in which case you know the CEO said he
didn't even care people were sharing him
because he said we're in the business of
addiction which is amazing but you can
see why I mean maybe HBO's numbers will
pick up once people don't you cable well
and see now the thing with HBO now that
I find so frustrated I I'm fascinated by
the concept but you know if it come in
at stated like 999 I would have picked
it up immediately but you know we're
hearing 1499 that's just too much to me
for one channel that is primarily yes it
does have shows like games with Game of
Thrones and you know the backlog like
true blood and all that but at the core
it's still good to be a channel that
shows movies that I didn't want to watch
when I paid for it on cable right
exactly exactly i think it's a little
too high priced I mean especially if
you're a cord cutter and you're paying
for say you know Netflix and then you're
also paying for sling TV and then you
add an HBO now and then all of a sudden
you know you're still paying a lot of
money it's not as cheap as it looks and
sure you're picking the channels but
you're also missing the ones which I
actually like to do sometimes on TV I
just you know go through the channels
and see what's on and you know maybe
there's a fishing show on discovery
channel and I kind of like that about
having a huge oh well that's yeah that's
one of my problems at night you know
whenever I go up there to go to bed I
always you know I'm going to watch
something on Netflix or Hulu before i go
to sleep and that there's something to
be said for just story on the TV and
they're already being something there
it's all end up spending 10 to 15
minutes flipping through going and i
want to watch that how long is it
exactly that's my problem yeah yeah
exactly you know you know now of course
tight you know i do use my watch list
extensively but still yo you're looking
well okay well that's that's 43 minutes
that's a little bit longer than i'll
probably be awake yeah you know it takes
forever by the time you're dead deciding
you could have finished whatever you're
going to end up watching exactly i'm
spent you know a half hour with my wife
like you know what movie should we watch
on netflix we're going through and
like all right let's just put on the TV
yeah see what's on yeah exactly now what
was interesting though also about the
study is that not only did we find out
you know kind of and no these numbers
are official by the way this was a study
so the thirty-six percent of homes in
the u.s. having not flex that that's an
estimate but Nielsen's known for getting
that sort of stuff correct but we are
optimally she also found out that they
are okay I'm sorry yeah I saw me freeze
I hoped it wasn't happening on your side
so anyway real quickly thirteen percent
of homes have amazon prime six and a
half percent half who now of those
though what it also found out that was
only ten percent of subscribers
subscribe to two or more and only
two-point-six percent subscribe 23 or
more intercell i I'm of the two point
six percent although includes amazon
prime now because I've got netflix and
amazon prime people are probably right
in the scene but right but yeah what my
guess is a lot of people probably don't
realize they have amazon prime hmm
because the numbers don't match up with
how many amazon prime customers there
are right so I think that I think that
on that number it's a little shaky but
you know people that actually access
amazon prime it's ten point six percent
okay oh ten percent yeah it's true i
mean i hadn't even um really gone into
instant streaming stuff until I found
out that workaholics the TV show I
really like is on Prime and then I went
through and I was like well there's a
ton of stuff but yeah I don't know if I
don't find you know it is welcoming as
Netflix maybe no it's not I fully agree
to you and a lot of that is the way
their menus set up mmm it's nowhere ZZ
so like if I you know let's say I go to
house of cards on netflix you know it
comes up and shows me season 1 season 2
season 3 all right there with Amazon you
have to go find each individual season
right
ayo now once you get into a season you
know I've got currently and I've always
admitted this I work out to cartoons
because you don't have to think ah so
i'm currently working my way through
super me in the animated series and i
put season one in my watch list and now
once I've got that my watch list now I
can navigate to the other seasons right
you know that way but it's the Amazon
interfaces know where is welcoming as
Netflix is for sure and who's that
interface is not welcoming at all yeah I
don't use hulu on origin I just haven't
been real big hula fan for that reason
and the ads and stuff no now the other
day when you and I were talking though
you said that you're not a big TV
watcher yeah so I on estimate how many
hours a day would you say you watch
television Oh minutes honest I mean on
average because I don't usually turn on
the TV um at night i'll probably put on
a movie for the most part but i'd say
you know under an hour for sure well the
nielsen study found that the person
people without streaming media watch an
average of one hour and 57 minutes a day
people with streaming watch an hour over
average of two hours and 45 minutes a
day that's really interesting and easy
because there's no ads i want and i
think it's no ads it's also it's just so
easy to go oh one more episode oh yeah
that's exactly right oh I'll just cannot
hit in one more episode yeah but now the
number what's really interesting though
and shows that this is definitely having
an impact is that traditional TV viewing
is down ten percent in the past few
years hmm so yeah people are definitely
moving towards the streaming model right
which is why you can see he should be a
wine to go off on its own and all these
services you know slim TV for example
seeing that means and hey we'll hear
that market well I think though that
also speaks to it came out yesterday in
a new york times article that netflix
last year spent 243 million dollars on
original programming
this year it's estimated to go up by
eighty eight percent to 450 million
dollars wow that is a lot of money to be
spent it on original programming yeah
but I mean you can see it works because
I feel like a lot of people were we're
hearing about house of cards they're
like oh I got to get netflix and stuff
like that so it's you know bringing
people into that ecosystem right you do
hear about orange is the new black but I
mean then their shows like you know my
my family loves lillehammer probably
because we're partially Norwegian it
takes place in Norway and what's
interesting that this is really really
interesting in this came from another
study they read that lillehammer does
not do that well here in the US for
Netflix but over in Norway where Netflix
is seventy percent of Netflix
subscribers watch Lillehammer Wow huh so
while it may not be doing great here
it's doing great in other territories
right you know so it's it netflix is
always going to be a strange beast and
how to measure it yeah but that's the
thing that's compelling to because birch
is a cable network where you know you're
against a new york city and you have two
other competitors let's say it's verizon
fios time warner cable and comcast and
you have you know maybe one has some
exclusive content or the others and so
they get subscribers but then you have
this global sort of approach here where
Netflix can you know they can launch
something and be like well maybe it's
going to be popular you know over in
Norway and won't be the US and that's
fine yeah millions of viewers yeah
exactly well we're getting quite a few
questions here about streaming media and
no I have not forgotten thank you to
such an ball for sitting me an audio
file that told me how to pronounce his
name finally at least I had the last
name correct but yes happy birthday to
such a bahala does birthday so happy
birthday to you but we're getting a lot
of questions here about streaming media
and this one we very kind of touched on
which streaming services Netflix Hulu
Plus play music all access
scribe to which ones you use most often
for me it's i subscribe to netflix and
hulu plus I I have amazon prime instant
but I don't really count that because i
buy it for amazon prime site for the
shipping yeah the videos of bonus and
the only music service type subscribe to
is Pandora I have netflix and then i
have a google play music because i'm
testing it on android phones usually
although they have that device limit
you're locked to 10 and then you can
only remove one device from that list of
Acts accessible devices once every
quarter which is really annoying so I
actually reached out to google recently
and I know I'm going on a tangent here
then they do they do clear your list
once every year or no just once ever but
it's nice to have that option and it's
frustrating when I have to do android
reviews but so that's why I pay for that
Spotify use it all day long every day
when I'm in the car everything so that's
like my go-to then I also pay for Xbox
music usually just when I'm doing
windows phone stuff so I'm using that
application foot and Netflix and then I
guess amazon prime so really i think we
could see why we both like the Roku so
much exactly wrong right there from uh
another question from such a baja which
you actually already brought up a little
bit earlier Todd is sling TV appealing
to you guys now full disclosure sling TV
actually contacted me back in January
and gave me what they refer to as
reviewers of counsel I i do have sling
TV for 12 months nice but i'm not paying
for it that being said if i had to pay
for it i would be interested if i was a
cord cutter I would definitely be
interested in it right ya see a couple
years ago when I lived in Manhattan I
was a cord cutter I just had internet um
and I I liked it but now there's so many
options and and these days actually when
I moved into my building they have a
cable package that's what's all included
in to me actually like we were talking
about earlier I'm most compelled to just
turn on the TV
browse through a couple things maybe
catch a sports game and then go to sleep
and otherwise surround a movie so to me
sling TVs not sort of up my alley but I
I love the idea I think it's perfect for
core cutters and i know i wish i had it
when I was a cord cutter back in the
city so uh this question just made me
laugh so hard from Sean the man before
Todd what I'm have you returned this
week none cuz I haven't bought any but
uh we'll see i'm sure i'll be tempted by
the Apple watching for any new listeners
out there that may not get that joke
todd has a bad habit of buying things
returning at the repurchasing okay it's
true oh they just kidding I know I'm
going off topic again um yes six edges
in in the irvine office and I have an
international unit here and that's neat
I'm not returning yeah well that's a
review unit so right yeah I'll return to
Samsung but not to this store a great
question here from such and bahal and
something we also touched on a little
bit also if you subscribe to some or all
of them why do you need to isn't there
one that offers the most or more than
others up here in canada we just
basically have netflix google play music
all access and show me and crave TV
which are like Netflix well see that's
the thing and i'll just talk about hulu
plus and netflix for a moment because
again i really don't count prime instant
videos it's an add-on but who is more
about television that's airing now and
netflix is a more about catalog stuff
right so if i want to keep up with
current shows then you need hulu but if
i'm only going to be watching catalog
stuff that no I don't need hulu right
you know so yeah there's a lot to be
they serve very different use cases both
of those now if I was going to buy
amazon prime instant video just for the
video i would not buy it since i already
have netflix because they do duplicate
ninety ninety-five percent of their
content exactly that's
sort of like the same question that
we're talking about google play music
and spotify mean they're so similar and
usually you'll find what you're looking
for on both I I pay for both again
because I'm testing google play music
usually on Android it's nice to just
have that option and I like to control
her from the Apple watch it or not the
Apple watch Android wear but i prefer
spotify because i love the sharing
features you know you can have
collaborative playlists i like that you
can just send a song off to somebody
select my buddy will send me one song or
off someone back that's why i prefer
spotify and of course both have offline
support yeah yeah from christopher miles
do you think fifty dollars is a fair
price for playstation views feature set
and channel lineup no yeah i'm not
really interested in playstation view
but again I think it's one of those
services where to start you know I think
there's Aang like here let's get the
ball rolling on it and then they can add
stuff in the future but yeah right now I
don't think fifty dollars is a lot I
mean I mean it is worth it because you
get a cable package for fifty bucks I
mean your internets probably gonna be
pretty slow did depends on the market
yeah exactly but now I think fifty
dollars is overpriced for what it
currently offers right well we'll see
what it develops into down the road you
know what I'm gonna say is a nice thing
about all of these services though it
and against cable is these rental fees
right we're like I have to pay five ten
bucks fifteen bucks whatever for the
DVRs I mean that's crazy and I think
cable companies if they're going to
computer can have to you know eventually
get rid of those prices because maybe
you put a deposit down sit on while
you're ruining it but having to pay
monthly just to have the box in your
home is obscene my eye I don't I'm
struggling because i I do do so much
with streaming media that it's hard for
me to rationalize why I do still have
direct television ayo directv but
there's a part of me i think it's the
old school part of me that's just so
hard for me not to just turn on a
television there be something there mmm
you know also I i I'm the oldest member
of staff I I do remember the days when I
had three networks and you know there
was only twelve numbers on
dile of the television unless she
reached down and turned the UHF geo
channel selector which really only ever
left on one channel because that's where
your PBS was you know so you just it's
hard for me to go to streaming
completely and I there's a part of me
that desperately wants to there's a part
of me that's like no you're like an old
Fred yeah hang on you know has anybody
created and I think years ago I want to
say it was boxy and I remember if it was
quite like this but an interface where
you turn on the TV and maybe something's
already playing maybe it's something it
knows you liked right and it kind of
creates that and then compiles say you
know instant streaming from Amazon and
Netflix and Hulu into like a playlist
and maybe just an icon that shows which
I you know now I from believe it did the
boxee did send me a the boxee box right
yeah I have that two years ago yeah
which was the worst physical design of a
streaming device ever unless I how they
ever for those that never saw it imagine
a box up on one corner and the corners
shaved away so it has a flat area but a
box it's at this weird angle like it's
standing on a corner yeah how were you
ever supposed to incorporate that thing
into your home entertainment system not
at all I feel like they were just like
you know they had a design team it was
like it looks cool but it's not like it
does it was kind of like a giant screw
you to the consumers right it had green
edge too so it's like you know this
bright green thing on your control black
reason usually you know like you just
like your boxes yeah so no the physical
design that thing was horrific right I
never could figure out what they did
there a question and I'm oh I'm gonna
butcher this and I apologize right now
koushik barred were on dude I'm sorry I
I can't I can't even try I I do
apologize uh why do you think Nexus
player is unsuccessful what did it do
wrong
um see that's one of those things where
I haven't really used I know in irvine
they have it and you have 1c right yeah
I have one as well there are a couple
problems with it from the get-go and the
number one was it did not offer all the
services immediately the same problem
with the Amazon fire TV when it first
launched it it seemed very sluggish to
me it was not a quick device it had a
severe lack of services and the problem
is when you launch a product like that
the only thing that people are going to
see are the initial impressions and
reviews you know if you'll notice i am
not reviewed sling television yet even
though i have a reviewer account and i
did that on purpose because when they
sent me the account they told me we've
got x y&amp;amp;z coming within the next couple
months and I thought you know what I'm
gonna hold this is something that I can
hold off a little bit because it's a
service to not a physical hardware
device right and so I can let them
breathe a little bit before I review it
and that i will be reviewing it within
the next couple weeks it's crazy though
how much has been at it since we first
saw it see yes it seems like every
couple weeks really go this is coming
okay just let you know they had their
like news entertainment i think they
split those and it's two different like
lifestyle and use package yeah yeah and
that was the whole resigned besides hold
off because I I knew more was coming I
was like I can review it with its
initial like 10 channels right that's
the review that will exist out there for
life or i can let them breathe a little
bit and do it then and so that's why i
decided to do that that's what I think
too with the PlayStation view someone
was saying is fifty dollars too much and
maybe for right now but we don't you
know there's probably more channels
right so and that's a luxury we have
with the service compared to a hardware
devices that's true because you know
with hardware we know that you know
there's going to be an update you know
12-18 months down the road so you need
to get that initial review out so the
nexus player all the reviews that came
out or just like there's not enough here
right and that's what people are still
seeing when they
look up reviews so I think that's been a
lot of the problem for the next aspires
that it's being judged on its launch
version right and it was sort of like
what so I did see it I saw it with
google in a controlled environment and
looked really neat that obviously but i
think it was also supposed to be sort of
a reference platform I know it's for
sale to consumers but for partners to
build their own devices and so we saw
nvidia come out with i believe they're
just calling the shield as well um and
that has their their streaming game
service on it so that's like an awesome
added bonus I think and I certainly have
my eye on that so to say that Apple or
the Android TV platform you know doesn't
work maybe it does work and just not on
that initial hardware and we sort of
have to see what the partners do with
that reference platform if we if we
consider it that way but I'm interested
to see to what developers to because I
didn't open up the apps and they have
the gaming controller and stuff like
that and to me that seems really fun no
I I agree I I would love to see the
potential being taken advantage of but i
think it's another situation of the
chicken and the egg you know developers
don't want to develop for a platform
where there's no consumers and consumers
don't want to platform where there's no
apps right exactly that's the problem
and developers have to choose between
you know that and the fire TV and other
things like that so yeah great question
here from Dean Norbit why do these
services Netflix Hulu come so late to
Eastern European countries I'm from
Romania we have good internet speed we
are fourth in the world for internet
speed and we don't have none of those
services hungry for an for an example
has Spotify we don't I think a lot of
that has to do there's two things that
has to do with really um number one
being the licensing situation an
expensive because every territory these
companies have to go out and they have
to negotiate new license deals so just
because Netflix owns the rights to say
they just add third Rock from the Sun
here in the US so just because netflix
has the the rights to 3rd Rock from the
Sun here when they go to another country
they'll have to negotiate for those
rights again mm-hmm so there's every
chance that potentially in Romania that
there you know there's excessive
ease it's hard to say without knowing
more details it's also a matter of
having to roll out the infrastructure
hmm you know because netflix has to set
up servers close to the physical
proximity of where you're going to be
watching so right there's two there's a
lot of reasons that's possibly rolling
out late I honestly I feel for you I
wish you guys had netflix I wish
everybody had netflix right yeah me too
and it's kind of a pain to like when we
travel for work when I was in Barcelona
and you get back to the apartment you
want to open up Netflix and then it's
like this is not supported your country
so there's ways around Todd yeah I know
I know that you have ways around it but
when i'm sitting here enough alright
then i'm just going to bed what you know
although oddly when i was in england I
discovered I could just login to netflix
UK with my account it'll let me watch
Netflix UK yeah that's pretty awesome
yeah so midnight the spain nut maybe
Spain doesn't have netflix yup yeah I
don't know we were both trying it ron
and i were there our video guy you're
both like in and then you weren't awake
yet i don't think because I I'm
different I was like why didn't reach us
what I know I know you got to do it it's
called VPN is awesome there I i I've
outed myself a I use VPN to watch
Netflix wherever I am hey I pay for it
why not mm-hmm from such in Baja will
there be an Amazon fire TV second
generation I probably um yes a similar
question a couple weeks ago about the
fire phone who where Amazon basically
has a dress that they're gonna you know
try to enter that market again whether
or not that changes I don't know but
they did you suggest slit on it you know
right right I we shun the man 34 is
asked this question every week for a
couple weeks and so I even though it's
off topic we've got to answer for the
poor guy what companies would you like
to see Apple purchase oh man yeah that's
part of the reason it hasn't
answer because I keep trying to think of
an answer yeah it's got a lot of money I
mean I remember back in the day I said
Spotify but that was before the beats
thing went down I'm right I don't think
anyone saw the beats deal coming yeah
especially because at the time when we
were talking about you know apples
getting streaming music it was still
pretty much with HTC remember HTC owned
beats and the licensing and that kind of
died out and I just saw recently the HP
which was including beats branded stuff
like the speakers and stuff is now
switching Rica obviously it doesn't want
to have an apple brand on its products
it's laptops but what would I like to
see Apple purchase I a social network
but it'd be way too expensive I I don't
know I mean apples done a really good
job of choosing smaller companies that
are not obvious right I think that's
part of the beauty to the system of what
they're doing because if they it's like
when Walt Disney but built Disney World
he set up a whole bunch of shell
companies to buy all the land because he
knew if he went in as Walt Disney yeah
everyone was going to jack up the prices
for what they want so if it's an obvious
company for Apple to buy the price even
though they have a huge war chest the
price is going to skyrocket to a point
that doesn't make sense for Apple
exactly yeah so that makes it a little
difficult to say what they should buy
because it's going to have to be
something that's not horribly obvious
yeah well we did you see yesterday it
bought a company I think was foundation
DP a database company and analysts were
saying you know this could help improve
I message and stuff like that so you
have to think well you know that's not
very sexy that's not a great company you
know why dapple do that but on the back
end like maybe it helps I message
perform better or maybe they can add new
features to it and stuff like that and
then you know that's that's good for
consumers in the long run so you can see
why it happens I don't know I don't know
who I'd like to see it but I have talked
to you know a couple times about Google
and who would I like to see them
purchase and you know you
they have all kinds of projects with
Google X and stuff and I often wonder
what about cyanogen and they could you
know apply that team to rebuilding you
know a lot of their products but who
knows obviously I don't think their
blade latest I saw this I engine was
looking to do non google play services
stuff right so yeah it seems like
they're branching further report yeah I
I don't know what they're going to do I
don't know I I because I would have
never thought about them buying a
database company right now so uh from
Christopher miles he asked will there
ever be a 2nd gen apple TV well yes
there was a 2nd gen apple TV I'm 45
actually I I looked it up while we were
talking here and it looks like actually
the current one is the sixth oh yes oh
we've had a lot yeah the last update and
I've been wondering about this last
update was in march two thousand twelve
which this is the longest I've ever gone
and yes I'm using macrumors buyers guide
it's been 1097 days since the last
update on Apple TV um technically 17
days because of the price decrease but
that wasn't a hardware that's right um
the latest rumors say Worldwide
Developer Conference in tune yeah I I
think there's a new version cut there
has to be there has to be a new version
in the pipeline yeah I mean usually when
you see a price drop like that it's to
get rid of sort of the older units and
so between now and June march april may
june that's four months of sales get rid
of what they have in stock replace it
with the new one and maybe that
streaming TV service now that we've
heard about yeah I I think there's one
coming I just I don't know exactly what
it's going to be and I feel like it
would be good and we've thought about
this too for apple tv2 sort of serve as
the center of the smart home so you
start to wonder are they gonna call it
the apple TV are they gonna call it
something else and just you know have
all the functionality and more I like
the App Store we've heard about and
have it sort of as the center you know
for control your temperature in your
lights and all kind of stuff because
they do have home kit which is exactly I
I think it's good i think that's why
there's been a hold on the apple tv's
because it's been waiting for her home
kit to be fully out there right and the
first products i think are set to launch
really seem like this spring and summer
yeah from joe j i've been testing out
cord-cutting loving it so far sling TV
is great does crash here and there might
be amazon fire TV s fault i will say
from using out my roku has never crashed
so I I would say that's probably an
Amazon fire TV issue but I mean I
haven't used it for like hours and hours
on end but i have used any everyone so
i'll see like it goes a little digitized
but I've never had a full-on crash Oh
like when the signals just been yeah you
know just like a burp in the the
internet you know hmm also from joe j uh
what are your primary phones and are you
guys all switching the samsung now no
we're in a situation where it's very
rare for us to ever hold on to a fun for
more than a week or two yeah we we
constantly are and no we don't have just
giant piles of phones laying around we
send them back but we we are constantly
rotating our phones because the review
units that come in but which this is a
great opportunity so Todd you you've got
the the galaxy edge sitting there with
you the galaxy s6 edge yeah I just put
my sim in it won't be my daily driver
really know because it doesn't have LTE
but I am gonna play with it and the only
reason it doesn't have LT is because
it's an international model should buy
up the right radios for ya um but you
know I was just on vacation quick
weekend getaway I was in Florida had the
HTC One m9 so I used that for that trip
and you know I've been using the note 4
and the note 4 edge before that so
really like you just said you know we're
going through phones pretty quickly I
think I think before the m9 and after
the note 4 i was on the nexus 6 / little
bit i think as of last week when you're
on this podcast you can see how quickly
we change then iphone 6 plus I
too and the thing with that is it's kind
of hard to move that sim around only
because it messes up I message yeah an
issue for a long time so I usually try
to just keep one phone number on that
but always carrying two phones and so
windows phones been in my pocket to you
lumia 930 so yeah I'm not sure John even
owns a phone haha he doesn't have a
primary I don't think he's good there's
some of your viewed it's that big nose
through fishing today he might I don't
know hey I don't think I've ever seen
the man holding the same phone talking
with iphone 6 plus when that came out
over the iphone 6 or maybe he was vice
versa no I think he did six plus he did
suck it was not his prime Brandon
stirred on six plus and then switched to
six right I did the opposite 626 plus
yeah I I can't imagine going to anything
under the six plus at this point yeah
for me for my daily driver in if you
listen the show you know that I'm a big
fat with me so even the edge actually
it's a beautiful phone I'm like whoa the
screens like not as big as I'm used to
but it's really nice Creed quad HD 5.1
inches which is crazy because years ago
5.1 inches was like massive yeah yeah
exactly uh from Sean the man 34 will
Apple keep the beats brand for the new
streaming service or a new name like
Apple music or Apple beats I they're
gonna attempt opium there somehow yeah I
think discussion was they were gonna
rebranded I wouldn't be surprised as he
had apple music that's what it sounds
like and if we saw it i think there's
news on the site that trent reznor from
nine inch nails is in charge i guess of
helping to build the app and i always
think it when i'm rewriting i like I
don't know if he's a developer or not
but man that development team behind
that must be like hey he's not building
it i am but i guess he's directing some
of it and i think there's going to be
exclusive album launches and stuff like
that on there but i think a lot of
services have exclusives you know
usually four days or weaker very it this
is a multi-layered question that i don't
think even Sean the man 34 realizes
do you think meerkat is here to stay or
is it just a fad I'm still not seeing
average consumers use this only in the
tech world thoughts now for those of you
that may not know what meerkat is it's a
new streaming service that allows you to
stream video to Twitter and carrying
South by Southwest everyone went nuts
about it South by Southwest is usually
where a lot of apps get their start to
printer actually God start really it
South by Southwest foursquare yeah
foursquare gowalla kohala yeah I don't
think meerkat is here to stay I think is
very definitely a fad i think is yet
another example I before I work
detectable I worked at a site that was
primarily focused on social and apps and
all that we'd get all excited about a
new service oh this is awesome this is
great in six weeks later even we were
like oh yeah that one yeah I what yeah I
I i have so many social media accounts
it's not even funny and because when i
worked there we were well-known so we
would rent out the second it wasn't as
we'd run out and sign up our names so
you got it right yeah exactly because we
didn't want someone to you know just
squat on our usual names you know so yes
I I have a bebo can if you want to look
me up if BMO even still is working I I
had an orchid account to uh uh high five
head high five I don't think I had high
five yeah I had high five so many though
oh yes it was ridiculous the thing I
think the idea of this is here right
like the livestream you people getting
on I don't know if it's meerkat and I
think the one problem from your cat is
while it's been popular Twitter today
just opened up periscope which is their
diversion they bought it in March and
they had taken a social graph away from
meerkat right during South by Southwest
and my thought is that while tech users
and the journalists and tech are using
your cat I feel like maybe consumers if
Twitter introduces the
to them that'll be sort of the more
accepted version of this this you know
live broadcasting which isn't really new
I get it though you can comment and like
things but her heart as you do on that
on periscope yeah I i I've seen so many
of these come through and there's
there's one guy who I won't name who I'm
sure RS Todd I don't know I'll tell you
there's one guy who I swear he he gets
so so into a service for like the first
three days and claims heads going to
change the world and then he never talks
about again it completely dropped off as
it just it became a running joke oh look
who's into this one losing this one yet
yeah I think it's like you see so many
going through like I'm York adding that
I'm reading this and it was just like
like okay you know like there's seven
people watching you eat breakfast like
that's stupid I'm sorry oh yeah it's
cool if you're okay so say you're at a
you know a big event maybe you know and
it's news like breaking news I love that
kind of power like here's live stream of
you know this speed sure this is
happening and I just saw like me like
that's cool right well you know and you
know it was also mentioned we had a
question here and i'll see if i can find
but youtube is supposedly going to be
getting into more that type stuff a and
a lot of people are seeing it as a
twitch competitor yo but i think there
is going to be more and more of a demand
for instantaneous video you know not not
sending it back to be edited and he'll
slap on your you know your slates and
all that and I think that's where these
sort of services are going to take off
but I also don't think it's quite ready
that the public is not quite ready for
this but yeah so and so how soon to were
at trade shows and I'm doing live hands
on
oh man I was in the year odd in a CES
2016 is still quite a ways away hahaha I
you never know yeah I mean we
experimented with it a little bit when
we did the unboxings for the iphone 6
and 6 plus you know and we did that was
before twitch establish the rules of
know non-gaming right content but we did
on twitch and you know we had people
that watched the entire day yeah that's
a good point i forgot that we did do
that yeah so you never know but uh well
folks we still have a ton of questions I
apologize but we are definitely coming
up on the end of the show and as always
we want to thank you for joining us one
last question here from Joe J so your
main phone is your test phones yes
usually yeah unfortunately and it's
great that's a good point because
sometimes it's kind of frustrating
because you really want to get into a
phone and use it and have all your
pictures there your music sword and like
really have it grow on you and at the
end of the day having a phone like that
is probably better than a camera or the
operating system or anything just having
your own personal device and you know
you don't always get that we def we're
testing them all but it's always fun
yeah exactly well as always thank you
