TechnoBuffalo here one of the great
things that palm and sprint are touting
about the new pixie is it sighs how thin
it is and how they've got a full qwerty
keyboard on a device this small and they
certainly have succeeded it's an
extremely thin very pocketable device
but with that thin small size or comes a
little bit of a worries people are
concerned about how the keyboard is
going to work can you type on a full
chorded keyboard this small so I'm gonna
give you a demonstration of how the
keyboard works and show you how easy or
hard it is to type now I just got this
device so I no means an expert but as
you use it more and more I assume that
you'll get more accustomed to the
keyboard however right now it'll be a
demonstration of how the keyboard will
work if you just walk into a sprint
store and pick up a pixie for the first
time so let's take a look at the
keyboard it is of course a full qwerty
keyboard with raised domed buttons the
buttons have a little bit of a tacky
feel to them which is quite nice and as
you push got a very clicky feel some
keyboard send to feel a little bit dead
this one definite let you know you're
pushing buttons and gives you a little
bit of a satisfying feedback let's go
ahead and turn it on and do a keyboard
test go and unlock the device I've got
the notes application right here ready
to go so i'll type a sample message and
we'll see how this works on try and go
as fast as i can
so this is a test of the keyboard type
to pretty quickly and completely
accurately which is something new for me
I'm not the most accurate typist on
mobile devices despite how much i do
type so i can't tell you that it's very
surprisingly easy to use the keyboard on
the pixi so one of the things that's
really a shop there with the device thus
far is how easy is to type one of the
knocks I had on the pre was the keyboard
it was a little bit small on a little
bit cramped because that's slider
mechanism we had a little bit of bumpers
on the side those bumpers are certainly
gone on the pre so you have some more
freedom before you can put your thumbs
and fingers so if you're looking to pick
up the pre one of the things you're
worried about was the keyboard do not
worry it's actually very easy to use I
recommend you go to a sprint store and
try it out for yourself one thing
missing though is still an on-screen
keyboard so you're limited to just to
what you can do with the qwerty board
and you guys hope you enjoyed it's a
quick demonstration of the keyboard on
the palm pixi I'll see you guys in next
video i'm jon rettinger bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
