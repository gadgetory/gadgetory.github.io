if you're watching this video on a
flagship smartphone chances are it's got
an OLED display in it and we're told
that it's better but what does it really
mean so the first time I saw an OLED TV
was at CES and obviously that's like a
kind of ideal situation but the
difference was really like staggering I
kind of me my first thought was Darren's
in the picture was kind of like the
first time I saw an HD picture it looked
really apparent all my analogies and
stories come back to sports but when I
watched a football game for the first
time on an HDTV and I could see the
blades of grass it was that staggering
to sort of see oh let's actually see
black and not just see kind of a dark
shade of grey that I've been used to on
a TV set it's probably not a spoiler or
surprise LG Display makes some of the
best OLED displays on the planet in fact
they're so good they make them for other
manufacturers even so they invited us
actually go up to San Francisco and I do
want to give them a big thank you for
sponsoring this video to compare how an
OLED TV compares against the flagship Q
LED and LED and LCD TVs that are out on
the market people generally don't buy
TVs that often and certainly you're not
looking at two TV sets next to each
other all the time you order one on
Amazon you go to Best Buy and you pick
up your set then you're done for a few
years but if you see the technologies
side by side if you see them up on a
wall you can notice the difference that
you wouldn't necessarily notice if you
were just watching your set at home what
Oh what essentially is a stands for
organic light-emitting diode and what
that boils down to is each pixel on the
panel is individually controlled to be
turned on or off and the off is where
you get to see those true black levels
so you're looking at actual black so
Game of Thrones just ended but if you
saw the Battle of Winterfell or maybe
you didn't see the Battle of Winterfell
because it was so dark that's an
instance where having an OLED TV would
have made a tangible difference for what
you can see
if to your eyes you couldn't see the
zombies you couldn't see the battle
going on it was because of backlighting
issues and you weren't getting that true
black that the creators kind of wanted
you to see in that battle that's sort of
one example where where old lead really
starts to shine if you're watching
movies with true black you're watching
like Star Wars you're watching anything
that's sort of you need those true black
levels it makes a tremendous difference
in the picture and also because you
don't have sort of layer on layer on
layer on layer on layer like you need
with an LCD set you can get these
displays crazy thin I mean I'm sure
you've seen these OLED displays that
look like I mean almost like sheets of
paper stacked on each other
they are so thin you can do more with
those displays and they could be they
could be bent they could be curved you
can do a lot more with an OLED display
and you can with anything that needs a
backlight so you've got a TV up on your
wall you probably got a character
sitting on another area that's important
is being angles you're not always
sitting right in the sweet spot of your
TV or your friends or family are sitting
around you the viewing angles on OLED
TVs are also really good I mean you can
sit really far off to the side and still
see the true to color picture and also
because those black levels are again so
black it makes the colors pop even more
by contrast if you holds a black piece
of paper up at a bright red piece of
paper up you can see the difference the
red starts to pop more than if you took
that black sheet away and that's kind of
one of the benefits you get with an OLED
set so LCD technology has been around
for a while the pixels on an LCD screen
can't let themselves up individually
they need a light source so you'll see
sometimes on lower end TVs edge lighting
around the side it's really apparent if
looking at something that's dark you can
almost see a border where the light
source is and on higher end LCD TVs that
lighting can happen on a smaller scale
in grids or matrixes matrices and
they'll light up as something is moving
across the screen and in most cases that
can look fine but where you can start to
see a difference it's again back to
those black lobes
you can see a ghost and you can see
trails that start
to happen as you are moving across the
set no matter what marketing turn you
hear whether it's LED LCD cue LED
quantum dot it's all some variation of
LCD technology those pixels need a light
source and while it's changing is how
those pixels are being lit up and what
colors being used to light up those
pixels so obviously I watch a lot of
sports I like action movies so I'm able
to watch a picture without ghosting it's
super important but again you're not
always thinking about your TV technology
and you don't really notice it until you
see them side by side so LG Display had
us come out to San Francisco to see both
flagship sets and both flagship
technologies on display to see what they
could do who was medical themed it
wasn't that they were using the Ola tech
for any medical or just sort of a theme
to show off the tech so the first thing
that we saw was kind of simulated eye
tests and they were using the latest
flagship 4k OLED panel and comparing
that to the latest 8k LCD display and it
was a black background and they put
letters and shapes up and as I sort of
faded away and came out you could
clearly see a difference between the
picture so as we saw these sort of
letters and symbols on a black
background they would go at varying
those of brightness at that point you
could clearly see the difference between
the technologies even if they didn't say
you know this one's OLED and that one's
cool ed it would be very good parents
which one was which
the second area was again kind of an eye
test but it was showing actual moving
images and both images that were being
shown they showed us was coming from the
exact same source it wasn't like gamed
to make one look better than the other
and again I insisted that I check to see
that both sources were exactly the same
but you again you could see a difference
the ocean looks blue versus the ocean
looking purple and instead of Pandora I
don't remember ever seeing a purple
looking ocean when you saw the sort of
green Firefly go through the back area
you could see more that was sort of
where that Game of Thrones thing came up
again I could see more backgrounds with
the OLED TV than I could with the cue
light it just looked almost gray whereas
on the OLED it actually
black because OLED TVs can be way
thinner you could do a lot more of them
so we've seen this technology in the
past since what manufacturers are doing
they're putting an exciter on the back
you actually get to use the whole
display as a speaker which is awesome
and it wasn't just the whole TV as a
speaker it was actually localized so I'm
looking at a TV set or in this case
facing away I could tell where the audio
was coming from it was localized so that
would translate to if you're watching a
movie and someone's talking on the left
side of the screen
that audio is gonna come from the left
side of the screen and same thing for
the right without having actual speakers
there it's using the whole display that
was really cool to see but I always tell
my kids is never touch daddy's TV but
they let me actually touch this one and
you could feel the display vibrate and
it was so localized you can feel it when
I was on the left side my finger up on
the right I couldn't feel it there and
as sort of the things we're moving
around you could track how that was
going that's another way that you can
sort of have a benefit with OLED tech
even if you you know use a sound bar or
you set up a surround sound system
and you never use that at least you can
appreciate a smaller set is generally
just gonna look better up on your wall
or on a stand so again I want to give a
big thank you to LG displays for
sponsoring this video
but then sponsoring the video doesn't
change the difference in the technology
OLED versus LCD and like in the real
world that Oh matters and seeing the
sets side-by-side and the same image on
both sets that was very clear which
technology gives you a better overall
picture so whenever it is you're looking
to get a new TV set you owe yourself to
at least check out one of the awesome
OLED options available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
