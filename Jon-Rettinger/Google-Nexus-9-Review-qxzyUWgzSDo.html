technobuffalo here at the full review
for you of the latest collaboration
between google and HTC this is the
lollipop rockin nexus 9 there are a ton
of great tablets out there can be hard
to choose from let's see if this should
be the tablet that finds away in your
bag so as I do with all my reviews let
me give a disclaimer I use this device
for six days before filling this review
Todd who did the written part which will
be in the link down below use it for six
days as well if you want more
information on things I'm going to talk
about if you want to see samples of the
gallery and just from get a bit more
detail again link down below to go to
the written review we tested the Wi-Fi
only models by doing this review in both
white and black which there will be a
difference as you'll see later on LTE
models are also available so you broke
this review up into six categories
obviously there's a lot we can cover by
thought these six are encapsulated the
whole tablet hardware performance
software camera battery file thoughts
and an official TechnoBuffalo score
let's get started so first we undertake
big difference between the white and the
black models offered by HTC the white
model is certainly a bit more premium
looking and feeling of the two devices
offering sleek metal edges and a smooth
though definitely not soft touch black
panel the Black Mountain other hand
though offers the same metal edges but
they aren't as prominent or shiny and
the soft touch material grabs
fingerprints like you would not believe
also if you push to HTC logo this is on
both tablets it definitely depresses a
little bit you can sort of feel it
moving just not as solid build quality
are used to from HTC the screen is an
8.9 inch QX GA which means it's got a
2048 x 1536 pixel display it's got a
kind of unique four by three aspect
ratio which I really ended up liking the
sharpness is solid but in general Todd
and I kind of agreed to display is far
from the best on the market and more
talking about screens one thing to keep
in mind there is a decent amount of
screen bleed here and it's very
apparently returning the device on see
the android boot logo you can see the
bleeding in from the top and the bottom
so for that in mind the screens are in
the sharp is what you might find on the
samsung galaxy tab s product line which
offers in our opinion some of the best
screams on the market and just didn't
give the same sort of wow factor the
screen such as sharp resolution often
does but they mentioned the screen is
very sharp that was appreciated in
certain areas like when I'm reading a
book or a magazine something you might
pick up from google play the text comes
to really nice and crisp and helps
alleviate the strain on the eyes it also
gets really nice and bright which i like
i like my screens big and bright the
screen is flanked by two front-facing
HTC boomsound speakers a deep dive by
the iFixit folk discovered that these
are the same ones used in the desire a
10 instead of the more high-end speakers
found HTC One m8 San was admittedly a
little bit Hollow although we were told
you okay with that given the trade-offs
those front-facing speakers moving
around the device you'll find a micro
USB charging port on the bottom two
volume buttons any power button on the
right side which also kind of felt a bit
cheap and hard to reach a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the top there's a 1.6
megapixel camera in the top bezel right
smack in the middle and an 8 megapixel
camera on the back of the tablet with a
single LED flash the camera does stick
out a little bit which kind of looks
funny but it's angled so it doesn't sort
of affect how the tablets it's on the
table it's like much more about the
cameras later alright next let's move on
to performance we already know NVIDIA
Tegra k1 is a boost the Nvidia shield
tablet is incapable of playing console
quality games the same chip is hiding
inside a nexus 9 Google doesn't really
show off its prowess however and all
something all developers have a chance
to do as apps take advantage of that
just ridiculous power so on the software
side as well you noticed an android 5.1
pop flies everything is blazingly fast
we opened up the task switcher and with
about 20 apps open flip through them as
if it was just nothing I had no issue at
all it's pretty impressive how far
android has come how smooth and drag now
runs and how first-class android feels
on this processor we had some issues
with choppy games on nexus 9 though an
update from google help fix that just a
little bit suspect though this is mostly
a software problem be fixed more over
time particularly since we know that k1
is designed to absolutely crush games
but I know you guys love raw numbers so
let me give you some specs Nexus 9
knocked up a score of ten thousand eight
hundred and forty-three in quadrants and
30 3993 in and 22 so pick bat for
whatever it's worth so more on the
software Nexus 9 s hardware and
lollipops are a match made in absolute
heaven lollipop runs and looks gorgeous
we've already gone into pretty deep
dives of Android discussing to change
the new features in lollipop so check
out those articles as well which will
link right down below in general though
you'll find that android 5.0 is by far
the best and most advanced version of
Android ever and kind of why shouldn't
it be red it's the newest one everything
has been refreshed their branding with
real design that creates a much more
aesthetically pleasing you I there's
small touches here and there I really
really like the light animations that
make the whole operating system feel so
much more smooth it's just incredible
how far and read on tablet has come from
honeycomb which was really not very good
multitasking is way more fluid as we
already discussed earlier and I really
really like the spacious and clean
keyboard layout it supports multiple
users increased encryption and way way
way more also I really recommend
checking out google's new calendar app
which is more refined color for and
robust than ever before which you can
probably download for your own android
device anyway we also really like the
new lock screen notifications which you
can finally interact with and we all
know before we start yelling at me
third-party options existed for a way
way WAY long time but sight to see these
on full bake and cook android right now
on that same note though the double tap
to wake functions another welcome
feature we've seen on other high-end
flexure devices um LG g3 um it's
convenient when you want to quickly
check in a vacation without having sort
of dig around for that power button it's
kind of hidden on the side so this
struck me as super weird there are some
software oddities living inside a volley
pop so gmail now supports all email
accounts which is great but Google still
includes your default email application
I like unified inbox it so I always use
that default mail app and I didn't use
gmail so I was excited I saw the
application I opened it up and all it
does is prompt me to open up gmail
that's it that's all the app does is say
you should open up gmail why why even
put it on there I just I found that very
strange its overall Todd and I agree
that Android has certainly caught up if
not surpass the visual beauty of iOS on
a tablet whereas once kind of clunky
looking it's now much from refined and a
app
salute pleasure to use so first let me
just say I love using the camera on a
tab but let me just get the out there
and full disclosure but if you had that
type of person likes a gigantic
viewfinder you will not be very
disappointed all those people looking at
your shooting pictures might be it takes
pretty good pictures if you want to see
more samples of how it looks hit the
link down below to our full review we'll
have plenty of samples up there's slice
to say if you want to take pictures it's
gonna be fine it's not going to blow you
away you know but won't take a quick
picture your kids scooting around it'll
do the job let's next talk about battery
the 6700 million power battery is pretty
solid in regular usage I easily got four
days regular usage is different for
everybody for me usually watching about
an hour to two hours of HD video on
YouTube generally browsing the web is
any email I've got two accounts being
pulled down all the time easily got sort
of full four days I'd probably have
gotten you in losing longer really where
the objective test comes in we're an HD
video playing on this guy we were able
to get nine hours that was with all the
wireless stuff turned off and brightness
at about fifty percent about 20 to 30
minutes to Rick google claims but if I
adjust the brightness I probably could
have pushed it so you can easily get
through a full flight and watch two or
three movies and still have a little bit
of battery left to tell your parents
that you got home so what's the verdict
on the Nexus night you couldn't tell i
kind of like it's a fantastic little
tablet i dig the size for me it's kind
of in between the size of what you get
with an ipad mini versus a full-size
tablet and i really like 24 x 38 aspect
ratio the software is obviously the
highlight here and lollipops is an
absolute treat although i'm not the
biggest fan of front-facing speaker a
battery life and overall smooth
performance so really sort of made up
for that this blight isn't perfect there
are way better ones out there but it's
not a complete deal breaker here at all
additionally in the area the back that
depresses when touched doesn't really
scream premiums HD you know usually been
known for over the past few years the
white model simply looks better than the
black one I don't usually say that often
sort of pick a color but if you're
trying to pick which device to get i
would definitely opt for the white one
although obviously going to come down to
personal taste mech design isn't perfect
but it's a great way to experience the
best of android 5.1 pop without many
sacrifices and you'll be guarantee
you'll have google's latest advancements
free and if any OEM bloatware this gets
a very solid eight point oh
