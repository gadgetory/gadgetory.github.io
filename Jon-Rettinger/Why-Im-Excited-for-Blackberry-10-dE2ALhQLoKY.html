technobuffalo here blackberry 10 is
coming although it's about a month and a
half away rim sent out invites saying
hey in january thirtieth come check out
did long-awaited much-anticipated
blackberry 10 see the software see the
hardware and hopefully get interested
again so i'll talk a little bit about
blackberry 10 i'm excited about it let's
get started it's a flashback to 2007 I
loved rim I was a dedicated blackberry
user as I'm guessing you might have been
as well we didn't have many mobile
operating systems before the iPhone
before android before all the modern
stuff we know now it was dominated by
rims operating system and of course the
blackberry that it was running on there
are a few of the upper systems out there
Microsoft had one that wasn't overly
intuitive and kind of confusing I use a
blackberry pearl several blackberry
curves and really back all the way to
the black and white days of rim so I was
really excited when the blackberry pearl
came out it was tiny tad smaller keypad
on it seemed like Iman topper to stop
racism at the time then of course the
iphone came Android came and everybody
forgot about rim they released several
nice phone since then of course 9900 had
that ball or awesome keyboard it had a
sort of webkit-based browsers that had
some multi-touch but just couldn't keep
up with what the other offers students
can do particularly in the apps and
development front yeah there was
blackberry app world was populated by
not the best quality of applications so
rim is now getting ready to unleash
blackberry 10 press invites went out
january thirtieth is the day we all
finally get to see it we've seen alpha
build beta build dev builds and all
kinds of other bills now ready to
actually see legitimate hardware so
rumor is we're going to have to
blackberry 10 phones one that looks like
a regular blackberry the physical
keyboard and a touch screen above it
dealer that looks like most other
smartphones nowadays hopefully not can
get sued but i'm guessing it's going to
be a rectangular slab it's going to run
their new blackberry 10 now which is
based on the QNX operating system so i
am really excited about blackberry 10
let me
tell you why so hear me out first before
you start Smashing and bashing rims I've
certainly done in the past as well so
used an iphone 4 past few years used
Andrea for the past few years user
experience has been relatively similar
it's gotten better but baptisms have
improved about a new features but the
user interface is still pretty much been
the same I'm excited for something new
I'm excited to try something fresh
perhaps I've been desensitized to
Android iOS phones but I really want to
try something new on I'm excited for a
blackberry 10 can do it does
multitasking so well it takes the best
of what webos did as far as the cars and
the stacks and so everything's off the
screen and adds the speed and the
hardware that webos never really had
with their pre line of products or of
course the pixi in there as well so it's
also gonna bring rims really kick-ass
email client and they're gonna have
blackberry tens awesomest as far as web
browsing video music store is going to
be in there as well you're going to have
blackberry messenger and just all kinds
of good blackberry goodness and stuff
people used to like some people used to
love ah but now being modernized a video
chat for example in blackberry messenger
is now going to be there I am hoping
that developers are going to flock back
to rim Microsoft had a similar situation
when they launched their newest version
of Windows Phone but they had very deep
pockets and paid developers a ass ton of
money to come over and start developing
for them rim doesn't have the deep
pockets anymore they do have what used
to be a dedicated user base and
hopefully those dedicated users that
have maybe since migrated to Android or
iOS are going to come back or at least
look at rim again and say yeah I want to
try this yes I'm just having a keyboard
rinse value has a great offering I love
rims keyboards I'm really excited for it
sort of a bold 9900 esque keyboard on a
qnx dial phone I just want to see it I'm
hope rooting for the underdog looks like
I'm rooting for Windows Phone i'm hoping
that black breaking rise from the ashes
phoenix tile and be ready to compete as
a really solid third offering system i
think they're mostly going to be
competing against windows phone for that
third slide oh they're going to be
touching iOS or android for many many
years to come but i do hope they find
their legs again
I think it's a company that used to
innovate they really know where to
consumer market for a while focus on
enterprise and really rested on their
laurels and lost or way by hoping under
fresh leadership Skinner bring fresh
devices on a fresh approach to consumer
electronics market particularly the
handsets so I hope brinke succeed what
do you guys think are you excited about
blackberry 10 e not as excited as I am
of course we'll have all the coverage
right here and TechnoBuffalo i'm jon
rettinger see you next video
