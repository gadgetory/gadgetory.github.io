TechnoBuffalo here the Galaxy Tab 3
laugh much like my own family comes in
various shapes and sizes up today we are
unboxing the big daddy the 10.1 version
Ashley unsheath the 8.0 a few days later
- go ahead take a look at this guy which
coincidentally is the first Intel Atom
powered Android 4.2.2 tablet let's get
diggin in so here we've got the Galaxy
Tab 3 box looking very similar to the
Galaxy s4 with that fake woodgrain we
got a picture that's having it on the
front and some specs on the back the
model we are unboxing if you're keeping
track at home is the gtp 5 to10 very
sexy name on that guy let's go ahead and
use the ice it's new again the
obligatory unboxing knife and we will
cut that samsung steel without slicing
my finger alright let's go ahead and
open this up and see what we are going
to have inside of this box have you have
a tablet inside just obviously we have a
tableau inside so here is the Galaxy Tab
3.0 looking oddly similar in design
language to the galaxy s4 push it off
the side for just a quick second and see
what else is going to live inside of
this box we've got another box that
lives inside of it we've got some Galaxy
Tab 3.0 Quick Start Guide stuff we've
got a charging cable it's pretty
standard microUSB and then we've got a
wall wart and same one that we saw with
the galaxy s4 stuff so I'll push all
those things off to the side and let's
take a look at this here tablet alright
so you were looking at Android 4.2.2
jelly bean but interesting thing here is
this 1.60 Gertz dual-core processor if
you're like me you're saying 1.6
gigahertz dual-core what is this 2010
this is actually the first Android 4.2.2
tablet to ship with an Intel Atom
processor so don't pay that much
attention to that dual-core business
here so continue our tour of the tablet
we got one big home button we got a
capacitive back button and a menu button
I've got a front-facing camera and a
sensor for sensing things the top of the
device we've got IR blaster it was real
grow SD card ports gonna live volume
rocker up and down and power I've got a
camera that lives right there on the
back and it is a 3 megapixel camera that
can shoot
10800 720p video rather camera on the
front in case you want to know is 1.3
megapixels so let's go over the
dimensions here it is 9.5 7 inches by
six point three nine by eight
surprisingly thin 0.3 one the fitness
also it doesn't weigh that much one
point one two pounds are looking at a
not super high resolution screen it is
1280 by 800 for 849 PPI this guy is
available now for about 400 ish bucks
it's got that same 1.6 cool dual-core
processor we just talked about 6800
milliamp hour battery with a seems
rather anemic now one gigabyte of RAM so
16 gigs internal but of course you can
expand that with a micro SD card up to
64 - 802 11 a B G and n Bluetooth 4.0
and it's available in two colors black
or white now you can guess what color we
have here I'm gonna go ahead pull this
off can all of your already screaming
that there are stickers on there so
let's power it on and see what it looks
like
the battery is non removable as you're
seeing you know with pretty much every
tablet here Galaxy Tab 3.0 you can see
Ralph in the reflection say hi Ralph
well let this guy boot up and we'll come
back here in just a minute to see if the
UI looks like so we've got this guy all
booty booted up and we are looking at
what's actually a giant version of
TouchWiz and right off the bat you can
see the screen resolution but you know
that going in and we were buying a
tablet like this so I'm not gonna knock
it for at all if you don't mind if you
can resolution it's probably gonna be a
pretty solid choice appears to be pretty
zippy but again all I'm doing is really
moving screens around let's see what
we've got in the apps apartment look
like there are quite a few of them so
some Samsung add-on we got chat on we
got game hub some samsung apps as
planners away for calendar I really
actually like the way they do the
calendar here I've asked planner name I
could do without but really you can see
a lot of stuff I like how they've done
the tabs for year month week day tasks
and lists it's a personal preference but
I really do enjoy it on samsung products
so Dropbox is a Samsung device when you
sign in you will get 50 gigs of storage
if you want
the s-voice is here because I know all
you guys love to use that voice search
chat on or watch on rather world clock
and YouTube I'll rest that stuff comes
right out of the box so it's been a
quick first look and unboxing at the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 version in
case you guys want to know what the
screen is it's a WXGA LCD so there's
that resolution for you
alright so let's do a quick size
comparison of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 little
brother the Galaxy Tab 8 point
what these suckers look like when they
are stacked and we made a sort of a
tablet sandwich without the meat you can
see the thickness on that is pretty much
identical I like the way the I'm really
on a kick for smaller tablet so I kind
of dig away the 8 inch feels but I know
a lot of folks preferred the bigger size
screen so you can have the option
obviously for both in the Galaxy Tab
