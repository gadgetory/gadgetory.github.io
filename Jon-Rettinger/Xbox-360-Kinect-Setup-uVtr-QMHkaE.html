TechnoBuffalo here since I first started
talking about the Kinect I received a
ton of questions about how easy or hard
it is to set up what cables you need for
the new Xbox versus the old xbox so I
figured since I gotta set this up anyway
we may can help answer a question or two
so I'm gonna show you guys how easy or
difficult it is to set up your new Xbox
Kinect
all right so we've got the Kinect right
here all the cables I'm not sure which
ones I'm gonna need they're not me I
don't think an external power supply is
going to be necessary with the new Xbox
but we will see in a minute if you have
an older Xbox 360 the Kinect will
absolutely work it does come with some
extension cables and adapters so the
Kinect cord goes in here
USB adapter and then power so you can
use this with any Xbox 360 there was a
bit of question whether not only worked
at the new one and it'll work with any
model all right so here is the Kinect
here is my Xbox go ahead and take off
the twist tie and connect this guy and
see what the setup process looks like
and then of course we'll do some
hands-on time if you connect and the
rest of that and business so put the
Kinect here up on top I'm going to go
ahead and drop the cord down the back of
my console stand here and pull it out
the Xbox 360 a bit of a squeeze
here's that court alright so go ahead
and plug this in go ahead and plug this
down and see if all we need is just deep
connects you want so here is the inch
box alright so here is the back of the
new Xbox 360 is sort of a nickname slim
and there is that connect port right
there here's my orange cable matches it
let's go ahead and plug it in so you can
meet anything else sort of looks like a
modified through this B cable let's see
if we needed power to connect I don't
see any lights on you may actually need
some sort of power cord plug my see my
table back in go ahead
all right so the connect is set up let
me say take it so let's go ahead and
turn on the television and see what
happens
all right sorry to figure it out this
works live on video together and it
looks like there's now a light blinking
on the Kinect so that answers that
question you do not need Nextel power
supply with the new Xbox 360 now up on
the TV I am getting a nice little
warning here asking if I want to update
my console because I've got a new
accessory so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that update you're gonna have to do the
same thing as well this is not the same
as the fall update that just came out
this appears to be a separate update
just for the Kinect so I'll go ahead and
let it do its updated business and come
back in just a minute all right so we
are all set up then update download the
console rebooted and it's asking me if I
want to continue my setup so let's go
ahead and do that all right a little
lead jumped away
make sure your sensor is position 2 to 6
feet from the floor place on a stable
surface you have problems later
all right the sensor is placed looks
like a pretty good location I think
let's go ahead and hit select all right
this process will improve voice commands
and the chart start by checking the
background noise when available at test
background noise all right so I'm gonna
shut up and want to do its test you guys
can see all this happening
my background level is okay that's good
make sure your Super Bowl and you set at
the level you used to play games so
check your speaker volume by playing
some sounds I don't send an internal
volume looks bad good alright let's go
ahead and see what this does to be yells
at me
a speaker volumes okay thank you for the
validation there Xbox all right this
will test the sound you help you or
interconnect your room your audio setup
may affect let's go ahead and calibrate
okay so I obviously had to be quiet
there I love when the Xbox barks out
orders microphone calibration calories
can complete you can turn up the volume
you can turn it back down
okey doke chat microphone kicked has a
built-in chat microphone for games Xbox
Live parties and I can hear myself get
yelled at by 13 year olds and stereo and
without the protection of a headset so
everybody can hear myself get beat you
want to use the Kinect for chat sure
it's turned on for chat connect alright
all I want to do is neck that's a pretty
in-depth setup process alright setting
up Kinect there's a lot to do with this
one little guy first stand up Luke you
know I am standing up put down the
controller Wow we had that know how they
knew I had a controllers beyond me make
sure the area is clear in front of the
sensor alright and now I'm hitting the
camera and in front of the sensor and
I'm not a freaking it's business out
only one person so now I think the
camera is as messy guy I want to move
the camera to a bit of a different angle
perhaps out of the sensors of you and
we'll see if we can get this thing set
up a little bit differently all right so
we'll go a little bit farther away
let's see if that alright and that seems
to fix the problem
alright stay there
I'm not moving connect way to interact
uh all right so let me select it off and
hold your hand over panel to select it
so I am just moving my hand around right
now we're going to move it to continue
and you see a little circle fills up
choose an avatar let's go and who looks
most like me know Justin let's go back
all right I'm just moving my hand right
here I'm gonna go back let's pick that
is my avatar with that creep dad's
mustache I would say so myself and done
like a little dancer you did alright I
think that we are now set up with
connect um pretty elaborate process to
get this guy up you going so now it's
gonna be sort of the standard Xbox
welcome just like actually done normally
it's no longer connected by I'll be
doing some hands-on stuff with the games
tomorrow and show you guys for what this
thing looks like so stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo for all of your
connectedness for right now I'm John
render and I'll see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
