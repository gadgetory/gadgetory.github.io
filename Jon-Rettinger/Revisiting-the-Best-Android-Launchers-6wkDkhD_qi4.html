you by domain.com welcome everybody to
this episode of TechnoBuffalo so you can
see there's something a little bit more
inviting a little bit more personal here
because I wanted to take a quick look at
a handful of launchers I know you guys
ask all the time what are you guys using
what's the deal lately I've been
something obviously I switch the phones
a lot and lately I've been trying a few
new launchers and I found myself going
back to an old favor but I wanted to
just kind of share with you guys a few
the cool features in the launchers that
I'm kind of all about these days so I'm
gonna try and keep this one short let's
get right into it right over here first
things first
Google now launcher I'm not a huge fan
of Google now launcher just because it
doesn't give you a whole lot of
customization options but the having
Google now right here is just so so nice
and so convenient and I do miss that
when I'm on other launchers now Google
now does something really cool that I
did not realize that it did when I set
up the 6p and when I set up to 5x before
I logged in and it synced all my apps
I did not realize they would also be
syncing my home screen layout on Google
now launcher and it even went so far as
to put icons on my display it's already
done now already obviously but they put
on icons on my display that were grey
showing me that there were apps being
downloaded still as placeholders from my
home screen so I thought that was really
really cool
now other thing Google now has is of
course the app drawer behaves as it does
in the new marshmallow not a lot of
control over what goes where though
obviously so let's take a quick second
we'll switch over here to one of my
favorite newer not newer but new to me
launchers action launcher it's been
around for a while too by its guy chris
lacy
he doesn't have called tweet lanes as
well I fall in love with action launcher
more and more every time I use it but
it's still got a handful of things that
are a little bit rough around the edges
for me so let's talk about action
launcher and see what's cool about it
now you'll see up here at the top it's
yellow super cool I love this this is
the quick bar you'll also see there's no
app drawer here that's because you've
got a quick selection drawer here that
you can zap through
in terms of the alphabet which I also
find super super convenient but this
quick bar of the top it behaves like
your Google search bar of course but it
also it also does a handful more things
you'll see that it's yellow that's
because it actually changes color
depending on the background so I've got
this background here Chandra LR uh from
oath of the gatewatch for magic uh and
it'll take that and it'll kind of
average out the colors and then select a
color for your quick bar that'll match
the background which i think is really
cool too nice little subtle small thing
but I really really appreciate it now
you might also notice there's not a lot
going on in the way of icons on my home
screen right here you'll see there's
only four that's crazy if you know me at
all I have a lot of stuff that I like to
keep accessible really quickly now
you'll see one just popped open one
thing that action launcher does that I
adore is you can create these things
called covers where since Instagram is
usually what I'll open up when I open up
that folder you can put on Instagram
right on top if you want access to the
rest of the folder swipe up on it and
then there's the rest of your stuff
which I really like and really
appreciate the other thing that uses the
same gesture is over here on destiny
you'll see there's a little icon down
there on the corner you swipe up on it
nope not that one if you swipe up on
destiny you'll see will do it really can
try to do this backwards you'll see this
is a shudder a shutter is just the icon
and if you swipe up on it it'll show you
the widget for that app actual app now
action launchers still like I said got a
few things rough around the edges that I
think could be a little bit better you
see some icons getting cut off here I've
got seven icons in the docks and stuff
like that but I really have enjoyed
using it I really hope that it can see
you know some weird little buggy things
like this it doesn't seem to be liking
the import that I did so there's a weird
stuff like that but beyond that it's
it's still a very customizable launcher
and I really enjoy it quite a bit now
last but certainly not least we're gonna
talk about Nova Launcher which is
probably my favorite launcher to date
and it is for a lot of reasons lets you
do a lot of stuff actually launches a
few these things too but nobody is just
so powerful and so customizable
so you'll see I still have four four
folders over here but you know slightly
less stuff in Oh shudders no no covers
like you get an answer action launcher
so I do miss that but what I really like
is the ability to have so many gestures
and so much customization to finger
swipes up
that's for your Nova settings I love
that let's go back to the home screen
let's say always for Nova Launcher
because they use it all time two fingers
down I have set to the Play Store to
check for updates or go grab something
really quickly of course has Universal
ok Google ok Google there it is support
and now you guys are also going to have
ok Google going off on your phones which
is super exciting Nova Launcher has been
my launcher of choice for a very very
long time and they really don't let me
down you've got a ton of customization
options in terms of your grid size
inside of the folder CC I can make that
a little bit bigger uh and they even go
so far as to normalize all of the app
icons for google standard in case a
developer has made them too big or too
small which I really really appreciate
no launch is one of those things that
can go into too deeply here for fear of
running too long but do yourself a favor
go check out both of these third-party
launches they're both fantastic they're
both have paid options if you want to
support the developer which I absolutely
do whenever possible but go check them
out they're on the Play Store they're
really really cool let me know what you
guys are using for your home screens I
would love to see there's any kind of
like weirder home screens out there that
I haven't tried out yet looking forward
to trying out Microsoft Aero which is
the new home screen that they've
launched as well again let us know in
the comments and as always thank you for
watching be kind of one another and I'll
catch you in the next video alright time
for your domain spiration that's right
this week we've got one of my favorite
ideas that I have not yet executed on
help me with my dot tattoo very popular
website or at least it's going to be for
people who need help getting rid of
their crappy tattoos it's a crowdfunding
site you can chip in and look at some
photos of some terrible tattoos if you
have terrible tattoo you know how bad
that might be next up your casa es mi
casa you can start a very popular in
spanish-speaking countries Airbnb clone
but there's a lot less safety measures
involved
there you go you're the next Steve Jobs
you can register both of those domains
at domain.com and you know what you can
save 20% off of that order as well using
the code techno buffalo and you know
what if you're thinking about domains
which I imagine you are right now you
better be thinking domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
