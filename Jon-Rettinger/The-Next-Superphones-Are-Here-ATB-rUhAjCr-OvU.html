to you by domain.com what's up everyone
walk about the episode of ask the
Buffalo Amir's John wrenches to show you
could ask me any question you want from
the world of technology up this week its
upcoming smartphones a little bit about
how you can get started on YouTube our
first question comes from at tech news
UK who asks at John for lakers we
surprised how revealing at 18 teen at
t-mobile's leaks of the galaxy s6 were
and what are your thoughts on that
curved display so t-mobile ett both put
out leaks it said and I quote six appeal
that showed a side profile shot with the
curved part of the phone illuminated in
both magenta and blue for the colors
respectively and that's all we know so
far about the galaxy s6 at least
officially so what we can tell from that
picture it looks like it's going to have
a metal back and some sort of curved
display the curves look is pronounced as
the galaxy edge but in say said six
appeal galaxy s6 presumably you can feel
if that is the galaxy s6 and not a new
galaxy edge they might release so it's
like we are getting curves we are
getting met on galaxy s6 if we can only
get rid of all that touch with blower
which is also a rumor floating around
samsung might just release the perfect
smartphone of course we will know very
soon at Mobile World Congress which will
be covering so of course check out the
site for the rest of that news this is a
question I get quite a bit from folks
that want to get on YouTube at Joan the
boss 24's at john for lakers what is a
good YouTube startup camera the answer I
always give people as don't spend a lot
of money if you got a phone in your
pocket that can shoot 1080p video it has
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack that's all
you need by an external lavalier mic you
just plug on into that and you're pretty
much good to go as far as I'm concerned
1080p video is going to be fine if you
just want to get started you want to
learn the new ones to the Bing our
camera you want to learn how to speak in
front of a camera and start putting up
videos almost all smartphones now are as
close to as good as cameras were just a
few years ago so I wouldn't worry about
investing in that invest in other things
that you think you might need but just
use your phone and find a nice little
tripod mountain to go take a quick
second to thank our friends at
domain.com had that idea for a new
website maybe was a dot-com or dot net
time think next-gen get yourself a ninja
expert or dot club
if you're into that type of music folks
domain com wanna hook up our fans of the
great offer save twenty percent on
domain names and web hosting when you
use coupon code technobuffalo that's one
word at domain coms check out Eric will
bond asked at John for lakers very
simply m9 what are your thoughts smooth
seen the tunnel leaks on HTC One m9 i do
want to give the caveat to there's a
rumor floating around that HTC is
floating out fake links of their phone
but having said that we got our first
look at what we feel are probably press
images of coming HTC One m9
unsurprisingly it looks like the HTC One
m8 lets you look like the HTC one m7 big
changes no more ultrapixel camera on the
back we've got a now 20 megapixel sensor
for you folks I'd like to do a lot of
zooming and cropping you should be
pretty happy got rid of the big branded
bar on the bottom we've got on-screen
buttons of course that's pretty awesome
boom sound ultrapixel camera move from
the back to the front dropped a few
megapixels oh it's now for ultra pixel
cameras that should give you really nice
or selfie shots or all your conferencing
shots that you might want to take
hearing rumors also it's going to be a
1080p screen and not a qHD I kind of
fall in both camps I get 1080p I rather
have battery life and for my money a
good qhd screen doesn't like that much
better than a good 1080p screen but i
also get if it's going to be a flagship
phone for the next year you want to have
those cutting-edge features and
competitions is already offering that
maybe you're starting already at a step
behind a Snapdragon 810 three gigs of
RAM risks of stuff that you would expect
from a new flagship phone of course a
new version of sense with Android
lollipop on board I've been a big fan of
sense as far as the skins go against you
now you gotta calm custom ui's from the
manufacturers so I think we're looking
at a really sweet phone of course the
pretty badass and ball or HTC build
quality with all these new smartphones
coming from a World Congress rumbling
we're on the dawn of the LG g4 to the
galaxy s6 HTC One m9 so we're cool
upcoming thing we want to do in future
videos I want to feature some of your
comments so what smartphone feature are
you most excited about in the next phone
you're going to pick up as a cue HD
screens three gigs of RAM Snapdragon 810
native Android whatever it is leaving
the comments down below I'll pick one or
two in the next upcoming technobuffalo
video put it up there and we can have a
conversation about it again thank you
guys for watching
course love a ton of Mobile World
Congress coverage coming technobuffalo
calm till then I am jon rettinger that's
the guys neck video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
