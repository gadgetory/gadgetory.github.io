show that breaks down the top stories in
the tech world that gives you guys Ian
for that you really need to know every
Tuesday and every Thursday I am Barbara
Rosenfeld and the invites are out that
big apple event is official and it's
happening sometime in September I've got
all the details on that and everything
you need to know also Sony just
announced their new latest flagship
phone with a crazy camera we've got a
cool Bluetooth speaker that we want to
show off to you guys and also give you a
chance to win one here's the lowdown
the rumors are all in the invites are
out and we will officially be seeing new
iPhones on Wednesday September 12th
Apple sent out their invites this
morning with the phrase gather round and
as always many are closely examining
every inch of that invite to see if
there's a hint of what we'll see in less
than two weeks
obviously that circular ring signifies
the new Apple Park spaceship campus and
the event will be taking place there at
the Steve Jobs theater and no men you
are hoping that the ring may signify
there be a circular display on the Apple
watch series for we've heard rumors for
months that this is not gonna happen
Apple is just going to slim down the
bezels and now nine-to-five AK has
published new photos that show what is
supposedly this new series for Apple
watch that's gonna come in a gold color
option and have slimmer bezels the
majority of internet sleuths are honing
in on the invitations gold and copper
color which may mean we'll get an iPhone
in gold now we've already heard credible
reports at the lower end 6.1 inch iPhone
will come in multiple colors possibly
even gold but this may mean the two
higher-end premium iPhones will also get
that gold color option as well 9 to 5
Mac also published images that they
claim are the new iPhones in that gold
color option and they do look really
good so it'll be interesting to see if
we do see that announced at the event
besides new iPhones we should see the
Apple watch series for make its debut
and possibly we could see those new iPad
pros with the face ID and slimmer bezels
that we don't know if that's actually
going to happen and we're also hearing
no new ear pods until 2019 and air power
are you seriously asking about air power
we haven't heard anything on that in a
while don't expect that at this event
maybe not even until 2019 and also we
want to know what you guys have to say
leave a comment down below are you
excited for a gold iPhone are we going
to see one also are you excited for
anything in particular or not excited at
all leave a comment down below for your
chance to be featured on the next
episode of the lowdown Sony just took
the wraps off their new high-end
smartphone the ex c3 and it looks like
it's gonna pack quite the punch the
phone boasts a six inch OLED display
with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio a
Snapdragon 8045 processor four gigs of
RAM and a 3300 milliamp hour battery a
couple of the phones biggest selling
points a Sony wants to show off it's got
a 19 megapixel rear shooter capable of
shooting 4k HDR
and also the ability to shoot super
slow-mo 960 frames per second also
there's a feature on the phone that lets
you tap the side and gives you a quick
shortcut menu based on your location
what you're doing that's of course
powered by AI this new XZ 3 is extremely
similar to Sony's older XZ 2 smartphone
and it's just one of a number of
products that's being announced at IFA
in Berlin and if you want to know the
latest what's happening in Berlin at IFA
be sure to check out TechnoBuffalo comm
we've got you covered there on
everything you need to know from the
event and also if you're interested in
that X z3 it comes running Android 9 PI
out of the box which is really cool and
it'll be released in October for a
starting price tag of $900 and for the
last story today we're gonna be doing
something a little bit different and I
do anything anchor for sponsoring this
video and sending us to speaker to check
out and also they are actually giving
away 300 of their sound Core Series
speakers and I'll tell you guys how you
can enter to win one in just a minute so
the Flair plus is not your average
Bluetooth speaker it's able to produce
360 degrees sound that makes what you're
listening to sound good from any
direction no matter where you are in the
room it's got 20 hours of play time on
its built-in battery life and for those
who love RGB you'll appreciate the array
lights on the bottom of the speaker
it'll kind of liven things up add a bit
of a mood to whatever you're doing a
couple of cool features that I
personally really appreciate on the
Flair plus or the first ones being that
it has a full-size USB a port on the
back of it so you can charge your device
while you're playing music the speaker
is ipx7 water-resistant so you could
take it out by the pool or to the beach
and not worry about it getting all
messed up it can even be submerged
completely underwater another cool
feature I really like and I think this
is really cool is that the flare plus
can be used as a stereo pair if you have
two of these things you just open up the
sound core app add that second speaker
and while you're in the app you can
control the lights you can fine-tune the
audio settings and also set up each
speaker as the left or right Channel and
listen to your music or watch a movie
with stereo sound and it sounds really
good there's lots of bass lots of
clarity and it's even gonna sound good
at high volumes and it gets very loud as
well and for $99 you get a lot for your
money but if you want to hang on to a
bit of your money and you want to win
one of these for free today is your
lucky day
Anker is giving away 300 of their sound
Core Series speakers and it's
super simple to enter all you got to do
is head to that link down below
visit the website enter your information
for your chance to win and you could win
one of 300 speakers and this giveaway is
running from right now today until
September 13th on the last episode of
the lowdown you guys left many comments
on your thoughts on these new iPhones
some of you guys love them some hate
them many are indifferent but Jeremy
Ocasio made a good point he said this
the only reason I'm excited for this is
for the 8 to become cheaper very true
Jeremy very true the iPhone 8 is still a
great phone and it's not going to be
less of a great phone when these new
ones are announced and it's gonna be
even better of a deal if you can get it
for an even cheaper price alright guys

Tuesday to talk more Czech news and
breakdown those headlines I'll see you
