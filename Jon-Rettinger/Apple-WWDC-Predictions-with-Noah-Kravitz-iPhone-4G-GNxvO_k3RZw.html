technobuffalo here and i want to give
you my predictions for Apple's Worldwide
Developers Conference but they are not
in my predictions and let me tell you
why so you guys know obviously I'm a big
cell phone guy a lot of topics on my
videos cover cell phones but some of the
videos cover technology in general I'm
also a very big geek and as such I like
to know everything about technology so I
follow and I read a lot of YouTube
channels and tech sites that have to do
with technology in general take your
league with cell phones so i came to
phoneDog calm and i thought they had a
really great site and their main
personality noah was really dynamic I
thought he engages the audience who was
nominally just funny and I thought he
was doing a really good job so I started
following them for a while and reading
and I saw this site and the channel grow
and deservedly so so about maybe a month
ago I reached out to know a nice listen
I don't know if you know who i am i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i
think you do a fantastic job with your
videos they could be fun to see if our
audiences may be overlap a bit and sort
of share each other with you know our
audience and he tended to agree you know
you look at all the time with a
collaboration efforts that you see on
youtube some of the bigger entertainment
guys do it all the time I think it's a
great way to show camaraderie if you get
a different perspective on my channel
and oftentimes you guys are stuck with
hearing me talk and love to say the same
thing and maybe you're you know getting
bored in my side whatever it might be
forgot to spice it up could be fun to
get a guest editor here and who better
to be a guest editor than mr. phoneDog
himself Noah kravitz so I hope you guys
enjoy Noah's take on the worldwide
developers conference ends predictions I
think it gives a really interesting
perspective on it if you guys like
having Noah show up on the channel let
me know at least in comments let him
know we'll do some more it's been a lot
of fun no is a very good guy that to
come a friend so I'd love to get him on
here a bit more and of course if you
like him you want to check him out be
sure to go to phoneDog com or
youtube.com / phone down and you'll see
all the know you guys can handle anyway
enjoy the video hey what's up everybody
I'm no one from funcom and at first off
I want to thank John for inviting me to
do
little guest editor spot on his youtube
channel jump for lakers and also run
technobuffalo or anywhere else you might
be watching this and i also invite you
you probably know this already but John
sunol guest editor spot over on our
channel youtube.com slash phoneDog it's
also on our itunes feed and then of
course it'll be on the website phone com
so definitely check that out I was a few
weeks back job drop me a line said hey
you know I follow your stuff and I don't
know if you know who i am and i look of
course i go here are you John for lakers
and you're saying you know I cover a
whole bunch of different technology and
you guys focus on cell phones some of
the other mobile tech but we've got kind
of you know a similar thing going on
somewhat similar audiences and it might
be kind of fun to get together and you
know do some content do some videos
together introduce you to my audience
and vice versa that kind of thing and I
thought this is great I'm a big fan
everybody phoneDog we're all big fans of
John for lakers and technobuffalo and I
just really psyched that you came up
with the idea got the phone talked about
it blah blah and here we go so if you
guys like it let us know maybe this will
be the first and a long line of things
cuz some collaboration between us we
could call it techno dog or phone
Buffalo and we'll just keep the name the
same but we'll do some stuff together if
you don't like it let us know we won't
do it anymore learn a rate we decided
well the next big event coming up is
apple's WWDC the keynote on jun 7th or
Steve Jobs it's kind of made it it's
kind of become the place where they
launched the new iphone everybody
looking for a new iphone at WWDC so we
thought let's get some predictions so
like I said you can check out John's
video with his predictions over on the
phone dog channels and I'm gonna hit you
up with mine I'm gonna try to keep it
quick a bad habit of talking too much
I'm gonna try to go quick I will be at
the event I'm up here in the East Bay
Area San Francisco area of northern
california and i will be at the keynote
in san francisco on jun 7 so jacket
definitely check out our live coverage
of Ramona calm that was my shameless
plug but maybe after the event John I'll
get together again do another
talking about you know not just all of
our predictions that came wrong or
didn't come true but you know what we
think and how the marketplace kind of
now shapes up with you know Apple versus
Google and then you know palm and
Microsoft still kind of in the
background but then of course rim
blackberry is still controlling the
marketplace even if you know some people
think their days are numbered enough of
that WWDC it's a developer's conference
but like i said it's become the place
for the new iphones launched Google i/o
a couple weeks ago their developers
conference they talked a lot about
Android they launched Android to to
froyo which is a huge update lot of cool
stuff in it they also announced Google
TV and they also gave out the sprint EVO
4g android phone to everybody in
attendance so they really made a splash
and they took a million potshots at
Apple I was really surprised a lot of
jokes at Apple's expense some of the
jokes are kind of lame somewhat kind of
funny but a lot of pot shots taken an
apple during the keynote on the second
day so and then of course there's a lot
of talk about chrome and you know
everything else schools doing so fully
expect new iphone at WWDC coming from
apple also there'll be a lot of not
iphone talk we'll talk about ipad all
the iPads they sold we'll talk about OS
10 perhaps a preview of the new version
of OS 10 I think you hear a lot about
the iTunes Store the new ibookstore iPad
international launch all that kind of
stuff you may see some talk about iphone
OS 4.1 being the first unified release
to support iphone ipod touch and ipad
all at once because right now there's a
separate beta version for ipad from the
other two you may hear some talk about
the game center for iphone OS although I
kind of think they'll save that till the
fall event where they traditionally
launch the new ipods because the ipod is
kind of their their premier targeted
game device the ipod touch so they might
wait till back to school for that i
highly doubt you'll hear anything about
an iphone on verizon or any other non
AT&amp;amp;T network in the u.s. i think from
now it's going to stay an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive
you might hear something lots or there's
always rumors about the verizon iphone
it's got to come true at some point
because google's got so many devices and
so many carriers you know they're just
flooding the net
market then again Apple makes their
money off a big big profit margins in
their devices not out of having huge
market share so who knows but i do think
you'll see an iphone on verizon
eventually you might see it in time for
the christmas holidays this year 2010 I
don't think you'll see it on jun 7th at
WWDC frankly I hope I'm wrong because it
would be fine it would really open up
the marketplace but I don't think you'll
see I do think you'll see a new iphone
the hardware will probably look you know
this is the old one the colonel 1 i've
got now the 3gs looks like from the
leaks you've seen online the one that
was left in a bar down there Apple
headquarters and the ones coming out of
Vietnam now looks like you'll probably
lose that rounded design on the edges
more squared-off it's going to be a
little bit thinner I think the big
features you're going to see
front-facing camera video chat
capabilities i think apple is going to
promote the heck out of it Apple is
really good at making commercials that
really focus in on a single feature and
how you can use it the first iphone
iphone they talked a lot about you know
the maps those commercials that had what
was it like the sushi place in San
Francisco everybody start calling them
up it so the ads on TV and how you could
use your phone to very quickly you know
look something up and call it the guy do
the whole apps thing and everything with
the 3gs with video they've done a lot
showing you know how you can use the
phone to capture video other devices can
do that too that's that's the thing
everybody always says about apples they
take you know features that aren't
exclusive and try to spin them like the
best thing since sliced bread well it
works because they sell millions of
these things they're gonna do the same
thing of the video chat I think you'll
see a front facing camera with video
chat I don't know if it'll work on 3g n
AT&amp;amp;T or only on Wi-Fi but I think you'll
see it I think you'll see a new
back-facing camera higher megapixels
probably 5 megapixels with a flash and I
think it will capture HD video i think
i'm going to focus a lot on video and on
high res i think they'll call the device
iphone HD not iphone 4g because it's not
going to run in a 4g network at least
not yet but I think he old HD video
capture I also think the screen on the
front it's not going to be as big as evo
4g so i can be a 4.3 inch screen I think
it'll be like 37 I think that's what the
rumors and the leaks have said 37 and I
think it will
also as the leaks of said have a much
higher resolution display much higher
pixel count 960 x 480 makes a lot of
sense it would quadruple the pixel count
it would be by far the highest res cell
phone display that I've ever heard of
any way much higher res an 800 x 480
that you see on a lot of the new android
devices and not only would it support
high-res photo and video playback but it
would support just much much smoother
rendering of fonts and of you know
graphics and so you would get something
that was much more like you know you
were reading a magazine I think that
just ties in you look at the screen
would be more like looking at a printed
page in a good way and I think that
would tie in with an apples trying to do
you know with trying to sell everything
from TV shows to digital magazines to
electronic books and their I bookstore
now so I think you'll see I books come
to the iphone give a much higher res
display I think it'll have new
technology that will they'll claim that
increases battery life build a bigger
battery as well but I think they'll have
you know the display will be a big thing
they'll push increase battery life
higher res and better performance in bad
lighting conditions especially in harsh
sunlight a lot of the android phones
that have a super amoled display they
just wash out in direct sunlight
Samsung's got their new Super AMOLED
technology coming out in the galaxy s
that does much better in harsh lighting
and I think you're going to see an
iphone with not super amoled but a
similar technology to again higher res
but also better performance and bad
sunlight I think the phone will be a
little bit slimmer again that's on all
the leaks better performance in terms of
reception data cell phone reception data
over cellular and Wi-Fi networks and
also GPS I think probably you know
though some advancements to make that
tech better but again the big thing from
facing a video camera new industrial
design more memory they always double
the memory you'll see almost 64 gigs and
then the back camera and the higher res
display as far as a one more thing
announcement I don't know I think you'll
see some new stuff an iphone OS 4 you'll
see facebook integration
maybe some other social networking
integration obviously the multitask in
there too previewed you'll see something
with the iTunes and maybe the mobileme
service apple bought this company called
la la that specialized in streaming
media and they shot la la down effective
made 31st as was scheduled so
everybody's speculating is I mean
they're going to have a
subscription-based I tuning thing kind
of like you know the zune pass and
rhapsody or will they try to do
something with subscription-based video
content TV shows that kind of thing I
don't know about that what I really hope
they do is I hope they introduced a
revamped mobileme service and they make
it free they need to to compete with
Google even to compete with what palm is
doing with webos where you're sinking of
your calendars and your contacts and
your tasks and your mail and all of that
is Wireless and free and even a wireless
backup service now google announced that
they're going to have one in the android
22 so apple in order to compete in order
to you know offer similar if not better
services they need to do something there
hopefully they'll announce it at WWDC as
for another you know consumer product
another one more thing I hope there is
something I hope we get you know rumors
about a new Apple TV device I hope that
comes true Apple TV running on the
iphone OS platform could be kind of
interesting I doubt it but there's a
slim chance there would be a second
iphone you'd see iphone HD at the top
the current iphone 3gs would slide in to
that ninety nine dollar price point and
then you know the mythical iphone nano
honestly i highly doubt it you could
hope right but so there you go i think
you'll see a lot of taught you see the
new iphone I already went down with
that'll do talk about iphone OS
obviously lot of talk about the ipad
talk about OS 10 a new preview version
of OS 10 and stuff about the development
tools and that kind of thing and
hopefully a one more thing free mobileme
service revamped so it's more useful and
maybe the apple TV i don't think we'll
see you a verizon iphone but like i said
usually i'm wrong so there you go again
thanks to John did I keep it man it's
like 10 minutes I still rambled on
