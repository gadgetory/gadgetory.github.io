wireless charging alliances come
together steamos elder scrolls online's
release date and the winner of that
crazy red mac pro auction is revealed
it's Buffalo bullets in time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story mention on the show
check the description for links or click
on the graphics for each story if you

well instagram held their press event
yesterday and revealed their newest
feature no it's not a first-party
printing service or native tablet app
like a lot of people wanted it's a
direct messaging service Instagram
direct is a messenger that allows you to
send photos to your friends directly
through the app works similar to twitter
and that you can only send pics directly
if the recipient follows you but there's
no text only option this appears to be
aimed at competing with snapchat but
times gonna tell on this one wireless
charging seems pretty cool but it's also
a little bit frustrating there are so
many different groups of wireless
chargers there is the wireless power
consortium power matters Alliance and
the Alliance for wireless power that
last group a4wp for short officially
launched residents this week which is
hoping to be the future standard for
wireless charging there are over 70 big
companies already on board including
Samsung LG HTC and Qualcomm so maybe we
will see residents grab a solid hold in
the market over in gaming 300 very lucky
beta participants will be receiving
their steam machines over the next few
days with steamos already pre-installed
on the rigs steamos will also be
available for download today but there's
a catch according to valve getting steam
OS up and running will be pretty tough
quote unless you're an intrepid linux
hacker already those are their words so
I'm sorry if I just burst your steam
bubble those of us not blessed with epic
mad Linux skills will likely be waiting
until later next year to try steamos out
hotly anticipated MMO the Elder Scrolls
online finally got a release date this
week for both PC and console if you're
using a PC or a Mac to play you'll be
able to grab ESO on April fourth of next
year if you're on PlayStation 4 or Xbox
one you'll have to wait a little bit
longer June to be exact there's also a
new PvP trailer online
it is delightful it shows Civil War long
intense stares at people dragons magic
fireballs and more will all be Adventure
is this spring pretty much at least
until we take an arrow to the knee
lastly our wild kuch story for the day
reveals the auction winner for the
almost million-dollar red pack pro and
also the 461 thousand dollar rose gold
earpods it's actually the same guy who
won both options and that guy is none
other than former apple vice president
tony fadell you're not familiar with his
name you definitely know his work this
is the guy who helped bring the ipod to
the masses and more recently he
co-created the nest thermostat it's
pretty cool that he purchased those
things but for me the best part is that
over 1.4 million dollars from those two
auctions went to charity that is the
buffalo bulletin for today if you
