to or the touch pro2 it's known
internationally is a really hot device
it brings with it some very advanced
hardware specifications augmented by
windows mobile 6.5 or Windows Phone as
Microsoft is calling it with HTC's own
skin on top of it called touchflo 3d
odds are if you're considering the tilt
- or the touch pro2 you believe looked
at the iPhone 3GS if you haven't
considered purchasing the iPhone you're
at least familiar with how the operating
system works so it should be a
relatively reasonable and fair
comparison we're gonna cover Hardware
browser navigation customization app
store and keyboard on both devices let's
start with the thing that you look at
the most the screen the screen on the
tilt - is a three point six inch
resistive touchscreen meaning you can
use a stylus because these touch
sensitivity is done by two layers of
film that actually pushed together so
resistive screens do have a little bit
of squishy feel to it the iPhone and on
the other hand has a 3.5 inch capacitive
touchscreen which is used by a sensor of
electrons so that's why you can really
only use your finger so in that
comparison the tilt tube does have a
little bit bigger screen
so speaking of dimensions the tilts to
is 4.5 4 by 2 point 3 3 by 0.65 where
the iPhone is 4.5 by 2.4 5.48
you know nothing terribly exciting their
colors wise the tilts - can show about
65,000 colors whereas the iPhone can
show many many many more about 16
million the pixel wise we're looking at
400 by 800 for the tilts - and 320 by
480 for the iPhone this is actually the
highest resolution that Windows Mobile
can't show the iPhone 3GS certainly has
multi-touch whereas the tilt 2 does not
from a battery standpoint we're looking
at talktime of 7.5 hours for the tilt 2
and 12 hours for the iPhone 3GS but we
get 475 hours
standby time for the tilt - and only 300
hours of standby time for the iphone 3gs
so enough of this non comparisons let's
talk about something that we can
actually see let's turn the screens on
for each and let's start with the
browser's pocket internet explorer the
browser that has shipped with most
versions of Windows Mobile before this
was let's just say not the best sin htc
recognize that actually shipped the
touch pro2 in this case the tilt - with
opera which is a very very very capable
and scalable browser so we're gonna go
ahead and open up the same website on
each we'll go over to internet here we
go and we will launch youtube.com slash
John 4-leggers okay so I've got a queued
up on both devices we are running on the
same 3G connection with between four and
five bars of 3G service so this should
be very quick and I should also mention
that this website has been viewed on
both devices
so cookies and cache and everything
should already be there so this is a
test of how a website that you look down
on a daily basis would load up let's go
ahead and try and get these things to
launch at the same time we're gonna go
ahead and hit go go there I think go
here at the same time alright and we are
off
certainly your 3G speed is going to vary
depending on where you are but at least
it's running on the same network should
be a pretty fair test so it's already
loaded on the iPhone 3GS and still
rendering here on the tilt - now in the
interest of brevity I'm going to limit
my browser comparisons to just one
website otherwise it's going to end up
being a twenty to thirty minute video if
I do a few tests but suffice to say and
all the tests that I have run the iPhone
3GS does render pages no matter what
page it is just a little bit quicker so
now that both pages are up and ready to
go let's take a look at navigation and
how the site looks so both have an
accelerometer so I can turn it and it
will rotate
as you can see now navigation is a
little bit interesting on me tilt - you
don't have the multi-touch you might be
familiar with on the iPhone the
application is done via two ways you can
either double tap to zoom in on an area
otherwise there is a zoom bar across the
bottom that allows you to zoom in and
zoom out scroll in and scroll up now it
does zoom in a little bit of an
arbitrary area so you've got to sort of
pan around to get where you want to go
but it does definitely function how you
would expect it to do now there's a
little bit of a buffering time if you
saw there at the checkerboard platform
but scrolling is smooth and you can
definitely get around anywhere you'd
like on the website its world's better
than pocket and at Explorer if you've
ever used that it's a very very capable
HTML browser on the iPhone for example
you can do that same double tab scroll
around you don't get that same
checkerboard pattern and you can zoom in
via multi-touch so just pinch and zoom
that's gonna come down to personal
preference browser I think is definitely
stronger on the iPhone 3GS but it's very
capable on the tilts too as well so next
let's talk about navigation we'll go
back to the home screen on each the
navigation for the iPhone should be
relatively familiar if you're an iPhone
fan you know how it is or if you don't
like the iPhone you're probably sick of
seeing it it's done by a simple grid
array of icons and you scroll around and
you have to scroll from screen to screen
to get to where you'd like to go at
least for the main navigation you can
drill down in menus to settings and you
get some more options in each one you
can go through and see what your sub
menus are the iPhone is a pretty simple
user interface it's it's relatively
elegant easy to use I'll let might be
getting a little bit stale so let's take
a look here at the tilt - this again is
running Windows Phone or windows mobile
6.5 with touchflo 3d on top of it
navigation is done by its main bar
across the bottom you can scroll all the
way down and see all your options home
people text mail internet talent
stocks pictures and the like it's a
pretty smooth navigation I've used
touchflo 3d in the past and generally
the processor that I've used these
devices on so the e-team diffuse for
examples but a little underpowered this
can get laggy the tilts too however
processor is quite fast and can handle
this quick Scrolls so it doesn't
actually end up being very smooth and it
nice and easy to use interface touchflo
3d makes Windows Mobile I think very
finger friendly as well so if you're a
corporate user that's used to Windows
Mobile this is going to be a very
pleasant surprise to you and things
actually work and are really zippy the
Start menu that you've seen in most
Windows mobile phones is gone replaced
with this sort of honeycomb looking grid
array which as far as looking at
programs is quite easy to use when there
aren't that many on the list if you go
to something like settings for example I
will go to system when there's quite a
lot to look at it can be hard to find
where you want to go although overall I
definitely prefer the honeycomb array to
the older list that was found in Windows
Mobile
this one's really going to be a draw
depending on what you're used to if you
want the simplicity and elegance of the
iPhone it's a great way to go looking
for the customization and the more
exchanged synchronization and some more
advanced features and especially a more
open platform the Windows Mobile is
really gonna be a very solid way to go
now speaking of a customization let's
talk about that
on the tilt - really you can customize
everything programs like SPB mobile
shell or registry tweaking and hacking
er pretty simple to use and install and
you can make the tilt to really do
anything that you'd like you can change
the home screen you can put in video
wallpapers you can customise your tabs
on the bottom that's one of the nice
things about Windows Mobile is that it's
open and you can customize everything on
here on the iPhone 3GS it's certainly
not that customizable Apple is really
limited in what you can do you can move
the icons around but if you're not going
to jailbreak your pants are quite tight
as to what you can do we're gonna keep
this comparison video as just a like
it's official tweaks however if we're
going to talk about registry hacking and
knew wrong installation
on the tilts - it's important to notice
that you can do a lot of the same things
if you jailbreak your phone on the
iPhone 3GS definitely something just to
keep in mind
I don't jailbreak mine but something
that you definitely could do so one of
the other new things that came with the
tilt - and windows mobile 6.5 is a new
marketplace so one of the nice things
about Windows Mobile in the past is that
you can install programs nice and easily
just via an installed cab file that you
could download from your mobile browser
and just install well they take that
sort of format and put it in a much
simpler easy to navigate package and I
think that the marketplace is really
nice and easy to use it's linked into
your Windows Live account and you work
just that you expect it would most
popular some are free some are not you
want to download one you just pick it
can ask you for your live ID before it's
gonna give you a description you're
gonna need some screenshots and you're
gonna need some reviews on it it's
already 135 reviews it's a very nice app
store scrolling is fluid and you get all
the information that you need the app
store on the iPhone actually looks
relatively similar so we'll open that up
here and you can view it by feature
categories or top-25 and if you want to
buy something it's linked to your iTunes
account certainly if you're gonna talk
about how the app stores behave it's got
to be a draw
however the app store on the iPhone just
has much much much much much more in it
right now I think that the app
Marketplace on Windows Mobile is
certainly going to catch up and there
are thousands of Windows mobile
applications that can be downloaded but
they're just not all in the marketplace
right now so the tilt to is called the
tilt to for a reason and that's because
it tilts up and as it tilts up it
definitely shows you its full QWERTY
keyboard so let's move on to the final
comparison phase keyboard input so you
can input text in a few different ways
on the touch pro in the tilt - you can
take advantage of the on-screen key
so we'll open up Office Mobile go ahead
open up word open up in your document
and you get a either in landscape or
QWERTY soft keyboard it's a little bit
difficult to use but you can't scroll
around to see the keys to make sure
you're hitting the right one you can
rotate it and get a landscape keyboard
as well but if you're using one of these
odds are you're gonna be doing most your
typing like this and the full QWERTY
keyboard is very easy to use and it's
actually one of the better full physical
keyboards that I've ever used it's very
very simple it's got a lot of buttons
you have an extra road just for symbols
there's a nice throw and the keys you
don't get that sort of limp feeling that
you get in the middle
it just works however when you do tilt
the screen up you're gonna lose some of
the room you had on that top row of keys
yes there's a lot of room for your thumb
there you tilt it up you're going to
lose that so if you look at the keyboard
on the iPhone for example I'm gonna go
ahead and open up a nodes application
you get a on-screen QWERTY keyboard
either typing in landscape or portrait
now before I tell you my opinion I
should say that I use an iPhone 3GS as
my primary phone so I'm much more
familiar with the on-screen keyboard
that it offers that being said I've
gotten very used to typing on it and I
think it is quite easy to use however
it's not nearly as easy as having a full
physical QWERTY keyboard like the one
found on the tilt to it certainly
rotates into landscape as well so
overall guys in in conclusion it's
really gonna come down to what you
prefer if you like the elegance of the
iPhone and I think there's really
nothing better as far as its seamless
easy to use experience I think you're
going to get probably the best mobile
web browsing experience so if your
that's important to you if web browsing
is a paramount importance and if you
like picture viewing and video viewing
and once your videos are done through
iTunes and your songs are all download
if they're iTunes it's gonna be tough to
beat the iPhone 3GS however if you want
more customization a more open platform
the ability to sort of tweak it and have
access to a few more file formats you
can
put a ton of different video and audio
formats on the tilt to using its media
player and built-in audio players it's a
great way to go as well it's gonna come
down to what you prefer
so guys which one do you prefer agree to
tilt to something of interest to you or
you not interested in for a particular
reason you hate the iPhone or you're not
interested in the iPhone for particular
reason curious to what you guys have to
say leave a text or video response for
