TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing of the
Ouya this is the Android based gaming
console coming very very soon we backed
this sucker on Kickstarter it is here
and ready to be ceremoniously unboxed
let's take a look so here is the box for
the oh yeah every time I say that name I
keep digging to the kool-aid guy busting
through the wall so go ahead and open it
up and we've got some bubble wrap and
not packaged looks like we got the yeah
controller of course already to all the
specs everything but here's the kind of
cross between the ps3 or the DualShock 3
controller and an Xbox 360 controller
but it does have a cool touchpad there
and it spells out yeah which is kind of
neat of feels she was nice to feel a
little bit on the plasticky side but
it's got a good feel to it
decent ergonomics but curious to see how
it feels when I'm getting my gaming on
and mashing some buttons but again touch
panel right in the middle also in the
box
I guess we got 2 batteries or supposes
for that remote control this is probably
the retail packaging for the lyac
console and pull this sucker out
there we go or maybe not the retail
packaging for nose-up I'm saying yes on
the retail packaging here it is Liana
black cardboard box got sort of embossed
on the side yeah
dream buy dreamt by gamers designed in
California something that's sounds
familiar
let's go ahead and open this up you peel
off the tape replaced from one side I
had any nails could do this much easier
well that's boom do that again on the
other side and see what we've got inside
I have not seen one of these yet in
person I know there's been some issues
with early UIs but supposedly hasn't all
been fixed and this should work like a
dream at least in theory so if you guys
don't know what the react console is
essentially it is an Android based
gaming console thank you for believing
that's probably in here for the
Kickstarter and we've got another
controller oh that's kind of cool they
gave us two so there's the controller
again and here is the react console
itself this thing is
super tiny so it's gonna cost you 99
bucks to be available June 25th
it's running a custom version of Android
4.1 - sure how it stands it stands like
this you've got ten of course I'll walk
you guys through here to mention them
it's 2.9 by 2.9 by 3.2 it weighs a very
light ten point five ounces it's being
powered by a video as Tegra 3 quad-core
chip it's got a gig of ram it gigs of
internal storage and expandable via USB
which you can see that port right there
core it's got Wi-Fi a game so you are
free to try and you can of course
download them could support for four
controllers and of course that
controller has a touchpad so let's take
a look at this guy's all kinds of stuff
going on here all right so I suppose
that is where powers gonna go Gigabit
Ethernet but of course Wi-Fi their mini
HDMI out believe or unless that's a
micro USB port there's the USB port and
there is HDMI we got a ton of stickers
on here let's pull all those off and see
what this thing looks like so a little
bit of a fan there and peel off just
blessed and boom this is the Ouya
console so I'll push that down for just
a moment so y'all should what I have in
the Box suppose you got to be something
I'll sing here to power it and there is
so here is the power brick looks just
like a bar brick we've got more battery
it's for the controller and they give us
an HDMI cable so that's nice we look
this guy up to a TV and try it and see
what it looks like and of course a lot
of first impressions gaming and full
review I want to show you guys what you
can expect when you get your yeah in the
mail kind of really excited to check
this sucker out anything guys want to
see your have a show you be sure to let
us know down below I'm John Renick from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video
