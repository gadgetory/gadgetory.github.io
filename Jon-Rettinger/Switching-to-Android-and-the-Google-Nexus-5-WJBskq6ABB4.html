to you by netflix hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you get to
ask me Ashley ask ever any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo com
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me anytime of the day or night on
twitter at TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley
ask ever make sure you use the hashtag
ask the be so I can see it and usually
I'll answer between three and five
questions every episode let's get
answering because this is ask the
Buffalo our first question comes from
one who asks hey Ashley I'm running out
of contract in a couple of months i have
an iphone 4s and have an Apple ecosystem
I'm tempted to change to an Android
device but i'm afraid that i bought so
many apps that all is going to waste
what do you think I should do stay with
iOS or changed to another operating
system well my answer for that is is I
understand that I too have an iphone and
I have bought into that ecosystem quite
heavily and it can be very difficult to
switch into a new ecosystem if you spend
a lot of money my suggestion you is if
you have a 4s I would just wait and see
how you feel about iOS 7 before deciding
to move to Android the other thing is is
it's not that much different from iOS 6
but there are some nice improvements and
it might be enough to keep you in the
apple ecosystem but if it isn't you'll
know right away when you get that system
update to iOS 7 and you'll know you want
to go android so that's my suggestion
try iOS 7 when it comes out officially
and if you don't like it head on over to
android town twitter user Julian j lanza
asks should i grab a nexus 4 while it's
cheap or should i wait for the nexus 5
or whatever it's going to be called man
the nexus 4 is really cheap right now
it's a hundred and ninety-nine dollars
for the base model which is how much you
pay for an on contract phone if you can
get it I would say the nexus 4 is a
pretty great device if you are not a
ship hopper if you're not somebody who
literally buys the newest phone every
three to six months the nexus 4 is a
great
a lot of people still use it as their
daily driver it's a fantastic phone
obviously running stock Android can't go
wrong with that like I said flagship
hopper definitely wait for the next
version of the nexus but if you're not
and you can deal with it or honestly for
200 bucks muscles buy one right now and
then in a year you could even get a
nexus 5 on contract for the same price i
would say if you're looking for new
phone right now get the nexus 4 totally
worth it twitter user Salim Usama asks
do you put cases and or screen
protectors or are you the person who
would take the risk and go naked with
beauty I feel like this is kind of a
double entendre question here Salim
Usama but I will tell you this is my
iphone there is as you can see no case
on it there's also no screen protector I
do I'm a risk taker I'm a rebel i'm a
loner dottie I definitely have no cases
because really at the end of the day so
many phones are coming out that are
gorgeous and why would you want to room
that with a case a big bulky case I mean
the iPhone 5 is meant to be slim and
beautiful and easy to put into a pocket
or a purse I just have to make sure I do
have to take the extra precaution to not
put it next to keys because obviously as
a lady you don't want that all rattling
around in your bag Erin asks is John
ever coming back because he is the
Buffalo okay there's a couple of answers
this question number one John makes more
videos than I do in a week our YouTube
channel so he is still here I don't know
if you guys have noticed but he does
make a lot of videos um however he
doesn't do ask the Buffalo anymore so
he's probably dancing behind me right
now if I'm guessing yeah John is here
he's here all the time he does videos
all the time his unboxings and and
hands-on and reviews and all that stuff
and then I do the really fun scripted
things that go on and I am I just know
something crazy is happening behind me
and I'm not even a look because I just
like to let John do whatever he wants to
do because really this is his joint so
he's love do whatever he wants guys we
got to take a second from ask the
Buffalo and talk about the final season
of breaking bad it is happening right
now I'm sure you knew that but I never
really had time to actually watch the
show until this summer so that's why I'm
using netflix to stream it directly and
Dubai I
