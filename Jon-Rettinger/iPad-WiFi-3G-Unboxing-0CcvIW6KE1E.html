technobuffalo here at that unboxing for
you of the ipad 3g + Wi-Fi a low for
brevity we'll just call it the ipad 3g
the box looks almost identical to the
ipad Wi-Fi model in fact at the top it
still just says ipad doesn't even say
AT&amp;amp;T there so this is running on a tMT's
network this is the 32 gigabyte model
you've probably seen the box many times
before i got a picture of it on the
front ipad on the side some specs on the
back and really going way to know that
it's 3g is right there 32 + 3g and that
is about it so let's go ahead and dig in
of course we'll use the big ol knife to
flip this over and cut the plastic i'll
be doing a full this battery of tests if
you will comparing this to the Wi-Fi
model see there's a difference in
battery life performance internet speed
i'm just putting it through the general
paces like we usually do in our videos
so rip off the plastic set off to the
side here's the box comes right up just
a little bit of cardboard right there
and here is the ipad 3g sitting right on
top press it off to the side for just a
minute I'll keep digging in and see what
else we get in the box so this should be
very familiar of course we have a power
cord and USB and this should be exactly
the same as the Wi-Fi model with the one
exception of the sim removal tool
because this does have a micro sim card
essentially it's like a regular sim card
just a bit smaller and you get sort of
your fingertips and iPad although and
you do get some stickers to case you're
wondering so go ahead and close that and
the 3g model is about a hundred and
thirty dollar premium over the non 3g
model so push the box off to the side
and let's take a look at the ipad 3g
so now we got all the unboxing stuff out
of the way let's take a look at the iPad
itself it is highlighted by a 9.7 inch
capacitive touchscreen which really
takes up almost the entire device got a
bit of a black bezel around it and some
chrome sort rimming it's got a screen
resolution of 1024 x 768 and it's got a
100 32 pixels per inch supposedly has an
oleophobic screen which means it will
avoid fingerprints but if you've ever
used an ipad you'll notice it is a
fingerprint magnet so we've got your
iDevice typical button you've got the
home button right there on the left-hand
side you have a micro sim tray that's
where you'd put in that sim removal tool
and pull out that micro sim essentially
it looks like a regular sim card but
shrunk it down actually you can cut
regular sim cards to be the same size as
micro sim and work in these on the
right-hand side you've got your standard
array of iPad buttons you've got your
volume up and down and your screen
rotation lock on the top you've got a
lock in power 3.5 millimeter headset
jack which is not recessed you may
notice this big black bar across the top
that is actually if I turn it over where
the 3g radios resides so you can
actually get a little better 3g
reception if you're trying to come
through the aluminum here on the back
and i should probably say that's not
chrome around the side it is aluminum or
aluminium depending on where you're
watching this and that's really the big
differences here the other different
conditions to the 3g radio versus the
just Wi-Fi ipad this actually has
assisted gps and it's it as a gps chip
to help get a better sort of location on
where you are the irregular ipad uses
the cell tower to sort of get your GPS
configuration and speaking of the ipad
Wi-Fi let's go ahead and bring that into
frames you can see the difference
between the two click here turn it on so
you look the same here is the or here
are the two iPads side-by-side you
really can't see any different or notice
any difference I guess the only way you
can tell from the top is that this is a
little bit broken up by the black on the
back you can definitely see a difference
we've got that sort of two-tone look I
think the ipad Wi-Fi only has little
cleaner alliance doesn't have to have
that
black bar but again no 3g radio and no
Wi-Fi from a thickness standpoint they
are exactly the same thickness you can
see right there there's really no
difference Apple claimed 10 hours of
battery life on each when just using
Wi-Fi and about nine hours when using
the 3g and if you won't cure about the
3g data plans at least on eighteen t
thirty dollars is going to get you a
truly unlimited plan where you can
download and watch whatever you want the
truly unlimited sense and about half of
that fifteen bucks is going to get you
250 megabytes of data or you can always
add on more if you go over and they'll
tell you when you go over and these are
not in addition to your cell phone data
plan they don't go on that plan it's a
separate bill you actually activate all
that stuff right from the ipad so i'll
put these two heads ahead and show you
speeds and course we'll run the ipad 3g
through our full battery of tests if you
will to see how it performs if you guys
have any questions or things you want to
see go ahead and leave them in the
comments and I will check them out
