from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the latest tablet to grace AT&amp;amp;T
airwaves this is the HTC built Jetstream
let's go ahead unbox it and see if it
can take off no all right so here is the
HTC Jetstream one of the first devices
and AT&amp;amp;T s line up to sport not only
that 4G logo which you see with the
HSPA+ but those LTE right below it those
three letters so very very very
important unfortunately we don't have
LTE in many markets but if you're
looking to pick up the Jetstream
hopefully you will have LTE in your
market at some point in the near future
AT&amp;amp;T said they've got a pretty
aggressive rollout plan so here's a
tablet we'll run through all the specs
in a few minutes HTC Jetstream there's a
picture of the jet stream on the back 4G
broadband Android 3.1 honeycomb of
course 10.1 inch HD widescreen HTC
French stream and a full HTML browser
this is running a skinned version of
honeycomb with HTC Sense sitting on top
of it
alright so let's go ahead and dig in
we'll go through the rest of the specs
as we go this was sent right from HTC it
looks like this guy's been unboxed
before the second unboxing I suppose
alright so here is the tablet and I have
not seen one these guys yet in person so
I'm kind of curious all right doesn't
want to come out I'll shake it out I'm
shaking right now because can't see it
okay so here is the Jetstream push it
off to the side for just a minute see
we're gonna get in the Box got a power
cord and it looks to be proprietary
power as is the case with most of the
honeycomb tablets out there most tablets
in general they require more power than
micro USB can give but for syncing you
do have a micro USB cable Quick Start
Guide HTC Jetstream all that kind of
business and some other warranty
information in there blah blah blah
let's look at the jet stream itself
let's power it on hopefully there's
enough juice and I will run through the
specs
power on boom HTC okay so as I mentioned
earlier we were looking at Android 3.1
this is being powered by an incredibly
capable 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor for those of you keeping track
at home
it's the apq 80/60 processor i read that
from notes i got next to me android 3.1
honeycomb 32 gigs of internal storage
one gig of ram this guy has a 10.1 inch
capacitive touchscreen with a resolution
of 1280 by 800 LTE support a huge beefy
battery 7330 milliamp hours of course
HTC Sense let's go ahead and take a look
at the butt of this guy boom what we
were looking at right there next to an
LED flash is an 8 megapixel 1080p camera
which can shoot video at 30 frames per
second it's actually dual LEDs and on
the front
none of that vga business we have a 1.3
megapixel shooter it's capable of being
used with HTC scribe pen so you can draw
right on it with a sort of passive
magnet magnet magnet magnet magnetic
that's the word magnetic stylus that you
can use to write notes or draw pictures
or all kinds of business this is the HTC
scribe pen will take a look at this guy
in the review we did cover it a bit in
the HTC Flyer overview alright so all
this sounds pretty awesome right you
ready for the kicker let's talk about
the price this guy and this is not a
exaggeration it's going to cost six
hundred and ninety nine dollars with
contract if you want to buy it without a
contract it's gonna cost you eight
hundred and forty nine dollars $699 the
contract eight hundred and forty nine
dollars without a contract he wants us
guy also has support though for HSPA+ so
that's a plus alright so let's walk
around the tablet here on the top got a
3.5 millimeter headset jack
your power and lock button living right
there hello
nothing on that site to say what's the
top or the bottom of each tab we can see
all Orion on the bottom here there's
that proprietary charging port got a
microphone down there volume rocker up
and down interesting thing about this
proprietary charging port you can plug
in both the power or a micro USB cord
into that same port batteries sealed in
here it is a brushed aluminum look
pretty substantial speaker this is not
Beats Audio
despite HTC higher down on some devices
but this is a very capable tablet if
you're not gonna be scared from the
price you are gonna get a capable tablet
here so let's take a quick look and HTC
Sense which I have not seen yet on a
tablet Wow doing it's all kind of
weather thing it looks like I do have
service it says 4G we don't have LTE in
Southern California so that is HSP plus
variety let's go ahead dig in and let's
go to TechnoBuffalo comm and see what
things look like so being an Android
device we'll have full support for flash
to be able to get websites and apps as
they were meant to be done and with a
gig of ram and a 1.5 gigahertz processor
you're not gonna have any sort of slow
down this guy should be an absolute
screamer it's one of the best SPECT
tablets actually on the market so we'll
bring this down just a little bit and
with the high resolution screen 1280 by
800 things should be pretty crisp and
clear so there's this test I always run
pages still loading button HSPA+ it is
loading pretty fast some interesting
tweaks here to the web browser at HTC
adits you've got everything right across
here tab search bookmarks and menu you
can see all that kind of business let's
go ahead and jump back home see what
other kind of honeycomb tweaks we're
going to have here both the tasking
still the same that we've seen I really
like how Android handles multitasking
especially on the honeycomb operating
system I like the way it looks it's
visually appealing and it's really handy
to use so let's see what some of the
widgets we got here
think of bookmarks widget all the stuff
we've seen on other HTC Sense devices so
you can find a blank homescreen and
check out some the other widgets hey
look at that
I do scroll around you get sort of that
carousel pick one you can see all your
home screens so we can pinch out there's
a blank home screen and let's go ahead
and look at our widgets so it will jump
on over to all widgets well a lot of
calendar options here too
calculator really handy to have a
calculator so you have a ton of
different choices calendar this is one
of my favorite HTC widgets the calendar
options looks like they translated over
pretty nicely to the tablet operating
system and a lock clock and your switch
from widgets apps and shortcuts is now
down here a lot of clocks a lot of
clocks that is a ridiculous amount of
clocks some featured apps footprints
friend channel french stream Gmail and
Google search HTC likes mail a lot of
other goodness here go ahead and jump on
over to app see if we get any other HTC
goodness it's a lot HTC goodness HTC
goodness it just it makes good stuff
navigation awesome and that's a free
addition to Android it's actually one my
favorite Android features that I
mentioned this over and over again but I
think it goes into the radar at most
people on any Android device there at
least any modern Android device you're
getting a free turn-by-turn navigation
with voice directions there's no
subscription you got to pay no $5.99 a
month built your carrier and it works
really well the voice is kind of robotic
but who cares it works and it's awesome
so if you're like me and you get lost
trying to get home that really that
sells and for me I don't got a lot of
great features but for someone who gets
lost that is just a must-have
so Polaris Office is gonna be included
in here so you can go ahead and open up
like your office applications that's
great let's go ahead and see what else
we got in the apps department HTC hub
it's where does he eat GC hub so you
needed a sense accountant signed in I'm
used to seeing HTC hub on Windows Phone
7 wrong button and go ahead you can
personalize it actually take a look at
that so you can personalize the
different scenes here pick what's best
for you so social HTC or AT&amp;amp;T current
let's go ahead and jump to HTC and see
what that looks like
go loading
whenever I guess funny story whenever I
go skiing and I'm on a ski lift or
snowboarding or something and you get
off the chairlift and just prepare to
unload my the only one that ever laughs
every time I see that so just three
dozen skin students we have wallpaper
different scenes you have skins here as
well
lock screen so different lock screens so
this isn't it's going take a look at the
lock screen this is one other thing I
like about HTC Sense especially on
phones trying to open an application you
can just drag it right into there and
you'll launch directly to the
application you want it and you can set
what you like to have there so pretty
neat so we run through a full review of
this guy and all kinds of other jet
stream business so leave a comment down
below anything that you want to see in
particular for a quick size comparison
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom the camera
out a little bit with hopefully not
making you guys nauseous in the process
I'll then making a promises now let's do
a size comparison with snap pet to take
if we see a difference here in the
orientations this is the sixteen by nine
so you'll see video so that was meant to
be seen on a widescreen then this
standpoint this is definitely thinner
tablet this guy arguably more SPECT
though packing more business in here so
this is the jet stream are you guys
interested in the jet stream can you get
past a price as a price not matter to
you are you waiting for the inevitable
price cut I'll be curious what you guys
have to say then you guys picked one of
these things up they are available now
from AT&amp;amp;T either online store or Best
Buy Amazon or you're asking your grandma
for Christmas whatever a lot of ways to
get it you can get it now
John Rhett enjoy from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you next video
