technobuffalo here I want to give you an
overview and demonstration of the
just-released opera mini for the iphone
and ipod touch 3rd party browsers for
the iDevices are nothing new they've
been out for well over a year but a
viable third-party browser we really
haven't seen yet opera is a browser that
has tons of market penetration if you
are a blackberry user odds are it's on
your phone if your windows mobile user
odds are your browser of choice we've
really seen it on a variety of platforms
but not yet on the iphone OS let me give
a quick overview what this looks like
and as you can see by my background i am
running iphone OS four point oh which
could make things run a bit a little bit
weird so let me open this up for you and
to give you guys may be a bit of a
bigger demonstration of it let's push
the iphone off to the side let's do this
demonstration here on the iPad you can
get a little of a bigger view of what
opera looks like we'll just search
stretch it out so we're going to add in
launching here you can see there's the
icon it's a free download available now
from the app store we've got double the
size here so it should be double the
presentation fun now I've got
introduction screen loaded up here cuz I
want to show you some of the key
features of opera mini so first tab
browsing and I'll show you all of these
this sort of con this is speed dial if
you've used sense or sense UI on Windows
Mobile this is going look very familiar
to what you get with won't a contact
speed dial long click menu something
that we've seen actually with the iPad
and now integrated here on other devices
i remembers passwords and opera link
synchronize your bookmarks speed dial in
search engines between all your mobile
phone desktop computers that's one of
the biggest advantages of opera is that
without any plugins automat they will
sync everything for you so let's go
ahead and get to the good stuff we'll go
ahead and hit the tab button here
actually before we do that let me show
you some of the settings so you've got a
big sort of wrench in the corner and
you've got a grid of 7 icons bookmarks
history start page saved pages settings
find in pain and help the help is where
that screen was that i just showed you
bookmarks pull up your list of bookmarks
will go
ahead and go back history obviously your
history and start page is what they were
talking about by that sort of speed dial
looking thing you can set all the pages
you want here these are the six that
comes standard technobuffalo
unfortunately you're gonna have to add
on your own let me go ahead and show you
what the load times look like here we'll
go ahead and on TechnoBuffalo and operas
one of those services that actually does
some of the rendering on the server side
and then push it to the device so
oftentimes you see much quicker
rendering so you look at it right here
at launched very quickly around a
standard 802 11 n connection the text is
a little bit small but you can change
that I'll show you double tap to zoom is
still there and see how quickly jumps
around pinch-to-zoom still certainly
works panning and scrolling is very
smooth I really want the big benefits of
operas it's a low time that loads just
very very quickly so the text is small
you go ahead and change the default text
size it's set by small sort of standard
you can go to medium or of course large
okay recommend because you clearly can
turn anything here but if you zoom in
you get sort of a more clear view if
there's you that I know we're going to
ask this doesn't have flash working in
it you're going to get sort of the same
functionality that you're going to get
with mobile safari so go ahead and zoom
out and you can get rid of that top bar
and the options you have a show full
screen have the menu bar at the bottom
go away one of the cool things that I
really do like about opera mini I sort
of the search engine stuff here so
similar what you see it on Firefox or
other browsers you get a ton of search
plugins up by default Google Amazon eBay
wikipedia and you can manage them and
turn them off hopefully at some point if
able to add more too I love an IMDB one
in there so I'll go ahead and go back
let me show you some the other sort of
cool features the tabbed browsing is
actually very neat let me go and open up
a new page here we'll go ahead and
launch new york times and let that
launched its kind of cool to see it like
it doesn't move doesn't move and all
sudden just jumps and the page is
already loaded we'll go ahead and launch
another one here let's go ahead and pay
facebook so tab browsing is really neat
sort of get this layer that shows up you
can scroll through very smoothly to see
the different icons and go right to the
one you want jump right to it of course
the X means close it go ahead and jump
right in technobuffalo so sort of
multitasking the background if you look
at some of the tab browsing that you get
on the iPad or iPhone or iPod touch you
can jump between pages but oftentimes
the pages you're going to reload they've
been sitting stagnant for too long not
the case here at the upper MIDI they
will stay loaded in the background let
me show you some of the other options
that you're going to get so we just
showed you start page saved pages saved
pages the setting is really where a lot
of your customization is going to be so
load images if you want to speed it up
and have your pages load blister in the
fact that you turn off the image loading
image quality set that and all these
settings are sort of optimized for speed
mobile view so instead of getting the
full view of sites we get the mobile
version full experience without talking
about by getting rid of the bar at the
top of the bottom opera link that'll
link up all your bookmark talked about
that earlier you get some privacy
settings i'll show you what those are
you guys are interested remember
passwords clear history clear cookies
make sure no one knows what sites you
were checking out and some Advanced
Options protocol start page links if you
guys want to see what those options are
HTTP or socket I'll go ahead and go back
and continuing our look at the settings
you get find in page which is actually
really neat sort of like a search go
right to the page so you can go ahead
and hit search you can type in whatever
you're looking for and it will search
there so there's an example the iPad it
will find next and just as a reminder
for people this is an iphone application
I've got blown up on the iPad that's why
I've got the iphone looking keyboard
here not the iPads keyboard sort of a
cool functionality will go ahead and get
rid of that we'll go ahead done and if
you go ahead and hit the button on the
left it'll sort of get everything back
to where you were refresh your page
obviously and if you let's say you want
to you know type in the URL of course do
that right at the top and it sort of
disappears as you start to scroll you go
back up it will jump back up to the top
I've used opera mini when I was a
blackberry user when I was a windows
mobile user it was my browser of choice
it's reliable it's very fast you're not
going to get as I don't think an elegant
experience as you get on mobile safari
but if speed is your thing if you want
to get your pages long as quickly as
possible there really isn't much of a
compare
I will show you a bit of a speed test
well this is going to be very
unscientific because it's based on
horsepower but I will load TechnoBuffalo
refresh it here on the iPad and I will
load it up on the iphone both on the
same network and I recognize this is a
very unscientific test again because of
processor speed but in case you want to
see how quickly things load I will show
you technobuffalo of course has been
loaded on both these devices and I'll do
a simple refresh on each so you guys can
see the speed so here we've got the site
all keyed up ready to go and here we've
got it all keyed up ready to go on the
iphone I'll sort of put it right there
so you can see it and I will refresh
both hopefully the same time which is
actually harder than you think it would
be at least close to the same time there
we go so this is mobile safari this of
course is opera so opera is already done
Mobile Safari is still loading now what
if we reverse those and we do mobile
safari on the iPad and we do opera mini
on the iphone let's check that out to
see if these speeds are representative
okay so I've got the sites ready to go
on both devices we've got mobile safari
here on the ipad now and we've got opera
mini on the iphone and we expect
probably that opera mini on the iphone
will load it faster although the
horsepower of the ipad may push it
through we'll go and check and i'll do
the sort of the Refresh test here let me
go ahead and open both these up or try
and hit load them at the same time which
like I said is more difficult than you'd
expect it to be so close to the same
time we see the ipad looks like it's
showing content first nope mobiles the
Opera Mini is still loaded it faster
they're looking at just a raw speed test
clearly Opera Mini is faster even with
the 400 megahertz faster and optimized
processor that the ipad has still on the
same mobile network this loaded much
faster this is great news for you
unlocked iphone users for maybe using it
on an edge network you're going to
notice a huge speed increase any guys
and jon rettinger from technova hope you
enjoyed the overview and hit the head of
