from TechnoBuffalo here and I want to
give you a speed test of Ryan's Just
Lunch 4G network I've got one of their
to launch advices here this is their
pantech 4G USB modem let's go ahead and
see if 4G
lives up to the speed pipe so you've got
a big gorilla style with the camera
angle here the VZ access manager
software that the to launching 4G modems
need to run as currently Windows only so
we've boot camps on the iMac into
Windows 7 so I want to give you first a
speed comparison so you can see what a
home network looks like versus the 4G
network my home network is relatively
fast off the fastest in the world but
it's pretty decent Oh will you speed
test on that here to check the home
network speed just as a basis for
comparison I've been in Southern
California so we will use the Los
Angeles server let's go ahead and get
started a Verizon is claiming 4G
real-world download speeds of about five
to eight megabits per second and upload
speeds of about one to three so my home
network is uh hauling along pretty fast
here it's actually a much quicker test
and I usually get generally I'm about 15
or so megabits per second I got twenty
two point one two down and on the up
it's relatively quick here hovering just
about eight or nine megabits per second
down and I'll leave this window up so
you can come back and compare alright so
this is my home Wi-Fi network pretty
quick nothing that's going to sort of
set any records but again it does get
the job done so on my home network here
if I want to download an mp3 it's gonna
take me two seconds of five mega
megabytes if I want to download the
video clip but 35 megabytes it's going
to take 13 seconds and the 800 megabyte
movie is going to take me five minutes
so I've got the USB modem right here
I've got a USB extension cable right
here it's go ahead and plug it in this
is the pantech so it sort of swivels a
little bit this USB part comes out and I
want to connect this in real times you
can see how well this actually takes go
ahead and plug it in will see some LED
lights light up there let me know it's
connected takes a minute or two to power
on the device I'm go ahead and pull the
modem down I'm going to
close this I'm going to launch the VZ
access manager software you can see it
loading right here and it's telling you
know it's connecting and that it's
initializing right now still takes about
let's say about 30 seconds from initial
plug-in to actually being able to
connect to the device so there it is
I've got my 4G LTE network connected a
guy hovered between one two bars of 4G
so I'll go ahead and actually keep
myself connected so I've got now one bar
4G you can see the easy access is
connected there are some other networks
here that's poignant via Wi-Fi but I do
have one bar of 4G so let's go ahead and
run the speed test again using the 4G
modem let's go ahead and at start of the
test will use the same la server let's
see what the speeds are on the 4G modem
so we're getting very quick speeds here
16 megabits per second down which is
faster than most home networks and looks
like we're going to be getting a tour so
megabits up I mean so really lightning
fast beads and these speeds are actually
pretty reflective of other tests that
I've done when I took this outside and I
used a laptop I was generally getting
between 12 and 15 or so megabits per
second down the upload speed here is
extremely fast and that may be due just
to lack of network traffic currently on
the 4G network there aren't that many
people on it so again for service and
speed comparisons here I'm go download a
mp3 a 5 mega bit megabytes in 3 seconds
35 megabyte video clip in 18 seconds and
an 800 megabyte movie in 7 minutes my
home network here is a little bit faster
not by much
in fact the upload is actually faster
than my home network so what does this
mean for you well if you are an avid
Internet user you are going to be
getting some crazy fast speeds if you
get 4G
servus I expect needs to slow down a
little bit as the network becomes more
mature and more people start coming on
it so let's go ahead and go to youtube
and see how this looks in a real world
environment so I've got my Mac versus PC
video of your plane's let's go ahead and
go to that page let's kick it up to 720p
she does any trouble with the buffer
there there we go 720p no problem at all
the buffers moving right along go ahead
and hit it play nice and smooth if I
fullscreen it there is no problem at all
I can jump around almost the end of the
video which is now just about fully
buffered and now it is all done I can
play it and it plays very very smoothly
without any issues whatsoever really
nice and again you can see that I am
indeed connected it tells me what my
data usage was to the 4G network and I
now have two bars of 4G right here so I
really noticed no difference in speed to
my home network and the 4G so if you're
looking for something to it's a game
with on the go if you can live within
the cap for data just currently going to
be fifty dollars for five gigs or $80
for 10 and then $10 per overage for each
gigabyte you're gonna be getting
fantastic network speeds here this thing
really just hauls anyway guys I am John
R Ettinger from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
