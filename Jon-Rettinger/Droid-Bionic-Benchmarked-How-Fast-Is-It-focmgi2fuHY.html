technobuffalo here and if you are
looking to pick up the droid bionic
chances are specs are important to you
you want the latest greatest and
supposedly fastest device on the market
well the droid bionic certainly brings
in the spec department but out of those
impressive spec sheets translate to well
fake real world use if you watch any of
my phone videos in the past you know
that I always you are on a quadrant test
on my android phones quadrant is one of
the many benchmarking tools let's sort
of give your phone a score think of it
like a letter grade that your phone gets
checks 3d capabilities can check some
multithreading and a ton of other sort
of technical things to give you a final
score so I have not run this quadrant
test yet on the droid bionic I thought
it'd be fun to run it on camera I'm
getting a lot of questions about the raw
speed of this guy let's go ahead and
check the quadrant score I'm going to
cut the camera but if you want to see
the full test being run it'll be at the
end of the video alright let's go ahead
and run quadrants it's a free download
from the android market go ahead and hit
ok and we'll run full benchmarks the
droid bionic certainly looks to bring
some of the thunder i'm expecting one of
the highest quadrant scores for a stock
rom that we've seen it's important to
mention stock rom every time I pose a
quadrant score and get a lot of
responses people saying I got a higher
score with my nexus s with a custom rom
custom roms let you do a ton of tweaks
there's certainly stock roms don't do
for you so I think this was a bit of a
grain of salt if you want to go back and
check some other scores from previous
devices you know I'll go ahead and post
those so you can check them as well at
least see what the score is going to be
and you can see what quadrant looks like
while it's running so am I going to stop
the camera thank you at the end for the
full score and we've got our full score
and not surprisingly it is a top score
by quite a bit giving us a score of 2202
for the droid bionic easily beating the
nexus one motorola droid x HTC evo at
all kinds of different builds it's a
pretty nice
score it's not the highest that we've
seen but it is very high so there you
have it that is the quadrant score for
the motorola droid bionic a fun short
video be doing a ton more codes on the
droid bionic coming up hope you guys
enjoyed jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
