TechnoBuffalo here there are a lot of
awesome fantastic youtubers and tech
reviewers floating around the internets
that aren't getting the exposure that
they deserve so occasionally the
TechnoBuffalo staff we will reach out to
one such youtuber and after the position
to be part of the team we're there
kickass video content can be featured
well right here on the YouTube channel
and also on technobuffalo you can get
the exposure that they deserve so today
I'm proud to announce the addition of
another TechnoBuffalo staff member John
quach you may recognize him from a few
other YouTube channels or videos in the
past you can be contributing regular
content for HD videos per month right
here in the John for lakers channel be
syndicated on TechnoBuffalo there'll be
some unique technobuffalo content as
well we're really excited to have him
join the staff he's a really amazing
talent so let until John hears himself
I'll see you guys next video ah well
hello there TechnoBuffalo viewers my
name is John and I'm from another
channel called tech waffle and mr. jon
rettinger has invited me to come on to
technobuffalo to do some videos and all
of you already know that mr. john for
lakers is such a cool guy therefore he
asked me to make a video telling you
guys why I think I'm awesome well that's
hmm that is tricky um I can draw sort of
allow me to demonstrate my skills for
you guys BAM it's a buffalo I thought
it'd be appropriate because you know
technobuffalo John for liquors and you
know he's eating some grass over there
how can that does not look like a
buffalo it's more like a sheep anyways
not too sure what kind of videos I'm
gonna be doing here for the John for
lakers china but i guarantee you should
be fun we're thinking maybe application
reviews opinion videos about certain
technology things for example damn this
is a rather large camera lens and guess
what it can get larger dirty so yeah
pretty much stuff like that hopefully
you guys won't mind me sticking around
this channel because we all know how
awesome mr. John render is Oh
so cool so yeah just sit back and relax
and watch some other videos made by mr.
technobuffalo himself and I guess I'll
see you guys in another video my you
guys remember John's creepy by that was
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
