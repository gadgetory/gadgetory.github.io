technobuffalo here flash on the apple
devices has been a very polarizing topic
without much of a resolution Apple as
their side Adobe the makers of flash
head bears and it really wasn't a
solution to be seen that is until now
I'm going to give you a demonstration of
a free application called cloud browse
it actually gives you full access to
flash applications so let's go ahead and
get started cloud Brown is a freak
download from the App Store it's meant
for the iphone or ipod touch and of
course you can use it on the ipad as
well as i'm going to do right now so i
can zoom in and make it a bit bigger so
let me go ahead and then open it up and
essentially what this is going to do
it's going to access an outside server
now oftentimes this isn't going to work
there probably aren't that many there
and you're going to get this married
message right here all servers are busy
you have to kind of keep hitting okay
and oftentimes it will take about 15 to
20 seconds of hitting this before you
actually get in I've launched this
application probably bout 10 times right
now and sometimes it takes three or four
shots we saw here sometimes it takes 20
or 30 so the interface looks like a very
simple Linux browser you've got your
tabs and say woke up the cloud browse
and a Google tab right there and if
you've ever used in remote access
clients to access remote computer on
your iPhone or iPod Touch or iPad it's
going to be very familiar as you move
your finger around you'll see a mouse
kind of follow you you do have
multitouch your pinch and zoom in
interface here is very simple you got
your back and forward buttons you have a
web button which are going to launch a
window to type in your web search or
address a button to pull up your
keyboard and some tabs which is really
just a simple list so let me show you
some of the most popular flash sites on
the web to see if this is really going
to suit you and see how it works
arguably the first most popular has got
to be who that was the first one I
wanted to check let me show you what
that looks like i'll go ahead and hit
web and we'll go to hulu com
and we'll see how this looks no loads
actually pretty fast and depending on
your Wi-Fi speed so here you looking
about a clip from Glee go ahead and zoom
in a little bit right there and I will
hit watch now and let's see what happens
I'm going to have to hit things a few
times you can see that a mouse tends to
follow you around zoom out a little bit
and we get a very familiar error message
those at the US may have seen it looks
like based on your IP address we notice
you are trying to access hulu through an
anonymous proxy tool so hulu is not
going to work on this unfortunately
though we can't see that of it was sort
of a u.s. location I probably would have
let's take a look next at arguably the
second or first most popular flash based
website YouTube so let's jump on over
there and we'll go to youtube com and
we'll go to my channel two down for
lakers and see how this loads often
times these mobile applications have
different versions of youtube to the
iphone or ipod touch or ipad as their
own different browser that you can't
play the video directly inside of it
although now we actually see that it's
plane is playing pretty clearly you can
see you've got me talking there it's a
bit stuttering and the audio is not
synced up necessarily the video but is
watchable you can see turn the volume
down to hear me talk twice and you can
see that there is a flash-based ad
that's showing up there in the right
hand corner and things are playing so
let's see what happens if we try and up
the resolution here I wouldn't they say
the recommend watching a movie but if
you want to watch a video at a pinch
this is going to work so right now we
are at looks like 360p let's see what
happens if we bump this up it means you
got to hit it a few times get it to work
so now we're at 480 a bit stuttery but
it's still watchable not the best
quality and I assume we're going to see
the same problem if we jumped it all the
way up to 720 it's going to look even
worse and probably take a long time to
play
so not so watchful you don't notice any
quality difference on this device so
whether you're in the lowest of the
highest it's not really going to matter
so let's jump back down to the lowest
see if we can get it to play as smoothly
as possible and we'll try full screen
and see if that works so here we are
back at 360 and I should mention as well
at the accelerometer does work to go
ahead and rotate any way you'd like and
we'll see if we can get this to play
fullscreen it's the other quality looks
so it does play fullscreen it doesn't
degrade the quality it looks pretty much
the same as it did when it was on the
main page a little bit sutter e and not
the best quality but it's watchable if
you need to in a pinch so let's see how
this handles maybe some flash games will
go to flash games 247 calming else you
may want to do we'll go ahead and launch
this well exit this flash games 247 all
right now was just give him some advice
for aspiring youtubers we wanted to
check that out that's what that video
was so here we are on flash games 247
I'll go ahead and just pick one and so
with diesel and death and again
sometimes it always worked first time
you click it you have to do it multiple
times to actually get it to recognize so
it didn't work right there we'll try it
another time and see if we can get one
of these to play and see if it actually
is usable you could see on the right
side there was flash content that was
actually loading so does not appear to
want to play we'll try one more time
we'll try a penguin game and see if that
works and does not appear to be working
which is unfortunate let's try one last
site which I know you guys probably
check out quite a bit we will try world
of warcraft
see if this would work I know a lot of
you guys play this and if you can play
it smoothly from your iPad or iPhone I
know you would be quite happy so things
are playing flash content loading and
you're going to get a very similar
experience to what you had on youtube it
plays its stuttery it's not going to be
the best experience but if you got to go
in there and kick some butt you probably
could do it but it's not going to be the
best experience so while this isn't full
flash like Adobe would probably want for
the ipad or iphone or ipod touch it is a
workaround as you can see here it does
actually function so it's something that
you guys would use would you actually
use the sprouts or check out some flash
applications or no use for flash anymore
on the Apple devices kind of curious
what you guys have to say anyway i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo where you
can go and create your own text sub blog
talk to people on our social network and
even monetize your own websites and that
make a couple bucks if you want anyway
leave your comments down below I'll see
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
