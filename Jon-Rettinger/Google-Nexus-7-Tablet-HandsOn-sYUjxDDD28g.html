hey what's going on I'm Noah from
technobuffalo when I try this again one
of the Google demo demo errs just blew
me out with the speakers from the queue
over there but we'll get to that in a
second I'm here with the Nexus 7 the
much leaked oft rumoured ballyhooed
google-branded Google built tablet
computer 7 inch tablet computer running
Android for one jellybean see the Nexus
branding on the back and the sous
branding it's built by a sous it runs an
nvidia quad-core Tegra 3 chipset android
41 like I said the first tablet first
device to ship with jelly bean it's a
7-inch 1200 x 800 HD display two
versions us eight gig for 199 16 gig for
249 set to shift in mid-july that's the
current date they're saying mid-july the
device has a front facing camera no rear
facing camera and the front facing
camera so far as I can tell I'm not
seeing a dedicated camera app on here
but instead you can get to the camera by
launching the Google+ app
so if I go to our hang out there I am
now and hang out mode but no other way
to get to the camera that I've seen
although I'm sure it'll be used for all
sorts of things also no hardware buttons
on the front panel instead you just got
the the virtual buttons on the
touchscreen and then on the right spine
you've got a rocker switch and the power
on/off switch on the bottom you've got a
headphone jack and a micro USB jack and
then that's about it device feels nice
hard to get a true sense of its total
weight because of the security device
here but we're getting ours they're
giving these out to everybody later on
today so we'll have a ship it back to
the home office in John I'll hit you up
with a full review in due course but the
device feels really nice lightweight
definitely smaller and lighter than the
knobby to which I just reviewed which
was sort of ironically the first Tiger
three device with a 7-inch display but
built for kids so much thicker and
heavier but you know this is this is
basically you could look at it as a
Kindle Fire killer I mean straight from
google with the branding and integrating
heavily with the new google plus like i
mentioned and the new google play store
that now has t TV shows and music and
all kinds of stuff and of course also
integrating with the new Nexus Q to a
separate video on that but that's
basically the Apple TV / sonos killer if
you want to use the whole killer thing
um I don't think I can get into it from
this one no I can't only the owner can
modify but this is the streaming device
whoops for audio and video for 299 that
this integrates with android devices as
well as the cloud the play cloud but
little preview here of advert for one
with the upgraded notifications the
notification is more configurable more
dynamic you've got the widgets on the
home screen which can be sort of resized
and all kinds of stuff you can do with
them now and so I gotta add this widget
and I move it on top of gmail it'll move
gmail around which is kind of nice makes
configuring your widgets a little bit
easier and then also if my screen was
full and i added another widget it would
resize things to make it easier on me as
well here we'll have glad the the
footmarks because that's big
and see it moves things around and we'll
add another bookmarks
so you can get some Auto resizing
happening yeah so you can see that
bookmark shrank down to fit the screen
anyway just one of the new features on
Android for one jellybean and again
shipping on the Nexus tablet but the big
news here the tablet from a sous again
199 for the a cake version i believe 249
for the 16 gig version 7 inch HD display
it will ship in mid-july or so and
pre-orders i believe are available now
you can check out the google play store
to order direct from there from google
i/o where i'm about to check out the
Nexus Q which is now displaying high-def
video on the big screen
I'm Noah crap it's much much more from
io 2012 over on TechnoBuffalo com really
