Hazleton from technobuffalo checking out
the brand new Microsoft Surface book is
announced today by surprise it's a
laptop / tablet really awesome device
has got a metal body here if I hold this
button it will pop off the top there you
go and now it's a tablet and now it's
really neat so you either have a core i5
or core i7 processor and it starts at
1499 and that's at the top part and then
the bottom part has a GPU which adds the
extra power you need for you know video
editing and stuff like that that
Microsoft was talking about today and
then it just sort of pops back on here
it's sort of an electronic switch to
take it off but then you just manually
pop it on a little difficult with my
tripod here but it pops back on there we
go and you can see it has a little
message there and says oh it's attached
here unattached back would really just
windows logo there on the right-hand
side just the charging port it looks
like the display port nothing on the
bottom Microsoft logo on the left you
have a full SD card slot to USB i
believe it's three point oh and then the
the pen magnetically sits here but also
sort of pops off it they showed it in
the demo that it should work just fine
and sit there but it didn't really at
all times again so you have the full
keyboard here full Windows 10 it's a 10
point one touchscreen display you've got
the live tiles in the Start menu we've
seen that before in Cortana of course
you can see asking anything right there
on the display and then under the hood
though you've got basically you're
looking at 13.5 inch pixel sense display
that's a 3000 by 2,000 pixel resolution
so 267 I pixels per inch storage you
either get 128 gigabytes 256 gigabytes 5
12 or one terabyte you're also looking
at an office 30-day trial again 6th gen
core i5 or i7 processor up to 12 hours
of battery life intel HD graphics on the
hifi version and then nvidia geforce is
also an option on high five by seven
version
so those are some of the specs here and
then get eight gigs of ram or 16 gigs
depending on the configuration so prices
you'll definitely jacked up a little bit
depending on how you can figure it but
nice trackpad here I'm really easy to
use if it feels natural sort of like I'm
coming from a macbook pro so I found
that was nice and easy and it does feel
solid in the hand it didn't feel too
wobbly but it's also not as Sturgis in
the laptops that I've used in the past
you can see there's a little wobble
right there whereas we use laptops that
very much more rigid in that area but we
want to give you a first look here at
the new surface book from Microsoft this
