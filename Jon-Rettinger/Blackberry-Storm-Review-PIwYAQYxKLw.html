it once to give a sense of how the phone
works and really can give me a unbiased
and relatively thought-out and thorough
review on it so I hope you guys enjoy
first thing it's a phone that's let's I
have call quality Verizon's network at
least by me is fantastic it's certainly
gonna vary by location but if you get
good Verizon service you're gonna be
very happy with the color quality on the
phone I heard no static or buzzing
people on the other end of the call
reported no static of buzzing either
very clear is that it almost sounded
like I was on a landline so kudos to
Verizon and Blackberry for that but
that's probably not what you here for
and not what you're interested in the
storm for is for call quality storm does
a lot of things and it's supposed to do
a lot of things so let's talk about what
it does well email is fantastic you have
the blackberry email that you're used to
on your curves your bolds your pearls
pearl flips everything does email
fantastic exactly as advertised it's a
Blackberry after all email is certainly
just phone strong points now some of the
concerns I have with the phone they have
become more and more as problems as I
continue to use it all right actually
the to touch mechanisms on the phone so
as I mentioned in my overview it
actually it has a capacitive touch
screen so when you touch it it registers
a click and then you have to push in to
use the function rubber application
you're using so it's actually a double
touch you have to touch it wants to
select it and then push in back to open
the application now that's a little bit
iffy using applications throughout the
phone sometimes you only have to touch
it sometimes you have to click it and if
it comes a little bit unclear so which
application do you have to do which with
the big issue that I had with the phone
is actually when you're typing so when
you go to type in SMS
pulls up a full keyboard either a full
keyboard rather a landscape and a shirt
type when it's up in portrait mode now
you can order the type but I've shown
this in numerous videos and had a type
on the blackberry storm you have to
actually push the keys all the way in to
type you have to wait for the screen to
pop back up so there's a little bit of
delay for typing and a lot of people can
type lightning fast on there are other
blackberries whether it's the bold or
the curves whatever you're not gonna
have as FAFSA typing it's really not
gonna be that accurate compared to some
other phones with on-screen keyboards
you can see what letter you're typing
meaning it'll pop up when you have your
finger over it
I'm not so with this one you just get a
little blue color that hovers over the
key and it's often unclear what key
you're pressing so typing is extremely
inaccurate when using the full keyboard
I found the only way to get even a
modicum of accuracy was actually to use
Dasher tech keyboard because the keys
are just bigger but again not nearly as
fast that nearly as quick
I tried typing the same message in this
shirt type on the storm and using the
shirt type on a blackberry pearl flip
with both similar keyboards I was able
to type much much much quicker on the
pearl flip with an actual tactile
hardware keyboard so that's something
definitely to keep in mind internet
browsing is something that BlackBerry
has really been working to improve upon
and they started their big ass
improvements with the BlackBerry Bold
really being able to render full HTML
pages and this is another area where the
blackberry storm really does shine is
with web browsing you get full robust
HTML websites it does handle some flash
but not so much
you can't view YouTube videos for
example yet on it and there isn't a
dedicated YouTube player like there are
on some other windows mobile phones or
on an iPhone for example so no YouTube
videos on this yet media on the phone
hand those media spectacularly as far as
viewing videos the screen is gorgeous
as far as listening to music you've got
a 3.5 millimeter head
Jack which is located on the right hand
side of the device and can handle all
those tasks with relative ease so now to
get some more in the downsides the
operating system is extremely buggy it
feels almost as though rim was rushed to
get this to market before the holiday
season they fixed some of the problems
with the software update but still
things like screen rotation aren't so
quick sometimes don't even register or
sometimes even too sensitive
I feel looking at the phone and just
tilting it back a little bit screen or
rotate even right now it's not rotating
back you can see in the screen as you
can actually a perfect example see how
long it takes with the rotate back did
shake it turn it again and then turn it
and then finally it rotates back that's
just one example of kind of how how
buggy and quirky this can be the click
keyboard is a very interesting and
unique approach to a phone but it
doesn't translate so well right now that
being said I think rim can really fix
the platform with software updates but I
don't think the phone is ready for
primetime right now you know like you
just saw screen rotation applications
kill load very slowly I've had numerous
crashes these are not things I'm
familiar with the blackberry and
blackberries are known for their
stability the reliability and their
business workhorse and the storm just
doesn't have that same feeling that
seems ability that other blackberries do
have like I said before I think it can
be fixed with software updates but if
you are thinking about getting a storm I
recommend holding off until you know two
or three software updates have come down
the line and you can really fix it you
know another issue with the phone and I
know people are reporting this and mass
amounts of the devices is the screen as
Lesley sponsored in the corners when you
go to click you have sometimes even
register at all which can be quite
annoying because sometimes you want to
use the full area of the screen
especially for typing with the full
keyboard so I'm gonna letters are in the
bottom left or bottom right hand corners
in the screen it's it quite difficult
when they're not gonna be recognized
there have been some sort of fixes like
putting a piece of paper above the
battery and things like that those are
things you should have to do with the
new phone especially a phone that cost
this much and this much for service
things like that should just work out of
the box so this
pointed with the rim for that now that
being said I was really excited about
the phone I was you know really hyped up
about it I thought it was gonna be the
first true
you know iPhone killer I hate to mention
the iPhone in a review here but die
phones really it set a standard for
touchscreen devices not it was gonna be
the killer the one that really was going
to knock Apple down the peg and really
set would have been Verizon up for the
future you know with the future storm
devices and they just haven't done that
yet you know it's if you're getting a
phone expecting it to to allow you and
everything you wanted to do very well
the storm is really enough he I
recommend you look elsewhere now why
should you get this door well if you're
on Verizon or I really want to switch
the rise in service and you have to have
a fully capable touchscreen email device
well let's storm is really the only way
to go if you're on Verizon and you want
to have a blackberry I still recommend
using the curve that they have on their
service or their world edition but if
you really need to have a full-featured
web browser and you're okay with the
quirks you know it's not going to work
perfectly you know you're gonna have
some troubles typing you know the
software hasn't been fixed yet then go
ahead and go up to storm but to me those
are a lot of compromises to make for a
for a phone no matter how much you might
want it so reasons not to get the storm
don't get the storm because you hate
Apple or don't get the storm because you
hate the iPhone you want to make a stand
against it that's not a reason the
phone's not a political statement I've
heard a lot of people say I'm getting
the storm because I hate Apple and
you're allowed to paint a player a lot
to dislike of company or its products
that's not a reason to go ahead and get
a device like this it's an expensive
piece of hardware it's also a two-year
commitment you might not be happy for
two years using the phone that is
inherently buggy and very well may not
be fixed with software it's just my
speculation an opinion that they're
gonna fix it but you know I don't have
any insider information on that so don't
get it because of that and don't get it
because you think it looks cool or you
think it looks fun because you are going
to be grossly disappointed with the
phone I can't tell you how many times
I've had to reset the device you know
you take it out your pocket you show
your friends you know look how cool
Blackbird storm that wears off very
quickly when you realize it takes ten
minutes type of text message or at least
type it properly
it does have cut and paste and mm ATS
some really cool things that you know
other phones may be missing but it's
still not enough to convince me to use
it as my primary device so guys hope
this was helpful hope I answered some
questions that you may have about the
blackberry storm check out my other
videos for some demonstrations some
browser comparisons I did a head-to-head
video with the iPhone actually like the
two of them so you know ask any
questions that you'd like about the
storm be happy to answer them for you or
any other things that you'd like to see
happy to answer them for you as well
