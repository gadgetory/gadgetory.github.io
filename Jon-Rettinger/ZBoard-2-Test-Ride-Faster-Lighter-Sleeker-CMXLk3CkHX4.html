to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone
John retina from TechnoBuffalo here
we're at showstoppers 2015 those you
might not be familiar it's like a mini
CES while CES is going on about five
months ago I took a look at one of our
favorite products of the year the Z
board you see in the background of a lot
of our videos it is an all electric
skateboard
but much like the cell phone and tablet
world new updates are always coming
we've been forming to show us the Z
board - so yeah today on IndieGoGo we
announced the Z board to upgrade to our
original Z board lighter weight faster
longer range quicker charging bigger
wheels more fun more awesome in every
direction so what's different about the
the way obviously it's lighter how much
lighter so the board that we had under
your feet was 25 pounds the new board is
16 pounds so 40% weight reduction but
even though we've reduced the weight
we've actually increased the range your
board at a 10 mile range our new $900 Z
board - Blue has a 16 mile range and
also we've increased the top speed so
while the board is lighter it's got it's
faster and goes further what's the top
speed on it 20 miles an hour
damn what else is you're looking at the
Bott the back of it the back looks
completely redesigned here so what are
we looking at I'm swimming this big slab
in the middle is a better yeah so our
new battery is significantly thinner
than our old battery but it contains a
battery almost as large in terms of
capacity partially because if there's a
CNC route in this deck a good happen to
this battery box is actually living
inside the deck that allows it to be
thin it also allows it to be very
weatherproof it actually
flash proof that's another feature of
the new Z board to also in this battery
box we have our speed controller on off
and charge port the charge port is
obviously for our charger which brings
the fast charging like I mentioned how
fast can a charge so a full 16 mile
charge in 90 minutes from this a
standard 120 regular wall outlet
standard 120 wall outlet basically it's
like laptop charger its lead brick lead
one side in the wall one side in the
board unless I can admit I'm not the
most coordinated guy in the world and I
was able to ride the original Z board
because of the pads is anything change
those are still the same pads that sort
of would allow a clutch like me to ride
a skateboard so similar but but improved
so the new pad is is more organ on your
foot it also in contains a larger sensor
that spreads closer to the edges so now
it's easier to press the the sensor
while also the pressing the edge to tilt
the deck the the pads are more sensitive
than previous and they're also more
flush with the deck so we didn't want to
mess up a good thing the other pads were
really well received so we kept them
very similar it just made slight changes
so people didn't see our first video
it's got two pads you can see on the
front in the back you put your foot on
each pad you lean forward you go forward
you have put your foot on the back pad
you lean back and you go backwards I
mean it's as simple as it's lean forward
to go is gonna be that's kind of our
calling card what I liked most about the
original Z board sort with electric car
is you step on that go pedal you get
that instant torque and you jet forward
you didn't do that which is he were able
to sort of gradually move forward I
assume that's the same thing here as
well a lot of the decisions we make with
the Z board are with Feig the Nubian
mind so we want it to be safe we want it
to have gradual acceleration we want to
have gradual deceleration we want that
big wheel so you can go over cracks and
bumps and maybe you should have been
voided on a smaller wheeled skateboard
so that real gradual acceleration is
really accessible and it allows us to
hopefully sell skateboards to non
skateboarders because we love skateboard
we've been skateboarding our entire
lives we want to share this with with
everybody and when and where can people
get this so this is available on
IndieGoGo now today's our first day we
had our goal in the first two hours we
got 29 more
IndieGoGo and after that it'll be
available on our website Zboard shop
calm but if people interested that you
can jump on the IndieGoGo because
they'll get the best pricing there and
most importantly can I write it alright
so for you guys promise you can't laugh
it's on carpet and I'm not the most
coordinated nerd around let's give it a
whirl I'm just going to drop the mic
like dramatic style
so thank you guys for watching my very
elegant riding of the new Z board to bed
thank you for taking the time to show us
here for you guys thank you guys for
watching our coverage of CES 2015 if you
want to see all the rest of the videos
