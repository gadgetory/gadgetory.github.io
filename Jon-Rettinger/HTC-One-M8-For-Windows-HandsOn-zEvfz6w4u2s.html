TechnoBuffalo we're checking out the HTC
One m8 for Windows it was just announced
by HTC and Verizon Wireless and it's
available today if it looks familiar
that's because it is it's actually the
same hardware and body that we saw in
the HTC One m8 on the back you can see
the only difference really is that
there's a windows phone logo and the
verizon logo below it you still get the
four ultrapixel camera with the depth
sensor right there and the dual LED
flash up top the IR blaster and the
power button on the right hand side you
still have the believe that's the SIM
card tray or the microUSB on the right
it's a micro SD card on the right there
and the volume buttons on the bottom 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and microUSB
charging on the left the sim card slot
right there that pops out and then of
course it's running Windows 8.1 point 1
the latest version that just hit that
means you get Cortana you get the new
Action Center notification shade up top
and HTC even included other features
like blinkfeed which we've seen before
and send six and it basically shows you
all the feeds that you want to subscribe
to you can go through and choose your
own topics and include social networks
and we'll see we can get through here so
here we have featured content or its
associated press food lifestyle music
topics different categories and services
naps like Facebook Twitter and Google+
another thing I wanted to show you is
the camera UI will also look familiar
that's because it really carries over a
lot of the same features that we saw on
the One m8 should be easy to use for
everybody that's already used that
camera but does lack Zoe and some of the
other smaller features but selfie one of
the options there uses that five
megapixel front facing camera with the
wide angle lens and of course you still
have the boomsound speakers other
features include support for the gesture
or motion launch gestures and then also
the dot view case will be supported on
the phone as well and so just to recap
under the hood you've got a Snapdragon
801
sister clocked at two point three
gigahertz 32 gigs of storage two gigs of
ram and right now this is the gunmetal
gray version the only version we've
heard of and as far as we're told it's
exclusive to verizon wireless this is
Todd Hazleton with techno Buffalo and
that's a first look at the HTC One m8
for Windows hey thanks for watching this
video and if you guys would like to see
