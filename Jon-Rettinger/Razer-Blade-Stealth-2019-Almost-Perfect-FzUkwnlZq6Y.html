resident evil to remake for sponsoring
this video what's going on everybody I'm
John render from I guess just like here
now and one of the things I used to love
to do was reviewing laptops and
computers in general and I haven't done
one in a while and if you remember the
last time I did that let's just say it
pissed a bunch of people off and if
having kids has taught me anything it's
that people get upset way too easily and
sometimes you just need a snack so let
me give you a juice box and let's take a
look at the latest from razor to razor
blades don't
so I've been kind of crushing on pcs for
a while ever since I started reviewing
the huawei mate book X is my home
computer but since and I want to say I
got to get attention span of a puppy I'm
always looking for something new so
what's up new hotness
so 2019 razor blade stealth is one of
the beast mode iasts ultrabooks you'll
find it's got all new design and latest
and greatest Intel processor and even a
discrete GPU I'll packed into a really
small ultra lightweight package it's got
almost all the text bells and whistles
you can ask for but are set bells and
whistles enough to justify it's $1,400
starting price tag and also more
importantly once once the whistles on a
laptop stupid analogies aside though the
new blade stealth is absolutely 100%
definitely beyond a doubt
mostly worth it so I tend to test
computers like in the real world not
like synthetically at benchmarks I test
them exactly how I use them so at the
office it's lighter stuff like slack
GoogleDocs rams highlights empty gave
this to the lakers rumors on Chrome
I don't gave him that much but I am at
home and the kids are asleep I do
occasionally like to fire up steam and
play some games so that's what I did
here with the razor blade stealth so
pricing is not cheap but it's also not
like crazy insane either there is a 5-2
dollar difference so 1,400 bucks - about
$1,900 from the entry level with
integrated graphics to the max SPECT out
the 4k touchscreen and the MX 150g pou
so razor is super quick to point out
that this is definitely not a
full-fledged gaming laptop you probably
want the very least a 15 inch blade for
that but this little ultrabook does pack
quite a punch but we'll get some more on
that in a minute we've got the mid tier
blade stealth here and it's $1,500
surprised I could definitely warrant
some research and do Deeley before you
pick one up for that kind of money
though you are getting some pretty
impressive least Ultrabook specs you're
getting the latest whiskey Lake i7 quad
core processor 16 gigs of RAM 20:56 gig
m2 SSD and then the NVIDIA MX 150
dedicated GPU I just like on MG pues
rage has been making some awesome
looking laptops for a long time have
pretty much been a fan of the design and
build since they started the quality of
the razer product especially their
laptops and the new stealth here kind of
raises that delicious sounding razor bar
it's got a new design that's pretty much
a pared down version of the larger
15-inch blade and that's not a bad thing
the stuff is a little bit more blocky at
the Ala Ludum design that does feel
incredibly premium and you kind of want
that you're shelling out you know
fifteen sixteen hundred bucks for the
computer the entire laptop is also
fairly small and surprisingly light
weighing in at just under three pounds
it's easy to throw in a backpack or Kay
around without ever really worried about
getting certain marks on your shoulders
so I've been a little tough on rage in
the past for shipping just gigantic
power bricks at their computers but I do
want to give them credit they are
charging this guy of you USB type-c and
the power brick is super tiny so if you
want some USB C charging you're good you
can expect some pretty awesome battery
life to accept a full day with some
mixed use stuff like web browsing video
streaming I thought I could easily get
over a full hour of use and speaking of
things that finally made their way to
raise your laptop's Windows hello is
here so on the plus side I love how fast
convenient is to just unlock a computer
with your face what I don't love though
is that potato quality webcam but at
least it's above the display and not
looking directly up my nose
looking at you del in wall way the
display on that new stealth is also
pretty impressive so this pen ATP
molecule is what is very noticeable
especially when you're outside in direct
sunlight and special improvement over
the previous self so underneath the
matte finish is a pretty good HD panel
colors look bold enough and vivid it's
got good viewing angles and even they
hinge the whole assembly sits on seems
to be smoother and it's more refined
than last gen you can also opt just
machine up if you want at the 4k touch
display but I've got no issues here
telling you to save your money and go
with 1080p better battery life but if
you do miss that touchscreen
got an option so mostly everything with
the blade stealth is candy canes and
rainbow but it isn't perfect I probably
my biggest issue at the new model really
comes down to the keyboard I'm typically
in the past love the keyboards on Razer
laptops or spacious tactile and
generally pretty comfortable but
I just like couldn't bring myself to
love even after the two weeks of usage
and this is ultimately gonna come down
to a personal preference but I found the
key child would be a bit shallow because
the whole machine lost about an inch and
a half of width and the redesign some of
the keys is condensed to fit in the new
design making the entire keyboard feel a
little bit too cramped for my finger
taste this is like definitely a small
annoyance and 100% subjective and one
you might not have it all the keyboard
though to get past that is really well
built
I think ditching individual backlighting
for one large single zone backlight is
that for the right information I'm gonna
throw up my hands up for precision
drivers they are here and the trackpad
is still one of the best you can find on
any Windows laptop it's super spacious
even in this small body the speakers are
surprisingly excellent for this size
it's actually four speakers out instead
of the 2 they get noticeably louder and
sound better than the last gen cell oh
they do lack the fullness you typically
get on larger laptop speakers but I
could easily watch youtube videos a
movie was this a music and not be
bothered at all by it so new plates
Delta passion for the impressive power
for its really tiny size so it's got an
i7 and 16 gigs of RAM that's gonna give
you some power to play with or things
like mobile video editing and gaming but
for those you love benchmark tests I'm
gonna throw a bone your way here's some
PC mark and 3d mark results for the new
stealth so it's obviously not gonna be
on the same power level as a
full-fledged desktop replacement or
really blow anything out of the water
but this is ultrabook can definitely
hold its own when it comes to tasks like
photo and video editing especially
considering its tiny size and get
pairing it to other ultrabooks in that
same class the still has a ton of i/o so
it's got a Thunderbolt 3 USB C port lets
you harness the power of an external GPU
if you'd like something like the Razer
core long Fat Boy you're also getting
two USB type a ports a headphone mic
combo port and then another non
thunderbolt USB type-c port so that's a
little dongle life with the Razer Blade
still so the optional MX 150 GPU and our
units also gonna give you a decent
amount of power to do some gaming on the
go just not gaming while you go
sorry good joke and I do want to give a
big thank you here to Resident Evil 2
remake for actually sponsoring this
section of the blade reviews I've
actually been a huge Resident Evil fan
when Resident Evil 2 originally came out
in 1998 it was probably the only game at
least at the time that I remember
playing after I beat it the first time
it probably boiled down to teenage me
loved the idea of playing a game that
absolutely terrified my sisters that's
when I saw the trailer at e3 2018 for
the resident to remake I was ready to
put on my saggy jeans play some Nirvana
get my late nineties game on so the game
does support onboard graphics and
external GPS so we wanted to try both so
it's kind of cool ploy in the resin evil
to remake the game looked very familiar
and was terrifying with way better
graphics I still remember the jump
scenes and I remember the cutscenes like
the truck driver at the beginning that's
really ingrained in my head but seeing
the remake and seeing what it looks like
now with mono graphics it's pretty
awesome
so unnormal I was under about 30 frames
per second when I wasn't moving I
dropped it down to essentially medium
setting and I was getting around 35 40
per second when playing it was totally
playable and looked awesome that's
probably the sweet spot if you want to
get your resin evil to remake on what
the major blade stove so the razor blade
stealth has Thunderbolt 3 so we wanted
to try it with an external GPU so he
plugged went in with a 1080 set the
settings up to max and we started
getting almost double you're getting
over 60 frames per second when I was
playing and moving it absolutely looked
awesome the graphics here look
incredible as it expect for a game
coming out in 2019 modern graphics on a
game this scary kind of make playing in
the dark a bit more fun so it's
different gameplay than the original - I
really dug the new over-the-shoulder
camera mode I'm about halfway through
playing to campaign as police officer
Leon which I think I like playing that's
my father-in-law's name and I'm a
detective fun but you can also play the
campaign as Claire college student if
that you damned the guys remember the
original game that came out in 98 maybe
the remakes got 2 jaemin for some
nostalgia or you never played it and
just want to play a really good-looking
terrifying game I will link to it down
below so you can learn more or if you
want to buy it yourself you can do that
as well so after 2 weeks of non-stop use
I guess stopping only to mourn the Rams
loss to the evil empire
I really do like the update to the
stealth I think it offers a lot to
consider although I'm not offended
keyboard you might be and the updates
and improvements to design and battery
life and performance make this a case
where the pros I think definitely
outweigh the cons it's expensive there's
kind of no doubt about that
those are willing to pay up for a
lightweight laptop that packs some power
the stealth is a small and mighty
contender</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
