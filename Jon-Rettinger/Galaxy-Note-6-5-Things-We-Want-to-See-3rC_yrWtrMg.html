from TechnoBuffalo here I know we're
still like six ish months away from the
galaxy note 6 but I am excited about it
and I want to share my thoughts and
wishes for the upcoming Samsung flagship
so here are five things and I hope make
its way into the Galaxy Note 6 and I'm
not going to talk about things like more
power or maybe even 6 gigs of ram legs
remember to have those things we can
expect you'd expect hardware
improvements and specs standpoint these
are some more different things that I am
super jazzed about let's get started so
number 5 a more powerful s-pen it's
gotten better and better each iteration
first let's make it reversible to just
avoid some of the problems that we had
with the last gen I wouldn't mind them
taking some cues from the Apple pencil
let it be able to write different angles
to have to get different sensitivity
when you're touching the screen I think
that would take it to the next level I
let it evolve for more of a note-taking
tool to a really awesome thing that
graphic artists can use create some
pretty cool things number for this one
I'm like 99% certain they just take it
to the bank but expandable storage come
on back just come on back and let me
just bask in your warm embrace come on
back and number three since I know this
is a wish list let's just throw a
removable battery in there I would love
to have the option to throw in an extra
battery maybe not for me I don't like do
it all that often but for you who like
to carry multiple batteries let's just
just make that an option you could come
close to making a pretty perfect device
for a lot of people so Samsung I hope
you're listening number two I hope they
borrow from the galaxy s7 and the s7
edge with ip68 let's get some
waterproofing up on this bad boy listen
maybe a hypothetical situation that
definitely has never happened to me
let's say you're checking your phone on
the toilet and you happen to drop it
no one's gross and you got to deal with
the gross factor but also you got to
deal with it getting wet so I'd be 68 so
I don't ruin another hypothetically I
don't ruin another phone and my number
one hope for the note 6 some form of 3d
touch force touch samsung touch s touch
you touch I touch some sort of pressure
sensitivity on the screen to be honest
Samsung is kind of been threatening to
do this for a while I haven't seen it
make its way to next-gen device but
Samsung loves to put brand-new things on
the note line of device that filter down
so I think this is the year we get some
sort of of touchy sensitivity happening
from Samsung
what would your your wish list maybe
it's a hardware base beep you guys
you're like I want a Snapdragon 808
doesn't even exist yet I want 12 gigs of
ram I want a four key screens to wish
list
let me know wish this are you can you
can wish for anything let me know what
they are down below until next time I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo and I
will talk to you dear friends a next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
