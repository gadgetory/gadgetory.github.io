hybrid tablet laptop that retails for
$499 and for that price tag you'll get
the Surface 3 running Windows 8.1
Intel's Atom processor clocked in at 1.6
gigahertz 64 gigabytes of storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM for an extra hundred
dollars you can upgrade the storage of
228 gigabyte in the memory up to 4
gigabytes of RAM which is the model what
you have right here when we did our
initial unboxing of the surface 3 a lot
of you guys were curious whether the
surface 3 could handle everyday tasks
like browsing the web watching YouTube
videos in HD or 4k and then there was
someone like me asking myself whether I
can edit videos or photos on it whether
it could handle basic multitasking
despite the Intel Atom processor we did
a few tests and here's what we found the
first one we thought we'd try was 4k
playback on YouTube I watch a lot of
videos online so I'd want to make sure
that whatever laptop I decide to
purchase is capable of comfortably
streaming videos without getting bogged
down in a process we played a few HD and
4k videos on YouTube and it works
surprisingly well in full-screen and in
window mode despite it having an Intel
Atom processor 1080p videos work great
though 4k did stutter however since it
has a 1080p resolution it's not pushing
all those 4k pixels through the display
anyways so another thing that crossed my
mind was can it run multiple windows at
once with an Intel Atom processor and 4
gigabytes of RAM I figured the surface 3
wouldn't be able to handle having
multiple Google Chrome tabs and multiple
windows open but to my surprise it
handled everything just fine now to
really test it out I opened one Chrome
window with a video on YouTube and tried
editing a document in another window I
did notice some lag but nothing too bad
multitasking is definitely doable for a
computer the size as long as you don't
overdo it upgraded 4 gigabytes of RAM
really does help another important thing
for me is whether or not my computer can
play games when you think of gaming the
Microsoft Surface 3 probably won't be
your first choice but we wanted to see
how it held up anyway
we installed Minecraft and it worked
really well in low to medium settings in
full screen however don't expect it to
run a smooth 60 frames per second we
also install a counter-strike go and it
worked well in medium 720p resolution
we also tried 1080p in low settings and
performed particularly the same as the
720p resolution in medium the surface 3
shouldn't be your first choice for
gaming but you can play games if you
really want to just don't expect it to
run the latest titles like Far Cry 4 or
GTA 5 the next thing I wanted to know
was if the surface 3 could run Adobe
Premiere and Photoshop I'm a big fan of
Adobe services I edit videos on Premiere
everyday and I use Photoshop to edit
images these are pretty intensive
applications so it's a good test for the
surface 3 the first thing I did was try
to create a mock thumbnail for YouTube
the thumbnail is a 1280 by 720 file so
what I did was go through all the steps
I'd normally go through on my iMac I
added my background photo added a border
around the image some text with the drop
shadow filters on it and the surface 3
held up I did notice some stutter when
applying filters and adding layers but
it still did pretty well could the
surface 3 be my only machine for
Photoshop no because if I were to work
on an image with multiple layers and
multiple effects the surface 3 wouldn't
be able to keep up I would need a more
powerful computer to edit my photos
comfortably next I tried opening a
Premiere Pro CC I imported both HD
footage and 4k footage onto my timeline
and surprise surprise the surface 3 held
up there were some moments where the
preview window wouldn't playback the
footage and 4k footage would stutter
when a clip was cut I also tried
applying a fast color correction but it
lagged during playback you can get
through a basic edit if you really
needed to rendering and footage was ok
depending on what I was doing when I did
something complicated that required a
few effects and filters on top of the
video it definitely took longer but when
working on a smaller video with a few
color correction effects on top of it
rendering didn't really take all that
long but the question is could the
surface 3 be my only machine for
Premiere Pro and the answer is no and
that's because it lacks the performance
of a high-end editing machine with a
dedicated graphics card and a higher
memory bandwidth Intel Atom processor
and 4 gigabytes of RAM just isn't enough
to edit 4k and HD videos comfortably so
with all that being said performance on
the surface 3 depends on how you're
going to use it if you're in a gaming
and creating media the surface 3
probably isn't going to cut it for you
if you're just going to use it for
streaming media writing emails and
working on documents it holds it for the
most part I can definitely see students
using this though for $500 you're
getting
Surface three with 64 gigabytes of
storage two gigabytes of RAM Windows 8.1
and no keyboard you have to pay an extra
$129 for that while the docking station
is $200
so for nearly $850 I'd rather buy a
full-fledged laptop such as the lenovo
y40 HP probook or the new dell XPS 13
these are much more powerful and capable
windows machines now if you're in a
scenario of whether you should replace
your tablet with a Surface three while
comparing it to the iPad 2 or Samsung's
Galaxy Tab s I would definitely choose a
Surface three over the two tablet since
it's running a full version of Windows
but is it worth $500 even though
performance isn't great no it's just not
powerful enough for what I personally
want to do what about compared to
Apple's new 12-inch MacBook to me they
serve about the same purpose and that's
to do everyday tasks like browsing the
web watching videos writing emails and
creating spreadsheets and Word documents
but basing it off of those task specs in
price the MacBook has a much better
processor twice the amount of RAM and it
also has twice or three times the
storage capacity as a Surface 3 and has
a built-in keyboard and force touch
trackpad but be prepared to spend over
$1300 on the base model though the
surface 3 on the other hand starts at
just $499 and even if you upgrade to the
higher-end model and buy the keyboard
you'll still spend less than what you're
paying for the MacBook so let us know in
the comments down below if you guys
would like to see a comparison between
the new MacBook and the Surface 3 so my
question to you guys is do you really
think the surface 3 is worth $500 let us
know in the comments down below and if
you guys enjoy this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up and we will see you
guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
