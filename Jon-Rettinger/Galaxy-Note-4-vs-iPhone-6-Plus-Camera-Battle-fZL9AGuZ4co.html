to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader and
remote support what's going on guys the
mark and Sangan from TechnoBuffalo and
today we'll be comparing the cameras on
the iPhone 6 plus and the galaxy note 4
and over I'll see which one comes out on
top so before we get started we're just
gonna be comparing the cameras on both
of these devices we'll eventually do a
full comparison between the six plus and
the note 4 in the coming weeks but for
now let's see how the cameras on these
to perform now from experience a lot of
the Samsung devices I've tried in the
past tends to give my images a bit more
of a sharpen look than normal and with
the Galaxy Note 4 is new or 16 megapixel
shooter that's not really the case this
here it's not that the overprocess
images are gone it's still present but
it's not as drastic as the previous
devices have tried now in terms of specs
the Galaxy Note 4 is equipped with a 16
megapixel camera with OAS and an F 2.2
aperture lens it's capable of recording
4k videos at 30 frames per second and
1080p at 60 frames per second as well as
slow-motion 720p the front-facing camera
is equipped with a 3.7 megapixel camera
with an F 1.9 aperture and a really
really wide lens the iPhone 6 plus on
the other hand is equipped with an 8
megapixel iSight camera with oh is and f
2.2 aperture lens it has face detection
autofocus or what Apple is calling it
focus pixels it's capable of reporting
1080p at 60 frames per second and
slow-motion 720p at 240 frames per
second now the front-facing camera is
equipped with a 1.2 megapixel camera
with an F 2.2 aperture and it's capable
of recording HD or 720p videos now on
paper the Galaxy Note 4 blows the iPhone
6 plus out the water but the iPhone 6
plus still holds its own when it comes
to mobile photography it's not always
gonna be about the megapixels but it
mostly boils down on the sensor now both
cameras take excellent pictures and
it'll be hard for most people to tell
the difference between each camera and
acceptable lighting the optical image
stabilization on both devices help keep
pictures sharp and clean but the colors
and contrast slightly vary between the
two devices now like I mentioned in the
beginning the Galaxy Note 4 has really
improved its camera buying
over processing their images as much
though in certain cases it is still
present I do love the ability to crop an
image without losing as much quality on
a note for and that's where that 16
megapixel comes in handy the 8 megapixel
camera on the iPhone 6 plus is good too
though you won't be able to crop as much
compared to the note 4 but in terms of
performance the iPhone 6 plus performs
like a champ
it's focused pixels up to ton when
focusing on a subject and it works
really well the note 4 is so so it's
great outdoors and good lighting though
I did notice the frame rates tend to
drop when shooting in medium to low
light conditions and speaking of
low-light shots I actually prefer the
iPhone 6 plus here to exposure seems to
be more acceptable colors are more
accurate whereas the note 4 still tries
to overcompensate the image to where
sometimes everything is blown out and
quality becomes really muddy now camera
UI I like both they're both fairly easy
to use and simplistic though the note 4
does offer more shooting modes and
software tweaks whereas the iPhone only
provides you with the basics
HDR flash timer and the basic iOS
filters though I do like the exposure
slider on the iPhone which makes setting
up shots quicker and the note 4 offers
the same feature but it's deep within
the settings button let's take a quick

rate when it comes to the video there's
no doubt about it the Galaxy Note 4
takes some pretty good videos and
ability to shoot in 4k will come in
handy for those who are looking to go
past full HD now this is a huge
advantage for the note 4 and being able
to scale down that 4k video into 1080p
will definitely help in the long run
being able to crop move the frame and it
will give you much more flexibility when
editing a video though in terms of
actual video quality like the iPhone
six-plus camera a bit better oh is with
cinematic stabilization is amazing and
colors are more natural compared to the
note for now I'm not saying that the
video capability on the note 4 is bad
but I just prefer how the iPhones video
looks in I can say the same for slow
motion video
the note 4 can film at 120 frames per
second at 720p but it doesn't look as
good and smooth as the iPhones 240
frames per second nonetheless the
ability to shoot in 4k is amazing and
the note 4 does a pretty respectable job
at it but if you want to have some fun
with slow-mo and then the iPhone is your
best bet now when it comes to the
front-facing cameras there's so much to
like on the note 4 Samsung's added a
bunch of software tweaks and features to
somewhat add more flavor than their
camera though the wide-angle lens is
what makes the front-facing camera in my
opinion so awesome you have a much wider
shot compared to the iPhone 6 plus and
you have different modes and tweaks to
choose from which the iPhone azar really
offer in terms of quality again the
iPhone 6 plus still produces a much
better photo
but the difference is not too drastic
here in low-light that's when the note 4
starts to deteriorate skin tones and
quality just looks really bad while the
iPhone 6 plus is still holding on and so
the red things are for you guys I really
like 6 pluses camera the Galaxy Note 4's
camera is really good too and Samsung's
doing a really really good job at
improving it make sure to stay tuned for
our full comparison with these two
devices in a few weeks or so and as
always a märklin sanger from
