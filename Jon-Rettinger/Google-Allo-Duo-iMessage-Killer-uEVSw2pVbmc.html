here at Google i/o 2016 and if I did I
could message her using Google's brand
new ridiculously awesome looking
messenger app called
a low and the voice chat client that
goes with it called duo these things
like absolutely incredible and important
things to know the big one
multi-platform is whether or not you are
an apple or an Android you can use the
client the big must-haves for messenger
app are there it's going to be linked to
your phone number as well so it's be
pretty easy to set up and get messages
from contacts Google did a lot of things
that we haven't really seen before for
messaging app first they have something
called whisper and shout when you hit
the send button if you just hold your
finger over it you can change the size
of the font so if you want to shout you
can make a big want to be timid maybe a
little bit meek and whisper you go ahead
and put that funk all the way down and
send out the resort now to just sending
messages in all caps some people know
you are yelling at them who is also
trying to take a small piece of that
snapchat audience with ink you can draw
write on pictures and send them off to
your friends and also kind of snapchat
you can set timings for messages on it
to expire in a certain time you can set
that they also kind of incognito mode
now as well so if you want to have a
message be deleted as soon as you close
a window you can go ahead and do that so
IQ best just private forever you stuff
you guys are up to you can do that now
with a low a low is really integrated
Google's brand new just announced Google
assistant it's kind of like Google now
2.0 and it's going to learn how you type
and learn what you write to start giving
you smart replies so if your wife wants
no time for coming home for dinner for
example it'll know that you say 10
minutes or suck at the office of oppose
messages up for you you just go ahead
and cap it to send it an integration
Google assistant goes way beyond that as
well it's can integrate with the context
of what you're typing or the picture
itself you want to send a picture of I
don't know maybe an adorable french
bulldog it'll know it's a french bulldog
it'll give you things you might want to
say about said french bulldog like that
dog is cute how does it breathe whatever
and go ahead send it integrate right
there as well if you want to make dinner
reservations and you want to suggest
Italian restaurant it'll suggest those
for you right inside of the app and give
you a card that everybody can see pick
the restaurant even book the reservation
using open
right from ello there's a ton of cool
new features in there too you keep them
played games with it like guess the
movie using emoji but ello wasn't the
only cool thing Google announced they
also announced a standalone video app
called duo again cross-platform iOS and
Android but they didn't say those we're
gonna see a desktop client but fingers
crossed some sort of chrome plugin or
chrome app will be available it does a
couple of cool things we haven't seen
before from a video chat application
it's got something called knock-knock
so instead of just seeing a picture of
who's trying to video chat with you you
actually see live video of them so if
you maybe it's your daughter calling
your girlfriend you can actually see
whatever they're doing before you answer
or decide not to answer who talked a lot
about how optimized this was as well so
do matter what cellular caching you're
on if it's a bad connection or strong
connection it should work really well
and of course it's fully encrypted
Google talked a ton about aloe and dua
but we don't know is when they're going
to be available in full release the
answer is hopefully it's going to be
soon because they look incredible it
looks like a finally a challenger to
iMessage that's really going to be
cross-platform a this is going to be
what whatsapp is try to do with Facebook
messages try to be and when I messages
tried to be as well one app regardless
of what platform you are on assuming
you're not a Windows Phone or blackberry
10 what do you guys think are you ready
to say hello or do you more want to say
goodbye I've been wanting make that joke
since the keynote well - your thoughts
on it because the comments down below
until next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo we are in beautiful
Mountain View California at Google i/o
2016 see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
