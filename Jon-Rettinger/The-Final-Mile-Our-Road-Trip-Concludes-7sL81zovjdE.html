the country thing was mostly just a ploy
to get here
this is Notre Dame Stadium we are in
South Bend Indiana
and this is on my bucket list to come
and see where the Irish play so I don't
with the South Bend we showed you how to
fill up your car using marketplace which
is the in - payment system in the
connected car on the second leg of our
trip we're gonna show you how to pay and
save with the show app I'm probably
gonna go just geek out a little bit over
the stadium time hit the road by Notre
Dame a Notre Dame turn right onto Joy's
Drive we're gonna turn right onto Joy's
drive in way to Toledo
hello Toledo Ohio we just pulled in and
we legit need some gas I'm going to use
the shell app and I'm gonna use mobile
pay and I'm gonna buy gas from my phone
and have it all set up before I ever get
out of the car
so back in March shell announced that
10,000 shell branded retail locations
we've actually let you pay for the app
for your gas using Chase pay so I use
chase to bank I've got the shell app and
I need gas so I'm gonna go ahead and do
it this would be really nice though if
you live in an area where it snows like
Toledo Ohio we don't want to get out of
the car deal with the elements while you
put your card in maybe it doesn't work
maybe the card reader is not working
have it all done and just get out and
pump the gas so we show you how it works
all right so I'm just going to open up
the shell app and it's integrated too
with a fuel reward so you can earn money
back while you pump so I'm gonna use pay
and save use my face or you have a PIN
number that you set up so I've got my
Chase pay already done and ready took
about five minutes to set up and more
payment partners are gonna be added soon
you can choose to pay at the pump or in
the shop if you want to buy some snacks
so I found it we were at pump number
three so you can see it's set up with
fuel rewards I'm earning five cents back
per gallon even get a paper receipt if
you want I don't need a paper receipt
we're living in the future so now that's
preserving the pump for me and all
without ever having to leave your car
and your code and start feeling so I've
got a code all I got to do is go up and
put in that code if I'm three and I'm
good to go
it's almost set the app gave me a code
it says enter code at the pump
proved says my name there it also tells
me that I'm earning five pence back four
gallon and I'm ready to start pumping
cuz we actually need gas it's another
big question it comes to conveniences
how much snacks do we want a lot of
snacks snacks
alright so because we have another hour
and a half forget to Cleveland and
Matt's stuck driving I'm gonna try to
make Matt laugh with dad jokes hey you
want to hear a joke about construction
Matt I can't tell you I'm still working
on it
what do you what do you call cheese
that's not yours
nacho cheese alright so we just got to
write outside of Cleveland I was gonna
go in to the shell store and see if
maybe they can get it
LeBron Jersey on the cheap alright all
fueled up we're headed to Pennsylvania
now next up Pocono Raceway three days of
driving led us here to Pocono Raceway
and I am almost on the track this is my
very first IndyCar race experience I
cannot I cannot wait for this I I hope
you guys can just see the excitement in
my eyes I'm hoping the Team Penske let
us get a chance to talk to some the
drivers I'm hoping we'll see some of the
pre-race tune ups hoping to get like the
most comprehensive experience I can get
because I'm never gonna get this chance
again and I don't know if you guys will
either so let's do it together come
along with me and let's go the race day
and as we're walking around when the
shell rips grabbed me and asked I want
to the interview to the driver of the
Indy car they sponsor Simon Padgett Oh
so obviously I'm jumping at that
opportunity I wanted to ask the question
that was top in my mind I got asked so
you're in 2016 champion which is
incredible but do you still get nervous
it like to sit in the car right before I
start thinking what is that what's that
feeling well you always get nervous
there if you don't get nervous
do you probably know need to know right
so but I have to say to out the years
you tend to it tends to be more bearable
when I started racing it was really hard
to not puke before race because of
anxiety but now the Malakal cam and I
know I know what I'm doing better
yeah so I have more in control so what's
what's your routine before before a race
well my routine is you just saw it I
just come out of strategy meeting we
usually have two hours before the race
strategy meeting then we do a meet and
greet with with our partners and friends
then after that I go in my motor home
and I have a massage session and I do a
lot of meditation I don't know more as a
kid I was all over the place so I had to
learn how to control my emotions
I was I was learning about she working
your parents a mom grocery store and I
did that at one point yes you know that
in life you don't know where you gonna
have to go at some point and racing is a
very difficult business because it's
only only a very few that can make it to
the top yeah and I was at a transition
where you know I need a back-up plan if
it doesn't work in racing so I started
working bursaries to learn the business
and II went to business school
I don't move the most educated words but
yeah Business School I've always been
interested in financial the business in
general always loved the interaction
with people in relationships so for me
business you know probably working with
that in
it's a big it's not just an inner
grocery store it's a supermarket we rent
cars we would send dishwashers TVs we
have a gas station
you know mechanical Santa's so there's a
lot of things there and that's
incredible night what you want to ask
about a paying for in your car so what
do you think about about being able to
pay for gas before getting out of the
car well I think it's phenomenal I think
you know obviously this society has
changed so much we are we're becoming so
in touch with our phones becoming so in
touch with the technology that we have
we've become so much smarter in the way
that we go about life we try to optimize
everything that we do so optimizing time
and you go to the gas station yeah it is
important and that's a way to make you
feel like you know losses much time and
you get more time for yourself so after
10 hours of driving and like 600 miles
going halfway across the country our
road trip was coming to the end and it
was a daunting thing to think about
driving that far but we had a ton of fun
I got to see sights I never a chance to
see in my life
I got to interview people that are the
best at their craft I got to experience
a new race it was an incredible
experience we got to see some new
conveniences that you can use in your
life we got to use the shell app to pay
for our gas and get hooked up with the
fuel rewards it was a really awesome
experience and is one that I'm not gonna
forget daren't that many times you get
to drive that far
and it was really fun so again thank you
to shell for giving us the opportunity
it's a really cool experience I hope you
guys enjoyed coming along with this for
the ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
