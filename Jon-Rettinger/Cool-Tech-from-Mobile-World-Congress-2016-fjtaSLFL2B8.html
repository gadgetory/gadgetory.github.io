technobuffalo and if you guys have been
following us for the last three to four
videos and three to four days you'll
know that we've been covering Mobile
World Congress in a very vlog ish style
if you guys like what you've been seeing
let us know in the comments below we
always appreciate the support and to
finish our trip off on a good note we
wanted to make a top five things we saw
at Mobile World Congress that really
caught our attention but these are not
five things we've already made videos on
its five brand new things that didn't
really want their own video that we
still wanted to talk about and bring up
on your radar so let's go ahead and get
started so first off we have the koala
way mate book now this is basically a
surface pro and ipad pro competitor
nothing really to report here other than
huawei is aiming it at corporate and
business professional that's what the
differentiating factor is hence why
they've paired it with what they're
calling a mate pen and a mate doc the
mate pen is a pen it's their version of
the Apple pencil on the surface pen the
only real difference here is that it has
a laser pointer on the back now I don't
know how useful this is for regular
consumers I personally am not that
stoked about it but I could see it being
really cool for corporate professionals
and meetings and slideshows and
presentations I guess we'll just have to
wait to see how it pans out the mate doc
however does seem to be a useful feature
the vga hdmi and a ton of other outputs
for bigger screens and projectors in
terms of display you're looking at a
12-inch 2160 x 1440 display looking at a
6th gen intel core m process with the
clocks in at three point one gigahertz
and you're running Windows 10 between
four to eight gigs of RAM and between
128 and 5 12 gigs of solid-state storage
depending on how you configure it now
moving on to number four we have the LG
g5 friends because the g5 is obviously
so popular it has four friends that are
worth mentioning we talked about two in
the hands on the camera module and hi-fi
audio output to that we did not mention
though however our LG's 360 camera which
is supposed to be a super simple button
button pressed 360 camera and the
accompanying 360 VR headset now all I
have to say about this VR headset is
that it is terribly made we picked it up
and put it on and the thing is super
plasticky it doesn't even seem to be
built properly everything just falls
apart you get a ton of light bleed from
the side so Todd was using his hands to
block out the excess
light it doesn't seem like a very smooth
move on lg's part that being said all
this can be forgiven if it comes in at
the very appealing price point so I
guess we'll find out and now speaking of
360 and 360 cameras we have with Samsung
announced which was their 360 camera
what's different about this is that it
seems to be more aimed at a real camera
pro camera action camera market Samsung
will also allow you to shoot with just
one lens so it's single directional
doesn't have to be 360 which seems a
good way for them to sort of protect
their users who don't necessarily want
to shoot in 360 but still like the
camera it's dust and water-resistant so
it seems more leaning towards that
action crowd but I think the bigger
discussion going to have is here are two
companies LG and Samsung we're trying to
make these 360 VR experiences within
their product line so you have the phone
you have the 360 camera and you've the
VR headset Samsung is in fact pitching
it as that shoot on the camera editing
trim on your phone consume it through
the VR headset and then share it again
using your phone next we have HP and
Microsoft's big guns the HP elite x3 now
this is a beast of a phone and who
respects you're looking at 5.9 inch quad
HD AMOLED display Snapdragon 820
processor expandable storage three gigs
of ram breathe in it's a beast of a
phone but the real thing that was
interesting going to the microsoft booth
was that they had it doc to a bigger
display keyboard and a mouse now when I
reviewed the 950 continuum is one of the
most interesting features to me to see
is this going to be the future of we're
computing goes with tablet laptop we're
seeing sort of the convergence of all
devices is this another sign another
step we're making towards using our
smartphones or only devices docking them
to bigger displays in keyboard and sort
of getting rid of our laptops obviously
it's very hard to say right now but the
HP elite x3 seems to be like the
flagship for all windows 10 phone so if
you're a big windows 10 fan and Windows
10 user you definitely want to check
this out and last but not least we have
two devices we saw at the sony booth
they're both concept devices the sony
xperia agent and the sony xperia
projector first off with the agent it
has two eyes so credit to Sony for
giving it some personality and character
at least they look like eyes to me the
agent seems to be an Amazon echo
competitor with a camera and a display
uses the roach
camera to recognize when you come home
it can supposedly turn on lights take
incoming calls giving notifications and
in general just sort of be your personal
assistant the sony xperia projector is
exactly what it sounds like it's a
projector the idea is that it shoots a
projection onto real world surfaces with
which you can interact and touch and
move around you can throw out the
calendar common information that other
people in your house need to see it's
extremely sci fi e and very cool so
that's pretty much it for this video
guys those are five things we wanted to
talk about and bring up on your guys
radar let us know what you think in the
comments below what do you talked about
what are you not pumped about it is the
future of text so I genuinely want to
talk with you guys in the comments below
