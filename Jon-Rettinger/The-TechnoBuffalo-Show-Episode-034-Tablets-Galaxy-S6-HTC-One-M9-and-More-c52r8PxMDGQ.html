techni Buffalo show I'm live your to
host for this week Shaun ani
editor-in-chief of the site and i'm
joined as always by executive editor
mobile Todd Hazleton hey everybody you
know I deputy me oh yeah I apologize i
forgot yes he is having every managing
editor right my apologies Todd I did not
know your your new title from you yes
Todd is now our deputy managing editor
which means he's still pretty much Todd
yeah to document but you know I didn't
say the name of the the number of the
episode when we started because I
realized I had no memory of what the
number was it's 34 it's 34 so yes our
apologies for no episode last week as i
mentioned in episode 33 it's difficult
at times gathering up the troops in with
Todd out of town on a assignment it was
I was just like I give up we try our
best around here though focused and I
actually thought about doing a solo show
I was like that would be the most boring
thing ever hey Shawn what do you think
I'm Sean back yeah I finally
revealed that I have multiple
personalities at screen yeah why not so
on this week's episode we're going to
tackle a couple different topics the the
first one being so tablets they're
doomed yeah well we just saw that
there's a report out for the first time
ever I think it was comscore I forget um
first time ever tablets their sales
decline in the fourth quarter which is
which is compelling because it's the
holiday buying season so you think
usually sales are up but annually I
think they were still up a slight
percentage and I think we were talking
the other day why or why are they down I
think it's because you know we both saw
the ipad air 2 we were like we don't
need that it's sort of like you get to
this point where there's somewhat of a
saturation where you don't need to
upgrade a tablet so frequently perhaps
not as frequently even has say your
smartphone and I think that's why
we're seeing sales down a little bit but
people are still bullish on the coming
years I mean and you see and you see
sort of reasons why this might change
rumors about the ipad pro so if they
have a bigger screen with split screen
that gives you a reason say to go by
that tablet because if you already own
an ipad and you can't do it with that
one then maybe you'll switch it up great
and then with windows 10 coming out i
think a lot of people are going to see
i'm actually testing it on my desktop so
not on the touchscreen but i think a lot
of people will see some pretty nice
advancements there the people will like
and in one example is a office office
suite was released yesterday it's
finally touch optimized so you can touch
around it and that'll that's the
universal version that will kind of
expand between tablets phones and your
computer but there's also going to be an
office 2016 which microsoft hasn't
really discussed yet though being hall
in the sort of keyboard and mouse well i
think part of the issue also a look this
is not a fanboy comment it's pure fact
the ipad leads the tablet market hmm and
there was little to no reason to upgrade
this year if you had not even just an
ipad air but you know the previous
generation I've had before that you know
I think a lot of people myself included
yeah I was like well I'll just waiting
to it's in the ipad air three yo it i
will i wasn't going to buy a new ipad
simply because it had a faster processor
and you know touch ID that just wasn't
worth it to me yeah and thinner but like
at what point do you really need that
much thinner to upgrade you know an
existing tablet it's already pretty darn
thin at the same thing i mean when you
look at Samsung Samsung and Apple
together totally dominate and I think
you know they had the Tab s both of
those think it was 10 and 8.4 range are
great tablets but again it wasn't sort
of a fourth quarter upgrade time for
anybody um I don't yeah so no I I think
that you know i just i find interesting
how many you know i'm talking mainstream
media you know like CNBC you know they
were shall do is the tablet doomed
no it's not dude I mean yeah sales were
dead but we're still talking about
companies selling 18.4 million tablets
yeah people are still buying the thing
is that I and I have to say this too um
ever since i bought the six plus they
usually use a note for also i don't find
myself using my ipad mini watching i
know a lot of other people sort of felt
that way too though you know it's sort
of like maybe maybe mini upgrade maybe
many owners will upgrade to sort of ipad
large and I'm ads in the next year
because I just don't see the need for
that much of a bump over my iphone 6
plus well I I think you have a very good
point there you know the because the 6
plus is so much larger you know and it's
in the phablet category the the iPad
Mini is technically not that much larger
than your iphone 6 plus but do you think
the same would be true if you had a ipad
error air too would you still find
yourself not using it as much I think
yes so I think yes that's also true
because I have like a nexus 9 and some
other tablets that I just really don't
use my wife uses the nexus 9 from time
to time because it sits on my desk but I
yeah I guess it's sort of like I'm
starting to find that even with the
bigger phone screen I'm not just going
for the tablet like my phone is enough
for me in a lot of places even when I
just traveled actually I usually I used
to pull out Yuma tablet for games and
books but and movies and my iphone sort
of is just big enough for a whole red
right now I get what you're saying I
still use my iPad a lot especially when
I travel because you know I I stock up
on movies before I get on a plane and
watch those you know so yeah me I I
could technically do that on my iphone 6
plus but as I for the bigger screen plus
I found if I've been the cover back I
can stick it in the soup the sea couch
in front of me it just hangs there for
me so which is nice you know everyone's
while the stewardess your your ear phone
cord can't go across the aisle oh ok so
I wait oh she walks my head but I'm back
on
but so it's not supposed to block
between us technically no it's not
supposed to block but because when you
have the C tray out and then you I know
it makes absolutely no sense yeah you
know you she doesn't tell me to put my
tray away why is she worried about my
headphone cord right yeah and trust me
if the plane starts to go down the
headphones are coming off my head pretty
darn fast but wasn't the music and your
final moments I just have to hear
American Pie one more tough so now I
just I think it's interesting you know
I'm sorry if a company is selling 18
million of any type of device you know
it's hard to say that it's doomed Yeah
right I just think that there's there
has been a serious decline for you know
apple's ipad sales quarter over quarter
over quarter over quarter so i think
people are saying like wow nobody's
upgrading and they're just noting on
that decline but right 18 lanes to live
units right well here's a kind another
reason to buy him here's a comment from
a viewer benjamin mcdonald i'm still
using my galaxy tab 2 10.1 exactly there
you know with tablets there's just not
as much reason and osseo we say there's
not as much reason there's not as much
reason to upgrade your phones every
right or every six months as some people
do you know let's face it we're all just
slaves to the upgrade cycles you know no
matter which phone you're using bao iOS
or android you know I although I I have
a very good friend that's using a galaxy
s4 and you know I told her when I saw
her there day the galaxy s6 was coming
out she's like that's nice haha cuz I'm
perfectly happy with this yeah right
yeah you see people I mean well we're
fan you know gadget fans I'm you like to
see the most advances but I think a lot
of consumers are happy with their
devices for a longer period of time then
we exactly exactly yeah they may get
device in me but you know
most people are able to control those
urges and shurz us well but speaking of
phone upgrades there are it was leased
it appears that there are two very
exciting devices coming out and I love
the fact that the rumors indicate that
they're both going to be announced on
the same day which seems
counterproductive to me but so yes it
does appear that I'm march first we're
getting the galaxy s6 and the HTC One m9
yeah I'm neither a deist right maybe
more yeah exactly you know neither of
these are one hundred percent confirmed
yet we're just working off of rumors but
the rumors seem to be pretty consistent
right and last year in Mobile World
Congress useful we saw the galaxy s5 so
it's pretty seems pretty plausible will
see the six this year and I think HTC's
teases enough that we're going to see
that too yeah exactly exactly so yeah
and we've got a couple questions here
like from Sasha Mahal what would you
like to see in the galaxy s6 and will
there be a galaxy s6 edge I think the
edge is looking pretty likely at this
point yeah I think even the invites were
suggested although the curve on the
invite was was interesting it wasn't
sort of works to you on the note edge it
drops off the optus yeah which i think
is still going to be the same it almost
seemed to help at the top on the end by
which i thought was weird in any case it
should be if there's an edge it should
be about the same width and everything
as on the note 4 because it makes sense
for developers to create the same apps
that apply to both devices and searched
yeah umass so I think you know there's
probably an s6 edge maybe on both sides
right like something was said but who
knows well you know the thing is last
time I was out the office I played with
the Galaxy Note edge and it was a very
odd experience at how you hold it mmm
like I was trying to keep my finger tips
below the curve yeah you kind of like
yeah on the side you don't hold it the
same
exactly and now so they're going to do
this on both sides supposedly the Hound
the world there's not going to be a
natural feeling way to hold this yeah
you just have to hope you're not
touching the screen with your fingers
all time and that it sort of detects
when it's supposed to be tapped and not
yeah I mean I wasn't holding the the
note edge that way out of any sense of
safety I was holding it out of a sense
of I didn't want accidentally activated
a nap right yeah I don't know I'm not
crazy about the note edge i like that it
looks cool and stuff like that but
actually prefer the note to it I'm not
sure why but I think it's because of
that sort of ergonomics of the screen on
the side there it's a neat idea though
and I think obviously Samsung trying to
push it forward with the s6 edge if that
really comes to fruition what else I'd
like to see those carry over some of the
design elements we saw the note for
metal edges real premium feeling a
smartphone although I'm kind of sad to
see rumors that they might ditch the
water resistance I thought that was a
pretty nice selling point of the galaxy
s5 sort of making with this lifestyle
device for everywhere now here's my big
question though will Samsung have
learned from their previous precedence
and not have the awkward banter no it'll
be the exact same charity specialized
European press events can I'm sure it's
going to be an exciting show those
banter moments are some of the most
painful things never to watch yeah the
last one I think was an ephah and saw
the note 4 announcement yeah yeah which
I don't even you because you're sitting
in the room yeah just goes on forever so
there was a it was when I first see as I
went to the Microsoft keynote and there
they brought out an executive to talk
about her experience with the Windows
Phone and how it changes her life and
all that and I was I imming with a other
writer friend of mine we were trying to
figure out which one of us had the
sniper shot on her she was painful yeah
how it was banker its oh yeah Samsung is
famous for that
but moving on to HGC so the one m9 looks
like it's a definite here I the rumors
on the other versions online keep
seeming to the other one I'm not sure
I'm not sure because in the past we saw
the one max and that was with the m7
came out later so i don't know if it's
going to be on track for the same time
or it might be a couple months down the
road if i had to guess I'd say a couple
months down the road I'm not sure
because I think they're going to try to
probably highlight you know the m9 right
now instead of doing two at the same
time you don't see a lot of people doing
that I mean Apple did it because they
only have one refresh cycle here but you
don't see Samsung announcing you know s6
and note for at the same time I think
HTC would be wise to stick to them one
at a time so we'll see although I guess
rumors are saying 1080p screen which you
know it's fine doesn't really excite me
as much as some of the 2k displays to
and then I think they're going to carry
over a lot of things that have done well
for them with the front-facing boomsound
speakers let's see if they improve for
the third generation and then I want to
see what they do on the camera front if
they really do bump it up to say 20
megapixels or something like that I
think that could be really good too
right yeah i just i think that uh i
think HTC is going to stick to just one
phone samsung you know there's so much
that they released me hear that they
can't help but do or the one divided it
a time right but with HTC i think
they're just gonna focus on the main m9
and then maybe a month two months later
we'll see some other variation of it
right exactly or I mean it could even be
as late as September say later down the
road Eva I have to apologize for the
thumping in the background there's
construction like my eyelashes going up
all around me hey I feared you were
you're doing some light drumming under
the table or something no I do that all
day uh-uh people wonder why i like
living in the middle of nowhere but so
moving back to tablets for just a moment
we have a question
here from nishant patel should we expect
the next iPad to be with stylus I if the
rumors the ipad pro are true that the
larger 12 inch version I could see it
coming with a stylus or what I'm sure
that I can almost guarantee you Apple
never utter the word stylist yeah I was
gonna say I'm not sure so sure Apple
it's not that kind of sexy thing yeah
it'll be like yo the Apple pan or
something like that I who knows yeah I
think that if the ipad pro is real i
think it could come with one I don't see
them doing it though to the normal iPad
or the ipad mini yeah I don't know it
just doesn't seem like jony ive's design
language to have like a stylist anywhere
whether you know it inserts into the
side of the tablet or it's like another
accessory that you lose because you
don't have that insertion point I don't
know hmm right like the microsoft
surface pro 3 doesn't have a slot for it
so you have to have it on an accessory
and i think that's kind of wonky okay
what happens my metaphor doesn't really
well I just don't see that kind of
designer let's say it's magnetized just
sticks to the side of the ipad I suggest
you reconsider I think it's stuck to the
power thing on the side well I just want
them to do that just so we can hear
Johnny I've say it's unapologetically
magnetic I I just want everything now
ever since the iphone 5c video i just
want everything that Jony Ive's talk
about i wanted to say it's something
unapologetically something the iphone 5c
is unapologetically plastic i think if
you look at you know current iPads
there's plenty of third-party options
that you can use as a stylist mmm Norman
with apples can change that you know and
I i we were sent a sample pack of a
bunch of different third-party styluses
and I used one for two minutes it just
it didn't feel as natural you know I
could note I could launch apps with it i
could write with it and so on I just I
guess I'm just so used to using my
finger now just didn't feel right to use
anything
but I don't know so moving on to some
other topics I see several questions
coming in about the Apple watch let's
see here uh from Sean the man 34 do you
think that we could see more from the
Apple watch another keynote and what
would you like to see I think another
keynote is a given yeah it seems like
you know there was a rumor that it was
going to happen in February which was
then shot down and it but if you look
back to 2012 when Apple announced yeah
yeah thank goodness because we're going
to be immoral Congress and that's going
to be crazy but if you go back to 2012
Mobile World Congress in February Apple
sent out invites for an event in early
March where it announced a new iPad and
so it's plausible that apple will do
that again this year especially if you
have samsung no announcing a new
flagship smartphone there Apple might
want to kind of do its typical thing and
try to disrupt the show a little bit so
we'll see but I think a keynote seems
possible I mean Apple can go over the
prices of the watch how you're going to
interact with it through the software we
just saw the icon for the management
application that will come in out and in
iOS 8 point to all the updates to that
and then maybe you know even that rumor
12 inch macbook air might make an
appearance so I think there's enough to
talk about if they wanted to oh I
definitely think there is as well and
you know there's all the rumors of the
ipad pro could launch in the spring so
you know they got out as well but yeah I
think there's this is choosing the
chromatic lunch for there not to be
another keynote and also the fact that
you know what we saw previously was just
the prototype so they're going to want
to show us do the finalized everything
yeah you know and I want to hear about
that battery lights yeah might not be as
good as you know we're all hoping
exactly um funny thing though was
yesterday when the rumor first came at
you and I were you know discussing
februari 24th was just not going to be a
good date for us yeah which Apple does
not consult us right
and you and I were going through our
theories on why Apple wouldn't choose
that date and I think the one that held
the most water for me was the one we
were saying about apple doesn't like to
go before somebody else because then
that allows that company to overtake the
the news cycle so let's say that Apple
did hold a press event you know just a
few days before the announcement of the
galaxy s6 and HTC m9 well then once
those were announced you know everyone
would immediately go back to talking
about those rumors then everyone would
talk about those phones and the apple
announcement would be lost mayo and the
river so what I've found over the years
is that Apple likes to okay you have
your little party you announce your
product boom here's our invite and we're
now going to control the news cycle for
the next seven days right yeah I think
that's more likely yeah and so my gut
feeling is I think the invites are going
to go out during mwc it seems plausible
to me although I I don't since March
versus a Sunday I don't think they'll go
out that day and try to steal the
thunder right then but sometime during
mwc the invites are going to go at all
but that's a prediction everyone does
not not not even a rumor by the fact
cure speculation because I know somebody
will call me on it shortly thereafter
jumping over 25 days ago you and I got a
tweet from Connor furlong asking us if
you could be the CEO of any existing
tech company for the next two years
which would you choose reason I'm
looking over here folks is this is the
screen where Twitter's so I I actually
been thinking about this during the show
so I'll let you go first I would what
company would you love to be the head of
I don't know I said simply Google
because I think they have you know their
hand all across the industry from yo
self driving cars to wearable is to
mobile to search to sort of everything
and I think maybe an expanding the
internet around the
world I think you just be exciting to
see all their projects and then you know
their secret stuff project eggs you know
all this stuff that they're working on
and nobody knows it out I think that
would be pretty exciting I actually I
was thinking more that I'd like to be
the CEO of like a small company like say
a 1 plus for example because then you
wouldn't have as many expectations on
you you country yeah you could be a
little crazier you know and yeah google
has no none of the marina ya askin say
ya know and you have a ver I mean if I
could be the CEO google and just focus
on the moon shot stuff Oh fantastic but
yeah I mean if I could be the CEO of a
small company that was willing to take
risks and try something absolutely new
and had the money to be able to do that
that would be fantastic yeah I have it
yeah or whatever company would just pay
me a gigantic sum of money for two years
of me sitting around on my behind but
exactly exactly but an interesting
question something we had definitely
never thought of before and that's just
a note to everyone if you ever want to
tweet Todd and I questions during the
week don't go nuts you can reach taught
at at robo Todd and myself at Sean piane
and go we'll see if we can't use them in
the following weeks show going through
some other questions here which we have
a lot of here all we didn't really touch
on this from a sasha Mahal what would
you like to see in the HTC One m9 is
there any feature that you're really
wishing HTC would do um yeah I think
it's just a camera i'd like to see step
up his game i do like the ultrapixel
stuff but i just don't like that I can't
really assume in you know later so I'd
like to see them pump 2 megapixel count
um and maybe you'll get a little
slightly larger screen be good for me
that's why I think maybe depending on
what we see with the m9 I might be more
excited about the m9 post you know if
you listen to the show you know like
phablets so I think that's those are two
things i think the m8 was great and
still isn't great smartphone now they
made us great phone hey there's not a
whole lot I would change about it I was
very happy with the m8 you know faster
processor is always nice though yeah oh
here's an interesting question from tony
yayo what's the difference between the
Apple watch at Microsoft band they're
very different creatures I think yeah
well for one the Microsoft beans
available now starts at two hundred
bucks has a small screen but it's touch
screen you can go through and choose
yeah it seems to have most immediate
that does have a focus more on sort of
fitness but you can also get your
notifications which is nice from Android
iOS and Windows Phone which is different
in the Apple watch only be iOS and it
does have apps sort of there's a
starbucks hat which is the only one
that's like a third party for the
venue's it's really great I like it the
battery life solid i get about two days
of battery life with it but i think
that's sort of like the main differences
it's not an app portal which is what I
think the Apple watch is going to be I
mean your developers already working
with watch kids develop apps for the
Apple watch the Microsoft band to me is
sort of just right now you know fitness
and notification sort of SmartWatch
health day yeah um speaking of Apple
watch we've got a couple variations on
this question oddly from Sean the man 34
wet model and color Apple watch are you
going to get and I know I saw somewhere
else yeah from Sasha baba are maybe
going to get the Apple watch when it
comes out in April as it stands right
now I'm not i think i will because i'm
interested in it and but if i do it
would be probably the metal one because
of them to spend that kind of money on
device i kind of want one looks nice and
really good instead of plastic but I you
know I'm really going to sit on the
sideline sort of and see what the
battery life is like if it's
hours there's no way I'm buying it
because I already you know I take off my
wearables all the time because I end up
having to charge them and then I just
don't put them back on again and until I
have them charged and really get back
into it and I'm you know they're not
using him and i just think if battery
life doesn't get you through and a full
day and I'd like to see longer than that
and i don't think i'm going to spend
that kind of money and let let us be
very clear that we are talking Todd and
I are talking personally here
technobuffalo will of course get an
Apple watch geo to test and review and
all that but on a personal level I just
unless I hear some very me yes
everything we've heard about the battery
life up to this point has been rumor but
if any of that proves to be true if it's
less than a day I'm just not interested
yeah yeah I don't need another thing in
my life that needs to be charged every
single day yeah and it's useless without
battery exactly I that you know I've had
at the end of the day like I'm wearing
something and it's dead like oh like why
it because the last thing you want to do
is what you know yes a device may be
wonderful wall it's charged up as soon
as it dies you're like why am i carrying
this around yeah the other the other
thing is like they have all these use
cases that you know look cool on a
commercial that are like you know use
your like my moto 360 for Delta check-in
and I actually tried it um I think I'm
the way to CES just for kicks and like
this scanner just wasn't picking up the
barcode and I was like I forgot to just
use my phone like I don't want to hold
up the line it's one of those things
like if it doesn't if everything doesn't
work really well then you're kind of
like okay can do cool stuff
theoretically but not well all the time
and at that point you know that forget
it yeah those um let's see here
interesting question also about the
Apple watch from Sean the man 34 are you
a little concerned that Apple watch
pre-orders will go out and people will
have to preorder order without ever
seeing or trying it on follow I think
that'll I think that'll definitely
happen that's how Apple Louise I mean
yeah probably announce it and say you
know orders today and people didn't want
to buy it can it seemed with all of the
products they sell and there there will
be lines outside the apple stores of
people that have never touched one right
just like all of their stuff so yeah
serio geez that's sort of maybe they'll
have regrets I don't know we'll have to
see you before we say that but I think
they will probably be except for you sir
yeah uh from Jonathan in a no do you
think Microsoft will release a flagship
phone along with Windows tend to replace
the 930 I'd like to see that um there
was the rumors I forget what it was
called but the you know the the new one
that was going to replace a 1020 and and
that I guess was cancelled but I think
they need to have something you know
push something bigger better out there
what it is I don't know yet but we'll
see I think so here's a fun question
from Benjamin McDonald the LG G watch
costs $119 and anyone since USD in
Sweden is it worth it the pebble not
steel is twice the cost boy that's a as
it's a hard situation um that's about
what i sold my G wash for so yeah
gineering I sold it oh hey I hate to put
it this way I mean if it was any other
watch than the g watch if it was like
the G watch our I'd say go for it yeah
Jewish person great yeah the G watch
itself was it more of like a reference
design square I mean in terms of what
you can do with them the pebble can do
more but Android where's you know
growing in popularity there's more apps
for it now you can change the watch
faces it's becoming a lot better but you
know if anything that price is going to
go down so yeah I I would hold off a
price it's tim panels
they just said that yeah yeah yeah yes
and we do have some questions here about
pebble let me find that from Sasha bahal
thoughts on 1 million pebbles and new
step from pebble in 2015 I'm very
excited to see what they've got planned
I as you all can see I'm wearing a
pebble right now I never picked a pebble
steel I just didn't see a whole lot of
I'm quite happy with the original pebble
I I want to see what's going on I am I
hate to say I mean anyone selling a
million of anything is awesome but that
does seem low to me I think it took two
years to you right so yeah but it was a
Kickstarter and now it's sort of a
success story built out of that but
let's see what it can do to compete I
mean when it launched the competition
wasn't as stiff as is you know as it's
about to be and so I think pebble needs
to maybe maybe it'll go with some kind
of color screen but one that lasts
longer would be a good option and they
really need to have a better design I
think pebbles feels good looking it's
definitely not as good-looking this
other watches out there other
smartwatches out there so I think
whatever they have next has to prove
that they're still in the game and you
can take on apple and all of googles
partners which is gonna be tough
examples gonna sell you know humiliating
a lot of quicker than peplum Justin yeah
um question from mark Elaine I was
looking to buy a moto 360 John mentioned
how one might be announced q2 does that
mean release think YouTube because the
previous Moto 360 was announced pretty
early but came out much later I think in
this case it would be announcement much
closer to the launch the original moto
360 was announced just because Google
want everyone to know that there was
more Android watches coming hmm i think
in this case if it's announced it's
going to be you know maybe a couple of
weeks maybe a month but i don't think
it's going to be anywhere the weight the
original 360 was yeah I agree yeah but I
think typically what we usually see his
announcement followed by launch
not always immediate so I would you know
maybe cutie though I mean a quarter is
three months so you could announce it
early on and have three months to get it
out okay well this next question is a
bit of a hand grenade but since it has
the most up votes right now from Sasha
Mahal what do you guys think about net
neutrality huh I supported I think it
should be the utility as FCC chairman
wheeler said yesterday I think it makes
sense but I understand where other you
know companies have said that it could
prevent innovation I'm not sure I agree
with that but I can see the argument I I
can see the argument but my feeling is
that data is data I don't care what that
data is doing and the idea to restrict
the flow of any data it's all ones and
zeros every last bit of it ones and
zeros just because my ones and year
zeros are more popular than someone
else's ones and zeros doesn't mean I
should have to pay you for the right for
my ones and zeros to get through the
pipeline yeah but when the and here's
the other side of the argument that I
understand sometimes it's when there's
when they're talking about speeds or
something like why does comcast need to
offer you faster speeds and Verizon like
they're saying they're putting all this
money into their networks and of course
the argument for that is that
competition in the market will you know
continue to push both of them you know
to do that what they're going to say
well then we have no reason to compete
if everything is sort of just governed
by the government in that way so I don't
know I think about is a good hey in
general I think many a as with anything
there are gray areas you know the the
world is that unfortunately not black or
white it would be lovely if it was
because I could just go I don't like you
go away but there's there's gray areas
with net neutrality but in general yes I
agree with it yeah okay now that that
hand grenade is out of our I think what
about I think what we want to say is
like it would be terrible if your
internet service provider had the option
to say you can't for example get netflix
or you can't
because we don't offer it and we want
you to use our service and that's why I
supported you Joe exactly uh from Shawn
the man 34 what company would you like
to see Apple by with all of their cash
hmm you know I've thought about this a
lot I don't know I don't know something
with good cloud storage very true very
true yeah I'm not a big fan of iCloud
these days and I'd like to see them
boost their presence in that market
right I mean they are going to spend two
billion dollars on this data center in
Arizona which happens to be in the
building of a failed project yep that
was the oddest situation I think I've
ever witnessed industry oh my but um
they are sitting on a war chest that
people can only dream of having yeah but
I think part of the way they've gotten
to this war chest is that they are very
very meticulous and what they do with
their cash they don't go out and just
buy companies to buy them and I think
every purchase they've made has made
sense now what I will say is surprising
is you know just yesterday we wrote up
the story about the samsung will start
probably start producing the a9 for the
next iPhone why has an apple invested
and starting their own ship production I
think they did you see right and yes
they used to yeah but they're relying on
so many third parties that a good
example my father used to work for a
company years ago that the man who ran
the company started to think about it
and he went why am I contracting out to
other people to do these things for me
and so he started investing and he
needed some sort of giants and furnaces
for his business so he went out and he
bought a company with Sam furnaces he
allowed them to still contract out to
other people but his orders always took
prior
30 mm and so then he had full use of the
Sam furnaces whenever he needed them but
he was also able to recoup some of that
investment by allowing them to contract
out and so I've looked at apple and I
wonder why do they continue to go to why
haven't they started their own glass
production why haven't they started
their own ship production all right well
I think they tried to do glass a little
bit with sapphire with GT advanced in
there now going with Foxconn as a
contractor but I don't know I mean maybe
it's because these companies you know
have fabrications to build these
processes for plenty of clients and so
when Apple should sort of buying one
slice of what that these factories can
do I they would have to be willing to
build these factories and sell the other
people as well I mean when you look at
displays right like if they buy displays
from sharp sharps not just making
displays for Apple they're making them
for other right in Pettitte errs and for
themselves and I don't know Mimi Apple
this more cards for ugly people yeah I
know I just it's I know there's a lot of
questions around it it just it puzzles
me because I've seen this business model
work you know so it just it's curious to
me I guess is the way to put it the
apple hat Oh still does rely so much on
third party companies but as for
ready-made companies that they could
step in and buy I don't know I mean
beats was kind of a surprise to me yeah
you know so maybe Apple's going to do
something else that surprises us but I
do agree with you Todd I would love to
see them invest more in cloud storage
and improve iCloud yeah and I don't know
what the right company to buy in there
would be but then I know yeah exactly
like go presence I don't think the watch
Oprah yeah I don't know oh that was
a movie let's see what were the three
billion dollars with there yeah exactly
from marc lanes these people have said
no prob people said samsung is about to
buy blackberry given window tens push
for enterprise and Internet of Things
focus
should Microsoft by blackberry and would
that let them dominate the enterprise
market I think Microsoft probably looks
at blackberry ins he says it you know is
leaving the industry maybe and in that
case Microsoft will just continue to try
to take over but I don't know what
Microsoft's plans for the enterprise
market I mean we know that Windows 10
the operating system and i don't mean
the phone is free for consumers but not
for enterprise which seems weird if you
want to get them you know back on your
sisters but I guess windows seven is
still really popular um in terms of
mobile and I think we're gonna have to
see sort of what Windows Phone Windows
10 for phones offers and what their
strategy is moving forward but I don't
know that they're worried about
BlackBerry's probably my answer and
that's probably what yeah I honestly I
could see why Samsung would want to buy
blackberry because they really don't
have a foothold in the enterprise market
Microsoft does and I think at this point
I think Microsoft just don't to see
blackberry go away that's my guess my my
gut feel and this is not a political
commentary or anything I my gut feeling
is blackberry is eventually going to go
away I think they've got so set in their
mind that they can revive this that they
are just going to continue to dance on
the low piece of wood left floating in
the ocean until that piece of wit
disintegrates yeah I mean which I just
rode up to kantar worldpanel hada
percentages for the first out here in
the United States which is dominated by
iOS and Android iOS roll excuse me I'm
sick was ahead by a point zero one
percentage points but then followed with
a sliver of Windows Phone and then other
Shino includes blackberry but it was not
even a slice of the pie really it wasn't
one percent right so and that's just
that's not enough well folks I think
