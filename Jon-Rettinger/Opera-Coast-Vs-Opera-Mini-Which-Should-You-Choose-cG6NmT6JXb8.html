TechnoBuffalo here over the past few
weeks I've been looking at alternative
browsers on the iOS side to Safari and
Chrome which I think a lot of us use
take a look at what operas had offer I
looked at opera coast and we looked at
Opera Mini and a lot of folks wanted to
know which one I would use and which
one's balance differences was I went
through all the comments on them so let
me go ahead and tell you what I think is
good about them bad about it which one
that I would pick and hopefully looking
for an alternative browser one that's
gonna do something that sort of the big
two don't do if one of the operas a shot
they're both really really solid
alternatives let's start opera coast
again if you haven't seen in these
videos we'll link them down in my pants
region so first I'd loved the UI of it
I'm a nut for pre design this one was
the prettiest browser that I've used it
was really really clean I liked it I was
like and a website there was no clutter
really on the screen at all they were
just three icons and that was it
sharing is really important community
websites some sharing stuff to the staff
I want him to see an article I'm setting
except home to my wife sister or
whatever same each sharing really really
elegant when you hit the share button
you almost get a thumbnail of that
article as well which I really like just
a small sort of token to show if they're
really putting a lot of effort to design
I like pals interface a lot to like be
able to interact with them there's a lot
of animations to that I kind of dug let
me remove a tile sir pops down from from
the top also when you go ahead and put
it in a URL I really like when you go
ahead and did that pull down new started
populate took advantage of a lot of
empty space i swiping left to right was
enjoyable to go back and forth and pages
I have to deal with arrows I like that
it's pretty much always private as well
as when you delete the tile there all of
your browsing history was going to be
gone not that I have anything to hide or
anything but I just prefer to not have
everything be saved and tracked on my
phone but all it's not perfect certainly
there's three things that could change
or be improved or things that you might
not like animations considered to a wait
time we saw that with iOS of the whole
sort of beta eight got launched there
were really long animations those sort
of got cut down there's also a really
big learning curve
usually when I pick up and your brother
figured out very quickly I'll precocial
took me a little bit of time but the
more I got to use it certainly the more
I appreciate it
it also doesn't do much to conserve dad
punting to yourself self what browser
does things to conserve data and I will
tell you which one in just a minute and
probably most importantly to a lot of
you there isn't an Android equivalent
out there quiet Android has its own sort
of browser options there are a ton of
browser options available but there's
not an opera coast version for Google's
OS I next we'll talk about Opera Mini
there's a lot to like here as well first
it's really minimal its stripped-down
give you the essence of what a browser
supposed to do and because of that it's
really easy to learn it's got a few
features that I think are just really
really useful a fission might be on data
limits and you've got a smaller data
plan you're worried about going over
I've got something called opera turbo
what that's gonna do it's gonna actually
shave out unnecessary pixels on a
website it's gonna cut out things that
you don't need while viewing a site and
sort of help you save on that and that's
just a little bit we're talking 30 40 50
percent of what that website might have
used for data it's going to free up for
you so it's giant deal and what that
does for text you also have video boost
that does for video it was a little bit
of video fidelity while browsing you
know YouTube watching another video it's
gonna save you just irid icky
done of data if you're on a two gigabyte
data plan for example I can go so much
farther so that's a huge deal if you're
worried about data I like to discover
newsfeed feature as well as you sort of
swipe over to the right you get news it
populates right there as well but like
everything things aren't always perfect
looking out pretty and nicely designed
opera coast was Opera Mini is definitely
a slimmed down trimmed version there's
endured equivalent though but is a few
versions behind four you get on iOS I've
had to pick one in fact I have picked
one when I go to browse I'm picking
coast I like the way it looks I like to
you I like you tinged a detail in it
I've got a 10 gigabyte plan I'm never
even come close to using that so I'm not
worried about my data usage I really
like the way it looks like a minimal
design of it like be able to swipe back
and forth to refresh pages but for me
it's a personal taste I just appreciate
the design of it into it if I was on a
lower data plan I want to conserve data
I wasn't always on Wi-Fi for example I
would use Opera Mini in a heartbeat if
you haven't tried it and if you're sort
of worried about how much dad you're
gonna be using
give them both the shot they're both
free to download and Vale
from the AppStore then you guys watching
I hope you enjoyed give a thumbs up for
alternative browsers until next time I'm
