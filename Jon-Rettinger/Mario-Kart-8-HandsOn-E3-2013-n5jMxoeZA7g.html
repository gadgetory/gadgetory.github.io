to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State what's up everyone janja
TechnoBuffalo comm our own Joey Davidson
did a gallery of the new Mario Kart 8
but if a picture's worth a thousand
words the gameplays got to be worth a
freaking novel so we're taking a look at
Mario Kart 8 Here I am actually getting
a chance to play one thing you might not
know but the TechnoBuffalo office we
used to have very heated Mario Kart
battles on the Wii before the Wii U came
out so it's a game that we are really
really excited to take a look at so
Mario Kart 8 combines elements from the
3ds and the he has version Mario Kart 7
to get access to flying karts and all
kinds of other cool things here I won't
say graphically it looks pretty awesome
it looks like the Nintendo sort of
cartoonish graphic but it looks really
good car to scrap don't look like that
big graphics parody that we saw with the
Wii and Xbox 360 and the ps3 gameplay
here is really smooth so I'm using the
Wii U control pad I have turned off the
motion controls it is pretty true one to
one it's a little bit better than the
Wii MotionPlus kind of thing I prefer to
not do that and actually just use the
analog stick but I'm doing all right
here I'm Donkey Kong I'm playing so the
game is coming sometime in 2014 but you
can see it's at least this level is
looking pretty close already if you can
see the flying kart there with element
of Mario Kart 7 and overall the gameplay
is really fun it's everything you love
about Mario Kart now with better
graphics downloadable content and more
levels so I'm really excited to get this
day when it finally comes out Mario Kart
8 coming at you sometime in 2014
I'm gonna go back and try and beat this
level I want to thank our friends at
