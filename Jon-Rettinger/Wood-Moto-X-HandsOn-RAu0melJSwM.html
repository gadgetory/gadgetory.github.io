TechnoBuffalo I already showed you a
walkthrough of the phone I just wanted
to show you this one it's got a wooden
back and right now Motorola assessing a
few colors let me quickly turn around
and show you he's got a darker but how
you can't really see it got darker
wouldn't so this is a prototype right
now and they're not settled on the
actual type of wood they're using yet
are the colors but you're going to be
able to choose this option in moto maker
online it's actually would it's kind of
weird feeling not sure if it's for me I
kind of like the other colors but I
think a lot of people will really like
it they didn't say what type just yet so
the colors can change Tokido type of
wood although there's a few options
online again they're still choosing
between them I just want to show you a
quick look here I know otherwise the
phone looks really pretty much the same
so up there's another color I just
quickly show that here's what another
one might look like so really similar
looking it looks like we have a third
alright and there's what a darker one
might look like actually that one's
pretty sweet so any case these are the
wood options that may be available in
the near future this is tates I'm a
technical phone what's up everyone John
