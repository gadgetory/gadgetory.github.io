TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of the Samsung Droid Charge
let's go ahead and see if the things got
enough juice to earn a spot in your
pocket that was a bad charge joke be
prepared for those all right so let me
run through the specs this guy very
quickly and then we will get into the
review it has a 4.3 inch and that's a
measure diagonal super amoled plus
display and we'll talk a bit about the
screen with a resolution of 480 x 800
it's being powered by a 1 gigahertz
single core hummingbird processor it's
got android 2.2 with TouchWiz on it we
will also talk about TouchWiz and the OS
it's not 512 megabytes of ram rom on the
backs got an 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus and LED flash can shoot video
in 720p but that's not the only camera
is also a 1.3 megapixel shooter on the
front and all this is being powered by a
1600 milliamp hour battery so all these
specs are great and fine but if it's not
going to make good phone calls it's not
really going to matter for you and I'm
happy to report as in the case with most
verizon phones i've tested kolkata is
absolutely outstanding most importantly
i did not have dropped calls during the
4g 2 3g transition or even from the 3g
on down to the legacy network of
transitions at all no dropped calls
during those transition periods which is
quite nice during my 20 call test I did
whatever have to drop calls while
maintaining a very strong 4g signal so
let's go ahead and talk about speaker
quality I use speakerphone quite a bit
i'm guessing you do as well i'm also
going to take this as an opportunity to
show you whether or not and put the
debate to rest the droid charge can
handle voice and data at the same time
so we're going to go ahead and jump into
the phone here and we're going to call
the samsung support line you guys will
hear what the speaker quality will sound
like and also whether or not that's
going to do voice and data so i'm going
to put this on speaker so
only it's going to get a bit distorted
as it goes through camera I suppose you
too but it is very very loud so while
we're on this call let me go ahead hit
home let's say I want to do some
browsing let's go ahead and jump into
the web browser good sweet oriental
screen notice there's no Wi-Fi going on
yet so jump into technobuffalo let's go
ahead and launch that and we'll see if
we watch it and it is launching so we
are launching their men hang up on us
right back but join the speaker speaker
volume is very loud and it can do
simultaneous voice and data to very very
nice thing this is probably one of the
loudest speakers that I've used on a
phone surprisingly and the speaker grill
isn't even that big very little but that
hump when its resting especially on the
back leaves a little bit of avenue for
the noise to escape kind of nice all
right so let's talk about this super
amoled plus display if you've ever used
a galaxy s device you probably know the
screen is beautiful but had a little bit
of a blue tint to it that blue tint has
sort of been eliminated with the super
amoled plus and you're left with just a
gorgeous gorgeous display without any
hint of discoloration of images so let
me go ahead and show you what some of
the images quality look like on the
screen so I've got a wallpaper right
here you can see you know that standard
things look like let me show you a few
others will go ahead and jump into
wallpaper wallpaper gallery and things
and images just look very very pretty
and more important than images is text
and text here looks very nice on the
galaxy s and the original Galaxy S
series the phone that should say text
looked a little bit off for me it wasn't
as crisp as i would have liked it to
been a text here is going to be very
very very crisp regardless of the
background that you are on so if i were
to say go to a page that has a white
background we're looking at one a techno
buffalos infographics that we did for
the imax launch I've looking at a white
background that tint is gone and you
just have very very clear crisp
easy to read font on there something to
keep in mind all right so let's go ahead
and talk a bit about TouchWiz this is
running android 2.2 froyo we don't have
any gingerbread action here TouchWiz
we've seen it for quite a while I love
it or hate it this is a newer version of
TouchWiz you got some increased
functionality here you can set your home
screen move things around it is what it
is the applications array or sort of
confined to these square icons some
would say iOS like Apple would
definitely say iOS light since they are
suing but exactly functional and works
well nice thing about android if you
don't like it there are always things
like launcherpro out there to change the
way the phone looks not the biggest fan
of TouchWiz but the charge is one of the
phones that are used from Samsung that I
could definitely live with it so I like
that it has four physical buttons across
the bottom not with the passage of
variety their actual button set deep
breaths although I wished that it had
back lid on it I thought I was in a
movie theater or something I couldn't
quite see the button so I would have
liked to have seen those backlit here
the phone is very fast I'm surprised and
I know some of you guys might be
surprised as well you know you hear
single quarry ago I want double core
more cores the better despite not the
fastest quadrant scores the phone guan's
relatively quick and behave just about
whatever I needed to do so when I was
you know browsing the web or when I was
you know I'm multitasking or pinching
and zooming things worked very well so
web page here that has flash content
pinch to zoom works very well scrolling
smooth the phone kept up with everything
i needed to do no problem oral is don't
get caught up on quadrant scores and
benchmarking those are certainly fun
things to do but how the phone works for
you is going to be most important
they're not going to set the world on
fire with a stock rom here and a
quadrant score you know under a thousand
but you are going to get a phone that's
going to be very quick able to keep up
with most of the things that you're
going to need to do this is by no means
a slow phone in fact it's one of the
quicker phones that I've tested so if
you're concerned about speed definitely
don't be with the droid chart one of the
things that I didn't like about the
phone is the
back this hard plastic it sort of looked
similar to Samsung's own nexus s just
that sort of a cheap fuel to me often
times when there's a bit of a gap
between the back and when the battery is
underneath there get that almost
concerted hear it hollow sound on the
phone and for a phone this high quality
and behaves as well I would have liked a
bit of a higher quality material on the
back images from the camera were okay
they were just about average what you'd
expect from a spark smartphone with that
8 megapixel shooter on it not get set
the world on fire it's not going to
replace your camera and certainly not
going to be Ansel Adams or whatever
other famous photographer you want to
pick but if you snap a few shots your
friends of club you know you're not
going to have any problems one complaint
that I did have about it or another
complaint rather was the back of the
phone got very warm while I was on 3g 4g
i'm speaking up for g one of my big
concerns actually using that Thunderbolt
was going to be battery life so how is
this battery life going to do for you so
it's got a 1600 milliamp hour battery a
little bit bigger than what we usually
see Samsung claim you can get 11 hours
of talk time at 280 hours of standby
time the thick thing for me was I need
to make it through a full day I don't
mind charge of my phone every night in
fact I generally do charge my phone
every night but I need the phone to work
and have enough juice from when I wake
up at around 7-730 that's when i go to
bed around midnight and i was quite
surprised actually that i was able to do
that on the charge with two email
accounts being checked every 30 minutes
a lot of web browsing probably about
three hours of phone calls a day not on
the phone to my ear sometimes on
bluetooth and watching a couple YouTube
videos I was able to get to the end of
the day with just around twenty percent
of battery so heavier usage you know
maybe you'll soft ten percent down less
or more you know margin of error of say
ten percent but it really did work well
I'm surprised late we get through a full
day of battery life on this guy so you
can put those fears to rest if i was
looking to get an android powered phone
right now on verizon wire
and I lived in a 4g area the jury charge
would definitely be the one that I would
pick up as you're looking now to get a
phone on Verizon getting probably
considering whether or not to go 4G or
3g now if you're in an area that even
doesn't have 4g service it'd be tough to
say don't get a 4g phone because you
might have 4G service during that to
your course of your contract so
definitely give the jury charge a look
you might also want to consider the
Thunderbolt if you're more swayed to the
HTC built variety droid bionic
supposedly coming at a much later time
in the summer it's going to bring some
dual core action so if you need a phone
right now definitely the jury charge is
highly recommended i'm jon rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
