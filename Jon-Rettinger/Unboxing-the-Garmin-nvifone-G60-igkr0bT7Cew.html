unboxing for you that I'm actually
pretty excited about this one is the
Garmin Nuvi phone
g60 which would be available for 18 t
come October 4th it'll run you $2.99
with a two-year contract after $100
mail-in rebate this is the first Garmin
Nuvi phone it's been released in the US
for those of you that aren't familiar
familiar with Garmin they traditionally
have made standalone GPS students so
navigation and things like that and this
is the first time they released a phone
so it's a full Garmin navigator with
phone functionality it's not even phone
functionality smartphone functionalities
so you get email and you get internet
and it really curious to how this is
going to actually work I have not seen
one of these and I've actually been
trying to stay away from any reviews on
it so I'm completely a fresh clean slate
let's dive right in and see what this
sucker looks like using the obligatory
big ol knife here I got my address
covered up go ahead hack into the box
slicing a finger off this is built on a
a proprietary Linux operating system
that Garmin has built from Linux let's
go ahead and open it up Garmin Nuvi
phone g60 we've got some PR information
look at that a little bit later you've
got a picture of the device on the front
makes use of a sort of two rows three
and four icons we'll see that when we
turn the phone on 3G obviously GPS email
three megapixel camera and Internet and
this has all of the maps actually stored
on the device so it does not use data
like TeleNav does so you can use this
for a GPS navigation even when you don't
have data signal and if you have the
device you have access to the full
navigation although if you want some
extra navigation features like traffic
updates white pages weather movie local
events and fuel prices you can get an
extra pack from 18 key for 6 bucks
but when you have a phone with the
internet they have a data plan you know
you may want to see if that's worthwhile
to or not I think they give you a 30-day
free trial so some more information on
the box tells you what's inside we'll
see what's inside in just a minute
another picture of the device some more
iconography and that's about it
let's dig in I think I've got this
upside down here this one opens from the
top that's new for 18 tee boxes
generally open from the side go ahead
and slice this open this has never been
open it's actually has even been
released yet so another three more days
before it comes out picture the
navigation on the side and I'll be doing
full demonstrations of how this works as
a navigator how it works as a phone how
it functions with you're using a
navigator and you get a phone call all
that stuff so stay tuned for the channel
for all that information so here's the
nüvifone g60 quick smart guide Quick
Start Guide a little bit about it GPS
email Tech's capable if you make a pixel
camera internet browser and Bluetooth
technology navigate all that stuff so
here's the phone itself go ahead and put
this off to the side for a minute let's
see what else you're gonna get when you
buy your new be phone you get like a
suction cup for a mountain car that's
nice they include that we've got a
battery so you can see of what size this
is it is a twelve hundred million power
battery so not the largest battery in
the world but we'll see how the
operating system manages power got a
u.s. power adapter probably slides right
into the plug I assume here is the car
mount that that suction cup hooks onto
that's actually really nice too included
this really does make it actually a full
standalone GPS and it's got that little
ball bearing that I assume plugs into an
adapter on the phone we've got a USB
cable which looks like it goes to mini
USB so that's nice no proprietary format
there here is the wall charger that that
US plug will slide into here's probably
that adapter
just talking about that the little ball
joint will push into yep so sucked right
off to the phone and we've got some
guide information with a disc in there
sorts but that's not why you're all here
let's check out the newbie phone get
fast info wherever you are whether real
time traffic
gas prices and more start 30-day free
trial of premium connected services go
ahead and tap one of those icons pull
off the classic it's a very satisfying
noise I'm not sure this is a capacitive
or resistive although on on first blush
it feels like it's a resistive
touchscreen so let's take a look at the
device and see what we got so the main
display gear is 3.5 inches actually a
relatively large screen with a pixel
size of 272 by 480 and it can show over
65,000 colors and it is a resistive
touch screen on the left side of the
device we've got really no physical
buttons there's a syncing port right
there there's your mini USB on the left
side of the vice also there's a lanyard
slot on the right side we've got your
volume rocker up and down and there is a
hard menu button on the back you've got
your three megapixel camera and Scott
it's sort of soft touch rubbery feel and
let's know using a Garmin Nuvi phone it
appears that the speaker is right there
on the back it does have a nice heft to
it it's not the thinnest a phone in the
world but it definitely feels solid
let's compare it to another touchscreen
phone that you guys are probably all
familiar with here it is next to the
iPhone 3GS you can see that screen size
the iPhone is a little bit larger let's
compare the thickness the Nuvi phone is
just a tad smaller and a little bit
thicker let's pop off the back and see
what we have and the one thing I should
mention on the left side we've got your
sinking in your charge reports there's
also a little hidden door there for
expandable men
that's a very nice feature you don't
have to remove the back cover or battery
to get to that I'm always happy when
phone manufacturers make it easily
accessible and you also have a headset
jack on top which appears to be two and
a half millimeters so the backs been
popped off the SIM card goes right in
there and will pop the battery in and
we'll do a first boot up and see what
this looks like I love saying we when
it's just me here I'm gonna pop that
back on and on one point of note that I
should mention this car adapter that
will hook up to your driver's side
window or your your - wherever you want
to put it it's also going to charge the
device as well which is quite nice makes
use of that mini USB port on the back
and it plugs right into the side and
when it sits it actually sits landscape
so it actually does look just like a
real dedicated GPS navigator let's power
this sucker on and see what we got got a
little buzz to let me know it worked
you are obligatory AT&amp;amp;T logo it's a
world phone so it is of course quad band
and certainly 3G and while that's
continuing the process I'll tell you a
little bit more about it it's got four
gigabytes of built-in memory it's built
off of Linux it's got a 128 megabytes of
RAM the expansion port that I just
showed you is micro SD which is quite
nice
I assume that this boot up is only the
first time it's got a predictive test
it's got a w AP 2.0 full HTML capable
browser it's got Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G which is
quite nice it can record video it's got
an autofocus camera at the digital zoom
and geo-tagging SIM card is missing in
the Box are unable to use with AT&amp;amp;T
insert the SIM card and hit OK alright
so let's go ahead ok I'm going to pop in
a SIM card and see what this thing looks
like we've got the SIM card in and is
indeed going through that same boot up
period when you put the phone I assume
it's trying to locate satellites but
every time you turn on the phone you are
going to have to just wait a minute for
that process let's go back and talk more
about the specs it's got bluetooth 2.0 a
stereo bluetooth the headset jack is
indeed 2.5 millimeters it's got the
alarm calendaring to-do lists and notes
it can do
IMAP pop3 SMTP emails and of course it
has GPS so those are all the major
features of the Garmin Nuvi phone g60
let's see what the operating system
looks like very quickly and like I
mentioned stay tuned to the channel for
a full walkthrough of the OS a
demonstration of how it works as a GPS
and how it handles calls when you're
using it as a GPS so here we are we are
located in the United States that ok I
gotta hit OK life is agreement all
except all of them warning you think the
battery is about to die here location
basis glamour yes ok and here we are
finally on the home screen and you saw
that those row of icons just moved which
actually didn't know about that's
letting you know that that's how you can
navigate through the resistive touch
screen does feel very responsive it's
going quite quickly as I slide my finger
over it and almost has a capacitive feel
but you can definitely notice a little
bit of squishiness so that just a
unboxing of the garmin-asus nüvifone I
hope you enjoyed stay tuned for a more
