from technobuffalo and when Apple
introduced iOS 8 last year one of its
big features was the ability to install
third-party keyboards and while most
people were quick to try out the big
guys like SwiftKey swipe and flusky we
thought it'd be fun to check out some of
the crazier options out there right now
today we'll be checking out three in
particular and number one on our list is
the jif keyboard which is free from the
App Store sometimes emojis just don't
cut it you can't always express your
true feelings with just emojis so why
not take things to the next level with
gifs with a jif keyboard you'll be able
to search any gifs you'd like by
entering a few key words in a search bar
for example we want to send rawness
Spongebob jiff you just enter the word
spongebob in a search field and a bunch
of Spongebob related gifs will pop up
you can also browse through different
categories like reactions trending and
music by going through two different
buttons at the bottom of the keyboard
each bun will have different categories
you can go through it'll show a bunch of
gifs within those categories for example
and reaction there's a category with a
title hashtag no and then inside that
you'll see just related to that specific
word copying a jiff is super easy just
press the Jeff once and it'll
automatically copy that on to your
clipboard you can simply just paste it
on your message field and hit the send
button you can also press and hold any
of the gifs to pull up options you share
two different social networks or email
and you can also save the chips your
camera roll which you can either save as
a jiff or a video number two on our list
is kimo G which is also free from the
App Store if you're not so much into
gist and want to trick we use emojis I
think you'll find the kimochi keyboard
to be very useful kimochi is a keyboard
that essentially lets you insert emojis
by typing their name or by typing
phrases and turning them into strings
and emojis kimochi looks like a standard
QWERTY keyboard but as soon as you start
typing words or different phrases it'll
start suggesting emojis in a scrollable
quick type like bar for example I want
to text a friend what's up it'll
translate that text into a string of
emojis that relates to that specific
phrase you just choose from a few
options by scrolling through the
scrollable bar above the keyboard now
one of the coolest features included in
the keyboard is the art emoji button
which essentially creates a series of
pictures or expressions using just
emojis and text for example we head into
gestures you can scroll through a
variety of emoji art which you can then
copy directly onto your message field
and sent to your friends emojis are
super fun and playful but would kimochi
you'll be
to send emoji art with a single tap a
button again came oh jeez free and you
can download it now from the App Store
so the last one on our list is probably
the craziest keyboard out there right
now and that's the click wheel keyboard
which is also free now do you remember
iPods before they were touchscreen do
you remember the click wheel well you
can relive that arrow with a new click
real keyboard the click wheel keyboard
is an exact replica of the click wheel
on older generation ipods once you
switch over to the keyboard you're
presented with iPods iconic click wheel
along with the bar above that displays
the characters so from there it's
basically scrolling left or right to
find letters you want to type click the
center button for entry and repeat a tad
space or move the cursor left and right
just tap on a click wheels left and
right area to move pressing up on the
click wheel will delete letters and
pressing down will capitalize your
letters looking for emojis too well you
can do that but you better have the time
and patience to find the right ones
because you'll be scrolling for a very
long time when scrolling through the
letters numbers and emojis we notice
that the ipod scrolling sound were
included in this keyboard as well which
brings back a lot of memories from back
in a day now obviously the click wheel
keyboard isn't meant for everyday use
but it's still nice to have if you're
feeling nostalgic now again to click we
will keep word is free and you can
download it now from the app store if
you guys have any crazy fun and
interesting third-party keyboard you'd
like to recommend leave them in the
comments section down below if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
