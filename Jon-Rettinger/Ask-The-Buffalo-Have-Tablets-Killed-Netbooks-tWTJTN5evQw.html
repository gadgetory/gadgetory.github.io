welcome to another edition of ask the
buffalo where you can ask me anything
you want from the world a tech from
mobile phones computers tablets laptops
anything that plugs in or uses
rechargeable batteries go ahead and ask
you can submit your questions two ways
the first one is either on the website
technobuffalo calm will have a post up
there you can leave your questions in
the comments or you can send it out
replied to me on twitter with the
hashtag ask the be to either the
official TechnoBuffalo twitter handle
which is at technobuffalo or my personal
one which is at john for lakers so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get started the first question comes to
us from twitter and user I are beast
John what is your favorite verizon phone
that's an excellent question there are
two phones that I think are absolutely
outstanding on verizon they've got a ton
of great devices out there first if you
are in an LTE area the one that you need
to pick up in my opinion out of all
their LTE devices which currently just
to the charge and the Thunderbolt is the
Samsung built Droid Charge LTE speeds
are absolutely amazing I've been getting
between five and ten megabits down and
about 3 megabits per second up which is
almost on par with standard comb
connections absolutely great device and
the best thing about this has been the
battery life I'm able to get through a
full day which is not something I can
say about the Thunderbolt it doesn't
have a dual core processor but it is
extremely fast rocking the latest and
greatest updated hummingbird so if you
are looking for an LTE phone even if
you're signing a two-year contract and
you're not in LTE area now you might be
an LTE area in the future if you live in
the maps the middle of nowhere you don't
think you're going to be getting LTE in
the next few years and you want to go
android the new x
24 verizon is a fantastic device if you
are looking for something that's perhaps
less future-proof the iphone 4 on
verizon is always a solid choice i
happen to have one right here if you
ever see someone using an iphone 4 and
you want to tell whether or not it's for
verizon or not sort of a handy little
trick i won't have the FCC business on
the bottom here if it is a verizon
iphone cut interesting so those would be
my top two choices for verizon phones
all right the next question comes to us
again from twitter this is FSU for Asti
who is asking John why did you choose
the macbook pros one of your first
videos shows you that might have been
following me on youtube John for lakers
you know that my first video was an
unboxing of a macbook pro hello
everybody my name is John I'm a recent
max switcher it was an extremely
unprofessional in boxing I was really
really nervous is about four and a half
years ago I had been watching a ton of
YouTube videos at the time it was really
before there were a lot of tech
reviewers out there and I knew that I
wanted to try it I had never used him
act before I had pcs in my whole life
and I figured if I made some videos on a
new computer it would force me to learn
it was annual operating system OS 10 at
the time I didn't know anything about it
or how to use it i figured videos would
be a nice way to do it I was also excuse
me to buy a video camera which being a
tech guy all I needed was a reason to
justify it in my head so that was why I
picked the macbook pro as my first video
the next question comes to us once again
from Twitter this is user blue 42 rich
man who asked how do you balance
hands-on time with three you device with
the speed required for SEO to videos and
reviews so I think what he's asked me is
how do i do ton of phone reviews I'm be
able to give each phone the time it
deserves oh really at any given time I'm
reviewing about two phones are coming
out and I'm really glad you asked this
question I know a lot of you guys out
there looking and get into the phone
reviewing world but it's tough to sort
of balance time to make sure the phone
is getting a review you can give your
audience the most honest review possible
if you just use
phone for a day you're not going to know
enough about it sometimes our reviews
come a little bit later than other sites
because I'm spending a lot of time with
these phones and I really want to know
all the nuances so to answer your
question the first thing I will do is I
will sit with the phone for one hour I
will even if it's a familiar poem that
I've used and I've used android before
for example I will sit with the phone
I'll go through all the widgets I'll try
everything I'll trying to speed of the
phone i'll compare it to a few other
devices that I with me and the next
thing I do is I hop in the car I've got
a loop sort of around my neighborhood
I'm in Southern California it's about a
five mile loop and i will make 20 test
calls and that sometimes can take a
while you're gonna take about an hour
and a half two hours usually I just keep
calling my wife I'd see if I have any
drop calls or how the call quality is
how their speakerphone is how it
connects the bluetooth now that's
certain the only representative of where
I am in Southern California's first call
quality but it will give me a sense of
whether or not it drops a lot of calls
and oftentimes that's representative of
a bad antenna I'm sort of a long winded
cancer to say that I really make sure
that each phone gets the time it
deserves and this is my job so I can
spend you know as much time as I need
from eight in the morning until 12 in
the afternoon just with one phone on i
can do that for three four five you know
six days even to make sure i can give
you guys the most honest opinion as
possible alright let's go to the next
one which comes once again from twitter
this is aj Goran one what do you use
most often tablets phones pcs that
include maps I use my computer's up
quite a bit so first one you can see
behind me connected to bird it's right
there behind me let's connect it to a
27-inch imac I do all of my video
editing on a Mac I you know use final
cut express or iMovie depending on the
difficulty of video editing that needs
to be done so most of my time to spend
right here in this chair staring at
that's great doing all of my video
editing when I feel I need to get some
direct Sun trend i might go work across
the street and I will bring my macbook
air with me and I can do some light
video editing in my movie but it's
on that fast generally if I'm you know
interested in bed they're sitting on the
couch I've got my smartphone with me I'm
checking Twitter or YouTube and that
really depends on what phone I am
testing or using at the time currently I
am using the Samsung Infuse 4G is by
daily phone so that's what I've got with
me sitting on the couch sometimes if
you're for bed I will watch youtube
videos on a tablet from testing a new
tablets what i'll be using but generally
i've got the ipad 2 with me so hopefully
that answers your question alright let's
go to the next one this comes from jamie
benn hughes at john for lakers have
tablets killed off the netbook industry
if not and when the netbook industry
really boomed up the past few years with
the advent of the intel atom chip
low-powered low power consumption and
you're able to use it as a standard
computer I said this time and time again
tablets are fantastic for media
consumption great for watching video
great for browsing the web not so good
for media consumption I'm not going to
create spreadsheets where documents
whatever PowerPoint whatever you're
doing it's very difficult to do on the
tablet for that demographic I think
netbooks are really going to always have
a place that is until tablets become a
tool for media creation I look at advice
like the epad transformer which has a
keyboard and it's got a trackpad tell me
sir cross that boundary a little bit
where tablets can be used for easy media
creation I with Android allowing now
nice so you can actually have a cursor
it's becoming a lot more prevalent to
use tablets for media consumption I
don't think that the tablet os's are
where they need to be for it's going to
kill the network industry but i would
say we're heading that direction very
quickly perhaps in iOS 5 or even in
Android Ice Cream Sandwich hopefully
that helps answer your question ah the
next question comes from the website
this is from quince hubs do you think
there will be a smart cover for the
iphone 5 because you guys don't know
this is a smart cover on the ipad 2 it
is a polyurethane or leather little
magnetic case hooks on the side that
protects your ipad 2 and can prop it up
and do all kinds of business with it I
definitely do not think we'll see a
smart cover for the iphone 5 first of
all who's going to really prop up their
phone generally you're holding it in
your hand imagine pulling a magnetic
latch and your pocket it's going to fall
off just not going to happen I would say
very strongly no we're not going to see
a smart cover for the iphone 5 pratts
will see an evolution of the bumper that
we've got for a case for the iphone 4
speaking of mobile operating systems all
right let's go ahead and jump into the
next question which comes from max
Kissel I believe sighs knows it hey John
what do you think about the new mango
update coming to Windows Phone 7 you
think it will put the OS compared to the
iOS and such LOL thoughts on the pre 3
i'm a huge fan of Windows Phone 7 i'm
got the samsung focus here but the new
mango update which is the new software
update coming to Windows Phone 7 I think
that we're finally going to see OS
parody I again really like Windows Phone
7 I think I could use it as my daily OS
but there are some things that's really
missing a unified inbox for one if
you're like me and I've got a work email
address got a business email address
work and business or actually two
separate emails and I've got a personal
one so that three emails going when
you're looking at the smart titles on a
windows phone 7 operating system can be
a bit tough when your whole screen is
filled up with a few in boxes so I would
love to see a unified inbox we're
finally going to see multitasking
actually doing a process called
tombstoning which sounds sort of violent
brawl it does essentially kills the app
right where you are and lets you go back
to it there's a ton of other security
features that are going in we now have
cut copy and paste we saw with the node
0 update so the answer to your question
is yes I think we'll see OS parity and I
think windows phone 7 will be as viable
and option as iOS is
android is and as hopefully webos will
be on the pre three which is another
device I am really looking forward to
getting my hands on I was able to see
one and test it very quickly and the
touchpad conference in san francisco
which was fine i believe in that
februari at this point I'm really
excited hopefully that's going to come
very soon although I do wish it had an
on-screen keyboard the next question and
last question comes from Twitter and
this is user Ross Jamison I'm giving a
lot of head Bob's ask the bee what are
your thoughts on the apple store two
point oh those you guys don't know it's
the 10 year anniversary of the apple
retail store and they've redone and
revamped slowly at least all the alcohol
stores across the country in the world
if they haven't done yours yet they will
be very soon oh if they've done and now
they're using iPads it's sort of smart
tags you can go through if you're
looking at a macbook pro next to the
macbook pro display there'll be an ipad
at all different information you can
even page a sales associate to come over
to you if you don't want to just raise
your hand or go up and say excuse me
you'll now have the option to just page
someone which is great when the stores
get really busy they can actually come
and answer your question should help a
bit with staffing a bit of a redesign in
there as well I think it looks nice
certainly a modernization of the apple
store is very clean its iconic and it's
become sort of a beacon for consumer
electronic retails that's really become
a model that a lot of companies have
tried to imitate so if you guys enjoyed
this edition of ask the Buffalo I am jon
rettinger and if you have any other
questions that come up be sure to check
out the website or the twitter feed and
we'll let you know what we're filming
another ask the bee and we'll get your
question answered i'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
