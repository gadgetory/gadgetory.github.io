for laker is back with another reader
mail bag before i start i want to remind
you guys to check out the website wwm
for lakers calm this coming Thursday
which watching this play later sorry is
August seventh at nine-thirty a.m.
pacific time which is 1130 a.m. central
time 1230 p.m. eastern time or 630pm if
you're in Italy we got a cool exclusive
coming up you're watching this later
they never know what the exclusive was
and hope you think it was fun now all
with the mailbag people liked away this
last time something to keep it up it's
just going to be a I'm gonna pick a
random questions out of my out of my
mailbox and she go ahead and get me an
answer for X I know a lot of you guys
sometimes have similar questions and I
can't respond to everybody unfortunately
so let's start with the first one here
by balls-to-the-wall 89 hey John my name
is Ron and I want your YouTube videos
all the time I have a few questions for
you about the macbook pro well I've
noticed my max need to get really hot
when it's running sometime so hot I
can't even touch the underside of it or
the hinge near the screen do all the Mac
Pro's you guys get this hot there's
something wrong with mine could it be a
big problem second has your Mac ever
started running really fast like the
sound when you put in the disc it makes
that sound like it's spinning all the
time any thoughts on the matter well the
macbook pros get very hot it's totally
normal don't sweat it if you're going to
burn yourself something wrong if it just
pot to the touch that's the way it works
laptops do get really hot don't worry
about it occasionally my fans get really
loud not that so loud that sounds like
something spinning if you have worries
or concerns of take it into an apple
store if you can but otherwise it sounds
like everything is fine as long as your
computer's working you should be good
make sure the fans are open when you put
it down and I don't want to give any
problems here let's pick another one up
there this is from Sony man 12 hey John
I was thinking about getting mobile me
and I was wondering do you think is
worth it
and by the way I love your new site it
rocks well thank you for that and
mobileme definitely had a tick ups
undoubtedly but Apple will fix them I
think that mobileme is worth it but
that's because I I work so I travel a
lot for work do I need to get my work
email pushed to my phone I needed in
real time so because of that mobileme
was a perfect fit and calendar syncing
with my calendar the office is really
important if that's not so important to
you pushy pushy mill choosing you sent
if that push rather a standard pull
email meeting it'll check every 15
minutes or half hour when I reset it for
it's a great option mobileme is not a
necessity but it is a very nice luxury
so if you have a hundred bucks and
you're looking to spend that mobileme is
definitely a good way to go so let's
take one more here all right this one's
from Tom tech and the title is taking
notes on a mac John I'm thinking about
getting a macbook pro for school I've
never used macs before some of them I'm
a PC user I was wondering what program
do you take notes on school on your
macbook pro you have any other tips for
me thank you been um use Microsoft Word
to take notes sign in Mac I have
microsoft word for mac just like a PC
you can use notepad can you use iwork
you can use anything advice for you i
forgot doing graphic design get a
macbook instead going to save your money
for whatever you needed for and uh just
go for the straight up macbook
especially because they're probably
gonna get revised in the next month or
so so let's pick up one more here let's
go to next was dumb a couple on my first
page here um listen from a friend of
mine on youtube by the name of van
houtte 2234 a nice question is on
upgrading ram in his macbook hey John
when I'm update uploading YouTube videos
my macbook pro of the Internet I find
that it can do anything else during that
time where I'll get the beach ball of
death my mac will freeze up I remember
you telling me that you upgraded the ram
but I was wondering do you think it
makes a huge difference of two to four
gigs in terms of freezing up in the
beach ball
hope the question made sense but yeah
turn knowing not to be able to do
anything on my laptop for 20 minutes or
whatever after shooting 8 to 10 minute
video well vanhoutte hope you're doing
well I sent you a quick message but
that's nothing to do with Ram your
computer's having some issues plenty of
people with 2gb of RAM have no trouble
uploading videos I would recommend using
time machine doing a full backup of your
computer and then doing completely solve
OS 10 sounds like you may have a larger
issue if that doesn't sound so appealing
to you I'd recommend taking it into an
apple store if you again I think you're
in Canada so you know try and find one
around there and have them take a look
at it as for a difference between two to
four it doesn't make a nice difference
as far as speed the computer processing
but nothing to do with upload time for
YouTube so sorry about that man alright
that was this edition of reader mail
back just answered a few questions for
you guys plenty more coming soon be sure
