one of the iPhone and 3GS vs. the PSP Go
you can also consider this the iPod
Touch vs. the PSP go now some of you
might be wondering why I'm putting these
two devices head-to-head since they seem
so divergent well I tend to disagree I
think they're actually competing for a
very similar market share a lot of
people are buying iPod Touches and even
iPhones exclusively for the App Store to
get access to those thousands of games
and applications that are available in
the App Store now by proxy people are
buying the PSP go for obviously the
games and it's got a lot of additional
functionality on top of that take them
play video it's got a web browser and
because of those features I think that
they definitely overlap now the
PlayStation Store that's found on the
PSP go gives you access to a back
catalogue of fantastic PSP games and
with those really full PSP games and
ones that run you 40 bucks or more
you're getting fantastic graphics and
you're getting and I think a top-notch
portable gaming library however with the
launch of the PSP Go there's also a new
category of games called PlayStation
minis and these games are very similar
to what's found on the App Store in fact
some of the titles even overlap as I'll
show you in a minute so this round is
going to focus on gaming it's gonna
focus on navigation and it's gonna focus
on some of the hardware so let's start
at the hardware let's talk about what
you look at most the screen the PSP Go
has a 3.8 inch screen with a resolution
of 480 by 272 the iPhone and iPod touch
have a 3.5 inch screen so a little bit
smaller but higher resolution at 480 by
320
I think Sony and Microsoft are competing
for the wallets of a very similar
demographic the iPhone is gonna run you
anywhere from $1.99 to $2.99 on contract
the iPod touch anywhere from $1.99 to
399 and the PSP Go comes in at $250
so it definitely is an overlap in price
there let's go in and talk about games
in particular so I've mentioned earlier
these PlayStation minis and you can see
right here I'm in the PlayStation Store
taking a look at some of the meanings
that are available so right now there
are only a few that are available one of
them in particular stood out for me and
that is right here Hero of Sparta
that's a game that's been very popular
not for the iPhone and iPod Touch so one
thing to know the game here is $6.99
from the PlayStation Store if you look
at the App Store look at the App Store
for example the game is market ibly
cheaper coming in I believe it's on sale
right now even for $1.99 go back and see
I've searched for a hero of Sparta so
there's definitely a big difference in
price but is there a big difference in
the quality of the game well let me show
you real quickly what the graphics on
both look like and you can be the judge
not for my opinion since it might be the
fairest reflection that shows up on film
okay so we've got hero Sparta loaded up
on both consoles here the iPhone 3GS of
course and the PlayStation go and right
away you can see the difference between
the Playstations
larger screen and the iPhones let's see
much of difference resolution wise
despite the iPhones higher resolution I
will tell you that navigating around on
the iPhone not any physical buttons can
be a bit difficult for example here
you've got to use a virtual joystick
whereas on the PSP code you can actually
rely on a physical analog stick which
makes things a lot easier in my opinion
for button control you have to deal with
virtual buttons on screen since you
can't use any of the iPhones physical
buttons for navigation and game play
whereas on the PSP obviously you get the
traditional circle triangle X and square
buttons which does make gameplay I think
a bit easier but taking the navigation
aside from a purely graphical standpoint
I think you are getting slightly better
graphics on the PSP go and I think that
would make senses the PSP goes really
built primarily for any gaming machine
whereas the iPhone 3GS and the iPod
Touch I think
just happen to play games so if you're
looking for a specifically gaming
perspective I think that you are getting
a little bit better graphics on the PSP
go now that said performance wise the
game ran just as fast on each so it's
really gonna come down to I think a
personal perspective on whether you want
something that can do a little bit of
everything like the iPhone or the iPod
Touch or whether or not you want a
dedicated gaming console like the PSP go
I will say though hero Sparta's a very
fun game so give it a download if you'd
like although I'm not so sure the little
bit of added graphics is worth the
ridiculously additional price that you
have to pay for the PSP go so let's go
ahead and back out of here and go back
to the home screens of each device so
quite obviously by looking at both
devices you can clearly see the
difference like I just mentioned
physical buttons versus non physical
buttons now you're also dealing with a
touchscreen versus a non touchscreen so
things like text entry on the PSP go can
be a little bit difficult because you
have to rely on a virtual keyboard they
have to control by moving the arrows
around whereas on the iPhone and the
iPod Touch you can actually touch the
button so it makes typing a lot easier
and that's gonna come into play for
things like the V browser now the
browser and video quality and music
functionality I'm going to show you in a
future rounds for right now I wanted to
focus just on gaming so it's really
gonna come down to personal perspectives
like I mentioned whether or not you want
lower costs more option games whether
you want the higher cost dedicated games
that you can get on the PSP go no I just
showed you the PS minutes but you also
get like I said a vast category and a
vast library of dedicated PSP games
which are not minis but full-scale games
which are definitely going to be more
expensive around the $40 range but you
are going to get great graphics online
play and a ton of other features so if
you enjoyed this round one stay tuned to
future realms for a lot more detail for
