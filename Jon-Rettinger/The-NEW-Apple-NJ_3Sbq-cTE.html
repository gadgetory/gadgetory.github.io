much did you rely on it in the early
days as the market got more
sophisticated it was less easy to do
that and the problem is is that market
research can tell you tell you what your
customers think of something you show
them or it can tell you what your
customers want as an incremental
improvement of what you have but very
rarely can your customers predict
something that they don't even quite
know they want yet for most of apples
history they've kind of been run much
like my six year old toddler lives his
life they don't listen to anybody and
they kind of do what they want and
that's led to huge successes iPhones
iPads Apple watches a few failures along
the way and they've kind of been run
like the old Henry Ford quote if I asked
people what they wanted
they'd asked for a faster horse it's
gotta be that Steve Jobs mantra of the
consumers don't know what they want
until we show them what they want you
could look at Apple's recent history and
I think say there's been some big misses
you can look at the 2013 trashcan Mac
Pro as a gigantic swing and a miss the
keyboards in Apple's most popular PC the
MacBook Pros have not been performing up
to standards and the MacBook line a line
that once made a ton of sense as they're
thin in like competitor once the MacBook
Air got updated made zero sense at all
but it seems like we are at a really big
paradigm shift for the company Apple is
finally starting to listen to consumers
I kind of begged the question is this
the new Apple
so apples product lines are usually
pretty clear you know what you want to
get your walk in and get it at least in
my experience but their laptop line was
a garbled mess and it was hard to figure
out which laptops were meant for who so
previous to a couple weeks ago you had
the 15-inch MacBook Pro that made sense
13-inch MacBook Pro that made sense but
then you had a version of that MacBook
Pro without the touch bar and then the
MacBook Air got updated and that was all
about being thin light and powerful then
you also had the MacBook whose whole Jam
was about being thin and light but now
it was kind of underpowered and didn't
make sense in that lineup and clear the
Apple was listening to probably their
folks trying to sell these things at the
retail stores and they simplified the
lineup in a way that actually is very
clear and make sense
you've got the MacBook Pros do you want
it in 15 or 13-inch there's no more non
touch bar version the MacBook Air is now
your option if you want a thinner
lighter computer and they killed the
12-inch MacBook line that makes sense
now Apple isn't to consumers they
streamlined their MacBook lineup
so why the lineup makes sense there
isn't a computer for everyone in the app
or rumor mill never seems to stop
churning a 16 inch model is supposedly
incoming very soon for this holiday
season that'll be that top end and it
will usher in a new generation of
keyboards for all the MacBook Pros
fixing those failure issues and figures
cross hopefully starting new design
language with face ID built in you guys
have been enjoying watching the videos
we've had a blast making them for me
it's been a liberating experience I'm
sure you hit the subscribe button in the
Bell notification so you know when new
videos are ready for you and the
question is arisen lately is there room
for a third category of device in the
middle so the consensus on the iPad was
incredible hardware limited by software
it's pretty much running a phone OS and
that's the way it's always been
but hardware this incredible and
powerful and capable it was funny
because you started to see the
limitations of the software we made a
whole video talking about please
makin iPad OS let this be potentially a
full-blown PC and appears that Apple is
listening to consumers we now have iPad
OS and even if it's not fully there yet
by making a dedicated operating system
for the iPad there's now a clear path to
get to that next version of a PC as as
the iPad as your computer and we're
getting things that folks have been
asking for you're getting a better files
app finally you're getting widgets on
the home screen importing directly into
apps better multitasking it's a huge
long list and the giant step forward for
the iPad letting it take advantage of
the amazing hardware with software to
match it probably the clearest example
of Apple listening to consumers is the
Mac Pro it took him a long time to get
there 2013 the trashcan Mac Pro came out
and I'm not gonna harp on it too much
the problems are very well documented it
wasn't that easily upgradeable thermally
it was a mess and it looked better than
it performs and we made a video on what
we thought the future of the Mac Pro
line should be and it was very clear and
people are spending money for pro level
computers they want easy upgrade ability
they want a ton of Io on something that
is going to be very powerful and
scalable for their needs and that is
exactly what Apple delivered I mean and
this is arguably one of the most
upgradable computers at least most of
gradable Apple computers they've ever
made we've got eight PCIe slots and sain
up to 1.5 terabytes of RAM pretty
expandable graphics options thus a
computer that can adapt to your needs we
talked about something that can take 1.5
terabytes of RAM it comes at a price and
these are definitely not inexpensive
computers and perhaps are more expensive
than they should be they're certainly
more expensive than the PC counterparts
there probably isn't a more cleaner
example of Apple answering a question
and addressing a problem than the brand
new just announced Mac Pro so on the
surface
you think a company listening to the
consumers would like a no-brainer good
idea that's obviously a way company
should be run
but isn't the way Apple has been run so
I kind of wonder now with Johnny I've
leaving the company are the days of
these new revolutionary products things
we didn't know we wanted are those days
done are we just gonna get better
versions that we already have a faster
iPhone a better iPad a better Apple
watch and those kind of things are we
still going to see these new
revolutionary products that as consumers
maybe we didn't even imagine in our
heads that Apple used to deliver and
again I'm not sure of as a discussion
point I do think that the days of Apple
revolutionized an electronics industry
are probably behind them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
