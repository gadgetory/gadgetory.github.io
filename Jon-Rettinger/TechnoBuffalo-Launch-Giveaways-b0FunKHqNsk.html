I've been waiting for and hopefully you
have as well as finally come
technobuffalo calm is officially
relaunched for those you that might have
forgotten with TechnoBuffalo is let me
refresh your memory it really stands on
three legs the first is what you see
when you hit the main homepage and
that's content that's been generated by
our team of staff and salaried writers
its editorial technology content
technology reviews everything consumer
technology focused obviously we're going
to be very heavily video focused as well
since well I got my start and video so
we're going to have product reviews
product unboxings a myriad of other
video content the second leg of
technobuffalo so it's called buffalo net
it's our full-scale social network this
is gonna allow you to talk to other tech
heads and see what likes and dislikes
you might have create friends send
emails in a rather anonymous way you
don't have to give it all your personal
information like you do on Facebook no
one's got to see pictures or what you
did last weekend it's just a way to talk
about technology and a really fun and
simple to use package the third leg of
techno Buffalo I think is the most
exciting we found that a lot of people
out there want to be tech reviewers but
are having a really hard time getting
your name out there well this is where
technobuffalo is going to come and
really help you you can create your own
sub blog off the main no names sowww
TechnoBuffalo calm / username now you're
going to get full of wordpress content
management for your own sub blog now
we're not here to please content doesn't
have to be used for technology as long
as something inappropriate you can make
that excite your own not only can you
make it your own and since you're
putting your own hard work into it you
can also make money from it we are
giving you the ability to insert your
own ad code across the banner to make a
few bucks from your hard work we also
realize not everybody knows how to use a
wordpress site who created a series of
tutorials that are going to walk you
through the process on how to do it so
technobuffalo you're getting content
you're getting a social network and
getting the ability to maintain build
and make money from your own sub blog
and occasionally if the content is good
we're going to be taking content from
the sub-block
curing on the main page so another way
for you to get some exposure that you
deserve so go check out this site we've
got a ton of giveaways going on during
launch week we're going to be giving
away a ps3 Xbox soon HD some phones and
