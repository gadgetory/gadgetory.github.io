to you by Linda calm what's up everybody
welcome back just kidding I can talk
again like a normal human being no
Batman math to be found here this week
welcome back to the episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm rios jon rettinger and i
finally have my voice back thank you
guys for dealing with my batman episode
last week i could barely speak fill me
that video is your the only thing i said
for the entire day or trying to save my
voice is so I can film that but we had
some fun of it to thank you guys for
humoring me up this week on ask the
Buffalo we are going to talk about
blackberry messenger on other platforms
some google i/o musings i'm just back
from the show some chromebook of valley
without it's a good value or not we're
gonna talk some driverless cars this is
asked to Buffalo let's let's get asking
first question comes from a man guard
who asks do you think that black braided
the right decision and taking vbm cross
platform I think if blackberry and
thorsten heins the new president thought
that the hardware business perhaps
didn't have a future taking blackberry
messenger cross platform absolutely was
a smart move it adds value as user based
blackberry messenger something that's
called the network good so what network
good means is it's only useful people
are using it like an operating system if
you have a great operating system but
nobody uses it it's not useful so
certainly getting more people on it
increases the value also increases a
potential valuation if perhaps
BlackBerry's looking to sell off assets
in the future I don't think that that's
necessarily the case but certainly might
be an unintended side effect firstly
though I'm excited about blackberry
messenger on iOS and on Android I'll go
doesn't make that much sense from the
hardware side I know a lot of people
were saying great I now no longer have a
reason to carry a blackberry I'll reason
I did in the first place was just to use
BBM and I know there are a lot of you
out there seem like very odd timing
though with two new bb10 devices out in
the q10 and z10 or z10 if you prefer but
I think it's gonna be very interesting
to see and I'm personally I'm excited
let's talk a little bit about iOS one
comes from our friend Josh who asked hey
John what impressed you from google i/o
they shared anything catch you off guard
ur was everything expected first of all
nothing was really expected my
expectations for google i/o weren't even
close I put a joke about Twitter walls
there at the keynote that I should have
just put my whole predictions as a whole
bunch of api's excels really all we gott
not setting api is warren awesome
because a lot of cool stuff i'll talk
about what didn't have the sexy fact
that lash at Google i/o had you know
when people were skydiving onto the roof
and people were mountain biking into the
Moscone Center black through that flash
there was a lot of cool stuff announced
first and I probably the most exciting
is the samsung galaxy s4 with stock
Android now such hundred fifty dollar
price point not so awesome but unlocked
bootloader and freaking stock enjoyed
having to worry about routing as candy
and no routing is up the hardest thing
in the world and putting a custom rom on
there's not a really difficult but first
sort of the average user it's gonna be
really nice so I am super excited about
that and that might be just enough to
pry the HTC One out of my hands the new
Google Maps was also very cool we did a
hole right up
check out on the site but I think they
did an incredible job with that being
able to pay with Gmail news or merging
of maps and google earth was cool
real-time clouds were awesome then going
to see the globe at night it was neat
but certain they did take a lot of nice
steps to remove redundancy and their
platforms really drove things forward
one of the understated things I didn't
get enough attention i think was google
trying to really reduce fragmentation
and the new developer tools you can
actually see a picture of what's gonna
look like a different screen sizes so 4
inches 5 inches tablets is you can make
sure that your applications gonna work
well on all screen size and same just
relying on upscaling so i give them
credit for that as well oasis jan asks
at john for lakers is a Chromebook worth
it so we talked about google i/o just a
few minutes ago and they actually gave
away the topper line Chromebook the
Chromebook pixel which starts at twelve
hundred dollars which is a very
questionable value so we're thinking
about chromebooks you thinking about the
pixel starting at 1,200 bucks going up
to 15 for 64 gigs and LTE no that's not
worth it all if at that price you're
looking at you know surface pro iPads a
ton of other tablets and laptop options
available for that but the lower price
samsung option Chromebooks are
potentially very very appealing also
getting a chance to use Chrome OS it
works very well they can look and feel a
little more desktop OS e you can serve
have that dock in the bottom but all it
does is launch web apps for the most
part and it works well you can access
things offline you can access google
docs offline if you want to do some
editing and writing and all the rest of
to the Google suite of applications but
I don't see use for it I don't know how
I would use it now that being said
you're not me so if you're the person
that is most of their stuff inside a
browser window might do you very well
and for great cheap price point you know
could be a decent option there are lower
price chrome boxes too and maybe on the
used market get something for even a
hundred bucks in which case it might
work out well for you anyway that helped
answer question this one comes from j
keyless f1 at john for lakers you think
driverless cars of the future and will
one day become more popular than non
driverless cars hashtag ask the beat so
you guys know me i have a crush on tesla
um willing to admit it publicly so Tesla
CEO Elon Musk was talking about
driverless cars the rumors that he was
meeting with Sergey Brin from google
Google's coincidentally a investor in
Tesla the speculation was Tesla's
looking to get into driverless cars Elon
Musk a thought said it very well we
don't want to do driverless cars we want
to do cars that can offer autopilot
that's a much better connotation in
driverless cars sort of driverless makes
us feel like robots are gonna be
controlling it tickets anywhere you want
to go autopilot means am tired this
morning put the car auto pilot let it
take me to work but when I'm ready I'll
get behind the wheel again I don't think
it's ever gonna be full automation we're
really you have no options controlling
the card all you'll always have the you
know the capacity to drive like a normal
car if you want i would say that we're
gonna see them hit mainstream sometime
in the next three to four years you
already have served precursors to it
right now got active Lane Assist and I
think BMW Mercedes other manufacturers
offer that'll turn the car for you
things like adaptive cruise control
they'll keep the distance in front of
you in the other car and speed up or
slow depending what you need Volvo's got
cars I can detect pedestrians and stop
for you there's all kinds of autonomous
technology already out there it's matter
putting it all together it certainly
Google leads to be the ones that are
leading that charge so whether you like
it or not driverless cars are coming and
coming very soon but call them autopilot
cuz i think it just sounds better one
