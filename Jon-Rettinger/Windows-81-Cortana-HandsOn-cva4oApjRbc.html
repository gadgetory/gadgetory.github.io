Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo this morning
i just installed windows phone 8.1
Developer Preview its latest release
from Microsoft and I want to walk you
through Cortana and the digital
assistant that Microsoft hopes is going
to compete with Siri and Google now and
other competitors on the market so let's
take a look at how it works alright so
you get started by just tapping court
Anna the icon up there or by hitting the
search button although that's a little
different but i'll show you a court anna
first tap that open it up here she says
top stories for the day so i have it set
up to show me headlines and business
news the weather where I am just Jersey
City here final score for the next and
the Yankees and you can change however
you want those sports teams in your
interests so the daily glance you can
see here I have weather commute and
headlines traffic I haven't set up
because I'm not usually driving that off
in here headlines like I said eat and
drink it'll show me nearby places as I'm
walking around hopefully and then Jets
nets and Yankees are the the sports
teams that I follow trip planner and the
weather near me so you can also add
anything you want if you want to add say
different sports click that search for a
team so you're a mets fan and you could
add the Mets so that's how you customize
Cortana here and there's other options
here remind me quiet hours your inner
circle so there's going to be people
that you're allowed to contact the most
you saw some Hazleton's in there
obviously my wife and my brother music
searches so if you use Cortana to pick
up the music that's playing somewhere
that'll all come in here in your history
so let's so let's see how it works
because that's what you care about most
right so we hit the speaker button here
and what's the weather in New York it's
currently 68 and mostly cloudy York so
really quick there and you bring up a
brings up the weather for you so let's
say yeah give me directions to
Philadelphia okay getting you directions
to Philadelphia
no so it looks like it crashed and keep
in mind this is a beta directions to
Pennsylvania sure thing getting you
directions to Pennsylvania okay so it
looks like that's not working properly
right now I could say other things
though remind me to call John one should
I remind you uh six o'clock sure I'll
remind you to call John at 6pm today is
that right yes great so that's already
added into my calendar now to call John
a six o'clock which is pretty nice we
can go through and do other things too
it's kind of funny i could say uh who's
your daddy no it picked up everything
there who's your daddy technically
speaking that'd be Bill Gates no big
deal alright so there's a couple easter
egg sitting inside Windows Phone 8.1 and
Cortana which is fun too now let me show
you real quick the other search so you
hold down that it brings up Cortana and
you can also speak it right here add
surfing to my calendar for saturday what
time does it get off 10 a.m. what should
I call it surfing sure add Irving to
your calendar or saturday at ten a.m.
alright so it didn't get surfing it said
Irving but you can see you can also
access it right from that search key to
as opposed to hitting the icon and
there's a bunch to talk about in Windows
Phone 8.1 we've got you can see the new
home screen or the backgrounds kind of
see through there the lock screen is not
part of this the customizable lockscreen
theme is not part of the windows phone
8.1 Developer Preview but hopefully
we'll see that soon and actually real
quick you can see Cortana was bringing
up headlines to on the live tile on the
home screen so hopefully we've covered
up a lot of what Cortana offers and
there's a bunch more it can go through
your emails and show you updates on your
package
your travel plans and stuff like that
but again we've only been playing with
it for a little bit this morning we're
going to try to bring you some
comparisons with Siri and Google now any
case that's a quick look at Cortana this
is Todd Hazleton for TechnoBuffalo
