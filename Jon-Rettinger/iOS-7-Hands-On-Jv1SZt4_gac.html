technobuffalo here iOS 7 just made its
debut we've got a first look for you at
the very early beta build of apples
next-generation mobile operating system
let's go and take a look see what it's
got what it doesn't have alright so a
few caveats before we dig into iOS 7
this is the very first beta relief so
there are bound to be some bugs and all
kinds of weird issues here it'll be
coming sometime in the fall for you to
download for your iOS device I'm showing
this one on an AT&amp;amp;T iPhone 5 let's start
with what you see right here this is the
new lock screen there's all kinds of new
things here if I can get it before it
fades away first the picture in the
background you can see Lucy staring at
you if you move the phone around it
looks like it's kind of almost 3d moving
around with you it's interesting effect
not sure if it's going to kill bad or
not and if you can see that same thing
actually on the background of the phone
so you can slide to unlock the same way
and you can pull up here now to access
the control center we'll talk much more
about that so we'll slide to unlock and
look at that things look crazy different
including new animations let me show you
that again you can also slide to unlock
from anywhere now you know to do it
right that little bar on the bottom so
things pop in so those two icons show up
first and then everything else goes
after it those are new animations for
pretty much everything no matter what
you're doing opening up an application
for example closing application there
are all kinds of new animations here and
also new or them icons a lot has been
made about this crazy flat design that
Jony ive was pushing and it's true it's
a flat design the icons are very
different I'm not gonna editorialize
that much he really not i like it or
don't like it cuz not honesty i'm not
sure yet but they are definitely
different and everything that was here
before looks totally strange now the
mail icon safaris different there's a
new app for facetime weather stuff is
just all cons and new here which is kind
of nice i gotta say something new with
iOS settings and we'll talk about that a
little bit later and bodo's so i
mentioned the 3d backgrounds you move
the phone around that's gonna translate
very well on video but it looks like the
picture below the icons is always facing
you feel most see behind the icons
that's what they said on stage
so are the big things here is control
center there are ten key new features
with ios7 control center is one of them
should access it you can swipe up from
the bottom and if you choose you can
access that from the lock screen this is
sort of quick settings that you
jailbreakers have been using for quite a
while so first thing you notice is the
transparency so it sort of overlays the
background there so it sits on top of it
access to all kinds of new stuff you've
got go to airplane mode turn Wi-Fi on or
off Bluetooth go into nighttime mode or
set the rotation lock you got screen
brightness from control your music
airdrop is kind of cool you can airdrop
things so like I'm check you can do on
OS 10 you could do that now with your
phone so that's kind of a cool feature
airplay can access right there for quick
apps you can't change what these are but
least you can access them one of my
favorites right there is flashlight
you've got camera calculator and some
other so that right there is control
center and speaking of centers let's go
into Notification Center so you've got
now a brand a new notification center
you could see much more so for calendar
you can see all kinds of events coming
up stocks you can just see more
information or you can go to today all
or miss if you've got any missed
messages so sort of like widgets but not
quite but you can see more information
at a quick glance so now a notification
center has much more utility so I'm
actually pretty excited about that one
another new one that I'm sort of excited
about tues multitasking is you access it
the same way you just double click the
home button and you get all these icons
you can see what is open or what's not
open and they are true multitasking out
for all apps to close them you just wipe
it off the screen but I do it with one
hand there we go we still don't have
here as a way to close all applications
which I don't understand perhaps we'll
see that come in subsequent beta builds
but close is kind of very satisfying you
could go ahead and wipe that off I know
I've seen that before an OS to swipe
apsa clothes but I just kept put my
finger on which OS it was but you can do
that we also have itunes radio so get
your radio on go ahead and go to your
music app and that's gonna look
different as well you can add a station
and you can listen to pretty much ad
free music if you have a itunes match
account so that's nice it's a radio
we'll go ahead and exit
out of that camera here is different as
well so we'll go ahead and go right into
camera I got a fancy new icon for it and
a fancy new user interface for it as
well as if you want to go into video you
can go into video and anything else
there is the same photo pretty much the
same there as well Square sort of what
use for Instagram you've got kinds of
Instagram e type filters with a
real-time rendering if you want to use
those pano for taking pictures of panos
I guess everything here is sort of the
same as what it was except for square
and the new filters but it's pretty easy
to use and it works actually very well
you can sort of swept through if you
want to control those so that is new for
the camera Safari also got a revamp
didn't just get a new icon so things are
here new a safari as you swipe the
things down below disappear if you tap
they sort of come back or go to the top
of the page so the navigation navigation
down below and as i continue to scroll
they disappear in if you go back up to
the top then they show up again tab the
different as well you can sort of view
them in a new way and you can see what
bookmarks look like they're and other
fun stuff built into the far i lock them
go into full detail everything because
there's so much covered obviously there
are many more features but you want to
give you guys an overview here keyboard
it's also kind of different so here was
a list of things i did bring for recent
trip so i want to add something look at
keyboard so depending on what after your
entry there going to be a black keyboard
or a white keyboard functions the same
just looks new you'll also see the new
fonts here that that are using as well
they're much thinner fonts and sort of
reactions that has been mixed but they
are definitely knew you can see it on
all the text below the icons as well the
jump at the settings here and things are
all kinds of different they're all kinds
of new settings that live here as well
let's jump Notification Center or
control center rather for example so
back to some lock screen on or off top
of the page you'll notice you've got a
back which is fine you always had a back
before but what if you want to go back
without ever tap in that arrow you can
now swipe from the side and go back
which is kind of a neat new feature if
you want to go through all of your steps
at you or get to the window that you are
at you can sort of swype back from the
bezel
on out so that was kind of neat they're
all kinds of other new things here
including mail there's updates to Siri
and now has a male or female voice
though it's not working on my beta so I
can't demonstrate that for you because I
can show you what the interface looks
like at least so what's the weather
there there's a lot more here the more i
use it the more stuff i'm going to learn
so i'm happy to show you what that is
you know get all kinds of new stuff here
calendar everything has been totally
redone and rethought so i think in
particular you guys want to see me cover
in subsequent videos let me know and
i'll be sure to do that male I'm not
gonna show because all my mail is in
there but I love to show you what you
guys want to see so what do you guys
think of iOS 7 you like it do not like
it I would love to hear your thoughts
I'll preview the video a thumbs up we
most definitely appreciate it i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i'll
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
