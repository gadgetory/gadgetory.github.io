gets you what like eight movie tickets
in a candy bar but the folks at Vee have
a $99 smartphone which is hovering
dangerous and close if not below motor
cost to buy like a prepaid phone but is
it any good actually packs a lot of
punch here surprisingly I'm $10 price
point including a fingerprint sensor
octa core Snapdragon 15 two gigs of RAM
and a six inch 1080p display first
impressions to build feels pretty solid
got a metal build around it a soft
plastic back it's got that hollow feel
to it
pretty solid feel to the to the back as
well go and power this guy on and see
with a $99 phone actually going to look
and feel like
so as this guy is booting up let's talk
a little bit about the phone it looks
like any other smartphone if I pick this
up for the first time I would not guess
$99 that's obviously before we test
performance typical capacitive buttons
on the bottom you've got three of them
power button volume up and down and then
your fingerprint sensor lives on the
back so cameras it's got a 13 megapixel
sensor on the back and a 5 megapixel
sensor living on the front screen looks
like a average 1080p display you can
still see a little bit of pixel in but
you're browsing websites playing games
I'm gonna notice much of a difference
here at all digging down inside the box
you've got a Quick Start Guide metro pcs
sim card
wall warts and just a USB cable and that
is all the exciting this that we've got
this guy's still still boone up 2000
years later the phone took about twice
as long as a typical Android phone to
boot up but you figure do that once a
day not that giant deal you can
certainly see the lower resolution
display here this is not the better than
1080p displays but this phone is still
$99 let's see what we've got in the UI
standpoint looks pretty close to stock
Android there's definitely a icon pack
on here based off android 6.0.1 so
you're getting least close to the most
recent version of Android and overall
the phone feels pretty decent
performance seems zippy enough at 615
octa-core processor 2 gigs of ram you're
not going to get you know flagship stuff
here but we're phone you want to use
for a few months or in a few years they
work really well it's got some auto face
detection happening here them taking
pictures my overall pretty impressive
for $99 I will test a little bit more
and sort of see how it holds up and Ken
$99 phone even be an option for a lot of
people you look for the $1,700 galaxy s7
galaxy s7 edges you know you can buy
almost seven of these phones one for
every day of the week so first
impressions seem positive not the
highest red screen not the best-looking
1080p display but bearing in mind for
$99 a pretty good phone especially
almost a disposable phone we just need
one for for a few months and one of the
apps you might want to consider
downloading on your brand-new zmax Pro
might be lyft and if you are a new lifts
user me you don't have the app you never
use it yet
lyft wants to give you $50 in free rides
it's actually break it up into ten
dollars for five rides I hit the link
down below just go to lift TechnoBuffalo
there's no requirement do anything else
you just get 50 bucks and free rides
link and everything will be right down
below check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
