ways like I could I could see you too I
would probably be disgusted until you
put on pants but also I'd ask you to
raise your hand if you're excited for
the galaxy s eight not wager a lot of
hands would go up even iphone loyalists
are kind of curious I think what Samsung
is going to announce we've been covering
the s8 for Otto Tim's like six months
three years about everything that it's
going to be in things that we thought it
was going to be but now we have a
complete picture including release date
announcement date even TechnoBuffalo was
the official site that debut the leak
spec sheet for the essay was almost
identical the SI plus which we're going
to talk about so to summarize all of our
TV news videos we've been doing let me
tell you everything there is to know
about the galaxy s eight so first when
are we gonna hear about it officially so
Samsung really teased the date they're
going to announce the s8 at Mobile World
Congress and it is March 29th so that's
official the rumored release date though
for the phone is later on in April on
the 21st so let's talk about talk about
some specs when I mentioned the specs
for the s8 they are identical for the SI
plus it's different one big difference
screen size the s8 is five point eight
inches and the SI plus would be 6.2 what
same technology same key resolution both
quad HD+ and of course Samsung is really
awesome super amoled panels um
interesting to see how they do that they
should all have the curved display we've
seen with the edge it also looks like
they're going to go the same direction
that LG started with the g6 with that
Nadine by nine or two to one aspect
ratio but that is yet to be seen optics
obviously going to be improved here on
the essay and Samsung I think it's had
some of the best camera modules going
it's not gonna be an exception with the
essay it's going to be a 12 megapixel
dual pixel sensor on the back and an 8
megapixel sensor on the front for
selfies power the guy is going to be a
Snapdragon 835 in probably most markets
if you're lucky enough to get those
Samsung's home-brewed X denotes 88 95
that will be in there as well on a lot
of the Asian
of course it gonna have the iris scanner
built in that we saw with the
now-defunct note 7 ip68 is going to be
on board wireless charging it will have
us bc so all the stuff that we loved
about the note 7 will be here on the
note 8 64 gigs of storage is going to be
standard which we nice to have and of
course that's expandable and four gigs
of ram i think is the one area a lot of
people might sort of not get for we
remember that the ram was going to be as
high as even ate that looks to not be
the case with these line of phones but
not that's gonna affect things or not
we've kind of yet to be seen for should
be plenty uh but perhaps the more RAM is
being saved for the note 8 coming out
later on in the year so in addition to
doing the specs you've also seen the
phone for a bunch of leaked out a friend
ever leaks leaks what looks to be a
press image to folks at BGR should
images the phone on it looks incredibly
thin and close to bezel is not only on
the sides but the top and bottom so
don't know really where the finger
prints that's just going to be here for
rumors that it's the street itself and
maybe it's gonna be just on the back so
I don't know we did see though was an
extra button for Samsung's own UI Bigsby
of course things like Google assistant
should be on board and it should launch
with Android seven-point onew get there
as well so that should be quite nice
perhaps maybe they'll find a way to get
71 on there one big question mark though
with the essay thinks we don't know it
was going to be battery life but you can
wager that it's going to be safe samsung
now has their eighth point battery test
make sure that phone and that battery
are going to be completely safe and no
issues at all i wager is going to come
in though probably between 32 and 34
hundred million dollars and our comment
of the day comes from our top security
tech video it comes from techno state
who says i normally don't pay much
attention to security but that lock got
me locked up it was a locking in control
that tsa approved check out that video
if you want to see if we link it up here
and of course you want to check out
techno state link to his channel down
below it's gonna be the comment of the
day just leave a comment and will
feature you and you get more subscribers
and life can be awesome for you thank
you guys for watching the video a thumbs
up we certainly appreciate it so next
time John
