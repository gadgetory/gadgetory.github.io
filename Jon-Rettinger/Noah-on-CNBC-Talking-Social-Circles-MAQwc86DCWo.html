over Green Mountain but over another g
Google its latest attempt to break into
the world of social networking now it
recently updated what it calls its
social circle networking tool now what
this does if you have a gmail account it
allows you to view the names and social
connections of complete strangers and it
is automatic you don't need to sign up
for it is social circle and invasion of
privacy or as Google simply connecting
dots providing a service it's valuable
to users and you do on your own another
way or if they didn't someone else would
do it instead Noah Kravitz is
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo
Michael furtick is CEO of reputation.com
and an expert on internet security now
let me start with you could you just
explain in very simple English and what
social circle does an example of what it
would do sure errands so um you know as
you said google has sort of been rolling
out these tools for a while and and
their latest update to their social tool
is social search which basically lets
you and this is where you actually do
have choice in the matter if you're
signed in to your Google account you can
choose to connect other social
networking accounts so Twitter Flickr
which is a photo-sharing service coro
which is kind of a question-and-answer
sort of crowdsource knowledge database
product and if you were signed in and
you and I were connected and you did a
search for say awesome bald guys in your
search results you might get back you
know an article with a little tag
underneath it that said Noah Kravitz
tweeted about this yesterday or that
sort of thing so it's it's kind of
connecting the dots like you said but
blending it into what Google does best
which is search results okay all right
so I mean so it's not just in other
words your friend but friends of friends
who know your friends suddenly know what
you said and all of a sudden you people
can see some of the privacy concerns I
guess Michael I mean but but Google's
point would be this is good someone's
going to connect these dots or the
individual person could find this on
their own so they're not doing anything
that violates privacy do you buy it well
I'll tell has had some form of social
search since 2009 they're really trying
to chase Facebook's tail
and so they are still letting people opt
into the searchability so if you have a
Google profile you can link in different
parts of your social profiles you can do
kind of choose in a sense right yeah you
can choose i think that google's on the
risk of the precipice of a big risk
however so so Google the evil the evil
step child version of this story would
be if Google actually opted everybody in
to the Machine by doing a broad search
of the web using their massive index to
connect the dots so that you know the
people at work now know that you're a
big Trekkie or people at work now know
that you're into some kind of
extracurricular activity you don't have
to be enough yes but that's that has not
happened yet and so so they got a big
knock down from the FTC over the google
buzz a few months ago they seem to have
step back from that precipice to be a
little bit more careful right now we
reached out to the FTC which did did
obviously come after them on google buzz
FTC did not did not give us a response
google did which will which will put up
on the screen but Noah how is this
really different then google buzz which
the FTC had a problem with are we now
looking at this latest functionality
being something that the FTC will also
put the clamps on well you know FTC
aside google buzz was a massive fail in
in the public so you know it doesn't
really matter but no i mean i think i
think what you know what you said was a
big if and and the key here is there's
responsibility on the user's end as well
you know basically anytime you sign up
for a service a lot of times or if you
get a new product if you activate a
google android smartphone for that
matter you are linking accounts you are
linking account to potentially depending
on how much you share over share online
a lot of personal information but you
always have to opt in and people need to
be a little bit more careful you know
obviously the company should get a whole
you know rain in the 50-page terms of
services people are trying to read on a
three inch screen but the users have to
be more careful about what they're
signing up for what they're opting into
and especially what they're sharing
online michael is this is this just the
way the world is going to go though I
mean if not Google then fill in the
blank right there is just not gonna be
any privacy out there so so this is what
worries me you're exactly right what
worries me is that we are sacrificing
I think our privacy I think that this is
a moment to actually recognize that
Google has done something that could
threaten our privacy but actually has
given us the option to opt in they have
not opted us in by default a lot of the
social networking sites including the
most famous ones have been opting us in
by default or kind of course sort of
tricking us into opting in and Google is
actually giving us an option here I want
everyone to understand though that if
you do opt into this different parts of
your life that you had no idea we're
going to be connected will now be
connected for anyone to see Google is
still giving us the option on this case
and we should reckon we should applaud
that in this case all right well
