from TechnoBuffalo comm and you know you
don't have to be rich to use a
smartphone these days in fact with metro
pcs you can get unlimited talk text and
web for less than 42 dollars a month I
know I should have been I should have
been lazy I should have walked to the
rich in 40th corner but it's kind of a
weird intersection here and whatever
anyway it's true though you know all
these these contracts with the big four
carriers and stuff and you're paying
seventy eighty dollars or more a month
for your smartphone service
metro pcs is all like no wireless for
all baby this is the new LG Connect 4G
you got to pay a little bit more upfront
it's 349 $30 rebate so it's 319 direct
from MetroPCS after rebate with free
shipping but you can get service for as
little as $40 a month unlimited talk
text and web you can go up to $60 a
month for the unlimited everything with
all the the unlimited multimedia
streaming they'll call it it's kind of
like throttling data cap we'll get to
that in a second but the thing is what
do you get for your 319 and you're less
than $42 a month is it worth it there's
only one way to find out
alright so just as an aside I happen to
be near a church here on the corner of
Richmond 42nd and this is an awesome
sign I'm not this is not a pro or
against you know Bible study I just like
that they say we offer free technical
support every Sunday at 10:00 a.m. that
folks is marketing alright so here it is
Wireless for all the LG Connect 4G just
out from MetroPCS it's an Android phone
obviously made by LG you're not gonna
get the latest version of Android it's
gonna run Gingerbread but what you get
here is you get a 4-inch display that we
might have to take out of the direct
sunlight here for you to really see
4-inch display you've got a dual-core
processor a 1.2 gigahertz dual core it's
metro pcs is first dual-core it's LTE
compatible although metro pcs is LTE
speeds are not in the range of Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T you're gonna get more like 3G
maybe WiMAX speed it's got dual cameras
you've got a 5 megapixel camera on the
back with 720p video capture then you've
got a front-facing camera for your video
chat type needs also up on top here you
got a headphone jack there's your power
switch on the side rocker switch micro
USB port on the bottom not much to see
there on the other side not much to see
there on the front you've got four
capacitive touch buttons your standard
Android layout the phone itself you know
it's a it's not the slimmest not the
lightest thrown out there for sure but
it feels pretty solid in the hands and
it says out of the direct sunlight
because you know it's not really fair to
right to pick this phone you know
against the competition in the direct
sunlight because not really anything
compares does although on the direct
sunlight it's get out of the direct
sunlight here alright so also in the Box
you get your manuals you get a travel
adapter your AC power adapter and your
USB cable so pretty standard stuff bring
your own headphones that kind of thing
but again looking at the specs here
you've got 720 720 HD recording off
point to it to give it her still core
processor we talked about a full gig of
ram the LG nova display with gorilla
grass gorilla glass on it which is good
don't be mobile you know kind of all the
standard stuff and a 2 gigabyte microSD
card
installed all right a little bit easier
to seen out of the direct sunlight in
the car just moving all around it's
man-on-the-street style here but you
know this is wireless for the people
right so Matt on the street makes sense
anyway I who display 4-inch it's a
4-inch Nova display LG's display so you
know not in the not in the range of the
super top-of-the-line super LCD to and
Super AMOLED and all that stuff but not
a bad display full gig of ram inside
here comes pretty loaded with a 2
gigabyte microSD card as well so if you
really want to load this thing up with
storage space you're gonna have to bring
your own card to the party but otherwise
you know you've got Android going on
like we said the LG skin on here a
little bit let's go to settings I mean
not a little as the LG skin is just not
a super heavy-duty skin I'll go to
settings here go to about phone and
confirm we're running two point three
point six and you can see right now I'm
in I'm an e video man F dual and I'm not
in the LTE Lance we're gonna have to
find some LTE compatibility LTE service
area to test out the LTE speeds but like
I said metro pcs people are reporting
more in the range of you know maybe 1 to
4 Meg's down that kind of thing some
more like 3G or even sprint WiMAX speeds
not the super fast speeds people are
getting from AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon but
looking at the phone comes with a bunch
of stuff pre-installed
you've got the Rhapsody application so
it's metro pcs for $60 a month you can
get full unlimited everything including
the LTE support and including unlimited
wraps that he's streaming so you know
you're looking at comparison that'll
cost you $10 a month on its own so
you're looking at what 50 bucks a month
for the service if you don't look at it
that way which still is a good deal much
less than what you would pay on Sprint
or Verizon or what-have-you let's go to
the camera we'll take a picture because
it will last longer why do I like saying
that so much I don't know here we'll
take a picture of the fake leather dash
in the car here and so your camera
options you know we can
which to the video mode go back here to
settings get your full HD 720p all that
good stuff if we go back to will go to
front-facing and if we go front-facing
now can we capture video in front of
facing you have VGA and then hi
everybody hey everybody how you doing
then if we turn it around to camera mode
VGA as well and we'll go back and flip
and so the camera itself the main camera
you got your up to 5 megapixels there
get rid of it they wanted to do here is
I'm actually going to customize this
phone and see you know if I put I get
this hooked up as just a stock Android
device and set it up the way I want and
get rid of you know some of the
bloatware stuff and then put on some of
my own stuff that you know customized
launcher all that kind of thing I'm
really curious to see if I could live
with a phone like this because when
you're looking at you know something
like forty even fifty dollars a month as
opposed to you know up around 84
something like an iPhone with unlimited
messaging that kind of stuff you know
let's all bet that's that's roughly half
price depending on which level II a
little bit more than half price but
still about thirty forty percent off and
over the course of two years that's
gonna add up to let's say it's $30
cheaper a month you know times twelve
months for a year is 360 times two years
seven hundred twenty dollars which you
know that's that's nothing to sneeze at
unless you live at the corner of rich
and rich so definitely something worth
checking out and that's what I'm going
to do you know kind of thumbing through
here but it's pretty pretty standard
stuff and go to Rhapsody I have to get
the app yeah
all right whatever this is the stuff you
have to deal with when I you know you
buy a well I mean you buy a high-end
phone from anybody these days pretty
much unless it's a nexus or an iPhone
and you're gonna get bloatware on there
you buy a mid-range phone on the cheap
from MetroPCS you got more blow air to
deal with but look I just get rid of it
yeah all right I'm gonna get connected
it's the connect 4G from LG and metro
pcs thanks to the folks metro pcs were
sayings to me and I'm still I'm excited
honestly to check this thing out because
it's really you know the phones these
days are the spec sheets
I mean dual cores and quad cores and all
that race to the top and everything but
you know unless you're playing like
wireless gaming how much that can really
take advantage I don't know but one
thing on the spec sheet everybody can
relate to is the price tag so that's
what I'm investigating spec sheet wise
will have much much more on the LG
connect 4G and the power of metro pcs
LTE network or the lack thereof over on
TechnoBuffalo calm until next time I'm
gonna get out of the car and edit this
video I'm Noah we'll see you later
bye-bye
