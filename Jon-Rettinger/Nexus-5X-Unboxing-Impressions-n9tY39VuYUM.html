style it just comes back and that's true
here with the Nexus 5
it's a few year old phone designed by LG
people absolutely loved it and Google
listened and they partnered with LG
again
to bring us the Nexus 5x I'm John Reggie
from TechnoBuffalo let's go ahead and
unbox this guy so first thing you're
gonna notice is a brand new Nexus X logo
that's got the X emboss and it's gonna
get a see-through picture of a beach
there it's gonna be available in
different prices and colors either
carbon quartz or ice starting at 379
bucks for a 16 gig version or 429-432
although I'm not sure what color or size
Google sent us what type of you guys
watch this video I'll been using this
phone for about three days so hey future
John let's go ahead and slide this
sucker I'll run through all the specs
highlighting it though of course is
Android 6.0 marshmallow I got that same
X logo right there go ahead and take off
the top here again we've got that same
logo I've got a little bits about the
device showing you the USBC cable which
this does ship worth where the sim
removal card is and stuff and here is
the phone upside down it looks like the
folks at Google probably popped in a SIM
card here for us and here is the Nexus 5
I've had a chance take a look at it the
launch event a few weeks ago and came
away really impressed with it push it
off the side just real quickly we'll run
through the rest of the stuff inside of
the box so try Google Play Music for 90
days on us so there's that we can do
that inside of here we've got sim
removal tool and a booklet safety
warranty guide LG brand wall wart and a
USBC cable it's USB C and USB C so this
wall were I imagine is indeed USB C push
all itself off this side let's turn on
the phone I'm gonna run you through all
the specs everything you need to know
about the next five as this guy's
putting up let's run through the phone
itself on the left hand side that's
where your SIM card is going to live it
is a nano SIM and of course compatible
with Google's Project Phi as well in the
right hand side there is your power and
lock button and your volume up and down
on the top just a noise cancelling mic
on the bottom USB C noise
cancelling mic and 3.5 millimeter
headset jack the phone is really light
it weighs 136 grams power this guy is a
snapdragon 808 processor it's clocked at
one point in gigahertz it's a hexa core
and 64-bit it's got the audrina 618 GPU
onboard as well 2 gigs of ram again
storage is going to be there 16 or 32
you are looking at a 5.2 inch screen
it's 1920 by 1080 it's LCD and as a PPI
of 423 I gave me this guy scratch proof
from your clumsy fingers is Gorilla
Glass 3 the camera on the back is a
twelve point three megapixel it's got an
F 2.0 aperture Creek or 4k video at 30
frames per second and it does have laser
assisted autofocus so should focus very
fast but of course we will test it and
it's got a dual LED flash right there as
well twenty seven hundred million power
battery and again USB type-c it does
have fast charging Google and LG say
I'll get up to three point eight hours
of use from only 10 minutes of charging
so pretty impressive there as well so on
the back you've got the LG logo a big
Nexus and blazoned across the back a
very reminiscent of the original Nexus 5
although this circle is not just a
little dimple for your finger it is
actually a fingerprint reader which is
nice be able to unlock your device use
it for Android pay and I just added
additional security so that's there as
well I'm not sure how it's gonna form on
the back of its gonna be hard to find
your finger there enough but we'll test
it and find out in addition to launching
two new phones the 5x and the 6p Google
is also launching Nexus protect you can
pick up for about 69 bucks they'll
protect your phone and if something
happens to it get you a new one or at
least a refurbished one sent out to you
I'm gonna go ahead and set up the device
and they'll come right back alright so
we've got this guy all set up we've done
a few videos on Android 6.0 marshmallow
but a few highlights first is dough so
it's gonna essentially power down apps
we use in the background it's gonna be
specially useful if you keep your phone
on while you're sleeping or if apps
aren't being used they're not gonna
drink nearly as much battery and in our
testing it's really improved battery
life also now on tap we get access to
Google now information inside of apps is
also really useful
first impressions though this phone
feels almost identical to the original
Nexus 5 which to say it feels great
close your eyes can't tell difference
mean which one you're holding either the
5x or the Nexus 5 another thing I want
to mention you've got front firing
speakers on here as well which shouldn't
make audio it sounded really good and I
some people might have worried about the
1080p screen versus say the wqhd on the
6p but the display here looks great and
the trade-off of giving away those
pixels you're gonna get pretty solid
battery life here as well I had a 27
million power pack so if you're worried
about the screen I wouldn't be too
worried about it here it looks really
nice on the 5x but of course we'll test
it and we'll see what else this phone is
all about anything you guys want seemed
particular be sure to let us know and
don't you recover in the comments before
we do our full review but I can use
phones for a while before we do that so
again let us know and I will test it for
you until next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys in
the next video bye oh no big deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
