technobuffalo calm here at the talk
sunlight challenge we're going to be
talking to some people and we're going
to let them pit their smartphones
against the qualcomm toq smartwatch i
might be a little biased but I think I
think the talk is going to win okay i
have austin here i'm gonna take the talk
sunlight challenge so let's see your
phone so let's compare and contrast my
tox screen to your yep right in the
sunlight how are you feeling about that
depends on the glare they see yeah
that's a lot better you want to take the
talk so my challenge come over here come
over here i'm gonna compare my talk to
your phone let's see your home screen
which one do you think looks better my
gosh the clarity on this one's 10 times
better than mine I'm pretty sure your
screen is still off so it's on I can see
the time it's 12 12 I can't see anything
I'm missing hey guys come over to the
cool come over to the boom are you even
seeing Matt Chilton at a certain angle
so is there like it's it sort of like a
special like you have to do like almost
a little dance to get it to work right
so the qualcomm toq smartwatch we're
going to talk sunlight challenge super
awesome who do you want to make any bets
now as to which Oh anything's better do
you think your phone might beat the talk
probably not that's I look pretty dark
yep that's pretty brave it is very
bright Oh is your is that on the top
setting you have the most brightness yep
man how are you even seeing that thing
how do you read your phone you wanna do
it on camera I'm sure you hear that a
lot in Vegas here's the talk okay
alright looks pretty good pretty pretty
clear you got yours exclude there's a
lot of glare on your phone yeah so now
if you turn it at an angle let's turn
sideways which one do you think looks a
little a little better that's it's
impressive yeah the watch is much better
let it down you got your sunglasses on
it's bright out today so
that's amazing you can't see anything on
my phone looks pretty good yeah it does
let's forget let's turn it may be for
for visibility this way we're in bright
sunlight well I try to easier to see
watches yeah now do you think that is
how do you think that technology works
uh I don't know different from my iphone
non-scientific answer i love it those
are my favorite answers cool so so what
do you think of the mirasol display it's
good it's a good answer so you do have
all my contact information so if you
could just take all my appointments for
the rest of the day and do all of my
work for do all of my work that would be
fantastic well that is the talk some
light challenge I think it's pretty
obvious who the winner is I mean I don't
think I saw any screens that looked
better than this not not really no not
even my own phone screen which is a kind
of a bummer but you know what hey i have
a talk and those people did not so i
think i would like to crown myself the
winner for the day along with the talk
that's the sunlight challenge you can
always check out more information at
