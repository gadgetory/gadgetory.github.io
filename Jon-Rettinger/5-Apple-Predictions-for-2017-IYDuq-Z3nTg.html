about predictions for a ton of companies
Apple included and I was pretty close
you didn't see that video will link it
up here and down below but I am bringing
my six cents back to give you five
predictions for 2017 for Apple and I
left off the low-hanging fruit here
things like we'll see SPAC upgrades
we'll see new iPads the iPhone is
included in the list but for a very
special reason let's get let's get
mind-bending first we're not going to
have an iPhone 7s 2017 we're going to
March the ten-year anniversary of the
very first iPhone think we're gonna skip
the s and jump right to the 8th these
are going to usher in three different
models see the traditional upgrade cycle
we've seen for the 4.7 inch 5.5 inch but
the big change is that third phone while
we don't with the screen size are going
to be we due to the technology in that
screen is going to be OLED and the back
is going to be covered with glass as of
course the front is going to be as well
edge to edge display on this phone which
means we're not going to have an touch
ID button anymore it's gonna be
integrated right into the display itself
as will the front-facing camera and
another big addition we could expect at
the iPhone 8 finally wireless charging
Thank You Apple for giving us wireless
charging it's been it's been way way too
long
number four Apple's going to play the
Grim Reaper and kill two of their
products MacBook Air and I hate to say
it folks the iPod line Nostalgia be
damned
nostalgia is not going to pay the bills
time for those two to go the way of the
dodo
I thought the MacBook Air Lines gonna be
dead last year it looks like a lame duck
even more now that the MacBook exists
and the new MacBook Pros are out we've
got last gen display you've got three
generations to go design but really
horrible looking bezels this thing
doesn't fit in Apple's lineup anymore
unexpected the MacBook to go a little
bit upscale to fill that gap where the
MacBook Air used to be and we could just
pour one out for the poor iPod ask
yourself when the last time you bought
an iPod was or one last time you know
someone who actually bought an iPod was
the only reason I could see anybody
buying one nowadays
is maybe for their kid but phones have
become iPods and the iPod as we know it
is done perhaps an email live on another
type of product but it's done
number three so they might be taken away
but new things are coming in the form of
accessories Apple wouldn't just release
MacBook Pros with the touch bar without
some accessories as well we're going to
see a brand new wireless keyboard with a
touch bar built in that you say Wireless
and I'm also gonna go out on even
crazier limb and say it's even gonna
have a number pad and it's going to be
Wireless so that should be nice to have
but it should bring nicely sync up with
a brand new iMac that we're also going
to have in 2017 that's not part of the
rumors that's like I was like a bonus
new accessories we're also going to
touch ID enable things we'll have touch
ID navel Magic Mouse and touch ID
enabled Magic Trackpad
comunit number two a brand new product
line for Apple Apple's notorious for
seeing new industries seeing new trend
stay on the sidelines so they mature and
releasing their products this is going
to be true with the home speakers we've
seen things like the Amazon echo with
Alexa Google jump in the fourth Google
home Apple is going to be jumping into
this battle feet-first with I don't know
Apple Apple home Siri at home
smart Siri Siri now one of those things
you'll have a Siri enabled standalone
device they could put into your home and
the number one prediction that I think
maybe folks aren't seeing coming it's a
rumor that we saw last year I think we
are finally going to see come to
fruition
iMessage for Android and before you yell
at me why would Apple do that it makes
no sense why the people are going to
switch hear me out just just hear me out
Apple has a chance to own messaging not
just own messaging on Apple's platform
there is iMessage for Android yes people
would switch and people have certainly
buy less apps for iOS they'd be using
different platform but owning messaging
would create so much value for the
company I think would almost balance it
out I mean look at what BlackBerry's did
with bbm they spun it off and now with
its own valuable platform companies have
been trying to get a piece that
messaging platforms you can google do it
without lo and duo would imagine one app
message all of your friends with
I think that's what Apple is going to
finally do the own messaging they'll
perhaps be advertising based inside of
the Android version to make up for that
lost revenue but I think owning that
from top to bottom
OS OS give me the first of many times
we're gonna see Apple start to play nice
with other operating systems so
obviously there are a lot more things
that could have predicted and things
that probably would been way easier to
predict but I wanted to keep you guys
some little bit exciting so things from
OLED phones touch bar enabled keyboards
the finally be able to message your
friends in blue who are on Android but
one prediction for next year that I know
is going to come true that you're going
to want to save a little bit of cash one
of the best ways to do that is on your
phone bill and the folks from ping have
you covered they have this crazy idea
where maybe you shouldn't be paying for
the data that you're using starting at
like $10 per gigabyte if you don't use
it you just don't pay for it if you
don't believe me go to TechnoBuffalo
