to you by domain.com what's up everyone
jon rettinger from technobuffalo here
and welcome dear friend back to the
episode of ask the buffalos the show
where i answer whatever questions you've
got one of the technology things that
are going on in the world don't know
what phone to get question about a new
tech this is where you ask it let's go
ahead and jump right in the first
question comes from victor PS one who
asks at john for lakers NFC deal breaker
or not and you could see the big like
subtext of 1 plus 2 there I'm not gonna
lie I was shocked when the oneplus 2 was
announced without NFC I had a chance to
talk to their co-founder Carl pay who
essentially said we don't think people
are going to care until the following
year why don't you agree to screw with
that will turn whether or not probably
you buy the phone for me though
personally it's not a deal breaker but
it's definitely an annoyance especially
with Android pay coming sometime in the
next few months hopefully becoming more
mainstream I like to have the option to
use it without I do or not think it
should be my choice I not having you two
certainly annoying I wouldn't buy or not
buy a phone based on NFC but that's just
me our next question comes from jl 363
who asks at john for lakers will you
have anyone else do on camera videos
that is not you or mark probably not
next our friend Alex underscore sanchez
241 ass at john for lakers which phone
are you most excited about note 5 or s6
edge+ we're sure the s6 edge plus i love
the galaxy s6 edge I thought it was too
small a bigger version of that would
make me a very happy fellow I love the
curve a detailed way the phone felt I
cannot wait for that phone to get an
ounce I'm so excited about the note 5
but it's definitely Danford by what I
think the s6 edge+ is going to be but
what about you guys are you more like
edge purists you care more about the s
pen and perhaps longer battery life or
you just all about the style you
couldn't tell clearly all about the
style we stop real fast and thank our
peeps at domain.com it's a place to go
when the next great idea hit you like in
the middle of the night to one-stop
shopping for all your domain name and
web hosting email
leads the main comm wants to hook you up
with a pretty sick aw for say twenty
percent on domain names and web hosting
would use coupon code technobuffalo it's
all one word and caps at domain comms
check out when you think domains think
domain.com all things gizmo asks at john
for lakers what do you think about apple
trying to bring their own phone service
to the public this is a rumor that hit
earlier this week we heard kind of
grumblings about it for the past few
years the story goes like this Apple is
looking to develop an apple sim which is
sort of seen in the iPads right now but
if she what that's going to do or the
idea behind it is you can choose what
carrier you want to be on and you'll
just pay apple a set fee at the month or
Apple will determine it for you that's
similar what Google is doing with
project x so you probably use your phone
and using the best experience from what
you expect to be TNT t-mobile Verizon
and Sprint without you really knowing
even what carrier on Shelly the best
experience matter where you go they'll
pay apple a set fee and you're on your
way and apple and turn pay the cure for
the network being used I don't
necessarily see this happening for AT&amp;amp;T
or Verizon but for tmobile explain it
makes sense so way to get people on
their network that maybe aren't right
now let's get revenue streams those
people that might already be on 18 tea
or verizon we saw that sort of transpire
with Google product by I think it's
gonna be the same thing with Apple if it
ever comes to market although I would
love to be able to have the best of all
four major US carriers I would be quite
a very happy fellow if you want to know
what cure I'm on h2 the whole video
about my past 12 months switching
between AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and t-mobile to
find the best one for me i will link
that over here and down below if you
guys want to change hey thank you guys
for watching if you enjoyed i love
answering your questions please keep
them coming it's one of my favorite
parts of the week we just get a chance
to talk tech until next week i'm joe
anderson technobuffalo dr. guys soon Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
