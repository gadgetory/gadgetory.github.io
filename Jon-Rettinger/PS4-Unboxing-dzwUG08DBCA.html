TechnoBuffalo here it's been just about
a decades I could say let's unbox a
brand new Playstation I've got the
fourth iteration of Sony's console right
here and I am itching to open this
sucker up let's go ahead and see it the
PlayStation 4 is all about so here is
the box for the PlayStation 4 it is
sitting right there and it's black
coloring you've got the brand new
controller that is the Dual Shock 4 and
that is about it so with the PlayStation
4 it only comes in one variety that is a
500 gigabyte flavor but you can replace
internal hard drive which will show you
guys how to do a little later I will use
this is a big unboxing senior stabby to
cut this tape ceremoniously I am very
excited the PlayStation is undercutting
the Xbox one by about a hundred bucks
but does not come with the PlayStation
camera put new PlayStation hi so here is
the box it's going take a look at that
console first we're gonna have a ton of
ps4 coverage including set up we're
going to go over the controller in much
more detail well show you guys how to
replace the hard drive and a ton of
other stuff so we've got cardboard now
on the side I don't have any more
styrofoam so more friendly for the
environment pull this out and here is
the PlayStation 4 looking very sleek
much lighter than I thought it was going
to be I'll push that off to the side for
one quick second I will come back to you
I promised my friend here is the new
dual shock for I've never been a big fan
of how the previous dual shocks felt but
this one feels really really good I've
always preferred the Xbox controller but
now it's pretty much even for which
controller feels better everything here
has been redone actually a walk you guys
through the whole deal but you've got
redesigned analog sticks new triggers
you've got a touchpad you got a glowy
light that the ican camera keep track up
to tell where you're at
you've got built-in microphone an
auxiliary port for something that's
going to come later
you've got share and options button
built right in this new controller feels
really really really good so if you get
we're like me weren't the biggest fan
and the older controller definitely want
to try this you might really enjoy the
new controller here else in the box
probably nothing too exciting
special offers for games welcome to
PlayStation and you've got a microphone
which kinda nice depart deranged the
controller with the built-in mic so you
can yell at the 13 year olds they beat
you I've got a way to charge your
controller just charges via microUSB
power cord no power brick it is built
into the console like the last
generation which I really liked it so he
did and they are including a HDMI cable
which is very nice last generation did
not do that it would appear that Sony
learned a lot of lessons from the ps3
launch so let me throw that box off to
the side let's take a look at the
console it is pretty nice so might be
asking yourself John where's the power
button it is hidden right there is a
touch sensitive button that you just
touch and the power turns on below that
is an eject button for the slot load
disk right there and that is of course
still blu-ray to USB ports I believe
those are USB 3.0 they've got all the
sort of logos on the side HDMI DTS Dolby
and blu-ray on the back though here's
where all your i/o is going to live
that's obviously power that's your
optical audio HDMI Ethernet of course is
built-in Wi-Fi and then I believe that
is an auxilary port as well our next
door to looks like a chubby USB port so
it's been a very first look and unboxing
at the PlayStation 4 you might be
thinking you want to put it like this
and it'll stay like that but Sony will
happy to sell you a stand they'll sort
of keep a little bit more stable it's a
little bit wobbly
other than that though it's a really
nice looking console I'm excited to
power this sucker up and get my next-gen
game on we're gonna have a ton of
