to you by gamefly welcome back to their
pisode of a rumor roundup I'm rose jon
rettinger and there's so many tech
rumors that come out seemingly every
hour that it's hard to keep track of
them all fortunately you've got the
folks here at TechnoBuffalo do that for
you and you've got to this show we round
up is the show where we take all the
tech rumors from the week we condense
them smash and bash them into one tech
show awesomeness for you up this week in
the obvious category Apple's iPad 5 is
gonna go on a diet Sony's big humped
camera phone at Sir Mix locks gonna love
is showing up in leaked photos
BlackBerry's a10 they're bigger I guess
you'd call phablet type phone is showing
up more note three prototypes are
leaking out those stories and more up
this week on rumor roundup Apple's iPad
5 is to be thinner captain obvious
Apple's expected to unveil its
fifth-generation iPad sometime between
now and the fall and the Refresh tablet
is all but sure to sport a similar 9.7
inch 2048 x 1536 246 ppi display same as
its predecessors so not much expected to
change with the ipad 5 this is a few
small subtle ones expected to get iOS 7
literally right out of the box you take
it out and boom iOS 7 in your face didja
times the ever reliable source reports
that new iPad will reach ER GF to touch
screen technology manufactured by Taiwan
d supplier tpk and the familiar Foxconn
subsidiary G is this new tech should
allow Apple to produce a thinner and
lighter tablet which should be awesome
hopefully that'll filter its way down to
other Apple devices so didja time
stories are always fun it's like I could
sit here I can put an article that's
saying you can mark my word there's
going to be an iphone 6 sometime or the
next decade take to the bank there's for
sure gonna be an iphone 6 coming up
these stories certainly have a grain of
truth to them but i'm not sure who their
sources are so take that forward it's
worth obviously it's gonna be thinner
probably going a little bit lighter
thinner bezel and iOS 7 the big story in
the big rumored whether or not the iPad
Mini is going to have a Retina Display
new alleged photos of sony's upcoming
20-megapixel smartphone which now oddly
seems like a low megapixel account now
with
20s out have surfaced further showing
that an extra camera bump looking at you
Lumia 1020 is not always necessary
judging from pictures Tony's new handset
is keeping you slim profile despite the
rumor 20 megapixel Exmor sensor being
included it looks a lot like a couple
days xperia z which we've seen reviewed
kind of loved and recently just launched
on t-mobile or the report from this
month revealed advice may come equipped
with a xenon flash just pretty awesome a
little also surface regarding some of
these mysterious handset one thing that
remained constant though is the devices
slim profile despite that big ol shooter
in the back well best salumi as 41
megapixel sensor that is gonna be a fun
a battle to do new BlackBerry a10 images
have surfaced so we've seen the device
really quietly pop-up few times before
but these are perhaps the best pictures
other device we've seen yet without
straying too far from design that
Blackberry introduced in the z10 the
company's larger a10 looks more refined
may typically to highlight the company's
blackberry 10 OS on just a nice big
screen which makes sense again I so s
but on a big screen general
specifications we don't really know yet
we've had it hurt though it might come
with a super 5 inch AMOLED display with
720p I dual-core processor and now seems
like a paltry 8 megapixel shooter so 810
thumbs up some sort of just like me
sideways want to hear your thoughts
leave them in the comments that are
located in your pants region Samsung is
expected to unveil their next-generation
galaxy note smartphone either just
before or during IFA in September and of
course we'll be there oh you imagine
though that means the device already
being tested somewhere inside of
Samsung's lab so it's no surprise was
riding to see some of these leaks tech
kitty recently posted two photos and
some benchmarks for the device including
one that runs the Snapdragon 800
processor one with Samsung's own exceed
knows 5420 phone looks super angular
very weird right now but it's probably
because it's just a prototype and
probably just a shell with the actual
hardware inside of it the phone also
expected to pack a 13 megapixel camera a
pretty nice 5.7 inch full HD display
which is bigger than the 5.5 we got
right now I'm 41 and excited about it I
love me some big phones the mega was
probably a little bit too bit but five
point seven inches with plenty of room
in my do jeans without making you look
like I'm trying to compensate so I'm
excited for the galaxy note 3 so let me
