technobuffalo here today april eighth
Steve Jobs took the stage in cupertino
california to announce iphone OS 4.0
with a ton of new features so let me go
ahead and jump into everything he went
over to see me look down and because I'm
looking at some notes this conference
just ended so we started off by talking
about the ipad naturally since it just
launched so they'd sold 300,000 the
first day and 450,000 up until today
which is a huge milestone that's even
before the 3g model was released said
over 3.5 million apps per box for the
ipad and over 4 billion total apps which
is just incredible especially we
consider maybe in 99 cent average price
point apple just printing money with
this app store model okay so now on to
OS 4.0 over 1500 new developer api s
including a camera access quick look
access in f SMS and calendar access so
developer api is are fine what about the
features end-users going to get well
there are over 100 new features in OS
four point oh and let's get to some of
the smaller ones they'll go over it sort
of the larger ones afterwards so you now
have tap to focus video so in your
courting video tap the screen it will
start to focus just like it does on the
3gs you now can customize a background
on the home screen and the lock screen
just like you can on the ipad you now
have access to Bluetooth keyboards you
can connect and type away there's now a
built in spell check application sort of
worked its way into native apps like
throws on the ipad as well and now
you're going to get a five times digital
zoom which is quite nice the iphones
admitted missing any sort of digital
zoom built into the camera app so
that'll be a very welcome addition so
enough for the little features let's
talk about the big ones and they started
off by breaking it into seven big
services and seven big features let's
talk about the seven big services first
number one and the
biggest biggest thing that's found this
way 20 X four-point-oh is multitasking
and this isn't just some sort of fancy
app switching this is actually true
multitasking is finally coming to the
iPhone platform I hope you heard me
correctly finally multitasking all you
do you double tap the home screen the
pull up an application launcher you pick
what you want and it'll launch the
application right in the background they
didn't say how many you could run in the
background but Steve Jobs did flip
through more than 60 at least that is
the limited number that you can run and
these truly run in the background so you
can have ton of applications going at
the same time which has a lot of other
uses as I'm going to talk about right
now so first background audio you can
now let's say run pandora in the
background while you're browsing the web
or doing something else or any other
application that plays audio and now be
able to run in the background quite nice
next voice over IP in the background
which means you can now use skype which
will work over 3g run that in the
background and you can still receive
regular calls receive skype calls and
receive skype SMS as well and regular
info and SMS is so you'll have access
really everything right on your phone
which is really cool I've be able to run
skype in the background and something a
feature that I've really been looking
forward to so if your access to 3g or
Wi-Fi go ahead and make your skype
called without any problem next is a
background location which is a big one
for me so I get lost going anywhere I
can now have my gps applications running
in the background so if I'm navigating
to a restaurant and a phone call comes
in i'll be able to make the phone call
and also be able to hear left turn in 10
feet or if i'm listening to music and
I've got my ipod playing it'll still
tell me left turn and 10 feet which is a
really really welcome feature also the
background notification locations also
can be used for geolocation applications
things like loot but if you want to opt
out of those you're going to have new
privacy settings on your phone
so any application you have that asks
for your location you turned off so you
know to broadcast to the world that
you're going to the bathroom hello some
people like to do that next you've got
push notifications nothing really fancy
here and not coming off of Apple servers
anymore so a lot of other applications
of accents to push notifications also
now get local notifications so if you
want ESPN for example to send you sort
of a message when your team wins or
loses are at the quarter you can now do
that and the last one sort of pretty
cool is task completion so if you're
uploading a picture to Flickr uploading
a video to YouTube you can run that in
the background then let that upload
while you're doing something else
previously if you wanted upload a video
to YouTube you got actually leave your
phone on and not do anything else if it
locked or you lost your web application
the upload would stop that is no longer
the case and go ahead and let it run in
the background and do whatever else you
like which is quite nice they didn't say
what a drain on battery this is going to
be for the end user but at least it's
going to be your choice for how you use
your phone in your battery if you use a
lot of applications running in the
background you know you're better luck
isn't going to be as good I know you
maybe you're going to experience a
processor slow down that's just the way
it goes released now the consumer has
the choice to run applications in the
background which I'm certainly in favor
of all right let's go ahead and move on
to some of the big new features the
first really big new features folders
which is pretty cool in the feature
essentially essentially what you do is
you take an icon you drag it tilts up
doing so little jiggly dance you drag it
over another icon and that creates a
folder now it'll do something called
smart dating if they're two games will
name the folder games or you can name it
whatever else you'd like simple folder
application it turns sort of one icon
into a stack of look and I comes which
makes it a lot easier to sort of manage
everything that you're doing you from so
before you can only have 180
applications on your iPhone now you can
have two thousand to 160 so Apple is
going to be making a ton more money from
folders it seems like a feature they
probably should have had a while ago
especially looking at that number so for
180 applications the 2100
see that is crazy the next feature one
that I really needed and liked was
unified inbox previously if you wanted
to use your iPhone or iPod Touch or iPad
to manage multiple email accounts get a
switch accounts it was a huge pain in
the butt now all those come into one
account and they also now come with
threaded messaging if you'd like you can
turn that on or off sort of saves all
your e-mails back and forth in a
conversation you also can now open
attachment with any related application
so for on the iPad for example and you
get a word document you can choose open
that up in pages or you can open it up
and another related view or if you've
got a special PDF viewer choice you can
open it up in that application not
limited to what Apple tells you you have
to do you now have the choice with
swords it seems to be the theme with OS
4.0 the next feature Apple included with
ibooks on the iPhone or iPod touch
whoopty-doo if you want to read the
books it will wirelessly sync up though
with your iPhone in your iPad or other
device using I books with sort of like
Kindles whispersync the other new
features added were some developer
features nothing terribly exciting right
there you can now have more than one
exchange account which is kind of nice
they're using exchange server 2010 and
new VPN options but one of the other
cool new features are sort of previewing
right now is called Game Center I think
of it like Xbox Live or playstation
network for your iphone ipod touch or
ipad you're going to have achievements
leaderboards game matchups I'll just
really cool the I devices have a ton of
games up there nice or have a platform
where you compete with friends yeah
you're doing against each other set up
matches be able to get your sort of
online play on if I were Nintendo
Microsoft and Sony I would be very
worried while the quality of the games
and the length of the game and the
graphics really don't compare to
portable and dedicated home consoles
fact that there are so many games these
devices are in so many people's hands
and the games are less expensive make it
a very valuable turn ative I know
personally I took a long flight overseas
I thought about maybe picking up
PSP or DS lite but i just downloaded
games for my iphone instead it was a lot
easier was more expensive but i was able
to tape myself for a 12-hour flight and
i assume that i'm not the only one so
the next sort of feature if you want to
call it that apple launched lead a
nobody surprise as a new feature called
i ad and the new advertising network
that they are launching with application
developers previously if you wanted to
put an ad in your application it was
pretty much a static banner you clicked
it took you to the advertisers web page
and that was the extent of it a lot of
people and a lot of developers want to
keep their applications free and sort of
subsidized at work with ads will apple's
new ad network which is going to give a
60-40 split 60 going to developers 42
apple really gives you just completely
immersive advertising environment Steve
Jobs said it evokes emotion and
interactivity essentially what it lets
you do is create full apps within the
advertisement so he showed an
advertisement for toy story to click on
it launched a sort of almost a new
application lets you play toy story
games download toy story videos watch
toy story videos and do all kind of sort
of minigames within it so the ad nap
stays within the application it sort of
up to developers or create applications
that better use these ads on Apple's
claiming they're going to serve really
fantastic interactive adds to the
developers so they can get their data
their applications ready to use with
this new service within an afternoon so
I don't know how to can affect the end
user is going to be really annoying or
it's going to be some welcome user
features but I guess you don't have to
wait and see mmm so when is this coming
that is a good question everybody's mind
previews up it will be released today to
developers will be coming this summer to
iphone 3gs and third generation ipod
touch users to second generation ipod
touch users an iphone 3g and previous
generation iphone users you'll get
access to summer as well but you will
not get access to some key features like
multitasking for example the rest of
features that will be emitted i haven't
been released yet multitasking certainly
very processor intensive so you're not
kind of access to that a pork plant some
of the older
sort of forcing and I'm pretty I suppose
and if you have an iPad it's going to be
coming in the fall no word was not was
going to cost money or not but I would
assume apples previous models will hold
true here so guys the question remains
are you excited about iphone OS four
point oh it seems like a lot of the
things people have been saying
negatively about the iphone for a big /
one by one me included multitasking is
that taken care of background images
have been taken care I would have liked
to seen better notifications I would
still didn't see that and I would have
liked to see more of a redesigned lock
screen at home freed really didn't see
that by the exception of folders but
finally multitasking makes it a much
more viable option I think for power
users so are you excited not excited can
you not waste your hands on this or do
you really not care it and you'll pick
up an Android device anyway really
curious hear what you guys have to say
anyway i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and for the rest of your
iphone OS four point oh news be sure to
check out technobuffalo calm for a ton
more coverage anyway jon rettinger i'll
see that next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
