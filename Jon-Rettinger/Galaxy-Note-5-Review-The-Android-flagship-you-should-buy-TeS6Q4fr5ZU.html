real phablet that I fell in love with I
was actually at the original launch
event in Germany and people were
scoffing at the idea of a 5.3 inch
monster of a phone I was personally
enthralled at the time at a 3.5 inch
rectangle just chilling in my pocket I
began wondering what I could do with all
that screen real estate so four years
have passed since original debuted IFA
in Germany and now its fifth iteration
it's as controversial as the first one
I'm John Wright injured from
TechnoBuffalo
and this is our review of the samsung
galaxy note 5 as I do with all my
reviews let me give a few disclaimers I
tested the device for 11 days 7 days
with international unit on AT&amp;amp;T and four
with an AT&amp;amp;T Brendan unit obviously on
their network Todd the written portion
used his phone at the same time with the
last 4 days worth of verizon model
instead so I'll know any more detail on
a theme to talk about including full
camera samples and galleries hit the
link down below and check out the full
written portion as I dive in and try to
answer the question would I buy this I
tried to rehash the same things from the
Galaxy s6 edge+ review so I'll be
focusing on the experience if you want
benchmarks we'll link to that review
down below as well from a purely
aesthetic standpoint it's hard not to
love the glass middle design total carry
over from the galaxy s6 introduced
earlier this year however you'll no
longer get expandable storage through a
microSD card slot which means you're
limited to 32 or 64 gigs of storage fans
the Galaxy Note has long expected to
have this and we've seen plenty of
comments suggesting that many fans for
the Galaxy Note 4 and still offers a
micro SD card slot and another feature a
movable battery fake leather back be
damned there's also been a lot of
concern about the design of Samsung S
Pen which have inserted backwards can
completely Bork your phone insert the
wrong way once you've got a chance of
running the sensor it's sort of too far
and you may have actually got stuck in
there permanently at first we thought
this could pull you blend a proportion
then I was messing around and put the
s-pen and backwards on purpose just a
little bit and I couldn't pull it out
that I broke the sensor so don't be a
John look before you put your pet in
those concerns aside every other aspect
of this phone is absolutely first-class
the phone runs on octa-core exynos 7420
trip the same as in a galaxy s6 the
Samsung padded phone with an extra gig
of ram giving me now four gigs
total and I'm slowly getting used to
saying that four gigs in a phone which
still just sounds like a lot in my
experience though using the phone for
daily gaming email phone
more I never once thought Sutter as it
expect sometimes you see phone start to
slow down after a few months something
tells me that note 5 is enough power to
totally avoid that for months and months
to come
assuming it works the S Pen is way
better than previous generations it's
way more premium looking and feeling and
no longer looks like a skinny plastic
stick and functionality it works really
well on display for taking notes saying
documents or cropping photos Todd goes
into way more detail on this I also
really like the ability to draw a note
the screen off it's helpful but mostly
just flipped holstered and then users
during my testing and finally the thing
your eyes are gonna be staring at dead
gorgeous display you're gonna find a
quad HTML panel that's bright and crisp
in all conditions you're gonna use it
outdoors it boils down to this the
galaxy note 5 and the galaxy s6 edge+
have the best screens on any phone that
have ever come out to market Todd hasn't
been a big fan of TouchWiz but I'm ok
with it here it's way lighter than
before and in all candor all I really
saw of it is notification shade and the
settings screen since I ran Google now
launcher which forever it's worth gives
you 5 icons down plus the doc Morel Bing
if you're worried about TouchWiz from a
note 4 or GS 5 experience exhale
Samsung learned also in the software
side is side seam 4.0 which allows you
to manage your phone entirely from your
PC late it's a Mac software's coming
that means being able to answer text
takes phone calls quickly transferring
files and more it's not the prettiest
software in the world - haven't always
loved side sync on other devices such as
Samsung Android tablets but it does work
pretty well here next let's talk about
camera the camera on the galaxy s6
totally blew us away in the note 5 which
features the same sensor and same
software improvements is one of my
favorite features of the phone I found
it a rare occurrence to snap a photo
that I didn't like or appreciate and
that's a huge compliment to the phone
against competitors which sometimes
required multiple shots get the photo
that you really want to use low-light
chop the restaurant for example came out
excellent shots in daylight we're always
more impressive tips I also had a really
cool new feature let's use livestream
directly from the camera app to YouTube
it's sort of like what you might do with
meerkat and periscope it works really
well something I hope to see on other
phones so before I wrap things up let's
talk about that battery the Galaxy Note
5 supports Samsung's proprietary
adaptive fast charger provides as much
juice as possible as little time as
possible Samsung promises a 50% charge
in just 30 minutes which I found to be
generally true and when I tried it it
seemed like a parlor trick usually have
a full charge about an hour
hour and a half which is pretty
incredible definitely keep in mind
though you're gonna need the adaptive
fast charging plug which is signified by
the lightning ball on the side of it the
standard is different than Qualcomm
quick charge 2.0 which is supported by a
variety of Qualcomm Snapdragon
processors overall a battery life was
about the same as a galaxy s6 edge+ you
can get through a full day but be
careful if you scroll through countless
Twitter feeds Instagram feeds you got
your screen brightness set up to 80%
you're good at difficulty set it to auto
and maybe limit how much you're on it be
able to get through a full day you are
get the changer usage so if you plan on
using this phone without charging it at
all throughout the day thankfully though
if you do charge it and use the
aforementioned fast charging feature to
top it off it's going to charge very
quickly or if throw it on a chi or PM a
wireless charger the galaxy a5 for me
covers nearly every feature that I'm
looking for in a smartphone the display
is absolutely gorgeous the camera is
really incredible and you'll get great
photos in almost every situation low
light high light wherever you are and at
least good enough to share with your
friends which is really what matters
most least for me from a smartphone the
phone charges incredibly quickly it
seems like a party trick
it's got decent battery life not great
design I think is incredible pretty
close to perfect so I get that I also
might be in the minority
I respect the opinion of folks who want
more from their phone who look at the
Galaxy Note 4 and want that back they
want removable microSD card slot you
want solvable batteries and I get it but
at some point it seems Samsung decided
that cloud storage is gonna have to be
good enough an industrial design Trump's
those features and I get that too and
for me I'm about to kind of burst and
never carried extra SD card direction
batteries so I've learned to adapt so
about that would I buy a question I
asked at the beginning and the answer
should be pretty obvious at this point
it's a resounding yes
I absolutely would and you should too I
just wish that it came in gold in the US
