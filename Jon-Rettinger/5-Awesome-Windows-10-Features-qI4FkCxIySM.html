it from TechnoBuffalo and windows 10 is
finally available which means if you
have a qualified Windows 7 or 8.1
machine you'll be able to update to
Windows 10 for free as long as you do it
within the first year we've been testing
out windows 10 for several weeks and
we're loving what we see so far it's
definitely the upgrade Windows fans have
been waiting for in the release PC users
deserve following Windows 8 there are a
ton of changes in Windows 10 but let's
take a look at some of the best features
in Microsoft's latest OS so the first
one on our list is Cortana now Ratana is
making its way to the PC in Windows 10
and it's an awesome feature you can add
things to her notebook like your
favorite locations TV shows sports teams
so she starts to learn what kind of
things you like like a real assistant
she'll immediately provide that
information and things like the weather
your upcoming flight plans and more all
from your Windows 10 taskbar Crotona
exists in two forms either as an icon or
as a full search bar and you can call
her by voice using the hey Cortana
command or manually so the second one on
our list is Windows hello
now passwords are very dumb but not
really they can be a pain though they
also aren't very secure if you're just
taping them to the side of the monitor
anyway that's why Microsoft built
Windows hello it's a biometric based
system security you can use iris
scanners which are built into some
computers already or you can use your
face or fingerprints who jump right into
your computer now we've recently tested
this feature at a meeting with Microsoft
and it works flawlessly and quickly and
we're told they can't be fake with
photos which I know may be a big concern
to some people this isn't a gimmick
either Microsoft is part of the phyto
Alliance which has a goal of getting
banks in other institutions on board
with the authentication standard so the
third one on our list is continuum now
continuum is going to play a huge role
in Microsoft's Windows 10 ecosystem on
tablets and two-in-one hybrids it
essentially allows you to switch between
a touch friendly mode and a keyboard and
mouse mode on a surface pro 3 for
example attaching a keyboard will enable
PC mode and detaching it will enable
tablet mode more importantly however is
what the feature means to apps the
applications you use on Windows 10 are
built to scale all screen sizes so
Windows 10 apps like photos or even apps
that developers build can run on devices
with 4-inch displays up to huge monitor
just pull the window and the app will
scale in real-time so the fourth one on
our list is the return of the Start menu
now this is a very big feature I'm sure
a lot of people are excited to see make
a comeback yes it wasn't very hard to
add a Start menu to previous iterations
of Windows but the real-deal Start menu
is back it's even better than before -
in microsoft says it specifically made
tweaks based on input from windows
inside our testers you can keep it nice
and small or resize it to take over your
whole screen if you want you can also
customize it to your content with four
different live tile sizes drag-and-drop
applications around and more for me it's
where I can quickly see the weather
check out a few headlines and open up my
most used apps and it's easily the best
version of the Start menu ever so the
last one in our list is Microsoft edge
while we're still getting used to the
Microsoft edge browser we're really
digging it so far you can finally pin
tabs you can take a snapshot of the
screen and draw on it in OneNote share
pages right from the browser and more
probably my favorite feature however is
the built-in Cortana support if you go
to a website for a restaurant for
example Cortana will pop up at the top
of the screen and let you know she has
the hours directions and more also if
you ever come across a word or something
you don't understand you can right-click
and ask Cortana for more information
there's also light and dark modes a
reading list and the ability to read in
a special reading view that makes the
page much more reader friendly like we
said there's so much more to love about
Windows 10 the new Action Center in
Windows mas is so much easier to check
out miss notifications and the new Xbox
integration in Windows 10 will allow you
to stream Xbox games directly to your PC
we also have support for full virtual
desktops and task switching is better
than ever
Microsoft is treating Windows 10 more
like Windows as a service which means we
can expect frequent updates from
Microsoft anyways thank you guys so much
for watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
