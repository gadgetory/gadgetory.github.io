review for you of the contour service
sound you may have seen in my unboxing
the contour surface sound is a tooth
speaker think of it as a Bluetooth
headset without the headset part
essentially what you do is you parrots
any Bluetooth capable device and it
transmits the sound right out of the the
giant speaker it takes up almost the
whole front of the device in my case
it's perfect you take advantage of clip
clip it to the visor of my car and as
I'm driving I can use this almost like a
built-in audio Bluetooth one of the
things that I really like about the
device it's actually it's got a built-in
boom mic so this thing right here opens
up you can hear it parent and how it's
connected to my iPhone and the nice
thing about this in addition to being
the power switch it also is the mic so
this is positions right up on your visor
you get the mic right in your mouth so
I'm really the audio quality to the
person your third era calling it's
actually very clear I was a big fan of
the old Motorola Bluetooth headsets with
the boom mic that went up and down but
also controlled the power and this is a
very similar idea which is why I was
immediately drawn to this headset I
really Booton drawn to the speaker I
really like the fact you can control the
power that way I got happy to hold down
a button nothing makes it nice and easy
so there aren't many physical buttons on
the device I mean buttons that really
aren't present are these four on the
side you have a call call hang up and
make a call button and a volume up or
down and that's about it in the case of
the most handsets you can actually
control the volume it directly from the
phone itself so I'm using my iPhone I
can't volume up and the volume up on the
speaker increases on the back of the
device you have a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack in case you want to use a plugged
in headset which you can use just easily
on the phone itself and it has a
microUSB port for charging I go ahead
and close this up and these are talking
about the device so overall I was very
impressed the call quality people on the
other end didn't know I was on a speaker
but it didn't impair their ability to
hear me he said it sounded very quickly
they said I sounded better than most
Bluetooth headsets so I'm going to keep
in mind that they will know you're not
talking on your phone itself but you do
sound certainly good enough quote
quality from Maya to the part coming out
the speaker is actually very loud very
clear and really transmitted a great
audio quality so other speakers I've
tested had a little bit of a white noise
hiss be kind it and the contour surface
sound didn't have any of that so
everything it was quite pleased to hear
that overall guys I've been very
impressed with the device I'm going to a
link to the contour site mean upper
right-hand corner or the left hand
corner suppose for you guys and you can
take a look at it see if you like to
purchase it I believe it's $99 I
definitely recommend it out of one to
five the scale I'm definitely gonna give
it a solid four and a half
one of the nice thing about this is if
your phone is a2dp capable meaning you
can stream audio over you can use it as
a speaker to play music on so not just
for hen says if your car lacks built-in
bluetooth and you don't like fooling
with a headset I really can recommend
this wholeheartedly I'm gonna use it
permanently it's gonna stay in my car
and not go anywhere
I think you guys will be just as happy
with it as I am hope you enjoy
so John ready for exclusive contents be
sure to follow me on Twitter twitter.com
slash John for Lakers I'll see you guys
next video bye-bye
right right onto the hood I'm sorry
so there's many good laughs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
