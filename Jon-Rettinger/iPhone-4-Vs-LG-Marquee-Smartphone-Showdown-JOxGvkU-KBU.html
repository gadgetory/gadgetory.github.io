I'm back with the LG Marquee after just
having gone to the fashion panel here
I have a few more specs for you guys I'm
going to take this back off here
and I'm revealing a 1500 milliamp hour
battery
this thing is reportedly very good on
its usage
there's another thing
well here and the screen is actually
brighter than the iphone Retina display
this phone is a little bit larger than
an iphone however
it's about the same thickness and
remember the LG Marquee weighs three
point nine seven ounces so it's very
light
it's just a little bit lighter than the
iphone
my experience here we're running android
2.3 gingerbread okay it seems to be a
quick poem however it definitely does
not match that smoothness
that charisma of the iphone 4 one other
thing to note here is that if you're in
a sprint IDs this phone has sprint IDs
it's basically different profiles here
let you choose
your profile based on your like so if
you like sports or you like
travel you can kind of customize your
own profile
show you a little bit more here the
keyboard has swype your typical android
keyboard here
and the LG Marquee it's not a bad phone
1 1 gigahertz processor 512 megabytes of
RAM these are kind of last year specs to
be honest the phone well very pretty
not of 80s like is a little plastic e to
me
up
only half with a dance party we also
only have a two gigabyte
micro SD card here we're light on we're
light on memory as well
go to the iphone 4 I would stick with
the iphone 4 that's just my first
impressions look for more on the LG
Marquee
