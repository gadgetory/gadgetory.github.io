to you by Toyota hey guys Ashley with
technobuffalo here we're checking out
corning and now you're probably familiar
with Corning if you've ever heard of a
little thing called Gorilla Glass
however they have something really
exciting this year one of the things
that we have to avoid a lot at CES is
jerks this is the number one enemy at
CES and one of the big reasons why is
because everybody is touching demo units
and there's a lot of germs going around
the show so boarding has come up with a
way to help people stay a little bit
less germy of the show is by the way
this is dr. joydeep Lahiri very nice to
have you thank you thank you for so you
guys are now actually pretty much baking
in antimicrobial material its ionic
silver into the actual glass of a device
yes so then the antimicrobial silver is
embedded which gives you activity for
the lifetime of the device that
severally us so you don't have to put on
any kind of skins or you know screen
cleaners at it like that this is
something that's going to be actively
helping you without you ever even trying
yes it's innately it's inherently
antimicrobial if you know the cover
glass actually has an oleophobic coating
on it right bitch so you cannot use
harsh cleaners okay and so by having the
glass inherently antimicrobial it
basically reduces the level
bacteria 24-7 and honestly you guys have
all seen the articles about how
disgusting our cell phones are we're
always holding them up to our face some
of you guys take them in the bathroom
not great but we're actually I'm a
little scared because we're going to
test my phone and see how gross it is I
just probably pretty gross so let's find
out here's my phone I didn't clean it
off before we did anything I have I do
have a little screen protector on there
but it's probably disgusting find out
take out one of these right and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
off you can see a little cotton swab
there I'm going to swab your device with
this I'm going to put it back you can
see a little reagent out here right I'm
going to break that seal the
contamination is going to react with
that reagent I'm going to put it back in
there is going to give you a reading
very fast so we'll find out I am
genuinely a little scared there's going
to be the black plague on my foot so
let's hope for that not down by
surprised oh boy I'm terrified okay so
we have it thick the swab so we're gonna
swap the device that's right where my
ear is that's terrifying and all the way
down where my cheek fits on my phone and
then right where near my face is oh man
I'm so scared I can't even imagine the
kinds of horrors that are living on my
screen and you guys I try to clean my
screen like quite a bit so maybe you'll
get a very low reading to find out what
he gets I'm so horrified and there were
some pretty high numbers here today so
you'll find out
CES is a it is a basket of jerks
everybody knows everybody's heard of the
CES plague we've all had it and honestly
this is one of the big reasons why
because we're all handling these tablets
and smartphones all day long demo units
at each booth all right here we go swab
goes in a voice is the reagent I mix it
up what terrible things are happening in
there this is when a giant amoeba jumps
out of the swab and goes on a rampage
just like in a horror movie a bee movie
from the 50s okay so now we're putting
it through this machine find out the
moment of truth oh boy 10 seconds 10
second countdown to some so whatever
terrible things have been living on the
top of my phone I'm really scared I'm a
little nervous about it okay three two
one let's hang what's up that is very
good oh it's really good very good yeah
I'm a dream on very well congratulations
oh thank you so much I feel really good
about it now I forgot but I would feel
even better if I had corning gorilla
glass with antimicrobial silver in it
which first of all it just sounds
amazing and secondly is a really good
way to keep your device cleaner and also
I was talking earlier to some of your
colleagues and they were saying that
there are some applications that are
really amazing for example windows in
hospitals this is like a really
interesting thing other applications
besides smartphones side tables and
hospitals any high touch areas they are
prime candidates so it's not just
consumer electronics there are a whole
variety of other markets where this
could play a role yes well this is
really cool technology we're going to be
checking out more recording stuff at
show on the show floor tomorrow but dr.
Jerry Thank You Lahiri Lahiri dr. Larry
