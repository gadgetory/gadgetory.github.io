well wherever you're at for everybody
that's in the united states hope you had
good fourth of july but for watching
this we pass a fourth of july hope you
had a good day i like to expand on our
previous video that i made as the
marketplace has changed and give some
suggestions as to which apple computer i
think that you guys should get it's a
question that I get most frequently
should I can go into college I get a mac
mac book pro which I look at an error
you know what should I get so this video
is going to address the laptop side of
the spectrum so whether or not you
should get a macbook macbook pro or
macbook air so first off start with the
most popular the macbook the macbook is
despite what people think is really is a
very powerful workhorse machine in a lot
of ways almost as powerful as the
macbook pro currently comes in a hard
plastic cases which makes a little bit
more durable but for taking it something
back and forth to class you won't have
as many dings on it you lost with
scratches but the component underneath
will be a little better protected it's
got a built-in optical drive which is
always very nice built-in firewire vault
an ethernet so if this is going to be a
primary computer and you're going to
college I generally recommend people get
the macbook did the exception is if
you're going to be doing 3d rendering or
can use your computer to be playing
games if you're going to be doing a lot
of 3d rendering or going to be playing a
lot of games in your computer then I
recommend getting a macbook pro which
comes in a larger screen size of 15 or
17 inches is all aluminum casing has its
own dedicated graphics card which helps
again with the 3d rendering games so if
you're looking for something very
powerful you know go for the macbook pro
if you have the money otherwise I think
the macbook is a great computer I would
have been very happy with the macbook in
fact I probably should have gone instead
of the macbook pro item 20 3d rendering
I'm doing games you know to something to
keep in mind both a run bootcamp and
Windows very well if you need to both be
able to run photoshop dreamweaver and
all that stuff fantastically I really
won't notice much of a difference I'm
browsing the web making videos and your
that stuff now you really won't notice
any sort of
to a difference so if you can save the
money you're going to college I
recommend getting a macbook again if you
are more of a power user and you play a
lot of games or you think that you may
get into 3d rendering and then go for
something like the macbook pro if you
already have a desktop computer at your
home and looking for something for a
more portable solution Nick over
something like the macbook air I'm
considering an air for for graduate
school it's something to carry with me
to and from class and uses a secondary
computer it's really don't recommend
getting the air for students as a
primary machine that's just not powerful
enough there's a really enough hard
drive space so no this is a nice short
video but I hope it helps yet a little
bit of light onto your guys decision
that's what you should get the macbook
is a very powerful machine and unless
you plan on doing 3d rendering I really
think it's a great option they can run
an external monitor i believe up to 22
inches so you don't have any issue you
know there with the screen size it does
only come in glossy but you can connect
it to a matte monitor if you prefer and
it really is kind of the best compromise
I think so hope the short little video
is helpful to you guys you know leave
comments questions and feedback try and
get to it all anyway I'm off to Los
Angeles go enjoy my Sunday ok guys do
