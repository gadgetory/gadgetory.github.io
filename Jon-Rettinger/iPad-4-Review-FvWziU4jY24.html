TechnoBuffalo here's a full review of
the fourth-generation iPad the iPad for
the new new iPad whatever you want to
call it it is here with upgraded specs
in a new lightning connector let's go
ahead and see if it's worth your tablet
buying dollars so here is the iPad 4th
generation I'm going to call it the iPad
4 cuz that's easier called the new iPad
you can call it Fred just don't call it
late for dinner
alright so fresh ranges are the same as
last generation from $4.99 all the way
up to a beefy eight hundred and thirty
bucks running iOS 6 I'll jump to the
rest the specs from a weight standpoint
looking at one point four four pounds
screen is a nine point seven inch LED
affair with IPS technology its Retina
display so it's gonna mean you've got a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 those you
math geeks that's 264 PPI got a forty
two point five watt hour battery gonna
give you about 10 hours of use what's
new here that was what's under the hood
it's got a 1.4 gigahertz dual core a 6 X
chip with quad core graphics I went it
with a gig of ram this thing is an
absolute beast LTE connectivity is an
option from now Sprint is being added so
you can pick from 18 t Verizon or Sprint
on the camera standpoint from the back
we've got a 5 megapixel camera that can
shoot 1080p video HD recording of course
and on the front now called a FaceTime
camera 1.2 megapixel 720p on here in two
colors black or white the other big
difference here is down below boom that
port right there is now lightning good
by 30-pin we now have a teeny tiny
little reversible lightning port so
let's talk about this guy whether or not
it's worth buying whether that's worth
an upgrade or what the iPad 4 really
means it came very quickly after the
iPad 3 so it's going to be important to
put the iPad 4 perspective of the iPad 3
and then I'll talk about this guy on its
own so first let's talk about the iPad 4
versus the iPad 3 so certainly there are
performance increases here this is a
much faster processor and it can do much
more much more quickly so if you want to
get all geeky with me Geekbench scores
much faster iPad 3
7:45 iPad 4 1772 if you want to talk
plants vs. zombies low time which is
probably one of my favorite games of all
time I pet three load it in fifteen
point nine seconds you're able to start
killing some zombies on the iPad 4
though in 12.5 seconds GL benchmark
looking at 87 frames per second on the
iPad 3 and 132 frames per second on the
iPad for GL benchmarks 2.5 on screen
performance we got 52 frames per second
versus 59 frames per second so
everywhere you stretch it the iPad 4 is
faster so we'll wrap up the iPad 3 part
if you have an iPad 3 there is zero
point zero reason to upgrade no reason
at all yes it's notably faster sure
graphics might look a little bit better
it's gonna be hardly noticeable wait an
extra two or three seconds load an
application graphics are gonna look
great on third generation iPad no need
to upgrade to the iPad 4 in my opinion
Apple pushed out the iPad 4 squarely for
that guy right there so that all their
products was unified under a single
connector they couldn't have a legacy
product with a 30 pin connector and
certainly Sprint's wanted to get in on
the game from the iPad standpoint on its
own it is a traditional iPad everything
on it works really well we can load
TechnoBuffalo calm the screen looks
gorgeous the whites are white the blacks
are black because I've read in this
blood there's never any text pic
civilization that you might get on an
iPad 2 or iPad Mini with that lower
resolution things just look absolutely
gorgeous playing video on it is
absolutely outstanding you can watch a
movie and you could be good to go for
quite a while video quality is awesome
of course the big deal here is the app
store it's got all the apps that Apple
offers really isn't much of a value add
versus the iPad 3 if you're coming from
an iPad 2 and iPad 1 it's gonna be a
great upgrade you're going to be
introduced to a Retina display which
really you can see a difference and
you're going to get that better graphics
performance but if you've got a 3rd
generation just skip this guy completely
on wait for the next gen perhaps we'll
see a case redesign I will say though
having played with and use the iPad Mini
for a while this feels like a freak
sized iPad
it feels jumbo to me so if you're
looking to get a new iPad definitely try
the iPad
first little lower resolution certainly
but you might like the size I'm finding
that I'm really enjoying the iPad Mini
and for me if I was looking to get an
iPad right now and I didn't have one
I think the iPad Mini would steal my
money it just seems to be a better feel
for ever reason I hated the idea of an
iPad made till I had a chance to
actually use one with devices like the
Nexus 7
I loved with a performed and I loved the
way they looked but I always thought
that I preferred a larger iPad turns out
I just prefer an iPad and I prefer iOS
on the tablet side and really this is
the king of the iOS tablets so if you're
looking to get one you know what it's
going to do cameras are going to be fine
on it video is going to look great it's
going to work pretty well it's not much
new you can say that this hasn't been
said with people generation and iPads it
works well it's going to have great
performance you have the same amount of
battery life you had at the last gen
despite the upgrade and performance and
you're going to get just a nice tablet
experienced of course all the
accessories will be available for it as
well
iPad for the TechnoBuffalo scale gets a
solid 9 I like to see thinner bezels so
no we have in the iPad Mini one of the
cool things that that's got is as you
hold it you continue to scroll it's not
going to do anything so certainly that
big bezel isn't could be necessary it's
a feature that got built into the newest
version of iOS 6 so that big bezel is
not going to need to be there so you can
manipulate without sort of accidentally
touching the screen so I certainly would
like to see a smaller bezel perhaps the
case redesign would have improved it and
got it up to that very coveted 10 spot
this is a great tablet arguably one of
the best tablets on the market I'm John
