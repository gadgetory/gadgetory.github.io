TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of the
2011 ipod touch this is obviously the
version that comes in white or black
let's go ahead and dig in and see if
it's worthy of the iPod touch name I'm
gonna touch it alright so here we have
the iPod touch this is the 2011 model it
comes in some odd sizes we got 8 32 and
64 no a 16 gigabyte option in there it's
gonna come air white or black pretty
familiar specs at this point 3.5 inch
screen with 960 by 640 pixel resolution
at 326 pixels per inch we'll talk about
all that goodness in a few minutes
they look at the box there is the iPod
touch sit in the box beside iPod touch
and I'll let the business I've got the 8
gigabyte model comes in to just about
$200 and it's $100 up each size that you
go so without further ado let's go ahead
and open this sucker up
let's give off a tape I'll do a little
seductive unboxing there we go
open it up pull it out and they should
come with iOS 5 pre-installed
I would expect it to so there's the iPod
touch a new feature of the iPod Touch is
actually this plastic back that it's got
sort of acts as a case when you want to
use it it's really will protect the
shiny aluminum back at alluminium
depending on where you live not dickin
guys obviously I carry through the
comments be like dude you fail you
should kill yourself that's not part of
the iPod touch comments are getting
meaner and meaner
so fingertips there's some finger tips
we do have Apple stickers so I know you
guys are gonna ask usual stuff 30-pin
connector and headphones with no
microphone all right great here's the
iPod touch let's go ahead and take off
its protective case seal off the tape
and your iPod Touch reveals itself
as does that sticker so it is clear on
the back or so it's shiny on the back so
you can see my camera you can see my
distorted face staring at it very very
very thin so it's got a video recording
capabilities on the back and the front
the back one is the one of note though
that can record video at 720p at 30
frames per second front one can do VGA
quality photos and try the back can give
VGA quality photos it's kind of weird
and all the rest is that we expect
everything dock connector you've got the
3.5 milimeter headset jack volume up and
down they're separate buttons to go and
power this sucker on while I'm talking
boom powers on and there is an Apple
logo so let's do a quick size comparison
let's bring in an iPhone 4 and you could
say it's an iPhone 4s if you want
because they are exactly the same size
and there you can see the thinness the
iPod Touch is extremely thin go ahead
and put it like that you can really see
it like they love each other
alright just kidding uh they're got the
iPod touch we've got the iPhone 4 sass
comparison time and yep there it is
letting it do its boot up thing out with
iOS 5 pre-installed in here shaken up
iMessage Notification Center and the
rest of that iOS 5 goodness so we'll do
a full review and a walkthrough of this
guy anything else that you guys want to
see with the new iPod touch this has
been a surprisingly dirty unboxing of
the brand new 2011 white iPod touch I am
John rector from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you guys in the next video
you
what's up everyone John rhett endure
from TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing
of the brand's new 2011 ipod touch the
model that comes in black or white
obviously we've got the white version
here let's go ahead dig in and see it's
a worthy contender to the ipod touch
line
oh yeah that's bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
