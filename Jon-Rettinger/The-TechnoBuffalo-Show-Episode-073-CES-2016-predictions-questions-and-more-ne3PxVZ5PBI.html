Buffalo show I'm live your to host for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by managing deputy
deputy managing editor Todd hazen deputy
Dawg that's my resolution or try 16 get
you an easier title to say yes that's
right so yes folks we are at the end of
2015 a year full of phones yeah yeah
there were phones phones and I feel like
there there were less fewer to fewer is
there a word tablets I guess other
result we had when I was in her tablets
yeah and we had big ones like literally
big ones like the the galaxy view and
the ipad pro surface pro 4 you know so
refinements to and i saw an interesting
article yesterday I think tech insider
did Business Insider about just like how
everybody this year 2015 was about like
trying to kill the laptop and not
successfully doing that and and almost
like pointlessly so you know like the
iPad pro like sort of going after these
like the Apple was saying that you don't
need a laptop but you like why would you
get an ipad pro it's so much bigger and
like bulkier once you had the keyboard
stuff like that it just didn't do a good
job trying to kill a laptop which
arguably you don't need to kill in the
first place I actually I saw an
interesting article week or two back
that what's saving computers yo desktops
and laptops both is spreadsheets is like
I have to agree i mean there are lots of
other things excuse me that you do with
the computer that you can't do with the
tablet but in general you you know me I
spreadsheet everything but yeah I can
kinda kind of see that yeah but i feel
like if anything's gonna kill like the
laptop I think it's and I don't think
they're gonna get killed at all I think
it's more like a long lines that I hope
to see like what we're seeing with
windows 10 Lumia 950 with continuum and
sort of like here's my computer bringing
everywhere plug it in but I don't think
that's a 2016 solution either i don't
know maybe down the line yeah I mean I I
don't know it's I don't think the
computer is going anywhere anytime soon
I I'd I find interesting that companies
keep thinking that they've come up with
the solution to kill but the whole
question is why kill ya why do you
really hear people walking around or
sitting at starbucks with their laptop
guy I hate you and I don't want to use
you anymore only me with the surface pro
3 and that keyboard Walt that original
he would that's it that's a different
situation I know I know I know I get
your point but in general you don't
really hear people saying oh how much I
hated can pay you know having a desktop
or a laptop nobody says that right you
know I think that's a whole lot of the
problem that we've seen in technology
over the years is that the tech
companies decide oh this is what you
really want yeah well isn't that what
Steve Jobs was famous for like making
products people didn't know they wanted
yes but there's only one Steve Jobs yeah
that's right everybody else is trying to
be like you I mean how many products
have we seen at CES you know I i I've
told the story before it will never stop
cracking me up the the guy I stopped by
his booth and he had windows 7 tablets
and you know he's walking me through him
and he gets to what he goes and this is
our iPad killer yeah is the only time I
have broken in a booth and I actually
laughed out loud as I what so 50 nothing
Lee please continue I'm like it's a
windows 7 tablet no it's not an iPad
color but uh mi jus folks this was very
early in the ipad life cycle right but
so the main goal of today though is of
course next week there will be no show
folks because Todd and I will be at Las
Vegas having a fabulous time yeah oh and
supposedly doing work at CES but uh oh
yeah and actually CS will be the the
main reason that we're in Vegas so as
always we want to take a look at you
know what exactly do we think we're
going to see at CES this year I think
we're already starting to see some
trends in the emails that were getting
and mind you folks we can't go into
specifics on a lot of the stuff that
we're receiving because it's under
embargo but you know there's there's a
definite trend that I feel safe and
discussing that seems to be everyones
talking the Internet of Things yeah
connected everything I mean and actually
some of the stuff that we've already
published on the site uh is showing off
this is so exist for example first is
LG's webos three point 0 which will
power their latest TVs which is great
because I love well as froze you don't
remember it was once palms operating
system for their smartphones um any case
so that's exciting because web and their
tablets oh there you go that's exciting
because they're gonna allow all these
smart connected devices like your
refrigerator well I like to think of the
appliances first but your lights and
your music and all kinds of things and
your refrigerator your washer and dryer
always like a thing about Sean I talk
about that a lot all these notifications
and things coming through to your TV so
your TV sort of serving as a central hub
to your smart home which um for a while
that was the rumor that Apple's the
apple TV this year was going to do and
like that sort of ever came to fruition
so that started it and then we saw
Samsung yesterday announced I think was
yesterday that all their smart things or
uh you know connecting devices are gonna
plug into the TV and I think everything
else to like all kinds of other ones
zigbee all that more than 200 devices it
supports again so you know your TV
showing you maybe when your washer and
dryer finished or you can control your
lights or something like that which i
think is going to be a lot cooler than
like to me right now in my apartment I
have Alexa T I mean I'm like oh you know
like turn on the lights and like that's
enough but I feel like if you have a big
house you know all these rooms to manage
and the TV is kind of like the most
important place I guess for a lot of
people who are sitting on the couch
anyway and then today we saw LG just
announced another thing
I think is called the smart think smart
it's smart thi NQ I mean it kind of
looks like an Amazon echo and it has a
3.5 inch display think it was 3.5 inches
can play music and can control your
appliances I guess or all your things
sort of again this internet of things
smarthome connected device oddly enough
it didn't have voice controls like the
echo though which is like like why why
even bother look it looks like a speaker
yes and it performs as a speaker so like
why wouldn't it have that I don't know
maybe they don't have the technology
yeah I think we're definitely going to
see a lot of smart home / internet of
things this year beyond that I really am
not seeing any one trend up here it's a
lot of refinements a lot of just
iterations I'm not nothing that we have
been emailed about yet or you know that
we've heard rumors of and so on nothing
is really staying out to me as like the
be-all end-all of CES I mean you've done
c.s a few years longer than I have I
mean I'm sure you can remember there
were years like the year of the motorola
xoom yeah yo that was the first
honeycomb tablet that was exciting mmm
you know but there's not so far there's
no one big thing that I think feel like
everyone's going to rush to go see and
cover yeah there were years where it was
sort of like tablets were the thing
right or even smartphones for a little
bit and now yeah I think it's more about
connecting everything I think we're
gonna see a lot of technology for you
know not just these TVs are connected in
car connections and the technology that
we're seeing in our cars I know it was
BMW I forget what it's called exactly I
want to say it was like 3d touch but
that's not right smart touch but it is
it's a concept control panel for your
car where you can use gestures above the
screen and stuff like that and I mean
this is just going to show that the the
entertainment systems and our cars are
far more powerful than they ever were
before I think we're going to see maybe
another trend in
perhaps it's a smaller one but finally
more 4k discussion about the actual
content not the tvs that have been you
know that are probably under a thousand
dollars in a lot of places now and we're
once these $10,000 TVs at CES i think
those are kind of coming into mainstream
and now we have to see like okay why do
consumers want them you know like
finally gave us the hardware now i do we
want it so maybe you'll hear from sling
TV i mean they have a press conference
dish directv what about live sports you
know from AT&amp;amp;T and stuff like that so I
think those are the the big trends that
I I can you know yeah I I would say so
it's I I think we even and there's one
thing I can't discuss that we've gotten
press release on that you know it's
another streaming service coming out
it's a specialized streaming service so
it's I think we're going to see a lot of
that sort of stuff it's but I don't
think there's going to be one gadget to
rule them all right yeah i think it's
it's becoming more and more about you
know the software and services side of
of the industry as opposed to
forward-facing I mean it's always I
guess I take that back CS has been a
place where they show you the latest
technology and then you know a couple
years later or whatever at the scene
here they're also showing what that
technology is capable of until that's
what my example was with 4k TVs a couple
years ago you know here they are and now
hopefully what can we do with them and
so now we're seeing you know these
connected smart like actually smart TVs
this year that are connected and and the
technology that they bring forward now
you know when you can control your home
with them and a 4k content on them sort
of more than just that dumb hardware
that i'll call it well you know i won
speak at televisions I mean televisions
are always one of the mainstays of CEOs
yo and you go back in halo so people are
just now starting to get 4k televisions
they're really just starting to hit
their adoption rate
but i think it was either last year of
the year before i saw the first five
point devices are gone nuts nice one is
i saw the first 5k television yeah then
two years ago I saw an 8k television and
IA I've heard rumors that the other
maybe some more 8 k's this year I'm just
like you know look first off there's not
enough 4k content to warrant even buying
a 4k television why are we even
beginning to discuss 8k you at this
point and that's what i mean by sort of
the dumb hardware like it's awesome but
it's sort of like what can you do with
it right now yeah just more of a proof
of concept I mean I i I've told you many
many times you know off the show that I
would kill for washer and dryer
notifications because my washer and
dryer in my basement ill and I it never
fails I always end up going down there
one or two minutes early and then you
you're just standing there like okay
I've got other things to do finish your
cycle right yeah so the idea of
something you know texting me or
tweeting me or showing up on my
television and telling me a folks yes I
know there are hacks out there I've seen
the videos I'm not drilling holes in my
washer just to put in a circuit board so
it can tweet me but uh although i'm sure
it's tweets would be far more
interesting than what i put out um so
yeah it's all interesting you know while
i'm fascinated by this I you know I
would love a television that told me all
that but of course that also means a new
washer and dryer that's not happening
this is going to be extremely slow
adoption rate I think so but they did
you have LG show today and I think
Samsung has their own through smart
things like these sensors that you can
put on them so yeah their vibration
sensors yes you don't have to buy
everything brand-new all the time but I
think yet this is the slow adoption the
start of you know when I go out and buy
a washer and dryer in five years i'ma by
anyone oh maybe I'll buy a connected one
exactly and here's a foundation my only
fear is and we've seen electronics
companies do this time and time again if
we don't run out and buy
they'll just drop the feature right and
so this is something i'm hoping the
electronics companies realize you know
at the OC level suites of the company
this is going to take a while to take
off this is not going to be an overnight
process yeah because they're not
appliances that you replace on a whim
you replace them when they stop working
exactly I I I can't remember i think the
last I think the washers newer and I
think it's like six or seven years old
you know right and we bought it because
the one we'd had for 20-some years broke
right you know so I'm interested to see
to you is how well these smart TVs as
center of your smart home systems work
because my main argument I think in my
head right now it's why not just use
your smartphone for all this because
that's what I use already and in fact I
just wish there was more of a one-stop
shop to control everything from Alexa to
you know my lights to whatever else i
have connected in here and and so then
I'm like okay well maybe my
one-stop-shop is the TV but do I really
want that and I actually don't use my TV
all at off and maybe for playstation 4
and stuff like that I know a lot of
people do but how many people were
sitting yeah but how many people are
sitting at their TV like oh I need to
control something from this as opposed
to just my smartphone or my tablet but
why oh and how many people are like you
right no no I know that i I'm I'm an
oddball I know that no I'm not saying
you're an oddball I'm just saying like
how many people actually are going to
use as opposed to tablet or smartphone
right and I think that while I think the
television notification and you've hit
on another issue I have with all of us
so let's say I walk out of the room to
you know get something out of the
refrigerator you know how long does that
notice stay on the television right you
know am I going to miss it or when I
walk back in the room do I have to check
to see if I missed a notification so
yeah I think it would be great if it
could go to the television and another
device like a phone or a tablet yeah you
know because let's say I'm I've got
a where I've got to do something oh I
gotta go clean the garage you know i'm
not saying in front of my television
right yeah so yes i fully agree to you
while the television is great that
cannot be the only source they can be
the more detailed source yeah but for
like notifications on all that I want
that mobile yeah and it has to run
really well i have a samsung smart TV
behind me a couple years old two years
old and it's just kind of really slow so
i hope that these are quicker webos last
year i guess it was two point O was
pretty good on LG's TVs so yeah that was
two point O lesser net was nice you know
I I'm anxious to check out three point
oh and you know and see how quick it is
you know I'm glad that webos is still in
existence in some form here you know yes
it may not be the the the one mobile OS
to rule them all but at least it's still
out there mmm so let's dive into a
couple of the questions we're getting
here and some of them are related to see
s let me look here to do two from such
humble hall and the ad boy this gonna
take a second to think about what stuff
did you guys see at CES 2015 that didn't
come out yet mm I think most of stuff I
saw came out I think so that stuff was
like you know those crazy Samsung TVs it
took a couple months Oh what was that
well I now there's one thing everyone
needs to remember we also see a lot of
concept stuff mmm because I'm thinking
specifically like that one video John
when shot of the tried different outfits
on him the mirror yeah LG I think it was
LG yeah and that that was that was
without question a concept device right
um I'm trying to think what else i
really i think last year was pretty good
i I don't I can't really think of
anything it sticks out is it was
announced and then we never saw it like
paper where yeah yeah I it happens
almost every year i'm sure we're miss
something but you know you never know uh
from the mics wireless is there anything
at CES that would surprise you um I
think if I saw puppies I'll be surprised
if I see I think there will be a couple
phones and tablets but I'll be surprised
if there's a major one announced there
because I think most people are saving
them for memorial Congress in late Pepe
weary that would surprise me you know I
just thought of something we need to
look for him i'm just going to write a
note and talk to you about post-show but
i just thought of something that we need
to uh to check on to see if it's there
because it's a notorious that sometimes
accessory makers make cases for things
that shouldn't be made on cases for yet
yes you know the thought last year was
yum was it last year two years ago i
think there's a lumia icon which was the
i think it was a lumia 930 and lumia 930
for verizon was yeah it was 939 924
verizon and we saw the cases for that
before was announced oh and it folks
here you get to enjoy me asking how to
question I did were you on the email the
other day that confirmed that we did get
our workroom no yes we are good for our
workroom and I believe it's the same
workroom I'm not positive yet so I
really need to print out the sentences
the bloggers under the stairs yeah cuz
it for everybody who hasn't heard it's
like a small room under the stairs we
are literally under the stairs so it's
like we're we're like the bloggers are
ashamed of yeah Harry Potter hiding and
they put us in the cupboard under the
stairs yeah hey it's a worker room
that's all I care that's true it's
awesome you want to sit on the floor of
the CES yeah from Jeff k awesome Todd
what did you sell lately huh I don't sue
me also means trade it when we have a
question about what Christmas gifts to
do nothing yeah I I don't I purposely
don't ask for technology for Christmas
at all um no I didn't sell or treat
anything
was kind of busy last week with
Christmas and everything so I haven't
returned it I don't think well actually
Sean and I here's a joke we back to this
company called me MOBOT like two years
ago and for those who can't see I'm
holding it up in Sean's going to we both
chose is bad it's a portable battery i
think it's like 5,000 milliamp hours I
don't at the time it was awesome and say
yes so at the time we were like whoa
that's cool it's like a and you know now
we probably had like three these battery
packs everywhere you look um we finally
got them and it's like I can't return it
but I don't really want it well i guess
i do its kind it's well over a year and
a half late yeah it's just like what
that here on let me plug it kind of like
hey I haven't even plugged mine in yeah
take the feet glow blue when it's
charged that's cool yeah yeah which I
got ya this was a kick AII like
Kickstarter and I realized stuff is
gonna be late but when your when your
product is a year to have played in its
technology-based that means basically by
the time it arrives it's right for the
junk drawer I honestly thought it was
never gonna come yeah I say although I
can't return it for a refund I would I I
do like the fact they somehow were able
to add quick church yeah that actually
is a nice little benefit yeah but still
excuses he is I cannot believe they did
not up the milliamp hours yeah in the
the time between when the backing
stopped and we actually received these
right but at least we'll have the
coolest chargers at CES I'm not taking
that thing really it's too big I mean if
I'm going to take here I this this is
the the biggest 1i I travel with I big
posters silver well I like this one this
one's huge and it's yeah it's try
thousand it's twelve thousand million
pairs but i like it because it has three
charging ports yeah so i can charge
three devices yeah i am i took this to
san diego con one year when i was with
Ralph and John and all three of us were
sitting at lunch and all three of us
were able to charge our phones at
same time that's awesome is a quick
charge to err no it's I quick charge but
it's still it's better than nothing
since it charges three items at once it
may be quick charge now I bought this
quite a while back i do like anchor
products yeah thank you three uh from
Jeff kay I'm calling shenanigans i'm
guessing yuri gifted thing just joking
haha oh I probably regift in a bottle
why my wife likes to do that actually my
met my mother does that do yeah she's a
regifter died wine many times uh from
such an Mahal what will 2016 be the
Europe it'll be the Europe shed Sean ani
jetty Oh looky here here should we tell
them all what happens and in slack when
you give you my name yeah so for those
of you that don't know slack is a
company communications tool it creates
different chat room so there's a chat
room for the editors of technobuffalo
and whenever one of us calls out that
we're on something especially if it's me
the other guys like to say well he's on
yet well for some reason we've
discovered if you enter jiffy to get an
animated jiff anytime you enter the name
on e so like / jiffy audie pictures of
jennifer lawrence appear always always
Jennifer Lawrence and we don't know why
just various Jennifer Lawrence although
my favorite has showed up two days in a
row now where she's doing the little
hair flip so I he was a sassy um so yes
the 2016 is the year of Sean ani
apparently morphing into Jennifer
Lawrence uh I don't know I mean I a lot
of people are saying oh this is gonna be
the year VR well the problem is VR while
it's out there is not out in mass
consumerism form yet so i don't think i
won't gear vr i would argue is probably
mad cuz you're gonna pick it up at a
Miss by
I know it's not like everybody like my
mom yeah that's really critical adoption
right yeah exactly i mean i I've been uh
I gave my father iphone for Christmas
it's his first smartphone it's been fun
um you know so the idea of going ok dad
you've had a week with the iphone I'm
putting you at a VR helmet now Rio but
that's clearly not happening um I don't
know I I can't think of what would be
the dominant item this year yeah I think
it's more about technology like not the
item of more about the connected home
and virtual reality in general spanning
not just not just from gear VR but you
know oculus and finally HTC five and all
these kinds of things I think you're
gonna end up Playstations all of these
are Sony's on all of these coming
together as sort of the trend and then
you know a lot again this smart home no
the echo for example was sort of
something that came out of nowhere and
now I think even today we saw mimicked
from LG not not in a very good way I
haven't used it yet but without voice
controls how good is it um so I feel
like these kinds of smart home gadgets
maybe ones we haven't even seen are that
are coming this year and then maybe
we'll see you know manufacturers
continue to try to kill the laptop I i
will say the echo is one of the most
tempting gadgets to me of 2015 i I've
fought it off because I don't have any
smart light bulbs or anything like that
but there's just something about that
makes me every time they put you put a
discount on like this is the time i
finally give in yeah i mean imagine if
it was if Apple had and that go or
Samsung and it was connected to your
phone and how convenient these kind of
things could be here you had like not go
mini for your desk I don't know I'm just
thinking of all these kinds of things
that would actually be useful if I could
have another echo in my bedroom you know
maybe it wasn't
full as this one but was sort of an
add-on I'll be really cool yeah yeah I I
don't know i'm not sure what this is
going to be the Europe but I I'm
definitely along for the ride to see
where we end up going uh let's see we
got several other interesting questions
here from jeff k random question
microsoft said they really need a Lumia
product with top spec / features in
order to succeed by argue the apps games
angle thoughts yeah I agree it is still
an apps games problem it's not i think
the Lumia 950 proves that it's not just
adding high-end hardware I mean we
finally have the quad HD display you
have cool things you can do with
Snapdragon 808 which was fast enough a
lot of ways i think the apps are still
kind of sluggish not optimized and
there's just not enough of them i mean
if you're if you have platforms with
apps that people really want and i'm and
i always use this in my review as an
example even i'll use it that much
myself but like snapchat right like it's
super popular and yet it's not on
Windows Phone and I think that turns
people often it's not just snap ties the
example of apps like that really really
popular apps that is a huge problem for
Microsoft and continues to be and they
say oh well you know now you can write
this Windows app for it 4 billion
computers you know around the world and
it'll just easily portal or two windows
phone well that's not necessarily true
for a lot of reasons because one why
would snap chat ever build a Windows app
right like these are web apps when
needed you know you go to instagram.com
on your computer you don't go don't go
to Windows and open up an instagram app
though facebook is apparently building
those but i just think that's sort of
the problem just because they have
windows and they think a billion people
out there like they can't forget that
there's a web browser too and that's how
people are idiots apps and developers
don't feel need to create a windows app
so it necessarily doesn't trickle down
the windows phone now I I fully agree i
still think it's the app situation yeah
I are going continuing to say that until
the situation improves but once again
it's a chicken in the egg situation and
it's been you know it's been a promise
for five years now that just hasn't
changed so yeah I know at some point you
know they're going microsoft bills
better apps for iOS and Android than it
does for his own platform so how could
it expect other developers did you
things differently you mean when you
open up the Lumia 950 for example and
put it into continuum and I've said this
my review skype doesn't work properly
like what the heck you owned by
microsoft yeah and yet there's you know
and they want developers of other kinds
to come and make apps for the platform
instead come on something's fishy there
now I I agree I agree from the mics
wireless in any world could you ever see
Apple specifically the iphone feeling
like blackberry sure sure I don't think
I really saw blackberry failing no I
could dude yeah no I mean our yo did
anyone see the the day and age where the
motorola razr wouldn't be the the top
phone the other day I walked into the
house and somebody was watching
something on netflix and i walked past
the television i stopped i looked at go
what year is this show from they go I
don't know why I was like why is that
person using a motorola razr probably
2006 2009 those the end live yeah it was
the it like the end of the whole you
know very end yeah area iphone was he
doesn't seven huh hey everything that is
on top will eventually fall I that
that's it's inevitable you know I mean
yes you can say McDonald's has been the
top fast food chain you know for years
but you know it's not what it once was
the iphone will eventually fall will
completely fall doubtful but yeah I
anything can fall yeah without question
yo during the OC yea though there will
be an a time with no iPads the thing I
mean the interesting thing was we had
windows mobile
palm OS at the time and blackberry for
smartphone operating systems that were
dominating oh wow and I take that back
in symbian with nokia devices and stuff
like that and then all of a sudden the
Apple came out with the iPhone and iOS
and which is totally a different super
consumer friendly sort of didn't feel
like at the time where smartphones were
starting to get more popular but we're
still very much like executive sort of
other that guy's a business guy he's got
a full keyboard on his phone that kind
of thing and then you know the iphone
key mountains were changed all that made
this very consumer-friendly device we
had full web pages oh my gosh that's so
cool so if somebody comes along with the
new device it sort of flips everything
on its head and it could be Android it
could be maybe it could be Windows 10
with continuing or something like that
you know later down the line windows
lebanon then you know all the sudden
it's like oh that's cool maybe everybody
starts adopting that and that's sort of
exactly what happened with the iphone
kind of came out of the blue you know
but i think the iphone was sort of a
perfect storm was the right time
everybody was very interested in these
pocket computers you know coming from hi
pods which they already loved so it was
easy to adopt an apple product easy to
get on board with that you know they
already have those iTunes libraries now
they were on their phone there was a
perfect storm that created you know
multi-touch was very cool although all
of that kind of stuff for the iphone so
it'll take a lot but yeah it'll be quite
a while but I definitely do see where it
could potentially be infirmary fall from
Jeff k just got my Samsung VR there you
go cut and I read they are going to
announce some cool additions to I assume
he means it any excitement on your end I
don't have a gear VR but Todd I know you
do yeah I don't use it regularly or
anything only when we're covering you
apps and something on I want to check it
out but I think this is very much you
know like the basement of something
really really awesome and cool coming
for everything I mean the apps that I
see on it now some of the games where
you're sort of like peeking around and
looking at things that weren't there
even a year ago is just really cool and
then that was when it was an innovator
edition or whatever they call it and now
that it's you know out there in
consumers hands developers have
more than ever reason to create really
cool app so i think is just the
beginning so i'm very excited for gear
VR and the future vr in general a great
question here from Kyle Ruggles do you
guys think manufacturers will jump
onboard USB 3.0 or 3.1 for us bc next
year I'm amazed how little tension is
got the six p + 1 + 2 are rocking us bc
but they're using USB tech that's 15
years old why is there very little talk
about this i I first off good point
there should be more talk about it
secondly I think a lot of is the fact
that so few computers have USB 3.0 ports
at this juncture there are some out
there of course but in general they're
still fairly nana ssin and their
adoption I oh um I'm not sure what the
answer was and I actually wasn't aware
that the that the 6p would sort of one
of the rare ones what I found
interesting is that the galaxy s5 for
example came with USB 3.0 and had that
kind of funky adapter you know for the
faster charging and for the faster data
speeds and all kinds of stuff like that
and then Sam sign actually went back to
two point O with the galaxy s6 and they
said it's because people weren't using
USB 3.0 it was so maybe and I really
don't know the answer and I didn't know
that it was you know so widespread I
mean aside from I don't see Mary very
many USB 3.0 ins it's because just
consumers aren't as educated on it but
maybe USBC especially with phones like
the galaxy s m and if it does start to
adopt three-point oh then maybe all
sorts take off yeah i'm i've also that i
do think we're going to say a lot more
USB type-c this year Oh more USB type-c
and I'm thrilled they'll I didn't know
that USB a lot of USB seat about to look
into it but that we're using older USB
2.1 I guess into one yeah definitely
worth looking into thank you for the
question Kyle oh let's see here
dishon from the mics wireless Sean did
you sell your samsung mega nope still
here that's because I i know i talked
about one week i thought i could get a
whole bunch for it on amazon it turned
out you only got the really great price
if you had the white version the black
version they were going to give me like
12 bucks is so weird actually never
ended up getting rid of my 1 plus 1 or
the Nexus 5 I didn't get rid of my one
because one up because I couldn't find
the charging cable and I just found it
last Friday um just a lot of them right
here that was those are the ones that we
like you know accepted the price for an
Amazon never mailed it out yeah but uh
know if I'd gotten the 200 some dollars
that they were offering for the white 1i
would shipped us off in a heartbeat but
for 12 bucks I might as well just keep
it around as a backup phone these is a
digital picture framers exactly for 12
bucks of doing I'll just keep it around
uh good memory though now let's see here
what else have we got to do from jeff k
do you guys subscribe to apple being out
of ideas and heading into a rough 16 i
think in the next four to five years
they will fall but i think the entire
mobile industry will take a dump you
know Jeff that's etc so you bring that
up because that's actually been a topic
of discussion between Todd and I quite a
lot recently that we think that mobile
overall is I think consumers in general
are getting more to the point where they
just walk in and they know that the
majority of the phones in a store are
good yeah good enough problem exactly or
they you know they know the Galaxy S
series they know the Galaxy Note series
and they don't really deviate outside of
that so I also think people are trying
to make their phones last as long as
humanly possible which I don't blame
them um that's why carriers are making
these new plans where you upgrade every
year right like give people a reason to
want a new phone or get a new phone
right
now as for Apple being out of ideas ah
that's a tough one you know a lot of
people can point to the fact that you
know oh well everything came from steep
well no I mean yes Steve Steve did a lot
there's no question but I would never I
don't think anyone at Apple would ever
say that Steve was the only person
coming up with ideas at Apple I honestly
if I was a betting man which I'm not I
would say a lot of what we're seeing
going on right now is because they're
playing a whole lot of effort into this
mystery what what do they call project
tightened the car yeah yeah I think
they're putting a lot of their efforts
into the car yeah I mean I feel like
apples a lot of ideas I mean look at in
2015 and launch the Apple watch right
which is the best-selling SmartWatch
which I know isn't saying a lot but i
think it's the start of something bigger
and i'm not saying that out is going to
dominate the industry for the seeing
future i think a lot of manufacturers
make really good watches but or actually
I should say they all don't make very
good watches so that's where there's
room for growth and actually creating
something people want um iPad pro i
think was kind of silly but that's just
me looking at it now and I haven't used
it so fair enough but you know and you
look at the macbook to which i think
should have been the macbook air should
have had no core i3 i5 processor instead
of core am but then you would have that
fanless core m design it's hard to say
because I see Apple I guess I understand
what Apple's trying to do with these
products and then you're kind of like
well that's not very exciting for us you
know as sort of huge geek so I think
they're also very appealing in some
cases for consumers and some of the
moves makes sense ipad pro you know
they're like okay well ipad air 2 is
still selling really well why would you
replace that that's why we didn't see
the ipad air three i think you know and
man when I say really well I mean it's
selling as opposed to you know the
decline just in general across tablet
sales but it seems like that's still the
most popular iPad and then so they so
they like okay like how do we get people
to upgrade their iPads right if the ipad
cheese still good enough and then they
to release a new form factor and that's
the ipad pro and i think that sort of to
me is it dud yes pace it yeah so I don't
know I I think I do think the next
couple years for mobile is going to be a
very interesting time and I think we're
going to see a lot of shake out and that
kind of leads us into what will probably
be our final question here from tlm TV
do you guys think that companies like
one plus with low Cosmo smartphones
excuse me can raise their game enough to
trouble Apple Samsung and leverage any
kind of substantial market share yes
because if they can get manufacturing to
the levels that Samsung and Apple can
and that means actually creating enough
phones to meet demand what you've seen
one plus can hardly do when they have an
invite system so that's going to be a
huge struggle for them on the other hand
I think there's proof that these
companies can compete you look at show
me and/or Xiaomi and in China which is
you know selling very low-cost devices
in computing in a lot of levels with
Samsung and Apple by creating low-cost
devices that are still very attractive
without the prices of yo Samsung and
Apple now no I I think they can
eventually challenge them and I look
forward to that day I think more
competition is always a good thing but
that is going to bring the final show of
2015 to an end and we will be back here
we will not be back here next week
