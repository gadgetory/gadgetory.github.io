sangun from TechnoBuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup we'll be
talking a bit about Apple's iPhone 6s
the new Nexus 5 microsoft surface pro 4
and new flagship Lumia devices this is
rumor roundup let's go ahead and get
started Microsoft's Windows Phone hasn't
received much love so far this year but
that's reportedly going to change in
October the redmond-based company is
expected to unleash two new flagship
devices running its new Windows 10
update and thanks to a nice little leak
we've got a pretty good look at what
these phones will look like and let me
tell you they look pretty nice Evan
blass release the to press renders late
Wednesday giving us a clear look at
Microsoft City man the blue one and the
talk man which is in black Microsoft
City man will be the more premium of the
two complete with the rumored 5.7 inch
qhd screen a snapdragon 810 processor 20
megapixel PureView camera 3,300 milliamp
battery 3 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes
of expandable storage qi wireless
charging support and even support
Windows 10 hello which will allow for
iris recognition the talk man on the
other hand is rumored to sport a 5.2
inch qhd display a snapdragon 808
processor which is only a tiny step down
from the snapdragon 810 other specs
include 32 gigabytes of expandable
storage 3 gigabytes of ram a 20
megapixel camera qi wireless charging
support USB type-c in an iris scanner
we've seen a wave of terrific android
phones over the past few months and more
are supposedly on the way combine that
with imminent arrival of new iphones and
microsoft has some pretty stiff
competition to go up against the windows
sent update coming soon these two
devices look like Microsoft's best bet
to gain a significant mobile audience
moving on to some more Microsoft rumours
it looks like Microsoft will unveiled
the surface pro 4 at a hardware focus
event in October now a new report
suggests a company could actually have
two new tablets in a pipeline for later
this year according to digitimes
Microsoft is set to announce a bigger
tablet in the second half of 2015 the
new surface will allegedly be available
with a 12 inch display or a larger
screen measuring between 13 and 14
inches across Microsoft already offers a
12 inch display with a surface pro 3 but
it looks like the rest of the industry
may be catching up apple is expected to
announce the iPad pro this fall with a
12 point 9 inch screen and it makes
sense for Microsoft to push for
with an even bigger surface if it wants
to hold on to its advantage in that
larger screen market October is just
right around a corner and we can't wait
to see what Microsoft has in store for
us the iphone 6s and 6s plus are
expected to be unveiled at apple's event
on September ninth which was just
confirm on Thursday we're expecting
force touch iOS 9 a faster a 9 processor
and more according to 9to5 mac which is
typically dead on with such rumors Apple
will introduce a 12 megapixel camera on
the iPhone 6s and 6s plus in addition it
will also support 4k video recording and
even a front-facing flash the flash
might seem like a gimmick but with the
increasing popularity of selfies it may
turn out to actually be useful for some
people 9to5 mac said part of the bump to
the 12 megapixel camera is thanks to a
new image signal processor on the new a9
chip which is reportedly being
manufactured by Samsung and TSMC finally
9to5 mac added that the front-facing
camera will support slow motion and 720p
video sounds like Apple is putting a big
focus on camera quality which is going
to be much appreciated by consumers who
might otherwise be looking at amazing
alternatives such as the galaxy s6 or
galaxy note 5 now last but not least
we're pretty excited about the new Nexus
5 even if it's still just a rumor but a
new leaked share to Weibo suggests that
LG could bring some of the same awesome
camera technology featured in the g4 to
its upcoming Nexus device the leak
offers a list of alleged specs for the
new LG Nexus the device will apparently
pack a snapdragon 808 processor a 5.2
inch 2k display 3 gigabytes of ram and a
13 megapixel sony camera sensor that's a
step down from the 16 megapixel shooter
found on the g4 though the new phone
will apparently keep LG's new optical
image stabilization technology we're
also expecting a 5 megapixel camera up
front along with a fingerprint reader in
the back and Android 6.0 marshmallow out
of the box if you're more of a phablet
fan there's also Huawei's rumored Nexus
phone which should pack a bigger display
and even more power under the hood now
if history repeats itself both devices
will likely arrive in late October
though it's always possible Google will
launch its new Nexus phones a little
early this year anyways thank you guys

rumor roundup anything that I talked
