TechnoBuffalo here and locked inside
this diminutive little package is the
Moto G the $179 smartphone it doesn't
forego much in the way aspect Department
so go take a first look at it unbox it
and see if it's worth your very little
smartphone buying buck so here is the
teeny tiny little box for the Moto G
part a smallest phone box I have ever
seen nothing really that exciting about
it though a picture the device on the
front Motorola Google company and then
some specs but we're gonna get into all
of that depicting to remember when you
take a look at this guy you consider it
it's a hundred and seventy nine bucks
which is about what most phones cost you
on a two-year contract except this guy
does not require a two-year contract so
Motorola a Google company consider this
sort of the kid brother to the Moto X
got a 4.5 inch screen compared to the
4.7 screen on the X and inside as
expected
there ain't much there's a phone there's
the charging cable it's a standard
microUSB and some books you can remove
the back plates and walks I'll show what
that looks like in just a minute but
let's take a look at this here phone and
it feels exactly like a smaller Moto X
which is to say it feels very nice go
ahead and peel off this plastic part
like can got you big plastic part
alright so after much fussing I finally
got that plastic off power the phone on
and I'll take a little bit about the
device and what it's got so you're
looking at a 4.5 inches just a lit up
screen 720 screen so that means 1280 by
720 Stephen getting the quick math in
your head it's a PPI of
if you said 326 you are a genius Android
4.3 at launch but I expect 4.4 to come
here very quickly as it already made its
way over to the Moto X being powered by
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400
processor so bear that in mind
it's got a gig of ram on here it comes
in eight or sixteen gigabyte flavours of
storage if you want external storage
you're gonna be relying on Google Drive
they did give you 50 free gigabytes of
space we've got a 5 megapixel camera on
the back and a 1.3 megapixel shooter
living right
on the front 802 11 a B G and n
Bluetooth 4.0 on here battery is that
pretty decent-sized 2070 milliamp hours
no NFC and it weighs a hundred and forty
three grams or 5.0 four ounces let me go
ahead go through the setup process I'll
come right back and take a quick look
we've got it all powered up and ready to
rock and it looks like stock Android
save for a few Motorola exclusive let's
see what we got here in the App
Department one of the big ones is moto
assist I love that you might just gloss
by it not even use it but it's great to
use when you're driving in the car and
of course does not come from a carrier
so there is no carry bloatware at all
motorola migrate and that's what we
wanted to use that we first started
transfers over all your business and
quick office comes on here right out of
the box so quick tour with advice we got
nothing on the left hand side on the
right hand side I've got a power and
lock button sitting above which sort of
reverse what we've seen usually of you
are volume up and down which is a single
button with a pressing on the top or the
bottom for what you want to do top you
got a microphone 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and on the bottom that's where your
charge and sync cable is gonna be let's
go ahead and bring in just real quickly
a Moto X for size comparison you can see
the 0.2 inch difference here and from
the back they look like little brother
big brother it's definitely a little bit
on the thicker side but not by much and
a little bit of a sharper angle up at
the top but other than that they feel
really really similar you're probably
thinking yourself
I love the Moto X I love Moto maker cuz
I could customize my phone can I do that
with this well you can't do the Moto
maker but motor doesn't want to be left
out of the customization game you can't
she replace this backplate I'm sure that
looks like you just go ahead and go
under where that Chardon sync cable is
and you sort of just pry off the back
and you can pick up different colors and
options so you can still get that
customization feel that you like the
battery though you are not going to be
able to get to and that's where your sim
is going to live the back it is plastic
but it's textured so it feels really
nice and it's it's almost flush to the
back of the phone I don't have any sort
of given you push in so it feels of very
high quality
Motorola sent us a blue one this phone
is sent to us from the folks at Moto's
PR company so go ahead pop a blue one on
you
a splash of color and then boom I've got
a new customized phone it doesn't look
like it darn it seems really around it
so you can't really even tell it it's
removable backplate but does look like
almost two phones are smashed together
you got that two-tone color if you do a
color backlight so bear that in mind but
we'll put this phone towards face take a
look at sit anything notable that we
want to share with you and of course
we'll compare it to the Moto X but I
think that you want to see about this
