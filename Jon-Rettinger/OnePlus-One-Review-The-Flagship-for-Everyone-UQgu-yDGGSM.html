from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
taking a look at this year's flagship
killer the oneplus one if you ignore the
usual release from Samsung HTC and LG
this is arguably amongst the biggest
mobile release we've seen so far this
year since its announcement in April the
oneplus one has become one of the more
sought-after devices both because of its
rarity and price just $299 virus can
pick up the 16 gigabyte so quite model
off-contract the 64 gigabyte model
meanwhile is only 349 but good luck
finding one since launched oneplus is
bet on a terrible invite system to
distribute its handset making the device
nearly impossible to buy even today
after a few months it was announced the
phone still isn't available to purchase
publicly but not only that the company
has been at the center of a lot of bad
press for its customer servers oneplus
hasn't exactly endeared itself to a
world of technology so far still people
are hype and are willing to forgive but
is the device even worth the headache
that's what we're here to find out now
let's start off with the basic
specifications the oneplus one is
rocking a beautiful 5.5 inch 1080p
display with 401 PPI 3100 milliamp
battery 2.5 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor with adreno 330
GPU and 3 Google bytes of RAM now
depending on which model you choose you
either get the 16 gigabyte or 64
gigabyte internal storage though neither
support microSD expansion it also sports
a 13 megapixel Sony Exmor sensor with 6
lenses dual LED flash along with the
ability to record 4k video in
slow-motion 720p videos at 120 frames
per second the phone is really fast and
we didn't really notice any lag with
this device you play games browse the
web with multiple tabs watch videos and
open up a ton of apps yet the device is
still super quick multitasking is super
quick too and overall the whole thing is
just really responsive now as I said
before the oneplus one sports a 5.5 inch
screen and it just looks beautiful
though it's no better than the Galaxy s5
or the HTC One m8 but it is an IPS
display and comes with what oneplus one
is calling touch on lens technology
which removes the distance between the
touch sensor and a display panel set the
screen instantaneously responds to even
the slightest touch it's also equipped
with Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the
device's screen from scratches and usual
wear and tear now the color of the
screen is very active
it's not overly vibrant the way the
super amoled display would be on a
Samsung device in my opinion photos
videos games and all of that look great
if you're not satisfied with how the
screen looks you can actually tweak it
the default setting is standard but
there's also a vivid and custom option
where you can change things like hue
saturation and contrast now some people
were complaining about a yellow tint
that appeared on their one but we don't
really have that issue in either one of
our 1+1 devices and for a device is just
$299 off-contract we expected the cheap
price to reflect poorly on the design
but the oneplus one feels much more
premium than the price suggests as good
if not better than some of the top
Android devices available now featuring
a design that most closely matches
something like the Oppo find 7 the
oneplus one sports a curved back and
slim profile that's very clean and look
at 1 + said it was determined to build
something that can go toe-to-toe with
the best devices out there and it shows
the textured back on a sandstone black
model we've been using feels awesome it
feels like a really fine sandpaper and
not all that rough it's worth mentioning
that it does attract dust and other
smaller particles that we can be easily
cleaned and you can't really smudge it
up with fingerprints up front is a nice
5.5 inch display all complemented by a
chrome outer rim that adds an extra
touch of luxury the display itself is
raised slightly too which creates a nice
frame with a chrome rim when it's all
polished up and clean it looks sunny you
almost don't want to touch it since it
looks so nice everything from the
ergonomic back to the button placement
is perfect - the power button is placed
on the devices right side and is really
comfortable to press meanwhile the slim
volume rocker is placed near the middle
of the left side and is mostly easy to
use on the top is a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and on the
bottom is a micro USB connection flanked
on each side by stereo speaker which are
loud and sounds great also around the
devices are three microphones on the top
back and the bottom so the oneplus one
has two cameras one 13 megapixel shooter
up in the back with Sony's Exmor sensor
and a 5 megapixel shooter up in the
front that has a wide-angle non
distorted lens the oneplus one really
impressed me with its camera the images
I took with this phone are just
beautiful the 13 megapixel Sony Exmor
sensor produce nice detailed shots and
since the apertures that f/2 images
provided a nice depth of field now the
stock camera app makes it easy to
quickly shoot and change settings on a
go unfortunately the oneplus one doesn't
offer any optical image stabilization
but what it's already beast of a camera
there's not much to complain about so
the battery under 1+1 is non removable
but it's still packin the beastly 3100
battery oneplus was definitely listening
to consumers when it comes to battery
life as battery life 1:1 is amazing I
have pushed email refreshing every five
minutes and other social networks
pushing notifications I make a few phone
calls and messages throughout my day and
by the time I get home from the office
never have I had to worry about plugging
the oneplus one as soon as I get home
like I knew what my 5s I got still keep
going
only when going to bed around 10:00 or
11:00 that I need to plug it in so you
could say that the battery is one of the
selling points at this phone as well now
the oneplus one is running CyanogenMod
11 s which is based out of stock Android
4.4.2 kitkat now see energon mod is one
of the main reason why this phone is so
great with the ability to customize
pretty much every part of the phone from
the home screen to the lock screen you
can easily install new themes icons
fonts and much more all the Google
services come pre-installed meeting you
have access to apps like Gmail Google
Maps Chrome and even Google now which is
always great to have there's also some
really cool gestures built in within
Santa janmaat 11's like the ability to
turn on the screen with just two taps
and locking the device by double tapping
on a status bar other gestures include
drawing a circle on the lock screen to
bring up the camera although you can
also swipe left on the lock screen to
access the camera as well and you can
also draw a V to turn on the two LED
flash in the back and for the most part
they're great but I found them to be a
hit or miss most at a time more than
once I pulled the device out of my
pocket and found one of the gestures
have been accidentally activated it is a
bit annoying but you also have the
option to turn them off if you prefer
other features that's included with
Santa mod are the ability to turn on or
off ik+ and software buttons and even
add more software buttons to the screen
now within the two weeks we tested this
device we didn't really experience any
app crashes or reboots Sandage and mod
11 now seems to be a really stable build
and it runs very well into one now
obviously since this is a phone it's got
to make phone calls so we use both the
Chinese and global version the one we
have right here on t-mobile in the call
quality was great people were hearing me
just fine but the person who was talking
to I could barely hear I had the volume
all the way up and it seemed a bit too
low for my taste even if I use a
speakerphone it's not as loud as we'd
like now I'm sure that's something that
a software update can fix but other than
that little thing everything else was
great LTE speeds were off the charts
with t-mobile so to wrap things up I'd
give them one plus one an 8.5 out of 10
why there's so many reason why this
phone could be your next smartphone it's
got a beautiful 5.5 inch screen the
camera is great
I've got LTE great processor and three
gigabyte
of RAM it's running CyanogenMod 11s out
of the box and last but not least the
price the price is comparable to
something like the Nexus 5
although the Nexus 5 is already
available via the Google Play Store
while the oneplus one is still an
invite-only program upon making this
video of course not every device that's
not on the market will be perfect there
will always be little quirks but the few
we mentioned here could probably be
fixed with a software update so what do
you guys think of the oneplus one is it
really the next flagship killer let us
know in the comments down below and
maybe we'll give one away to one of you
guys and as always a Marklin saying it
from TechnoBuffalo
i'll see you guys in the next video
thank you guys for watching please
subscribe right here to be the first
ones to know whenever new videos get
uploaded we got a ton of stuff we do
phones tablets cars anything has to do
with consumer electronics has to be
plugged in or uses batteries we review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
