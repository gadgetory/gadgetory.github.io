technobuffalo here with an android
smartphone smackdown on the left-hand
side we have the Challenger the HTC
built evo 4g running on sprint's network
and on the right-hand side we have the
defending champion the droid incredible
running on verizon wireless so during
these tests we're going to cover some of
the key features we're going to go
respect speed some differences between
the two we're all totally going to
declare a winner so let's talk about the
geeky geeky specs and get those out of
the way the first thing you're gonna we
look at these two devices is the screen
size on the evo is huge it is a 4.3 inch
screen which is significantly large
versus a 3.7 inch screen found on the
droid incredible both interestingly
enough five screen resolutions of 480 x
800 which means the incredible has a
higher pixel ratio per inch then you're
going to see on the evo something to
keep in mind battery is going to be a
big concern with both these devices the
evo packs a fifteen hundred million of
our battery and principe 1300 on the
incredible the evo these different
screen technologies as well they're both
sort of multi-touch capable capacitive
screens but the evo uses TFT technology
whereas the incredible used amyloid they
let me go through this you'll see some
differences between the two and I'll
highlight them as we go along as well
from a memory standpoint they both have
512 megabytes of RAM whereas the evo has
1024 megabytes of ROM compared to 512
megabytes on the incredible both have 8
megapixel cameras with LED flash which
are very very impressive however the evo
can shoot HD video at 1280 x 77 2270 p
whereas incredible shoots video at wvga
which comes out to 800 x 480 so a big
difference there I'm sure going through
the general specs are both running
android 2.1 with HTC sense UI and they
both have the same processor the
Qualcomm built one
heard snapdragon processor which is very
very capable all right let's go ahead
and talk about what I use phones for the
most probably you use phones and votes
as well internet so we both are running
on different networks who got sprint on
one and we have around isn't on the
other and network to network speed out
about one to two bars here where I am so
see this is a fair comparison we're
going to load up TechnoBuffalo calm it's
like that's been loaded on each multiple
times so it'll be a representation of a
site visit on a regular basis but before
we start doing anything i want in seat
we're starting from the same basis here
so i'm going to use task killer to kill
all running applications use it here on
the EVO kill all selected apps alright
let's go ahead and launch this up so
we'll go to internet on each and will
queue up technobuffalo
all right you've got the URL ready to go
on each I'm going to go and hit go at
the same time and again this is a
network speed test we've gone to two
bars of evdo rev a 3g service on the
incredible and we've got two bars of 3g
service evdo rev a on sprint's the evo
4g is obviously a 4g capable device
however i don't have 4g where i'm at so
we can't test those blazing blazing
speeds we'll talk about them in a few
minutes let's go ahead and hit those
green button same time and we are off
and I've tested many sites using both
networks and give you a sort of a tail
button off the speeds we're going to see
here representative of what I saw
overall looks like Sprint's got a little
bit of an edge here contents already
showed up on the EVO just showing up
there now on incredible and Sprint's is
done and Verizon looks like it's still
loading this is pretty fair for what
I've seen generally the evo loaded web
pages about one to two seconds faster
than I saw on the incredible something
to keep in mind now as you can see here
there's some content sort of moving
around that's because both of these are
capable of flash so you can't play flash
content however don't have thoughts of
Hulu because hulu is not going to play
on either of these don't even ask I
tried the first thing I tried I got so
excited with something to keep in mind
so as I mentioned both our multi-touch
pinch-to-zoom now and because they both
have the same screen resolution they're
going to show the same content how are
things are just going to look bigger on
the 4.3 inch free text is going to be a
bit easier to read because it's going to
be a bit larger and less strain on your
eyes something to sort of keep in mind
as you're looking at these so i will say
click on an article here i'll
double-click you can see it's sort of
zoom up in the text looks nice and clear
same thing here an incredible can see
that they both show exactly the same
thing it's just a little bit larger here
on the EVO so let's go ahead and turn on
Wi-Fi and do a speed test to see if that
is any difference i'm going to do this
live on camera so you can see that
there's no funny business going on we're
getting go to settings wireless networks
turn on Wi-Fi do the same
here as well you can see that Wi-Fi is
now turned on incredible and it should
be turned on in just a moment here on
the EVO and now it is we're going to go
ahead and reload TechnoBuffalo and we're
going to see if there's any sort of
speed difference as well the back up to
the top hit the green buttons on each
one more time and i'll see if the speeds
are the same forget the same results
yeah this is loading component see
difference between the screen technology
is a TFT and amyloid that's a personal
preference thing I personally like the
way the TFT looks and without while I
was still talking both these loaded it
almost exactly the same time and that
was definitely what I saw spec for spec
they're pretty close to identical as far
as processing power that translates it's
a real world load time something to keep
in mind so let's talk about this big
screen size if it's something to see the
pro for some or a con for others it is
big certainly we SAT these two on top of
each other you can certainly see that
there is a difference if you wear if
you're an emo can you wear tight jeans
you have a hard time fitting the evo in
your pocket and the incredible is going
to be the way to go however if you've
gone through some loose fitting pants
and you fit things in your pockets a lot
I think the screen size on the evo is
just about as large as tolerable for a
smartphone but that screen size makes a
few things kind of interesting for
example typing is very easy to do on the
evo because the screen is so big the
keyboard is just as large even now when
it's in portrait you've got a very large
keyword look at this keyboard now on the
incredible let's go ahead and launch it
up as well in here so new message and
you can see the difference is there
between the two keyboards I mean one is
much larger you put your finger over a
key and see what it covers the same here
we switched over into landscape
difference is even more noticeable I'm
the keyboard is just huge if you made
any errors when you're typing or you got
big fingers it's definitely going to be
something
you're going to want to keep in mind i
think the keyboards on android phones
are fantastic as they are and HTC made
them even better the autocorrect
features on here probably second to none
and I think that there even are starting
to to pass those seen on the iphone so
you know if you're not used to a non
physical keyboard having a larger ones
you're going to reduce your mistakes
it's go ahead and kick these both back
up into landscape mode let's continue to
talk about differences because there are
still a lot more to cover with these two
devices I get them back and focus here
so the big differences here is obviously
4G and screen size so if you're
fortunate enough to be near 4G network
so going to be a no-brainer decision for
you you're going to get speeds of up of
up of a 10 megabits per second down
which where a mobile phone is totally
unheard of so there are two other things
we want to talk about as well first
let's discuss camera since you already
talked about the back let's talk about
the front the evo 4g has a 1.3 front
facing camera hiding right above the
sprint logo and that can be used for
video calling video chatting you can use
a regular camera for pictures or video
you can use it over quick you can use it
over fring or any other skype plugin and
it does work quite well over a Wi-Fi
quality for a clear over 3g it does get
a bit choppy but it's nice to have
either nice to have that option 4g again
is that a big difference display is sort
of the piece de resistance here 3.7
inches versus 4.3 one cool thing that
the evo does brings the table which are
starting to see in a few more
smartphones as actually hdmi out so on
the bottom there right next to the USB
port there is an hdmi you can see it
labeled right there hdmi you can plug
this into your television and you can
actually watch a video right from your
phone on your flat screen which is kind
of neat the Yugo also bring something
new to the table brings youtube HD or
higher quality youtube videos you can
watch on its board is this boy and sort
of speaking of video it also has on the
back a kickstand which you go ahead and
kick right out see that right there and
you can use it to prop it up while
are watching your content it's not a
huge feature but I have fun that's be
quite nice I like to watch sometimes
from YouTube videos I'm in bed or
sitting at a desk it doesn't make it a
lot easier than holding the phone in
your hand and if you watch the video
when you're on an airplane for example
you're going to really appreciate that
kickstand go ahead push that back design
there another some key differences here
as well the incredible has an optical
trackpad which you can use to serve able
to get around and I like having that you
lose out on that on the EVO 4G history
relying only on your finger to navigate
around both do have the same for
capacitive buttons across the bottom
although the circles around these to
make them do look physical but rest
assured they are just capacitive buttons
so let's sort of recap differences here
between the two first 4g is sort of the
main one of the display the 4.3 which is
3.7 hdmi out one last thing is that
sprint is capable of being used as a
mobile hotspot i'll be afore additional
fee but if you are near 4G it's
certainly going to be worth it they have
connect up to eight devices over Wi-Fi
using 4g speeds it's actually going to
be fast enough to do some gaming on
teams will keep in mind up for that as
well designs a bit different HD quality
video is something that's really is a
big determining factor if you want to
ditch your let's say flip minnow or
pocket up HD video camera you can do
that now with the 720p recording
capabilities of the evo and then finally
the front basic camera is sort of the
big difference as well if all things are
equal if you have good sprint coverage
you have good Verizon coverage and you
can pick up either phone on a new
contract it seems to be a very clear
decision for me that the evo 4g just
brings a lot more which is really a
testament to how good the phone is
because the incredible does so much in
this so much so well but at the end of
the day for new capabilities
front-facing camera larger screen hdmi
out really do it for me with the evo
I've been very happy with sprint's
covered in service where it's available
or two very well I'm very few drop calls
call quality on each are fantastic
certainly you can't go wrong with
ridings network but you do have sprint
service where you are I think you'd be
hard-pressed to not go
with the evo 4g sorry guys i'm jon
