the table here it's very hard to tell
the difference between them they all
look like projectors but that's about it
they all have real differences that
affect how you might want to actually
use them now if you Sonic reached out
and asked to sponsor a video so that we
can help make your projector buying
decision a little bit easier what to
look for and how to tell the difference
between these white boxes okay so even
though there are differences still a lot
is the same between these they are all
1080p and resolution they all use a lamp
which is what produces the light there
are all DLP projectors and they're all
meant to be used in the home of course
you could use these in other
environments but home is the primary
focus reading the product names doesn't
really get you any closer to
understanding these projectors either we
have the px 700 HD coming in at $499 the
PX 706 HD coming in at $6.99 and the PX
725 HD coming in at 679 and they each
specialized in more or less one thing
first is the px 700 HD this is the
projector you buy if you just want to
get up and running easily and start
consuming content it has HDMI in the
back like all these projectors do but
there's also a USB port that is powered
so you can plug in your chromecast a
fire stick or your Roku and power it
from the projector itself without
needing to plug anything else into the
wall it's also rated at 3500 lumens with
a 16 millisecond input latency so you'll
be able to watch more content in more
places this brightness also means that
you don't have to have a treated room
you can watch it anywhere even if
there's ambient light this is a great
option for those who want a projector
but don't necessarily want to dedicate
the resources to a full fledged
entertainment room you would easily use
this to consume content on a up to 300
inch screen not to mention it also has
3d capability if that's something you're
looking for and it's a great long-term
solution as well the lamp is rated at
15,000 hours so you won't have to
replace it nearly as fast now next is
the px 706 HD this is very similar to
the first projector and almost has the
same features but this is packing even
more this is really meant for gaming and
smaller spaces this has a short throw
lens built in so you can have it very
close to the wall and still get an up to
100 inch image with these other two
projectors you have to have them set up
farther away now it also has 16.4
millisecond input latency it has a sonic
expert speaker which for a projector
actually gets loud enough to use which
you don't see very often and on top of
that 3d support 20 2001 contrast ratio
USBC for easy one cable connection and a
zoom feature that lets you adjust the
size of the display this is a
full-featured projector for a smaller
space and if you're in a gaming
now finally we have the P X 725 HD this
is the projector you want
if image quality is your goal it has
much better color accuracy it has a
slightly lower brightness level at 2000
lumens but with rec.709 color accuracy
and a faster color will you get more
vivid images and a smoother color
variation you can also customize your
own color profile to get exactly what
you want and it's ISF certified and you
can calibrate the image for day and
night viewing it doesn't have some of
the features that the other projectors
have but that's not the goal of this
projector color accuracy is so those are
the differences between these projectors
and kind of what to look for when
purchasing a projector first you make
sure that you know you want it for
and the what feature is most important
to you then you find what fits best if
you're looking for a great all-around
entertainment projector or you want one
for gaming or want one with the best
color accuracy even though these
projectors physically look more or less
the same they are very different if you
pick the right one
you should be happy before we head out

one of these projectors we're running a
giveaway where you can enter to win one
