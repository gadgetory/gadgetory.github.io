lakers calm here with a review for you
of the samsung epix it's a new windows
mobile 6.1 handset that was released
just a few weeks ago on a TNT's network
i'm going to try and make this more a
review of the phone itself and less a
review or a dissertation on Windows
Mobile so let's get started with a real
quick hardware overview of the phone
first thing that you'll notice is it
looks very similar to the samsung
blackjack in blackjack 2 and the old
trio is meeting its got a full qwerty
keyboard on the front and a touch screen
right there in this case the 320 x 320
resistive touchscreen meaning it's got a
little bit of squish to the screen the
taps are registered by the two thin
layers being pushed together so in the
front of it there's your full qwerty
keyboard and this in the middle that
looks like a d-pad is actually an
optical trackpad you can move your
finger along and it actually looks like
a mouse on the screen the arrow follows
you around where you're doing it it's
actually a very handy and a very quick
feature to get used to if you don't like
it you can very easily turn it off and
the stern it to a standard d-pad with
swipes up to go up and down to go down
hardware-wise we've got two soft keys
the left softkey and a right softkey
send key and a lock and n key on the
front full qwerty keyboard with
shortcuts down below you've got a
shortcut for pocket internet explorer
calendar camera and mail right there so
few handy shortcuts and those can be
programmed for anything else well the
icons on their make it easy to remember
what's what on the left side of device
got the power on button right there a
very easy to reach volume toggle on the
right side of device we've got your
papaya Samsung proprietary charging and
headset port there is not a 3.5
millimeter headset jack but there is an
adapter you can plug right in there
without any trouble and what nice people
i like to see is a microSD slot on the
side which is available without taking
out the battery and it is hot swappable
of course so you can just take that out
push in your microSD card and you are
good to go on the back of the device
you've got a 2 megapixel camera with a
self-portrait near and a soft plastic
back
the whole phone is made of plastic and
it does have a nice solid feel to it in
addition on the back of the device there
is pull it out that a three-way
collapsible stylus for use with the
touch screen this samsung epix unlike
some of the HTC phones is not skinned
meaning Windows Mobile is as microsoft
built it on here with the standard
windows mobile home screen so everything
that you need to do really need to be
done on the stylist it's not very finger
friendly let me go ahead and close this
up here and put that back in and let's
talk about the best features of the
phone this thing has a monster battery
i'll show you guys in a little bit it's
an 1800 milliamp hour battery I didn't
charge his phone for four days and
that's with heavy internet usage phone
calls the battery in this thing is
unbelievable for a 3g phone I have never
used any any 3g phone that can last for
that long my iphone for example which is
the 3g version lucky to get through a
day without a charge so congratulations
to samsung the battery really makes up a
lot of the half to the phone and reason
the phone is as thick as it is during my
unboxing i did a size comparison with
the iphone so you can go ahead and check
that out if you like to see some more
sizes on it the keyboard on the phone is
very good very similar to the black jack
and the blackjack to it is easy to use
the keys are small but with a little bit
of care you can get the right key
presses without much difficulty so i do
like the keyboard is hard to get a full
front facing cory keyboard to be very
wide spaced but samsung did do a nice
job with that they really didn't fix it
wasn't broken so that's a nice feature
the trackpad in here like i mentioned
it's actually very easy to use and i
really did get used to it very quickly
um almost the first time i was using the
phone the epics does come with haptic
feedback meaning every button you touch
the phone vibrates a bit let me tell you
that gets annoying so quickly the whole
phone vibrates almost like it's ringing
just for a quick second it's unnecessary
it's a little bit laggy so you'll push
it and you'll feel almost like a second
later it vibrates
I'm not a fan of the haptic feedback so
the phone itself if you look at the
keyboard here you've got your white
number rose going all the way down but
the nice thing is it since this is a
touchscreen you don't have to use those
numbers if you want to dial it does have
a full keypad well the keypad itself is
a little difficult to use it's small the
screen is small it's kind of hard to
dial with the resistive touchscreen so
not such a fan of the keypad that you
have to use the dial let me go ahead and
turn this thing off and show you guys a
battery because it's very hard to
appreciate how big it is until you
actually see it so go ahead and pull the
back of the softer so you can still see
the thickness of the divisor then pull
out this monster battery why didn't need
the stylist to do it grab that out we
will pull this out here alright so the
batteries out just get a sense of how
big it I mean that really is there's the
phone there's a battery the thickness of
the phone really is this monster
behemoth of a battery 1800 milliamp
hours I would gladly have a thicker
phone to have a battery of this capacity
so again I really have to give Samsung
credit and that made the phone much more
enjoyable in my opinion glad put that
battery back in here reception wise the
phone was just as good as than any other
phone i've used of any windows mobile
phone iphone even the g one I was using
last week really reception wise was fine
collars on the other ends had no problem
hearing me I know probably hearing them
they did say there sounds like a little
bit of white noise but it might have
just been my location so call quality
was good speaker volume on the handset
is actually outstanding speakers are
quite loud it's a very large speaker
grill at the top of the device right
there so the speaker phone was fantastic
cameras 2 megapixel you're not gonna be
Ansel Adams taking any professional
photography shots with this but it's not
bad decent for a camera phone
it's fine for a quick snap at a party or
take a picture of your friends to show
them later so not a problem there
hardware-wise the phone is fantastic
while it is made of plastic it does feel
solid and nice in the hand it's got a
little bit of heft probably from that
monster battery but it does feel nice
and it does feel solid and it's
certainly a pocketable device despite
its size so I really did enjoy that what
I don't like and still what this phone
cannot overcome as its fatal flaw is
windows mobile 6.1 at least on skinned
it's not finger friendly anything you
want to do you seemly have to take out a
stylus and you have to start tapping
away so it really takes anything those
one-handed operation now becomes two
handed operation I think you lose some
of the joy of a touch screen when you
can't operate it with one hand I've used
Windows Mobile standard before so the
non-touch screen version and I'm almost
preferential with that that's much
easier for one-handed operation you can
scroll down with buttons this just seems
much more difficult to use and didn't
play to the strength of the phone it
didn't use the hardware as well as it
could of with a phone that has this
capacity I think Samsung should have put
some sort of skin on it certainly
nothing like touchflo 3d like HTC is
done but I know Samsung does have some
proprietary skins for instance the
widgets that's found on the omnia so
that would have been a very welcome
feature overall I've been very happy
with the phone but I just can't get over
the windows mobile side of it I was
really trying to give Windows Mobile a
shot but 6.1 just didn't quite cut at my
opinion so on a one-to-five scale I was
just grading the phone itself I would
give the phone a solid for just for
hardware and feel but overall I'll bring
system and phone using experience I
really got to give the phone at three
out of five so guys jon rettinger with
john for lakers calm hope you enjoyed
the review of the samsung omnia make
that the samsung epix rather and this
phone is currently available through
AT&amp;amp;T service so hop on down to your AT&amp;amp;T
store or online it's available for 449
with a no commitment pricing with
two-year contract it's 299 with a
hundred-dollar mail-in rebate breaking
the price to 1 99 99 and the rebates you
do get that rebate gift card in the mail
so guys I hope you enjoyed this review
of the samsung epix if it's a phone
you're looking for if you're a fan of
windows mobile and go ahead and get it I
think you'll be very happy with it if
you're looking for something to replace
an iphone or something that is a little
more one-handed and user-friendly
recommend looking elsewhere alright guys
