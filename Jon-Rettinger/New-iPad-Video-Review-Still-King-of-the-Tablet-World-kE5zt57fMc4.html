technobuffalo here the new ipad is out
it's been available for a few weeks
we've had it in our TechnoBuffalo labs
testing it I've been using it every day
to try and give you the most
comprehensive review from a user someone
who's actually tested everything about
the tablet put it through all of its
paces to try and give you guys the most
comprehensive review and help you make
the choice whether or not the new iPad
is going to be right for you let's go
ahead and get started so with the new
iPad the more things have changed the
more they stayed the same the new iPad
is nearly identical in looks to the
outgoing ipad 2 sure it's a little bit
thicker and it's a little bit heavier
but for the most part they look almost
exactly the same they got that same
aluminum back they've got the same
colored bezel and the screen wall
powered off you really can't see a
difference so it's available in a ton of
different models you've got a 16 gig 32
gig 64 gig Wi-Fi then you can throw 4g
on top of that prices ranging from 499
all the way up to eight hundred and
thirty dollars shipping with iOS 5.1 but
certainly that will get upgraded from
dimension standpoint 9.5 inches by 7.31
inches by point three seven inches
weighs one point four four pounds that's
point 11 pounds heavier than the ipad 2
others play is that same 9.7 inch retina
display or try a 9.7 inch screen it's
now a Retina display it's an IPS screen
the resolution of 240 8 x 1536 42.5 watt
hours apple says can be good for about
10 hours on Wi-Fi or nine hours on 4g
processor we're looking at an a 5 X 1
gigahertz dual-core chip with quad-core
for graphics we've got a gig of ram in
here so we've got a 5 megapixel camera
that can shoot video at 1080p it's
actually the same lens system as the
iphone 4s on the front we've got the
same vga camera that we had on the ipad
2 4g LTE on both verizon and AT&amp;amp;T the
big upgrade here's of course our retina
display found on the new ipad and
fortunately the biggest upgrade is also
the one that i can't really show you
it's not going to adjust
to see it streamed on whatever you're
watching this video on but I will do my
best to show you some of the highlights
if you saw the video I did comparing
this to the ipad 2 that's the best way
you can see a difference the pixels are
extremely bright there's many more to be
lit up here so there's been want to talk
about the ipad heating up thought to be
appropriate to show it here with some
fire I has run a little bit warm but I
haven't any sort of extreme heating
issues that others are reporting so at
least in my model that appears to be a
little bit blown out of proportion text
looks absolutely incredible I never
thought the screen on the ipad 2 was bad
in fact it always looked pretty good to
me but this definitely looks better
extremely crisped I always had a hard
time reading books or long articles on
LCD display it hurt my eyes I preferred
ink I've had a much easier time though
on the new iPad so if you've run into
issues similar to that definitely gonna
be a reason to want to consider the new
iPad let's talk about something that I
can show you speed eid speed speed and
speed we now have an upgraded a5x chip
this is an extremely fast tablet go
ahead and watching something like Angry
Birds that's been stored in memory it'll
launch very very quickly there you go
angry birds space go ahead and get your
space camion actually can check out a
full review we did of this game it's
actually been one of my favorite games
out there but things just work and they
work very well new look beautifully what
beautiful wall you're doing them it's
going to take a look at something like
infinity blade which traditionally has a
very long load time it's currently one
of the most graphically intensive games
but it looks absolutely beautiful here
the benefit of the new iPad versus the
outgoing certainly quad-core graphics
but we should see those benefits come in
the coming months is developer start to
take advantage of what the new iPad can
do we need to see software optimized for
the hardware so not a giant difference
right now between the new iPad and the
ipad d but presumably this is going to
show itself as a gaming powerhouse the
camera certainly better and definitely
improved video quality on the new iPad
is certainly improved as well 1080p
video and the 5 megapixel sensor
definitely takes nice pictures
the speaker on this guy while looking
almost the same is markedly ladder so if
you use your speaker to play music or if
use it for skype you're going to get a
much better experience and also the
built-in microphone seems to work a
little bit better as well so if you're
courting video you're going to get a
much higher audio fidelity here so in
conclusion this is very much the same
iPad that we've seen before but better
in almost every way but it's still far
far from perfect I wish we had an
improved operating system I would like
to see widgets I think notifications
could be revamped to be less obtrusive
you've got notification center but you
still have to go through a few steps
access that I keep referencing back to
webos the way I handled notifications I
would love to see something similar
baked into the next operating system iOS
6 hopefully so despite its shortcomings
this is still the best tablet on the
market it is head and shoulders better
than anything else available from a
tablet world it's the iPad then there's
everything else on the phone world there
are tremendous amount of phones and
operating systems that work equally well
in some cases a lot better than iOS but
in the tablet realm the iPad certainly
reigns supreme so is it worth getting
yes it's absolutely worth getting if you
have an iPad 2 you might want to
reconsider the upgrade if you need LTE
if you do a lot of traveling it's
definitely going to be a reason to want
to go ahead and force the upgrade if you
do a lot of pictures or video chatting
on your iPad you might want to consider
the upgrade despite the fact the front
facing camera is exactly the same the
screen is certainly a nice addition but
I never thought the screen on the iPad
to look particularly bad have that
double resolution is very nice with the
284 x 1536 but it's by no means a
must-have if you're coming from an ipad
one absolutely worth the upgrade if
you're looking to first jump into the
tablet world the new ipad is going to be
a wonderful addition this is my tablet
of choice this is what I carry with me
when I'm on the road the ipad is a
tremendous workhorse as far as media
consumption goes certainly not and is
not meant to be a desktop replacement
you know we hear that post-pc
f thrown around quite a bit the ipad
certainly assuring in that era but we're
not there yet I'm very curious to see
what Microsoft does with windows 8 and
how they bridge that gap between a true
OS and a mobile OS so what do you guys
think I'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo this has been a full
review of the new iPad I'll see you guys
in the next video bye buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
