you I know things have been a little bit
weird between us especially the past few
weeks and I owe it to you to least be up
front you know we've been moving
together for two years you know I've
gone through and got you all the
upgrades that you've wanted a gotta new
3g of up cue from eight to 16 gauge and
we've had a lot of really really good
times together and I know things have
been awkward and you've probably heard
your friends talk and maybe they've even
you know seeing some things but I
thought it would be better if well you
just heard it from me um I have been
seeing other phones and I know that it
was disrespectful to you and I know that
on some level you always knew that I was
seeing other phones you know I'm sure
you get I'm sure you heard it from your
friends but you know you don't you owe
it to hear it from me I'm not just
telling you because I was worried about
getting caught you know I'm just telling
you because I felt bad you know you've
been fantastic iphone I mean we've had
such good times together I remember when
we first started seeing each other a
couple years ago and I opened up your
Safari browser and I couldn't believe
how much you looked like the real
internet you aren't like this pocket
Internet Explorer garbage you were the
real thing and I felt the connection
with you it was absolutely amazing and
kind of as the years went by you know
things got stale on it doesn't look that
we met them when you get stale I was
just one of those things that happens in
a relationship and it's not that I don't
still have feelings for you I'm always
going to have a place for you but
sometimes I just need some variety you
know you don't do and I don't get
offended you don't do all the tricks
that the other phones do you know
sometimes I need to multitask sometimes
I have to send it mms okay you know it's
embarrassing sometimes you tell my
friends hey you know I'm going out with
iphone and I thought well that's great
you know send me
sheron's I can't sometimes you know I
need to do that oh I'm sorry in the way
that I went about it I should have been
upfront with you um I've been seeing
palm for for a few weeks now and I
really like palm but it doesn't mean
that I still don't have feelings for you
easy calm down palms not a floozy palm
doesn't necessarily know my situation
palm didn't know that you know I've been
the two-year relationship with with the
iphone you know didn't know that so
what's not palms fault it's my fault I
take responsibility for it you know I'm
not saying that I want to move on
completely I'm just saying that I need
variety sometimes you know you're still
always going to be the one that's going
to be charging next to my bed at night
you're still going to be the one that
I'm always gonna want in my pocket I'm
going to come home to you every night
iphone but sometimes during the day I'm
gonna go out I'm gonna have to see how
the phones you know whether it's Palm
this week or samsung jack a couple weeks
ago blackberry storm or even new
blackberry curve you know I'm still
gonna have to see them say hello see
what they have to offer but I'm always
going to come home to you iphone no
matter what I'm still going to come back
to you and don't don't cry I know you
just got your upgrades I know now you've
got a camcorder and that's fantastic you
know when your compass app is going to
be really useful for when I go hiking
but sometimes I still interested that
spice and variety I hope
understand and I want to be upfront with
you and to make sure you know sort of
where I'm coming from that being said I
phone you know I would still like us to
stay together and maybe having a little
bit of an open relationship you know I
may be using some other phones right now
and then but still I phone you're going
to be the one that I'm going to take
with me on vacation you're going to be
the one that I'm going to take home to
my parents you're going to be the one
that I'm going to reduce my friends too
that's who you are you're that secure
stable influence in my life the other
phones you're through the flames just
things that I'm trying out seeing how
they work but I'm always going to come
back to you so I want to know iphone if
that's okay with you this your open
relationship I suppose we'll work I want
you in my life you're always going to be
my main phone you're always going to be
the one that I'm gonna just pop my sim
card in and we'll go away together we'll
i'll take you to work you're still going
to be the one I'm going to use for for
email and for web browsing your web
browsing is still so good and I think
really above anything else even palm but
I I just sometimes need a little bit of
a variety and it doesn't mean that I
don't love you and I know I'm rambling
but I just wanted to be upfront so I
join I hope you understand I'm not
breaking up with you at all I don't
think I could ever break up with you I
just want to let you know that i am
gonna have some variety in my days but
still at night iphone you're gonna be
the one that i am going to come home to
so you know we can talk about it i'll
give you some time to think it over and
just know if this coming from the bottom
of my heart I just felt that I owed you
an honest explanation of what's going on
you know it was wrong of me when I was
using these other phones to bring a
video camera in a mix you know I know
that was probably a little bit
disrespectful and in retrospect I
shouldn't have done it but it's done in
the past the videos are up there you
know and I'll be more careful with with
what with what i use my video camera
learn what I take pictures with what
right about you know and I just hope
that you understand i phone I'm still
always going to have a place my heart
for you and I still always want to be
with you sometimes i'm going to try out
other phones that's just the way it goes
and you know i hope that you understand
and that we can move on with our lives
together so anyway iphone thank you for
for listening and for letting me talk
and for hopefully understanding it'll
give you some time you can think about
it and get back to me and you know we
can hopefully take a relationship
further and maybe this will even bring
us stronger together iphone you know
they say Sean which relationships are
forged to diversity and we're going
through a tough time in right now but I
know that we can work through this and I
know we can push through and get ahead
we can still be hats happy as we were
two years ago so anyway I phone I just
want to tell you I thought I owed you an
explanation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
