the Xbox 360 and three years since the
ps3 hit the market to this day there's
been endless debate on which console is
number one each camp has hordes of
fanboys ready to swarm to the defense
against any attack against their
preferred platform just visit news for
gamers or any other game blog and
there's bound to be a dispute or debate
on the subject both devices are now well
into their product cycle and the time
for excuses is now over and in this
series of videos I'll be comparing the
devices on a level playing field where
we are right now in fall 209 I'm going
to be covering all the aspects of the
devices hardware accessories price and
functionality the user experience both
online and offline we're also going to
be comparing the top exclusive and
multi-platform games of fall 209 it's
all going to be covered in depth so get
ready for 12 rounds of heavyweight game
console action it's LP from
TechnoBuffalo
and welcome to the console war showdown
so we're gonna start off this matchup
with a thorough analysis and comparison
of the controllers after all the
controllers are the physical extensions
that connect the machine to the man in a
sense wow that was deep
anyway game controllers have evolved
quite a lot in the past thirty years and
I remember being amazed by the 8-bit
Nintendo controller after having used
the clunky Atari 2600 joysticks
I also remember going to school and the
teachers asking me what happened to my
hands after I had band-aids on my thumbs
well I'll tell you what happened Super
Mario Brothers Metroid happened the
concave relatively sharp edge buttons on
the 8-bit controller really brought the
gaming community together almost like a
gang sign that appeared in the form of
blisters on your thumbs so here we are
20 years later looking at the ps3 and
xbox 360 controllers and this time
around they both actually look like
something designed for the hand so which
is the better controller the first Dual
Shock is widely considered as the
benchmark for modern controllers two
analog sticks triggers for your index
fingers and Rumble support pretty much
every controller made after the
DualShock has taken some aspects from
its design and yes even the 360
controller has taken a lot from the Dual
Shock controller the button layout is
essentially the same with the exception
of analog stick placement which was
probably switched around with the
regular d-pad to avoid patent
infringement ok let's talk about form
factor so here they are side by side and
the 360 controller is obviously a lot
bulkier and it's also quite a lot
heavier than the ps3 controller when we
take a closer look at the controllers we
notice that the ps3 controller has a
smooth surface while the 360 controller
has a fine texture to it I've been using
a Dual Shock controller since the
original PlayStation days the first Dual
Shock was a nice fit in the hand back in
the day and the DualShock 3 also feels
decent in the hand now but after having
the Xbox 360 controller in my hands I
have to admit that the DualShock 3 feels
a bit tiny in the hand the Xbox 360
controller is a snug fit in the hand and
it really feels like something made for
an adult
Microsoft has definitely had some top
ergonomics engineers working on the
controller it's large enough to support
your entire fingers and it truly feels
comfortable the smaller size of the
DualShock equates to less support for
your hands and fingers and you actually
have to bend your fingers quite a bit to
hit the triggers pressing the triggers
on the 360 controller feels a lot more
natural even though the dual shocks have
always proven successful I would have
liked to seen Sony make some bigger
alterations economically to the
DualShock 3 apparently the development
budget was put into the six axis motion
controls that really haven't gone beyond
the novelty factor and admittedly very
few games take good use of the motion
controls I think it would have served
Sony much better if the money invested
in copying Nintendo would have been put
in actually improving the form factor of
the controller itself but the 360
controller isn't perfect either
I have to mention I've been getting some
pretty weird symptoms after using the
controllers I've been experiencing some
numbness in my middle finger and I
figured that it's caused by the ridge
under the back triggers that are pressed
pretty intensely against some of the
nerves on the joints of my fingers even
though it may have given me an excuse to
flip you guys the finger I'm pretty
serious about this my fingers been numb
for a week now and I could probably
stick a needle in there not feel a thing
I can't be alone on this anyways
despite losing sensation in my middle
finger ergonomics wise the points go to
the 360 controller okay let's check out
the build quality as you can probably
hear the ps3 controller is a bit squeaky
when a lot of forces put into it even
though squeezing the controller may make
it squeak a bit the buttons with the
exception of the back triggers feel very
solid and the DualShock 3 can definitely
handle years of use I've been using this
particular controller for a couple of
years now with hundreds and hundreds of
hours of gameplay and you can barely
notice the wear and tear so it can't not
be satisfied with the durability of the
ps3 controller the 360 controller is
definitely a lot heavier device but
apparently heft brings solidity it's
almost impossible to get the 360
controller to squeak when you squeeze it
the plastics feel a bit tougher than the
Dual Shock plastics and all of the
buttons on the 360 controller feel very
solid and it could probably fight off of
air attack with a 360 controller okay
just a small bear if a grizzly bear
attacks you you're pretty much a goner
anyway the point is I'm quite impressed
with the solidity of the Xbox 360
controller so I have to award build
quality also to the Microsoft variant as
you have hopefully noticed both
controllers are wireless the PlayStation
3 uses a Bluetooth connection and the
Xbox 360 uses a 2.4 gigahertz wireless
connection which are both good up to
about 30 feet or 10 meters the Bluetooth
connection is definitely more stable
everyone said again I seem to lose
connection with the 360 controller but
it's nothing too serious
battery life is about twice as good on
the 360 controller you can get about 40
hours with Xbox variant while the
Bluetooth controllers will last you
about 20 hours on the ps3 but a very
annoying thing is that you have to buy
rechargeable battery packs for the 360
controllers which will cost you another
20 bucks per controller I think
Microsoft saved money in the wrong place
here the ps3 controllers are
rechargeable out of the box and you can
charge them from any USB powered device
buying the rechargeable battery packs
and charger is a bit of a hassle when
the ps3 recharging is so effortless
let's check out how the controller's
buttons and layout translate into actual
gameplay the 360 controllers left analog
stick and d-pad placement are different
but other than that the layout is pretty
much the same in my opinion having
analog sticks placed symmetrically makes
for better dual thumb coordination I
know it sounds kind of dumb but I think
you know what I mean also there's a bit
less strain on the left thumb when the
analog stick is placed lower the tops of
the ps3 analog sticks are convex on the
tops of the analog sticks on the 360
controllers are concave I really can't
differentiate which feels better because
both feel very natural under the thumbs
the analog sticks on both controllers
are very responsive there's a slight
dead zone on both controllers and by
dead zone I mean an area in which the
controller does not register movement
the smaller the dead zone the more
intricate movements will register which
for example may result in more precise
sniping but I would estimate that the
dead zone on both controllers is pretty
much the same the analog sticks on the
360 controllers definitely have a bit
more resistance to them which I kind of
like
having more resistance in the analog
sticks in my opinion makes for better
control in for example driving games
it's a bit easier to oversteer with the
ps3 controller not to say that it
doesn't happen with xbox360 controller
as well I need to get me one of them
logitech g27 racing wheels which
actually cost more than my current car
sad I know
the ps3 analog sticks are definitely a
bit looser which actually may translate
into faster movement in for example
first-person shooters
possibly the biggest weakness of the 360
controller is definitely the regular
d-pad in my opinion it pretty much sucks
you notice this immediately when
navigating the dashboard or typing text
it simply put not very accurate it's too
easy to accidentally hit the upper-left
when you're simply trying to press up it
really doesn't work too great in xbox
arcade games where it's actually
motivated the d-pad solution on the ps3
controllers is definitely a lot more
accurate fast and responsive also one
thing I have to mention is that the a
and B X&amp;amp;Y and the d-pad buttons on Xbox
360 controllers are made out of a glossy
plastic that makes them feel a bit
sticky at times while the texture on the
ps3 buttons feels a bit well not sticky
the triggers on the ps3 controller are
definitely one of its weak points the l2
and r2 triggers in the back bend down
convexity which can cause slippage while
they should be concave like the triggers
on the 360 setting down the ps3
controller on a table will sometimes
result in an unintentional trigger press
which can for example enable rewinding
when watching a movie and can really
spoil the moment depending on the movie
of course the 360 controller triggers
are backed by a ridge that prevents this
issue and the 360 controller triggers
truly do feel a lot more like actual
triggers which may add a little
something to first-person shooters I
also have to mention when for example
shooting up the neighborhood in Call of
Duty the vibration translates nicely
into the triggers themselves on the 360
controller which adds to the effect of
shooting a gun so the triggers are
definitely better on the 360
I have to admit that I enjoyed both
controllers immensely they're both in a
sense damn good but there are pros and
cons on both controllers and it had
served Sony and Microsoft well if they
got these controllers to mate to create
something of a hybrid of the two
and here's what it might look like
anyways despite losing sensation in my
middle finger I do have to reward the
first round of this battle to the Xbox
360 because Sony in my opinion even
though the DualShock 3 is great Sony has
played it a bit too safe because they
really haven't improved much on the
controller from previous iterations so
the Xbox 360 takes this round by a
slight edge stay tuned for the next
round where I take an in-depth look and
analysis comparing the hardware
