three
the sad part is I'm thinking about that
intro for a while the one plus three is
coming and it's probably coming towards
the end of this month which is May 2016
where are we starting to know a lot
about it we've seen pictures leaked on
phone arena on Weibo and on Twitter so
you have a pretty good sense of what the
oneplus Andy is going to be and what
it's going to be looks pretty badass so
here's what you can expect from the 1+3
and maybe you might make you hold off
for a few weeks to get your next phone
so it looks like one plus is going to
stick with their two phone scheme the
oneplus X and the oneplus two last
generation we don't know if we're gonna
have two different versions of the
oneplus or maybe the oneplus x squared
in the oneplus three but regardless
we're going to have two phones that look
both to be pretty sweet the low respect
model it's probably gonna retail for
around three hundred dollars it's going
to four gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of
internal storage which will be
expandable via microSD the larger more
expensive lunch retail for about 380
it's going to have just an unnecessary
six gigs of ram and 64 gigabytes of
storage both those should have the same
5.5 inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen so
you've been screaming for a 2k screen
maybe you'll be disappointed
a Super AMOLED really gives a nice
picture and oneplus is said in the path
shows a low resolution screen to keep
the price down so you gotta make
sacrifice somewhere but with that lower
res screen you should get crazy battery
if they're upping the battery leftish
generation about 200 million powers so
we should have a thirty-five hundred
million power battery on board as well
the oneplus 3 or 1 + threes will not be
skipping the processor department either
they could easily save some money and
gone for a Snapdragon 810 but they said
no Snapdragon 820 will be on board here
as well also gonna be on the phone is a
camera hump before you go up set camera
up is going to be hiding a 16 megapixel
shooter and it's friend on the front
will be an 8 megapixel shooter so you
should get really solid pictures from
both sensors holding out hope though
it's gonna be based on Android 7.0 and
maybe a little disappointed it's gonna
be oxygen OS 3.0 which is going to be
based on marshmallow it's almost stock
Android with a few really nice additions
fixing one of the most glaring and
frustrating emissions with the oneplus 2
NFC you'll be making a comeback they
listened the
learned and I have no idea why it wasn't
in there in the last generation oneplus
is ditching their classic sandstone back
it looks like they're gonna go for an
HTC inspired all-metal design should
also have a fingerprint sensor on the
front for for unlocking and for paying
for things all this though we should
know for sure just a few short weeks so
what do you guys think about the oneplus
three three hundred eighty bucks less
than four hundred dollars I'm gonna get
you a Snapdragon 820 six gigs of ram a
beastly battery what looks like a pretty
killer camera hoping it's a Sony sensor
inside looks like it's gonna be really
good deal it's gonna get the Nexus
devices and I think whoever Motorola
comes out with next for the Moto X a run
for its money
update your thoughts on it leave the
comments down below thumbs up if you're
excited for a new phone from Android
just thumbs up if you enjoyed the video
you always appreciate it
until next time I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
