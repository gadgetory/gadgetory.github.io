technical Buffalo that's the iPhone 5
this is the new Moto X and I want to
show you both neatly because the size is
similar you get a 4.7 inch screen here
we're all familiar with the iPhone 5 but
the point is Apple X advertise it you
can reach all over the screen on this
phone here at the Moto X you can do the
same and they told me specifically they
built it yes I have chubby fingers I
know that but they built us so you can
reach across the screen easily and you
really can I've actually been waiting
for an Android phone that you can reach
across the entire screen with your
finger and that's important they say
especially as we're getting into
phablets and all kinds of huge phones
I'm really happy to see a nice smaller
display on this device and I already
brought you the hands-on but I wanted to
show you just how easy it is to navigate
around and compare quickly the iPhone 5
the body itself really thin really
pocketable not seem heavy no it is a
little weightier than I thought it would
be but I think that's a nice thing and
now Motorola specifically built the
battery to fill in that space that
curvature here it's sort of leveled
battery and I believe it's 2200 milliamp
they promised 24 hours of battery life
which is really nice now the iPhone 5
let's just see how they stack up
together I just want to show everybody
especially if you're an iPhone 5 user
and you're kind of tired of Android
because you think the screens are too
big or whatnot
you get a bigger screen on the Moto X
here the phone itself so not too much
bigger which is nice because it has that
you know just a little bit trying to
line this up just a little bit bigger
but the nice thing is it has the edge to
edge screen you can see the bezels are
actually a little smaller on the Moto X
I buy a lot the screen takes up more
space it kind of shoots up higher and
sort of looks smaller on the edges there
that's just a quick comparison again
they're about the same price you're
gonna get 16 gigs of storage on this for
$1.99 of course the iPhone 5 $1.99 as
well 3249 here quick look just comparing
the two of them just odd he's insane
