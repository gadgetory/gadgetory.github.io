to you by full sail what's going on guys
a mark on Sangha from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's rumor roundup we'll be
talking about the alleged new iPad air
plus the galaxy s6 and the galaxy s6
edge the HTC One m9 and is motorola
working on a nexus 6 spinoff with
improved specs this is rumor roundup
let's start rounding those rumors up
earlier this week we got our first taste
of what HTC's big new flagship phone
might offer and it showed a very
powerful 5.5 inch phablet with some
top-notch specs however and even newer
leak suggests the company could be going
in another direction with the One m9
according to some reports HTC's next
phone could feature a mix of high-end
specs and mid-range hardware the device
will apparently come with a 5-inch 1080p
display a next-gen Snapdragon 810
processor a very high 20.7 megapixel
camera a 2840 milliamp battery and could
launch with Android lollipop would send
seven point oh now comparing these
latest leaked specs to what we heard
earlier this week we're not really sure
which rumoured version of the vice we
prefer though it's possible both models
could be in development and we could
possibly see two variants of the HTC One
m9 in 2015 it could be a few more months
before HTC announced its next flagship
but we're already itching to see how the
company plans to follow up the one mA
over the weekend alleged schematics for
the so-called iPad air plus hit the web
giving us an early glimpse of apple's
new tablet also known as the iPad pro
the device is expected to pack a massive
12.2 inch display and a few nice
surprises as well one of these surprises
could be four speakers yes four speakers
that will deliver stereo sound to on its
top and two on its bottom and that's in
addition to the 12.2 inch retina HD
display and apple's next-gen a 9 chip
reports are saying we could see this new
at ledge iPad air plus hit stores
between april and june 2015 the concept
of a larger iPad is pretty exciting
though we're not sure he needs to exist
with interest in Apple's iPad seemingly
on the decline we're hoping it will be a
kid
to Microsoft Surface pro though it's
hard to say at this point so we've been
hearing a lot of rumors about the galaxy
s6 recently and a new report suggests
that when it does launch there may be
more than one device to choose from
according to the usual anonymous sources
Samsung plans to launch a limited
edition galaxy s6 edge offering a curve
variant of the rumored flagship phone
similar to what we saw with a note for
endnote edge early last month there were
reports that the galaxy s6 could even
sport two curved edges in an effort to
set the device apart from its
competition though it looks like the
flagship device could feature a more
traditional design we're still assuming
the galaxy s6 edge will offer similar
specs just like the note edge holds
similar internal hardware to the note 4
but of course this is just a rumor for
now but we wouldn't be surprised to see
seems to make another push with its
curved display technology next year

let's talk a bit about some Nexus
goodies Motorola is reportedly planning
to release a spin-off version of the
ginormous Nexus 6 as part of its regular
lineup of smartphones according to some
rumors the device will fit into
Motorola's lauded family of Moto X and
moto G devices and actually come with
specs that are even better than those
found on the Nexus 6 if the rumor is
true that could potentially give
Motorola a trio of really really great
phones the company already has the Moto
X the Moto G and the droid turbo and we
can't wait to see what comes next I have
a guess it might be called the Moto s
but who knows when the device does hit
stores it'll supposedly come with this
same 5.9 inch qhd display found on the
next 6 alongside the latest snapdragon
810 processor which will take advantage
of lollipops fancy new 64-bit
architecture sources also claimed
vice will include 4 gigabytes of RAM yes
4 gigabytes of RAM an enormous 4000
milliamp battery which is even bigger
than the droid turbos 3900 milliamp
battery just imagine the Nexus 6 as it
is now but even better yeah that's
pretty awesome I'm sure by 2015 will
hear plenty more about this suppose
Nexus 6 spinoff but i wonder how
motorola plans on marketing this device
when it's sharing the same shelf space
as d nexus 6 at carrier stores either
way i'm excited for this gargantuan
beasts when it does hit the market

rumor roundup i'm your host marklin
