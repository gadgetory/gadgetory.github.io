TechnoBuffalo with a review of the canon
60d the new DSLR that's meant to fit
between the t2i
and the 7d and their mid-range lineup
now just to preface this review it's
really going to focus more on the video
side of things as the photography stuff
has already been covered in a lot of
other places and this camera really has
a lot of great features meant to make it
appeal to the videographer look on the
outside of this 18 megapixel camera and
you can see the standard canon control
wheel and then a big improvement over
the t2i all these outside controls in
the top LED screen on the sides got the
pretty much standard input outputs with
a line in for the mic and HDMI and USB
for memory uses SD cards instead of
compact flash as the 7d does look at
some of those features that make it
great for shooting video the moveable
LCD screen is really great for framing
your shots at those awkward angles as
well as filming yourself which is of
course something hello youtubers out
there do so looking at the video quality
it does Full HD at 1080 430 and 24
frames per second and 720 HD at 60
frames per second of course great video
sucks without great sound and when the
big advantages of the 60d over the 70 is
the ability to manually control the
audio input speaking briefly about the
photography capabilities the 60d bests
the t2i
in every category things like frames per
second and focus points as well as all
those extra little features you normally
only see in more advanced cameras one of
the best things about reviewing a camera
is that you can actually show footage to
people so they can kind of judge for
themselves so let's go ahead and take a
look here it isn't that tech review
typesetting and you notice the video
quality is the same as the t2 are the 7d
and that's because all three cameras are
using the same sensor so you're not
really going to get any better quality
with either one now here it is a more
outdoor kind of into
field setting and once again you'll
notice you know it looks exactly like
you would expect from a t2i
or a 7d style camera the only difference
is these shots were a lot easier to get
because of that moveable LCD screen
because a lot of people are going to be
debating between the t2i the 60d and the
7d here's the rundown the t2i is going
to be the lowest price it's going to
give you the same sensor as the other
two and it's going to be much better for
beginners to use and learn SLRs skipping
up to the 70 it's going to be the most
expensive of the three but it's going to
be much better build quality and is
definitely going to be superior for
photography purposes looking at the 60d
advantages it's going to have that
moveable LCD and that manually
controlled audio which is really going
to make it better for video than the 7d
in my opinion and of course you're going
to improve photography controls over the
t2i
so bottom line the 60d fits snugly
between the other two cameras in terms
of both capabilities and price because
of that I'm going to have to say I
definitely recommend this camera for
anyone who's looking into getting into
DSLR filmmaking and video well hope you
guys enjoyed this review this is Matt
