to you by Netflix
thank you guys for tuning in this is
renters rancis the show where I rant and
rave from anything in the world of
technology I'm her host John Retton it
up this week we're talking city cards
nano sim micro sim regular sim too many
to keep track of it makes it impossible
to know which one goes in which phone
what adapters you're gonna need let's go
ahead and get ready so before the iPhone
4 launched really had one SIM card size
it was standard it was used in every
phone and I made those GSM folks happy i
SIM card is what's used in GSM phone so
in the u.s. I'd be AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile to
put all your phone number on essentially
it was your phone on a card you could
take that SIM you could pop into any
phone and suddenly your phone number was
on there so now any carrier that has an
LTE network uses a SIM card but back
then it was only those two and life was
simple review phones you're a
TechnoBuffalo and ever I want to try a
new phone I'd pop up my sim card on put
it a new phone and I was good to go then
the iPhone 4 came along and Apple said
you know what we want to save room we're
gonna create a micro sim it's got the
same sized contacts as regular size SIM
card we're cutting out the plastic we
want to make sure every millimeter
micrometer nano meter is used
economically okay fine we got it Micro
SIM became the standard for most phones
it was adopted by Samsung it was adopted
by Nokia adopted by HTC and that was
just a new standard it was great
everything was fine with the world you
could pop it a micro sim in any phone if
you wanted to use an adapter you could
do so there were sim cards available all
you had to do was take a SIM card and a
regular sized SIM cut it and hiki's that
regular size SIM hole as an adapter and
everything worked out perfectly then
Apple said you know what we want to save
a few more millimeters that were gonna
create nano Sims with the iPhone 5 make
it nearly impossible to take your sim
card from an iPhone 5 and put it
directly into another phone you need to
get another kind of adapter and I
understood the move from regular sim to
micro Sims there's a decent amount of
plastic and wasted space on that SIM
card but going from micro to nano is
really a matter of millimeters and seems
to do
thing more than make it difficult for
people to go from an iPhone to another
device but there's a way around it
you can pick up any myriad of adapters
we got to make sure you're getting the
right one that goes from nano to micro
or what if you have an older phone then
you got to go from nano to regular it
becomes a frustrating mess and in this
industry when we test a ton of phones
you never know what simcards gonna be in
each device let's get a standard let's
agree on one and stick with it I don't
care if my phone is that much thicker
that much wider so you have to have
different sized SIM cards I don't think
this was an issue of Apple trying to
save space like I did with the move from
regular to micro I think this is just
them trying to make things difficult
so maybe nanos gonna be coming under
standard that will go micro nano or
maybe they'll create a new sim standard
so I can't work with Apple phones and
you can never switch SIM cards another
device this is problematic though if
you're traveling I imagine you take your
iPhone 5 and you want to go abroad to
Europe South America Middle East Africa
Antarctica Australia there's some other
continents South Central America that's
not a Content but it become quite
difficult if carriers don't have an
iPhone there you're gonna be out of luck
you can't get a nano SIM you're gonna
have to get a some sort of cutter bring
it with you pick the SIM card and put it
in then you have curious like t-mobile
it don't have the iPhone if you're still
offering micro Sims the whole world the
SIM cards blows my mind and makes me
crazy mad I know it's a tiny little
thing everyone's gonna say
firstworldproblems all that kind of
business but it is really annoying and
it's another sign of Apple getting more
and more proprietary what do you guys
think of my way off-base my cranky old
man or do you agree Jake trying to buy
adapter to keep tracking different
phones if you switched phones quite
frequently you'll know exactly what I'm
talking about
it is maddening so we think it made it
talked about something that's not
maddening something that's incredibly

wrong I want to hear your thoughts on it
I want one SIM card size for every phone
it's enough that we got a deal with the
different phone adapter for different
phones almost everybody except for
Apple's gotten microUSB why can't we
just get SIM cards to agree and maybe if
we can adjust you ran a SIM card
standard maybe as a chance for peace in
