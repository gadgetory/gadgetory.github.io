technobuffalo here I've had the HTC One
for a few days and I wanted to share my
first impressions how the phone feels
how the phone works and hope you decide
whether or not you should pick one up
pre-order it and figure out if it's the
next phone for you let's go ahead and
get started alright so I have had the
HTC One for a few days and I wanted to
share my impressions it's not enough
time to give it a full review that will
be coming later but I do want to share
what I think about it what I've learned
about the phone during my time so first
let me refresh the specs for you what
you're looking at here is an absolutely
gorgeous 4.7 inch diagonal screen the
resolution of 1920 x 1080 that means it
is eight 1080p screen with the highest
ppi i have ever seen of 469 this screen
is absolutely ridiculous we'll
definitely talk about that shipping with
android 4.1 point2 at launch 1.7
gigahertz quad-core snapdragon two gigs
ram 32 or 64 gigs of storage no external
a lot of hoop love being made about that
guy right there that is an ultrapixel
camera it's got an HD video capable
front-facing camera in a 211 ABG and n
for the first time I get a say AC as
well 2300 milliamp hour battery and I've
seen coming in at five point oh four
ounces or 143 grams alright so let's
start with the first impression when I
first took this device out of the box
held it this was the best first
impression I have ever had of a phone
since the iphone 4 and that's held true
or my few days with it the way this
phone feels in the hand is absolutely
incredible it's not something that I
said about every other phone that I've
tested this phone really stands out the
way it feels the way it looks it screams
premium quality HTC has learned a lot
over the years but how to build phones
and this is the culmination of those
years of efforts this is one of the best
looking phones I have ever tested and
I've tested pretty much every phone over
the past four years there are few
oddities here as well the first one that
sticks out for me is the button
placement so you've got a back button in
a home button position sort of oddly on
the right as much as you want that HTC
logo to be a button it is never going to
be so you're missing the multitasking
button
i multitask you double tap the home
button and you get HTC Sense fives new
multi tasking UI and you can go ahead
and open applications by clicking it or
you can swipe them off the screen will
talk about sense 5 though in just a
minute continuing the button quirks the
power button which is also an IR blaster
and put it to sleep is on the left hand
side I've never seen that before
definitely taking some getting used to
boom sound which is sort of the
culmination of the speaker's here it's
not just a speaker it's a software and
technology that goes into it is really
loud this is the best speaker I have
ever heard on a phone HTC previously had
the title HTC surround an older phone
was one of the best this phone blows it
away if you rely on speakerphone you
want to play some music for some friends
this is a great speaker I'll give you
guys demonstration certainly not going
to do much justice coming through
YouTube but suffice to say the sound
quality is really good for a speaker
phone
alright so let's talk a little bit about
sense 5 I haven't been the biggest fan
of HTC Sense and previous generations
since five gets out of the way and I
really like that things from that little
widget to the top to how you control the
app drawer here I really like what they
did so I did a whole video going through
sense 5 and demonstrating what it can do
and i'll leave that link down below if
you want to watch it but if you had
issues with sense for previous version
didn't like the way they worked don't
worry about sense 5 it really does a
nice job getting out of its own way it
brings a lot of great features with it
including a pretty awesome email clients
I've been wondering about getting an
email client one that works for you the
one that's bundled with HTC one is
pretty awesome a lot of hoopla is being
made about this guy right here this is
blinkfeed think of it as a flip board
for your home screen you could pick from
a ton of different options and able to
up right on the home screen it works
well I found it to be a bit of a battery
drain I'll show you what it looks like
we'll go ahead and select associated
press you can also select your Facebook
or Twitter streams here as well if you
want me I push the home screen all the
way over to the left I have not found a
way yet to get rid of it if you don't
want it but I just relegated over to the
side so you can see it looks like right
there pulls information do the same
things with Twitter or Facebook it's
kind of neat and if you go ahead and
open it up it's not going to open a
straight website or bring them serve a
mini browser they can use to view the
content I really like that touch so go
ahead and go home when it comes to the
camera we've got a full camera post
detailing how those performs next to a
ton of other phones might be interested
in so I'm going to direct you to that if
you want to judge for yourself let's
take a look at some example images you
can take a look at that link which will
also be down below as soon as that post
it goes live well so let's talk a little
bit about performance this thing is
blistering fast this is one of the most
complete phones I've ever tested this is
the way Andrew I think was meant to be
outside of a Nexus device it is
extremely quick everything opens up fast
the boot up time is less than seven
seconds HTC has got a quick boot
technology in here it's absolutely
incredible to see I mean I've never seen
a phone boot up from cold in seven
seconds the screen here is absolutely
gorgeous as well and that's really the
big story i'll go ahead and open up a
gal
could see what that looks like it seems
a little bit even better than what we
saw on the droid DNA night we do to the
smaller screen size and the higher ppi
with the screen is absolutely gorgeous
stunning screen I've never seen anything
look this good on a phone if I sound in
love with the device because so far I am
as i mentioned i really haven't had that
positive and impression of a phone at
least initially as I have with this
since the iphone 4 so if you want to get
a phone and looking for something that's
going to suit you very well you're kind
of owe it yourself to look at the HTC
One it's still too early for me to do a
full battery test but I will say it
seems about on part of the droid DNA at
least thus far as I continue to test of
ice or a full review I'll make sure to
go over battery life and performance I
wanted to share with you guys my first
impression of the phone is anything that
you want to see be cover the review be
sure to let us know but again we'll
continue to test the camera will
continue to test everything about it
will sure to share all that with you in
our full review thank you guys for
watching give us a thumbs up we
certainly appreciate it check us out at
technobuffalo calm for ladies and
