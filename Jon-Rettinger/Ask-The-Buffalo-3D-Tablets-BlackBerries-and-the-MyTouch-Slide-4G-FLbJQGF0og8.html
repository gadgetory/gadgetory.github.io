you by godaddy welcome back to another
edition of ask the buffalo i'm your host
jon rettinger and you can ask me
anything you want from the wide world of
technology today we're going to talk
about cell phones tablets 3d technology
and everything in between let's go ahead
and get started so here I'll ask the
Buffalo it's the best farm animal themed
technology show where you can ask
anything that you want from the world of
technology to ask your questions you can
do it in two ways first you can go ahead
and send me a question on Twitter either
at John for lakers or at TechnoBuffalo
and use the hashtag ask the bee and ask
whatever question you want otherwise
once a week on technobuffalo calm we
post up an article asking folks to leave
your questions and comments so if you
have something you want to ask me and
you want to see it broadcasts on the
wide revision3 channels you go ahead and
check out TechnoBuffalo calm or just say
hi to me on twitter you know no big deal
so let's go ahead and jump right into
our first question which comes from user
been rang 888 lots of eights who asks
John is your tablet of choice the ipad 2
if not what is your tablet of choice
well a few months ago somewhere to ask
me what tablet I recommended it would
have unanimously been the ipad 2 i was
grossly underwhelmed with the android
offerings that were out there however
that was before the asus transformer and
this guy behind me the samsung galaxy
tab 10.1 they transformer that in the
tab 10.1 are both awesome and
performance awesome inspects however the
tab 10.1 behind me is extremely thin
thinner than the asus transformer so if
you're looking for a new tablet i can
wholeheartedly recommend the galaxy tab
10.1 or the ipad 2 as the two best
tablets out there the screens are
beautiful they are beefed up processor
wise they're going to do everything that
you need them to do all right so our
next question goes to the world of
blackberry from jordan canning 17 who
ass
John do you think the blackberry bold
9900 is worth the money or should I wait
and get an iphone presumably he means
wait to get an iphone 5 or iphone 4s
whatever they decide to call it so the
bold 9900 9930 in the CDMA world is
essentially just the bold touch it's the
form fact that everybody has been
waiting for it looks like a typical bold
but a much thinner with a touchscreen
it's got some NFC technology it's got a
modern processor in modern specs and it
looks at me pretty nice I have a big
blackberry fan and actually out of all
the phones coming out in the next few
months that is the one I am most looking
forward to however if you want to
compare it to a film that hasn't been
announced yet or hasn't been released
yet I don't know it's a very subjective
question if you're like me and you like
having a full qwerty keyboard then the
Blackbirds may be a great way to go if
you want a bigger screen to browse
movies or to watch movies watch TV so TV
shows have a better downloading
experience from the itunes store and the
iphone is going to be a great way to go
it really comes down to personal choice
the next question comes from Sam inator
who asked John do you reckon that will
see 3d tablets in your future I've
actually been watching a lot this is a
random thing watching a lot of friday
night lights on netflix with my wife so
I start talking with the southern accent
you will know why they're actually our
3d tablets already on the market need I
remind you of the tmobile G slate this
is the LG built G slate which is indeed
3d although you need those funky red and
blue glasses to make it work I think
you're probably referring to
stereoscopic 3d like we have with the LG
thrill or the evo 3d I think certainly
that those are coming and probably
coming very soon I think a new type of
glasses free tech knowledge that we
might see is actually one that uses the
front-facing camera found on most modern
tablets the screens are exactly as they
are as they are right now whether it can
be a type of screen and actually sense
is where your head is and it can adjust
the image is depending on where you move
it that's not moving of the head thing
so I think we're going to see 3d tablets
very very very soon this next question
is more on the personal side and comes
from Trinity Brown who asked John what
was your first computer and how did you
get so interested in tech my first
computer that I ever had in my room when
I was just a little guy but this big was
an old app
to see I remember playing lemonade stand
and jungle hunt on that thing I have
always been a computer guy I've always
been into tech ever since I was just a
wee one of my first computer that really
got me into the tech reviewing I was
actually my very first macbook pro
actually I made my first youtube video
ever unboxing that macbook pro that
launched my whole second career which is
what i do now talking about technology
to you hopefully that helps answer your
questions so our next question is about
the t-mobile mytouch 4G it's from Cal es
wag who asked hey John what are your
thoughts on the upcoming t-mobile
mytouch 4g slide besides the camera what
does it have that any dramatic
advantages over the sensation thanks in
advance I think he's asking does it have
any dramatic advantages over the
t-mobile sensation well coincidentally
right behind me I happen to have the
mytouch 4g slide and it's got that dual
core processor and all that business
you'd expect from modern smartphone but
it does have a few advantages first it's
got that genius button for all kinds of
voice-activated goodness and the other
advantage is boom slide-out keyboard and
a very very thin form factor and
extremely me to throw it an extremely
impressive camera in fact our own Mike
Perlman did a comparison of the camera
on the mytouch 4g slide versus a
dedicated point-and-shoot camera from
sony so be sure to check that out
hopefully that answers your question i'd

bit on the personal side and advice for
aspiring tech reviewers from reader drew
Howard who asks i have watched your
youtube channel for months and you've
inspired me i would like to become a
tech review or and like some pointers to
how to start off what's the most
important task or tax tasks that you
have to do as a tech reviewer / blogger
i created a whole series you can check
it out on technobuffalo it's advice for
aspiring tech reviewers but the best
advice and I can give to anyone is find
your own voice don't try and emulate my
style or anybody else's style out there
find your own sense of who you are and
show some personality you know don't be
afraid to you know make a little bit of
fool of yourself have some fun with what
you're doing don't just say here's a
t-mobile mytouch 4G it has 1 point 2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
it can record 1080p video it has a
genius button you know make sure you
show a bit of personality can talk about
it can tell some antidotes about your
life in there you don't have to go out
and buy all the stuff you don't have to
be rich to be a tech review or you can
talk about things that just been
announced what your thoughts are you
don't make sure you say I've never seen
the iphone 5 yet but if it has when the
rumors say you know could be nice and
that would be the best advice that I can
give and for more in-depth sure to check
out that ask the Buffalo series and the
