to you by netflix welcome back to their
episode of renter's Frances the show
where I rant and rave on something
that's going on in my mind whole of this
week and that rumors about me things are
going on the youtube channel and all
kinds of other ramblings that are going
to shoot out my mouth this is recognized
rants let's get our Randy's in a bunch
so as you guys might have noticed over
the past few months in the past few
years even we've had new faces show up
on the TechnoBuffalo YouTube challenge
fun we get other people a chance to
share their dreams talk about technology
and just generally get geeky but I see a
few people talk in the comments and I do
despite my better judgment I do read
almost all the YouTube comments on
recent videos all kinds of crazy things
from John is dead but I'm clearly not
dead or we have definitely mastered
sideboard development or computer
animation you decide so one of the fun
thing that's happened with TechnoBuffalo
the started with just me in my apartment
and it was absolutely incredible and the
audience gave me a chance to live my
dream I got to talk about technology and
it was and still is the best thing
syphon family that I have in my life
hands down it has given me everything in
this world but sort of what grew from
that is a business and one thing to
earning a business it takes a lot of
time we've got 12 people that work with
and for techno buffered capacity that
takes a lot of time to manage we have
advertiser takes about time to negotiate
contracts conference calls all that kind
of stuff and it got to the point where
we're only putting out probably a third
of the content we could be putting out
so so busy being drawn in other
directions trying to run a business so I
thought to myself what can i do to still
be able to run a business to be able to
grow a company to be able to provide
other people employment of a chance to
give them a chance to live their dreams
we're gonna bring new face on the
TechnoBuffalo which is perfect we've
brought on all kinds of fun people that
you've seen over the past few years we
had Mark Watson soldierknowsbest help us
with the TechnoBuffalo launch a few
years back now we've got Ashley a skater
i think is probably one of the most
talented video producers going she knows
her stuff like nobody's business so when
you see Ashley on videos be nice to her
be kind it is really
hard to go out and make videos I do this
for a for a living doing it for years
it's tough to see comments tough to read
our people other people say I know it's
suffer you guys see a new face on the
channel I'm not going anywhere i promise
i am always going to be here making
videos but i want to make sure that we
are putting out all the contents we can
and unfortunately i just have too many
other things to do to try and help a
business grow and run my goal I'll very
publicly say it is for TechnoBuffalo to
be the largest consumer electronics tech
portal in the world anything short of
that I really won't accept we're
independent not owned by any large media
company so every dollar that we spend we
have to earn we don't have a big
paycheck coming in from you know cable
network or media conglomerate we have to
fight with scrap for every cent that I
earn every cent that I pay for the staff
and that comes from spending time going
to those meetings so if you're getting
contracts it also comes from putting out
new content which is while you want more
people i can put out more contact and
share new things about phones tablets
and the tech world and surely part of
growing a company anything that you see
on the channel just know it comes from
the heart even if it's not me up there
still someone else coming from their
heart I just wanted to sort of share
what's going on at the company I love
people asking where I've gone why I'm
not making any more videos anymore why
I'm making as many as I used to it nasty
honest answer i'm just being pulled and
i've been pulled too thin so in order to
make sure that technobuffalo can keep
putting up the content that i want
confident about the content that keeps
me up at night we brought on other folks
so i'm still going to be here i'm always
here i'm always lurking in the
background of videos i'm still gonna be
making videos you're still going to see
me on camera but you're gonna have me
and other folks actually for example
we've got our intern David Taylor here
Todd those videos we have a ton of great
people that are working their butts off
to bring you the best content and I hope
you guys enjoy it hope you guys can
