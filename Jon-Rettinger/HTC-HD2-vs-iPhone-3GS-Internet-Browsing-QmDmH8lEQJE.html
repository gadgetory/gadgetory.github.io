TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
going to compare the internet browsing
experience of the HTC hd2 with that of
the iPhone 3GS as a recap the hd2 is
running on Windows Mobile has the
largest touch screen of any smartphone
available on the market right now at 4.3
inches and it has a 1 gigahertz quad com
Snapdragon processor which really makes
us wonder how much faster or even if it
is faster than the iPhone 3GS and
rendering webpages and launching the
browser and doing other things like that
of course the iPhone 3GS has Safari but
the HD 2 has a modified version of opera
mobile version 9.7 to help work with the
capacitive touchscreen so let's take a
look let's start off by launching the
browsers and I'm going to tap Opera
browser here in Safari on the iPhone and
see which one opens faster I think it's
no surprise that Safari launches in less
than a second in most cases and it's
about 2 or 3 seconds on the HD 2 so
definitely in terms of opening the
browser for the first time the 3GS wins
now let's launch a website from a
thumbnail like the iPhone 3GS on the HD
2 you can place little thumbnails of
websites that you visit on a regular
basis so I have the TechnoBuffalo
thumbnail here and here let's see which
wins I'm assuming the 3GS is going to
win because it has that headstart since
the browser loads so fast love it let's
do it on a count of three one two three
okay here they are here they are off
ok the iPhones nope not done yep now
it's done and Wow about a half a second
later the hd2 finished very close even
though the 3GS had a head start let's
turn them into landscape see which one
kind of rotates into landscape faster
okay so the 3GS one there and let's do
it the other way
okay 3GS is a little bit faster now what
you get to notice an
at least how much more of the website
you get to see or at least how much
bigger it is on the hd2 because of this
large high-resolution touchscreen let's
sort of stack them so it's even easier
to see and it'll move around at the same
time and you can get a better sense of
how things look we're gonna flick down
the flick scrolling on the hd2 is a
little bit faster which is not
necessarily a good thing because it's
technically less precise when it's
faster but you can see sort of how both
of these render pages differently the
the browser on the hd2 doesn't have
flash support just like the iphone 3gs
although you don't get nice links to the
YouTube videos as you do on the 3GS so
very nice browsing experience on the hd2
it really makes good use of screen real
estate on the 3GS you still have this
top bar here in the bottom bar but on
the hd2 you only have a little button in
the bottom right corner which will
launch all of the buttons associated
with the controls of the browser so
let's go to another website and do a
speed test now that they are open and
ready to go we're going to try
pocketnow.com
so we give this a nice big on-screen
landscape keyboard and we're gonna do
likewise here okay that's ready to go so
I'm going to click here and here at the
same time and we'll see which one loads
it faster ready set go
and they're off okay about even right
now okay the hd2 just finished the 3GS
about a second afterward it's quite
amazing that the hd2 can keep up with
the iPhone 3GS so we can move around on
the page and again we get a nice massive
view thanks to all of the screen real
estate on the hd2 we can move around we
can pinch to zoom in on the HD - just
like we can do on the iPhone 3GS so we
can pinch like so and let's go to the
same story and pinch and we can flick
down double tap to zoom out move down
double tap to zoom in and then zoom zap
to show the whole website in its
entirety so very smooth on both devices
let's go to another website and
which loads faster we're gonna go to
webmd.com this time and over here okay
and ready set go they're off okay three
GS won by about two seconds there and we
can move around on the page everything
looks bigger on the hd2 when in reality
actually in terms of what is fitting on
the screen you can see that if we start
at the top and start at the top over
here although let's move it down just to
be fair we get down to cholesterol here
and down here we get a little beyond
cholesterol so actually the hd2 starts
zoomed in a little bit more the iPhone
is really good at showing you an
overview of the page but the hd2 is
everything quite a bit bigger so it can
flick down of course we can double tap
on the side to zoom in I'd say the zoom
capability the iPhone 3GS a little bit
more smooth so we can move around double
tap again double tap and this is a
little bit more choppy as you can see
but it's quite smooth especially for a
windows mobile device and the
multi-touch works quite well okay let's
talk about multiple tabbed browsing so
that you can have more than website open
flip between them and see how kind of
smooth it is on both of these devices so
on this device I am going to launch a
new tab and I'm going to go to say
Gizmodo I'm gonna have that load and I'm
going to go over here they already have
a tab open here I'm going to close that
and I'm going to click on new page and
do the same thing over here and of
course we get the mobile version of
Gizmodo and there it comes
and so to access the tabs and the iphone
3gs obviously you tap in the bottom
right corner and you go like that
you can go very fast between them up to
about eight or so pages you can load on
the hd2 let's see how how easy it is to
get to other pages pretty fast it's not
as visual which is in my opinion not as
good but you still can bounce between
two websites or three websites or
however many can fit in this list pretty
quickly which is
nice to be able to do if you're trying
to be productive so overall we're quite
impressed by the internet experience on
HTC hd2 in most cases it can keep up
with the iPhone 3GS in terms of speed
and definitely getting around on pages I
think is a little bit more enjoyable on
hd2 because you have such a larger
screen to work with screen rotation is
fast the multi-touch works quite well
the only weakness of the hd2 is that the
browser takes about two or three times
longer to launch than it does on the
iPhone 3GS we'll be back soon with more
comparisons of the HTC hd2 with the
iPhone 3GS that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
