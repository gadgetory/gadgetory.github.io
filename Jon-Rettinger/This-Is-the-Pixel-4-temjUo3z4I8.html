Rudy Derrick Rose my buddy Tito from
high school which is long story for
another day and it looks like the pixel
line of phones is poised for a comeback
of epic proportions
it appears that Google has listened and
seen the problems with the pixel - in
the pixel 3 to make it for an amazingly
awesome device if I have a sense what
that phone is going to look like
courtesy of the folks at price Baba who
worked with on leaks sold some info from
our good friend John Prosser so today
I'm very excited to introduce you to a
new phone made by Google
we call it pixel so the history of the
pixel line of phones is it very long
we're just on our fourth gen coming up
in a few months the pixel one was a big
departure from the Nexus line it was
Google's version of how a phone should
look and perform and for what it did it
did it very well it was camera centric
experience and that camera was amazing
pixel to comes around their screen
calibration issues there's burnin issues
it wasn't the runaway success that I
imagined Google was hoping for pixel 3
got plagued by a ton of software issues
Hardware issues as well as it's a really
unnecessary and quite ugly notch on the
front of the device and it looks like
Google has taken all those years of
mistakes and learning to make a device
that looks pretty close to perfect so
we're talking about phones that aren't
announced released or you know living in
your pocket grain of salt but there are
a lot of things that I think we know for
shizzle about the pixel for so pixel for
pixel for Excel the Excel version should
be a little bit bigger than six inches
six point two fives about what we're
seeing all that screen resolution should
stay the same from the outgoing pixel
three and three XL but a lot of
aesthetic changes and under the hood so
specs things you would expect now
snapdragon e55 SOC six gigabytes of ram
finally inside so you shouldn't have any
of those
branded issues that's playing to the
pixel 3 in the past another hallmark of
pixel phones the bid front-facing
speakers those look to be removed and
gone and now place I guess more
commonplace flanking the USBC port on
the bottom
speaking of ports the USBC port seemed
the only one there no headphone jack
will be built-in instead of the knotch
which i think was much maligned on the
pixel 3 XL but now giving it dad
that forehead but inside of that
forehead you now have two front-facing
cameras for improved selfies and a blank
space on the right not like Taylor Swift
style blank space but I think this is
going to be something cool that Google's
been officially unveil as a face ID sale
competitor
there isn't a spot on the back for
fingerprint reader so it's possible
there might be a fingerprint reader
built into the screen which is certainly
seen that on many phones I'm gonna place
my money on a face ID competitor which
is amazing I love unlocking my phone
with with this ugly mug I think it's
great for security it's awesome for
unlocking passwords and password
security apps banks
it just makes unlocking your phone and
using it a lot easier so it would be
awesome to see Google actually built
that in to Android cue other sort of
sketchier rumors claim that it might be
for some sort of gesture based
navigations but I'm going with face ID
we heard some rumors earlier on that
there wasn't gonna be any buttons on
this phone that looks to be put to rest
we should have the usual array of
physical clicky buttons of volume and
the power lock but in their usual places
found on the pixel and if we flip the
phone over you will see a glass back so
wireless charging should remain which is
awesome but the cameras this is where
things get extra juicy and spicy
I've knocked the pics on the past for a
myriad of reasons but one thing google's
does awesome camera and the way they
shoot pictures and they've done all of
that with a single sensor they're going
to take that single sensor and multiply
it we should be three camera sensors on
the back in fact Google actually showed
off a picture of the pixel for with
those three cameras on the back so if
Google can do awesome things with one it
should be absolutely incredible
with three so the array I'm expecting
the usual sort of normal lens that we've
seen on other pixel phones a wide angle
and a telephoto should be absolutely
amazing and with those three cameras I'm
also expecting a better video
performance from the pixel and maybe
even things like portrait mode on a
video will be awesome to have but as
amazing as the pixels bin for stills
hasn't been that great on the video side
I expect that to be rectified fully
completely and awesomely with the pixel
4 on the software side no surprises
Android Q we'll get an official name and
launched with the pixel of four and four
XL and they should come out in the
October time frame so while we know what
the pixel four is probably going to be
the story on how we got there is equally
as interesting so according to our
friend John Prosser from front page tech
who's been pretty accurate with pixel
leaks there were three different
versions of the pixel four in
development one that had the hole punch
and supposedly no buttons on the side
I'll touch the one that we are
supposedly getting and a third one that
we never got a chance to see and Google
was running projects and development
teams for each of those versions
simultaneously that kind of doing like a
gladiator style like we're gonna make
you compete and then pick the best one
or the one we think is going to be the
most successful it was interesting to me
that they picked the one with the chin
and the forehead instead of sort of
maybe what we would expect on a flagship
phone with the hole punch like we've
seen from Samsung and others but Google
I don't think has that many more chances
left to get the pixel right the pixel
promise has always kind of been three
things the most up-to-date software
incredible camera and the best Android
experience that you can get and every
version that pixel is delivered on one
or two of those things but they've
generally missed out on hitting all
three we did a whole video on talking
about where the pixel three went wrong
I'm not gonna rehash it but I don't know
how many more chances Google has left to
deliver a perfect pixel and it looks
like the pixel four might be it in a
typical pixel fashion it's not the
best-looking phone but it looks like it
will delay
ever on those three things I think
Google needs to make the pixel for
smashing success</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
