and today we're going to be looking at
Nokia's new xpressmusic device the 5730
it's a prank interesting device that
combines the media playing functions of
the xpressmusic series with a qwerty
keyboard that's very similar to the
keyboard on the 75 so in this video I'll
be unboxing the device and I'll be
taking a look at the devices hardware
and software and I'll try to determine
whether the 5730 is worth your hard
earned cash so here it is it's not at
all a bad looking device I actually like
the red and black coloring but let's put
it aside for a sec and check out the
accessories the device comes with the
standard xpressmusic accessories we have
your standard Nokia charger which is
always handy I can add it to my
collection still sticking with my theory
that there are more Nokia chargers in
the world than actual people the device
comes with a thousand milliamp battery a
USB sync cable which is quite short I
may add
I guess the recession has taken its toll
we also have your operation metals and
software and the software is actually on
a mini DVD which can be tricky if you
own an optical notebook drive for
example I gotta mention one time I could
not resist the urge and stuck one of
these mini CDs in my old Acer notebook I
hit the eject button and three years
later I'm still waiting for the city to
come out anyways the device also comes
with a pair of inner ear headphones
which if are anything like the n97
headphones aren't too bad the device
also comes with a hands-free extension
with playback controls which is nice ok
those were the accessories let's take a
look at the device itself
I actually kind of liked the look of the
device it looks a lot like the e75 which
was Nokia's mid-range business device
that was launched in the spring of this
year the exterior of the 5730
xpressmusic resembles the e75 to quite
an extent they're basically almost
identical the plastic covers have been
changed but the features are pretty much
the same a dedicated button for gaming
has been
added under the earpiece and on the side
of the screen you can find dedicated
buttons for the music player the device
is equipped with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is a standard
feature for the express music series the
device also sports a USB sync port for
connecting with your PC and the device
comes pre-installed with an 8 gigabyte
micro SD card which adds a little bang
to the buck on the opposing side there's
a dedicated button for the camera and a
volume up and down rocker key the back
of the device wheels a 3.2 megapixel
camera with an LED flash build quality
of the device is solid it does feel a
bit plasticky but I think the 5730 can
take a few hits like average nokia phone
so let's put the device to a real test
okay enough joking around I did not run
it over with my car or did I
anyways the screen on the device is 2.4
inches with a resolution of 320 by 240
pixels brightness and contrast is good
and color reproduction is also very
satisfactory the screen supports up to
16 million colors but let's get to the
most interesting feature on the device
which is the QWERTY keyboard the
slide-out mechanism on the QWERTY
keyboard is quite solid the keyboard
pops out with a nice snap the keyboard
itself is pretty much the same as the
one on the e75 the keys are nice and big
and I have to say the QWERTY keyboard on
the device is actually surprisingly good
for device in this price range the keys
have an OK feedback when press but they
could be a bit more elevated the top row
of keys is quite close to the screen
which causes at least my fat thumbs to
rub against the screen when hitting the
keys I liked the fact that even though
the device has dedicated QWERTY keyboard
it also has the basic phone dump at
although the numpad does feel a bit
plasticky and the d-pad has a slight
squeak to it but I do like the LCD font
that they've used on both the numpad and
the keyboard ok let's take a look at the
software I've mentioned in the past that
I'm not too fond of the Simba and 6d
operating system it's definitely
starting to show its age but on the non
touchscreen device it can be very
efficient the user interface is quite
snappy and works without a hitch on top
of the homescreen a new widget has been
added for your favourite contacts it's a
cool addition to the UI and it works
nicely another cool feature is that you
can add an online RSS feed to any
contact also featured on the home screen
are icons for quick access to the OB
messaging app email and music player on
the bottom there's a row of quick launch
icons for some of the more used
applications the Facebook app especially
it seems to work quite nicely with the
device the Symbian music player is quite
decent it's nothing too flashy but it
gets the job done
the speakers are definitely good the
highs are sharp and the lows are clean
but the volume could be pushed up a
notch the device comes pre-installed
with an 8 gigabyte memory card which is
quite a lot of space for legally
purchased media content the device
features a 3.2 megapixel camera with the
Carl Zeiss lens and an LED flash and
it's always nice to see dedicated keys
for operating the camera the camera
takes good pictures in daylight but the
image quality phase when the lights fade
the LED flash on the device is good for
close-range shots but not enough to
light up a room the Symbian album
application on the 5730 is actually
pretty good thumbnails are rotated on a
small carousel and accessed with haste
the album application is actually a lot
better than the album app on the n97
which I reviewed earlier the 2.4 inch
screen is a bit small for web browsing
but the Symbian web browser handles HTML
pages with ease the device does support
3d speeds but it can be a bit slow at
times when loading on pages it's not a
perfect device for web browsing but for
random web use it's an OK device the
5730 xpressmusic has some dedicated
buttons for gaming which are located
under the earpiece the device comes
pre-installed with a bunch of game demos
which play quite nicely using the
dedicated buttons wow this game looks
pretty cool I'll definitely get this if
the graphics look as good in game
okay I just saved five bucks this game
looks like crap hmm I wonder if this has
the Nokia snake game which is a classic
from the olden days back in the 90s I
actually competed in a snake game
competition if I recall correctly I came
in last in conclusion the 5730
xpressmusic is an okay device it has a
good selection of features and a
workable QWERTY keyboard audio playback
on the device is great and I kind of
like the look and design of it it's a
nice fit in the hand and it feels solid
enough taking into account where you get
for the price I think this device
deserved TechnoBuffalo approval catch
you next time
