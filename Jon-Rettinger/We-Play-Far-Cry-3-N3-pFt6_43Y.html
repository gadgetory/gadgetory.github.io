editor technobuffalo calm and i'm here
with a look at far cry 3 alright far cry
3 features a very expansive world and
rather than dive into one of the
missions in the game and possibly spoil
any plot lines i think i'm at kind of a
pivotal point campaign itself i decided
to hop onto a hang glider and just
reclaim one of these pirate controlled
locations but this is the the games map
its massive there's a lot to do in Far
Cry 3 and even where I am right now I
haven't really paid too much attention
to the story missions because i keep
getting sucked into the side quest
moments whether it's hunting and
crafting holsters and and basically
different elements in order to make me
carry more gear or like hunting down
these random island relics or finding
these encampments for pirates in order
to reclaim them for the peaceful rebels
we're not really peaceful there gun
toting rebels who will kill people but
whatever if friends and so i just wanted
to kind of grab a quick slice of some
action in the game as i try desperately
not to crash land this hang glider i
fail miserably of course but hang
gliders are pretty sweet they're
returning from far cry two you could use
them there they're actually really
useful here fast travel is really easy
as well that was always a problem in Far
Cry 2 but that's been addressed the game
is actually a joy to explore so you'll
see me approach this basically pirate
base there's not very many pirates at it
and I want to take it as my own in order
to create a fast travel point and
somewhere that I can stock up on guns
namo and find rides and not be in danger
and rather than move in and take them
out in a traditional fashion you'll see
me shoot an animal out of the cage it's
actually a bear so let's let that unfold
it's clearly very hot on this island you
also might notice here that the AI is
painfully stupid I have time to take out
a camera stand in front of him aim my
sniper rifle and shoot them in the face
or chest whatever
just a word to the wise whenever you're
recapturing these pirate bases make sure
to disable the alarms if one of the
Pirates runs over to the alarms and
activates them you'll see reinforcements
come in and things get a little messy
also in a moment here you're going to
see some fire spread now the fire
spreading mechanic was pretty awesome
infarct right to its back in Far Cry 3
though I will say that the fire looks
kind of bad here I am about to shoot
this bear cage out once i get a better
angle it maybe it's just the xbox 360
bill to the game maybe the pc version
features better fire graphics but you'll
notice them they look I don't know cheap
might be the best word for it
cool
now this poor bear rather than use my
own am I'll just shoot from this mounted
machine gun there's one of the really
minor complaint I have about this game
it's just silly when you skin an animal
rather than taking their fur you like
get some kind of weird hunk of meat and
therefore remains on their corpse just
strange far cry 3 is out right now for
the xbox 360 and playstation 3 and pc
platforms there is a ton of stuff to do
in this game it's probably one of the
best values for 2012 i would check it
out if you're a fan of shooters and
exploration and hunting and all kinds of
craziness so far it's pretty good thank
you guys for watching appreciate it or
if you should be up early next week
