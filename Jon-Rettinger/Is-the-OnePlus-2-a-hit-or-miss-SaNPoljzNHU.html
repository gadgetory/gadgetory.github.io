to you by Harry's what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here the
1+2 was announced earlier this week and
as soon as it got unveiled there was a
ton of questions complaints and just a
whole bunch of ambiguity around the
device so i thought i'd share my
thoughts and opinions on it we already
did a hands-on and we showed it against
some of its competitors want to see all
those videos will link them right here
go check it out but I want to just to
recap what the one plus two is and I'll
talk about what it is and what it isn't
as you guys decide if it's right for you
were to try to make up your mind on the
phone so first there are two burgers are
the oneplus 2 i'm going to focus on the
top of the line one that starts at three
hundred eighty-nine dollars another one
for about 3 30 that drops the storage
size and the ram down to three gigs so
again it's going to cost you three
hundred eighty nine dollars and for
comparison purposes if you want to buy
these phones unlock the day would cost
iPhone 6 16 gigs 649 dollars galaxy s6
32 gig 569 dollars LG g4 32 gig 613
dollars and the Nexus 6 32 gig five
hundred dollars 1 plus 2 is going to
come with four gigs of RAM it's going to
give you an octa-core processor in the
snapdragon 810 64 gigs of storage a 3300
million power battery 5.5 inch 1080p
display 13 megapixel camera that does 4k
it's got two sims and a USBC slot Dems a
lot of specs but people aren't really
focusing on those specs with the
focusing on is what's not not there and
what's not there is NFC no support for
verizon's bands and no expandable
storage most people are understand the
lack of Ryan support but the NFC gets
gotten people very upset i want the sort
of put in perspective for under four
hundred dollars you're getting a phone
that goes toe-to-toe with almost every
other flagship that's close to double
the price now listen I think the lack of
NFC is definitely knock on the device I
had a chance to talk to the co-founder
of 1 plus Carl pay and I asked him
straight up to his face why was NFC not
included and the answer Eddie gave was
very candid he said we know Android pay
is coming we don't think it's going to
be something that's going to be used
much this year with anything something
that's going to be for for next year the
follow-up to that was well you can add
cases on the back we'll to be a back
panel that could add NFC in the Africa
that was a reason
no so I wouldn't expect any sort of NFC
add-on to come from the oneplus 2 so
whether you agree or disagree those are
the reasons that NFC wasn't included in
the 1+2 but focus on what you're getting
for your money I think when you buy a
phone you want to get good value and so
be hard to find many phones that are
going to be a better value than the one
plus two you're getting octa-core
getting a ridiculous four gigs of ram in
a phone they're getting a large 3300
milliamp hour battery supposedly is
going to last for days and days you're
getting a fingerprint sensor I admit
seems a little weird to have without NFC
for android pay you're getting dual 7
something really kind of new in the new
at in the u.s. you're getting almost
stock naked Android with promise update
your getting a camera that could do 4k
you're getting a lot for a little bit of
money so let me stop just real fast
first to say hi how are you friend and
to tell you there are a few things that
that I really don't like I'm a fruit
snacks don't have any grape ones in them
and having to go the store to buy razors
I don't like to shave fortunately
Harry's cut out the middleman for have
and go to the store and buy razors their
starter kit is just 15 bucks that
includes an awesome razor three blades
of your choice Harry shave cream or
foaming gel whichever one you choose on
I'm a shaving cream man but personal
preference as an added bonus you also
get five dollars off your first order
when you use my code which is techno
after using that code you get in tires
month words of shaving for just ten
bucks you're getting high-quality razors
at a really low price and shipping is
always going to be free so boom shave
your face McLaren caveman if you focus
on what's missing you're probably never
gonna be happy with the device is always
something it's going to be missing well
I admit the NFC is a large omission for
that price point you're still getting
one of the best values in mobile that I
think is a hard thing to find nowadays
you've got things like Moto's offerings
a new Moto G and moto x but for under
400 bucks you're getting a phone that
can easily last two-plus years which is
hard to find you're getting the LTE
connectivity for gigs of RAM is going to
be really future proof I don't even know
what you do with four dudes Aram
certainly I probably would have liked to
see maybe one gig of ram taken off and
perhaps NFC added
maybe wireless charging but that was not
the case i would still jump into 1 plus
2 in fact i'm going to buy one myself
the device feels premium it feels great
in the hand the capacitive sensor that
uses a house a home button and the
fingerprint sensor works very well it's
a really good device I've seen it I've
used it dhola NSE necessarily deter you
if mobile payment is when you're big
reasons for wanting to buy an android
phone then yeah that's a reason not to
get it something you think you might use
or might not use I'd really look at if
you can find something else for that
price point isn't it equal value for you
can have a really hard time doing it but
that's just one dudes opinion you know
if you guys just agree if you think
having NFC is a big deal i'd love to
hear why i leave in the comments down
below perhaps a function 1 plus we'll
watch this video and maybe look at your
comment seriously and use them as they
make the one plus three for next year
and I think you guys for watching hope
you enjoy until next time John render
from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
