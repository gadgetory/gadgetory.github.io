technobuffalo here with an unboxing of a
gadget that is aiming to make my life
and hopefully your life a little bit
easier this is the fuel tank duo by the
folks at Cal pod it is a universal
charging system for all kinds of gadgets
let's go ahead and dig in and see if it
does its job so the idea behind the fuel
tank duo is very simple you've got an
external power source and you got a ton
of adapters that you can use to plug
into really almost a consumer electronic
that you might have so dual device
energy power you can actually plug in
two things at once make sure the device
on the front on the back charges up over
three thousand different mobile devices
across the major brands provide seven
times the capacity of a standard mobile
device quite nice so this is great if
you're a frequent business traveler or
you're on an airplane you need to charge
your cell phone to charge your ipod you
can charge whatever it might be you're
gonna have the option to charge with
this guy and service all you need to
bring if you're going away for a weekend
for example you have to worry about
carrying all those cords for different
devices you could just bring this guy at
least in theory let's go ahead and dig
in its gonna set you back up anywhere
from about 40 to 255 dollars I've seen
the advertised price so I'll go ahead
and open this up and I'll put a link in
the description too if you want to find
a place where you can pick one of these
guys up for yourself we could sort of
just put in there so I've got a wall
charger which appears to be microUSB
when you order this I believe you can
order it with the tips of your choice
through the ones you'd like so here
we've got the Apple tip it looks like
that's plugs in via mini USB see what
else we got in this box we have a case
just to serve a classic case to throw
your device and see what else some
information although it seemed to giving
Brie's little explanatory plug-in device
we've got a micro
two mini USB port and somewhere in here
I assume it's going to be an actual
device itself and indeed it is so here
is the fuel tank I think that's all that
we are going to get in the box also
something else nope that is what you're
going to get in the box if you request
these tips so let's take a look at what
we have here so here is the fuel tank
itself the three tips that requested
this come with so we've got a micro USB
we've got a mini USB and we've got the
Apple port so it's pretty decently sized
it's not the largest device in the world
you can see right where your two
charging tips would go so you can plug
in whatever you like dick trips your
devices at once when you want to charge
the actual fuel tank you go ahead and
plug that in right there and you've got
a bit of a battery indicator on the side
and that's gonna be about a pretty
straightforward advice I'm going to go
ahead and test it and let you guys know
if it's worth your money alright guys i
am back i've been using the fuel tank
for about three days with pretty good
results the thing does just work as
advertised let me go ahead and show you
let me make one point of clarification
the tips that plug into the end are
actually not micro USB so if you want a
micro USB port you need the micro USB
tip so I'm gonna go ahead and plug one
of these guys in and when you plug it in
it's going to turn blue to let you know
that it is powered and just as you'd
expect you plug your device in and
you're going to get a charge it's pretty
straightforward you can plug in two
devices and both of which will charge at
the same time when you're charging the
device you're going to get another LED
indicator sort of glowing a yellowish
green and you can charge devices while
you're charging the device itself so the
are going away for a while and you don't
want to carry a ton of power cords and
not this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
