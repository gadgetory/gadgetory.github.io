to you by full sail university you ever
looked in the mirror and realized maybe
you're your own biggest competition
looks like Apple might be competing with
themselves for customer just
cannibalizing are ready their own
customer base if you believe a rumor
from the folks at my driver's which has
a little of a spotty pass but did
predict some rumors that looks to be
true with the upcoming iPhone s ii if
you believe those folks they are saying
there will not be an iphone 7 plus but
in fact it'll be an iphone 7 pro with
dual camera sensors on the back that
does line up with a report from KGI you
said Apple is currently testing two
versions of the iphone 7 plus one of the
dual lenses on the back and one with a
single one it looks like apples going
full pro following rumors that the
alleged ipad air 3 is going to drop the
air name and just be a pro and also
would expect that error name to be
dropped throughout all of apple's lineup
looking at you macbook air so will be
two sizes allegedly for the ipad pro
much like they're two sizes for the
macbook pro dropping the plus so does
seem a bit strange but certainly Apple
does like dump things pro it means they
could perhaps charge a little bit more
for it or make it seem like more for
power users although not sure what a
power user for a phone really is looks
like as Apple heads into the fall and as
these phones start to come out probably
toward in September timeframe I look
like we could have an iphone 7 and
iphone 7 pro and a much smaller iPhone
se but again with all rumors take this
with a giant grain of salt the trade-off
will consume an end up to three
different product choices they're
different screen sizes and developers
are now left trying to figure things out
for 37 phone so it looks like as we head
into the fall September timeframe when
the iphone 7 and 7 pro should come out
Apple will have a three-pronged attack
they'll have the smaller iPhone se the
iphone 7 and the dual sensor iphone 7
pro when I heard it I really was just
curious what do you guys think about
calling a phone of protiv ice what does
that even mean would you would you buy
into it when you're not buying into it I
really would like to I'm generally
curious what you guys think I am NOT
curious however what you think so what
you guys know you know
something you'd want to buy you care
about do lenses such a little mean is a
little better off it a little quicker
autofocus and supposedly look kind of
cool I certainly won't be the first
manufacturer to ever put dual lenses in
a phone but you know Apple put some
fancy marketing language on it and it
should sound pretty sweet and wheel to
your thoughts on it again guys leaving
the comments here till next time I'm
gender from technobuffalo talk to you
guys a next one now I just got to go
back to playing with myself against
myself playing against myself what's
that you pick up your new alleged iphone
7 pro and you're like hey I've got an
idea for an app but I don't know how to
make apps the folks at full sail have
you covered with undergraduate degree
program they'll teach you had on a
mobile application or if you're like you
