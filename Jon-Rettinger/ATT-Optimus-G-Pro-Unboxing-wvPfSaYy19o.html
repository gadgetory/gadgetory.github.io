TechnoBuffalo he didn't feel like me you
liked your phone big I got something for
you this is the optimus G pro coming to
AT&amp;amp;T on May 10th this 5.5 inch beauty
Rox quad core HD screen all kinds of
other awesomeness let's go ahead and dig
in see it looks like alright so here is
the rather nondescript
alright so here is the rather
nondescript box for the lg optimus G pro
behemoth let's go ahead and open this
sucker up it's gonna be one hundred
ninety nine bucks the two-year contract
but of course by the time you watch this
video definitely check with the carrier
or other third parties to see what it's
going to cost you so it looks like our
unit has been manhandled by AT&amp;amp;T PR
which kind of stinks I was left pulling
off the plastic so here is the optimus G
pro which is a big big phone but I kind
of dig it push it off to the side for a
quick second I promise we'll come back
to it run through all the specs let's
see what else we're going to have in the
box Quick Start Guide for you guessed it
getting started quickly safety and
warranty information and what's the
warranty like don't put it in microwave
we also have I'm guessing that's where
the battery would go but that appears
like it's already in the phone a pretty
large sized wall worked for charging and
we've got a micro USB cable so nothing
overly exciting in there although I
think that maybe when this comes to
market if this isn't the full retail
packaging you're gonna get a folio case
in the Box not a Fuli okay's or a Coolio
case but folio alright so now that I've
got the phone out of the box I will see
if I can power this sucker on I'll run
you through all the specs cuz there is a
lot to like about this phone there's a
little life is good LG logo there
alright so what you are looking at is a
gorgeous 5.5 inch screen and that is a
full HD screen that's 1080p which is pre
impressive so it's going to be available
on AT&amp;amp;T on the 10th oh that I mentioned
499 bucks by the time you watch this
video price may have changed so check
with the carrier third-party retailer to
see what the prices are at all right so
this guy weighs six point one four
ounces being powered by a three
140 million power battery there's an
Amber Alert going on evently near us
it's got a Snapdragon 600 which is a
beefy 1.7 gigahertz quad-core chip two
gigs a ram storage up to 32 gig
expandable to at 64 on the back we've
got a 13 megapixel camera that can do
1080p and a 2.1 megapixel camera that
lives there right there on the front of
course 18 t LTE is here it's got
bluetooth 4 oh and NFC does have some
cool dual cam recording and quick memo
applications for notes and supposedly
they're supposed to be that free folio
case but we did not get one alright so I
think this is running Android 4.1.2
we'll take a look in a second whoa well
confirm amber alert hopefully they find
at that car so present hold an app to
Dragutin homescreen there are a lot of
apps on the homescreen and see what I
can find somewhere in here where
settings live and let's see what we got
so it's broken down to network sound
display in general so I'm guessing the
about the phone will live in general
about phone let's confirm we have
running on here so software information
we are running 4.1.2 all right so let's
continue our tour of the phone here
we've got a hard button on the Left
which I'm guessing is gonna launch the
camera but let's see launch is there
quick memo service but you can use to
draw or write on the phone so you can
pick what you want and you can just draw
around you can save it if you choose to
I am not to go in and save it so that's
what that's going to launch you've got
right in the middle sort of an oddly
located of volume rocker on the right
hand side that's where your power and
lock button lives on the bottom 3.5
milimeter headset jack and then you've
got of course your noise cancelling mic
we've got two capacitive buttons here
living on the left and the right we've
got a back button and a menu button a
very thin home button with LED lights to
glow around it that is an extremely thin
button here but again the story here is
this gorgeous 5.5 inch beam LG skins are
sort of light not overly heavy we can
see there's some kind of cool effects
there if we long press this is where you
can see apps download widgets and
wallpapers or some custom LG action is
but all the widgets
to be pretty stock Android save for a
few we'll pull this down you've got some
qslide apps which are kind of neat to go
ahead and launch like calculator for
example it's gonna launch it up right on
the screen you don't need that and you
can move it around you can do it
calculations blah blah blah and then
when you're done you go ahead and just
exit it we don't have fear those any
sort of capacitive stylus no s-pen like
we've seen on the Samsung devices and
this is certainly the same screen size
as the Galaxy Note 2 and speaking of the
Galaxy Note 2 3 and bring that in just
you guys can see for a comparison here
very very similar looking phones
certainly a much larger home button here
on the note 2 then we've got on the
Optimus G pro so that's important to you
definitely try it in the store while
being much more slender you certainly
can still press it pretty easily so it
is a removable battery which I mentioned
was pretty beefy 3114 milliamp hours and
it is classic back which looks to be
pretty close to the trend now it is see
what that looks like there's our NFC
radio we actually had a international
unit that came in a few weeks ago but I
wait did the review till I actually got
a chance to try a carrier version this
one was kind of unique I was meant for
the Korean market and it has if I can
find where it is incorrect hearing
crazy-long like old-school antenna
looking thing I kind of wanted to walk
around with it antenna out and okay I
can't hear you let me see if I can get
some reception and then pull it out so a
very similar looking phone so actually
what ended up coming to the market uses
micro SIM and there's your expandable
storage living there as well so put this
guy through its paces see what it can do
what it cannot do and see if it's worth
your hard-earned buying buck but if you
are looking for a 5.5 inch phablet
that's gonna be a very good choice a
1080p screen at least on first blush
looks really nice and brightness you
knows only at 59% if I keep that sucker
all the way up to play gonna look washed
out for you guys but with normal people
eyes that is a beautiful screen it's
also a quick remote function so that
must be a IR blaster right there I guess
in the upper right hand corner it's all
kinds of cool stuff to learn and check
out about this phone left here with off
anything you want to see in particular
be sure to let us know and of course
we'll do review comparisons and all
kinds of other goodness we love to do
here at TechnoBuffalo let's leave your
comments down below please give the
video a thumbs up we most definitely
appreciate it I am John Rhett enger'
check us out TechnoBuffalo calm i'll see
you next video
