unboxing for you of the Amazon Kindle 2
this is an e-reader so it's a way to
read books without the paper let's go
ahead and unbox it this is straight from
Amazon it's the packaging that will come
in open it up the obligatory big knife
now let's go ahead and dig in this is a
little bit on the expensive side for
devices it'll run you about three
hundred and fifty nine dollars u.s.
right now it's only available on the US
and unlike the first Kindle this does
not come with a cover the cover is
another $30 I'm sure you factor that
into your purchase so you're probably
looking at around four hundred dollars
total here we've got the Kindle cover
this should be a decay for a symmetry
let's go ahead and open this thing up
first just in cardboard very
eco-friendly from Amazon with a little
pull tab here so go ahead and pull that
open the packing stuff there alright
take that off this is my first digital
reader I've ever had some very curious
to see what it looks like
you can see there's a little some
symbols and letters in there and it says
Amazon Kindle and kind of embossed black
and it says Kindle stead on Fire inspire
stir up catch fire or become animated so
here's the actual cover itself and
another little flap that was in and this
one does feel like it's made out of
actual leather does pass the smell test
it's got some cushioning in here to
protect the device a little diagram
showing you how it fits in rotate and
snap but that's not what you guys are
here to see so this is the cover which I
think everybody should definitely have
the Kindle the front of the device
actually doesn't have any protection but
what your reading is actually the eating
display without anything covering it so
here is the Kindle itself box just says
Kindle some information on the side
you know that assembled in China the
little pull tab and nothing on the box
go ahead and pull the tab here I'm very
excited to to use this for most books
even new releases and New York Times
bestseller
they're about $10 on the Kindle Store
and you know to get a hardcover book is
generally twenty-five to thirty dollars
so you're looking at a anywhere from ten
to fifteen dollars possibly $20 savings
on your book so if you do a lot of
reading you can't recoup the cost of the
device that way open it up again it's
got the sort of embossed letters flowing
and here's the tray that it comes in
some more of the embossing right there
no cushioning or anything just straight
cardboard so here is a device itself
it's got that same sort of embossed
color on the front and get that in the
camera you can see it's sort of flowing
right there this Amazon Kindle right in
the middle that'll pull tab on the side
and on the back so those more little
lettering let's go ahead and open this
thing up yet another tab that one's a
little bit easier cardboard just comes
off and there's a another cover here and
pull that up and there is the device
itself
Amazon Kindle it's my first time
actually holding one of these it has a
nice weight to it but not too heavy it's
only a very thin I'll show you guys some
size comparisons in a moment it says
right here step to the slide and release
the power switch above your screen will
refresh in a few minutes plug in your
new Kindle so we'll go ahead and do all
that in just a moment let's see what
else comes in the box here you can pull
up this tray it's actually made of a
very hard plastic here this is not
cardboard so that's nice to know things
are protected in there but it does
showing you that it is recycled so that
is always nice
we've got Amazon Kindle users guide and
getting started probably never use that
not a directions kind of guy but if you
are go ahead and take
that here is the Charter sooo this looks
like very thin for the us adapter right
there and this actually uses a microUSB
so it's a standard port which is very
nice a lot of cell phones use micro USB
and this right here pulls right off
plug just in via USB cable so you can
actually use this to charge your iPod or
any other USB device it's kind of handy
thing to have around plug that back in
let's take a look at the device itself
Amazon claims that this is actually
thinner than any 3G phone you can
actually download books directly on here
using Amazon's whisper net essentially
what that does it uses Sprint's 3G and
now older legacy networks to download
books right to the device so you
actually never ever have to use a
computer download your books which is
very cool it does sort of look like a
first gen iPod so let's do a some size
comparisons for you and get a sense of
how big inhale ticket is I'll show you
there it is with the iPhone it's
significantly bigger here it is with the
pantech matrix pro you can see a pretty
decent size comparison right there
Emily compared a normal sized hardcover
book for you to you guys can see the
difference here here's one of my
favorite books Jack Welch's winning can
see that it is significantly smaller so
I'll stack that on top you can see a
difference obviously what you're gonna
read is just the screen but size-wise is
a significant difference let's go ahead
and do a thickness comparison to and see
if what Amazon says is true here's the
iPhone only phones I have laying around
right now and that is definitely a
difference right there you can clearly
see that the Kindles thinner and
certainly it's gonna be thinner than the
pantech as well here I've got these
Samsung epics big difference there also
so let's go ahead and take off the
plastic
and I'll give you guys a hardware tour
very quickly so the cool thing about
this eating display is that the battery
is only used when the image on the
screen is changing so right now this is
actually on the screen but it's not
using up any battery which actually
makes it very very neat so on the front
of it we've got a put it down here I'll
zoom into guys conceal it but there we
go almost a blackberry style QWERTY
keyboard
obviously that's intended for thumb
typing for looking at books and such
this have a full row of number keys
across the top and I can use the
keyboard and that much but before you
need it for it does seem to be very
usable so one of the complaints people
had with the previous Kindle was the
next page button extended across the
entire side of it when you picked it up
for just a reading now I take that next
page button there was a lot of
complaints about it so it looks like
amazon fixed that with this Kindle you
can't turn the next page button by
hitting the outside you actually have to
push the inside to make it click so that
should eliminate the accidental presses
no click and there's the click so
there's your next page button on top is
a home button which takes you back to
obviously your home it shows you what
you have downloaded previous page next
page so if your left or right handed a
menu button a back button and now a
five-way little joystick toggle that
also pushes in for that fifth way the
previous Kendall had a scroll wheel this
one actually now lets you go left and
right and kind of scroll all around here
so that's a very nice they did get rid
of the removable battery unfortunately
so the battery is sealed in here but
they do are amazon is claiming improved
battery life so let's see if that's true
got the two speaker grills on the back
for the speaking functionality so what
this will actually do is will read the
text to you it sounds very computer and
mechanical but it will still read the
text which is kind of neat actually I
don't give you guys a demo of that in an
upcoming video
the battery is sealed so nothing else to
see you there on top of the device
you've got your power button and your
3.5 millimeter headset jack so you can
listen to your books from headphones if
you're on
airplane nothing else really on the side
nothing on the side there except for a
volume volume up and down rocker and
that's about it guys on the bottom is
the charging port for that microUSB so
as that is just about it let's see this
has any power in it at all slide and
release the switch above do that let's
see what happens say I got a follow step
1 and plug this thing in first so I will
do that and I'll ship nope there it goes
doing something Amazon Kindle get that
little bar flashing let me know that
it's loading I'll leave that there that
you guys see this in real time and again
like I mentioned the e-ink none of this
is using any batteries only battery
that's being used right now is just
moving this bar across the top and the
screen feels pretty secure but I
wouldn't want to throw this in a
backpack and risk of something getting
damaged on it so definitely the case and
the cover is gonna be something you're
really gonna want to invest in so when
you buy a Kindle it actually registers
it to your Amazon account so your
information should already be there so
this turns on it should say John's
Kindle at least in theory so let's see
if it does that once it finishes loading
refreshing it's a little icon up it
right there letting you know that it's
downloading and syncing
welcome to Kindle alright I'll go ahead
and look at that later let's go home my
Kindle so it looks like that's all taken
care of I have to sync it up possibly on
the computer maybe I didn't put my
account information correctly when I
purchased it nope there it goes
refreshed
Jonathan's Kindle now it says right in
the upper left hand corner so it really
did a very nice job of taking itself up
automatically it's downloading an item
right now welcome Jonathan from Jeff
Bezos who is uh the heads of Amazon so
that's very cool
I'm just navigate it's in that little
line now guys I'm gonna go give this a
charge and actions already got a decent
charge in it but I'm gonna go use the
device and stay tuned the rest of the
week for new videos showing some
software features how to download a book
and at the end showing me a full review
of the device hope you guys enjoyed for
exclusive content be sure to follow me

Lakers I'll see you guys in the next
video
