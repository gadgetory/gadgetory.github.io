TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the Apple iPad I am very excited
to finally get some hands-on time with
this this is the 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi only
model you've got a picture of the device
on the front got your iPad branding on
the side looks like a big iPhone box
iPad some sort of tech specs on the back
so again it's 32 gigs and it is sealed
in plastic if you pick this up from the
store you have the option of them
setting it up for you which really just
entails I'm plugging into iTunes
happening information and you walk out
with a working iPad
although setting up yourself tends to be
very easy let's go ahead and dig in God
of course the obligatory big ol knife go
ahead and cut right into the plastic
pull the plastic off and here is the
Apple iPad box comes right off no
padding just a little bit of cardboard
and there is the iPad in its plastic
covering it's very thin actually the
first time I've ever held one I'll push
it off the side for just one minute take
a look at it in a second
it's got designed by Apple and
California probably fingertips or some
sort tells you about it and it's like
some warranty information and two Apple
stickers for set off and the only other
things you're going to get in the box is
the Apple 30-pin connection cord and a
wall outlets which I assume just goes to
USB and indeed adult looks to be the
same one that ships with the iPhone or
iPod Touch but enough of that push it
off to the side and take a look at the
main attraction here is the Apple iPad
let's go ahead and pull off the plastic
this is always a very exciting event the
whooshing noise
there we go and here we have the nine
point seven inch capacitive touchscreen
with a pretty large black bezel the
familiar home button on the bottom let's
take a quick look at it and see what we
have button wise so as mentioned there
is the home button on the right hand
side you've got a screen lock which will
stop the accelerometer from from
functioning so if you want to keep it in
portrait or landscape you give that a
flip and you'll be good to go and you've
got a volume rocker on the top you've
got your power and hold button 3.5
millimeter non recessed headphone jack
which is quite nice I believe that your
ambient light sensor nothing on the back
got that sort of aluminum feel it seems
to feel pretty nice iPad and big shiny
Apple logo on the left side there is
nothing on the bottom you've got your
speaker grille and the 30 pin connector
connection and that is about it also
case you guys are interested I picked up
the Apple case for the iPad we'll go
ahead and unbox this real quickly it's
gonna run you about 30 bucks it's sort
of a light neoprene feel this is the one
that I demonstrated back in January with
you a little bit of a sand go ahead and
pull this out and rip it out of the case
here it's not very thick they had some
other case ones which are a bit thicker
but they were about 60 70 bucks which is
a lot of money to spend for a case you
can see it's a got a bit of protection
on the front it's hard and then it's
sort of a rubbery neoprene feel on the
back and there's worth slips in that's
about it for the case nothing terribly
exciting there in case you want to see a
size comparison for how thick this is
against let's say the iPhone I will
demonstrate that for you in case you
want to see what little and big brother
look like together this is the 3GS
go ahead and stack them on top of each
other you can see that it is very very
thin actually even thinner than the
iPhone and only weighs 1.5 pounds and it
feels very very light stay tuned to the
channel and TechnoBuffalo for all of
your
I've had new it's going to be a one-stop
shop we're going to cover all the
