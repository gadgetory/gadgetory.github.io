to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back to ask the Buffalo the show
where you can ask me
not John Redinger any question you might
have from the wide world of Technology
I'm ashley Esqueda John and his wife are
on vacation this week they are
celebrating the upcoming arrival of
their beautiful first baby and mourning
the loss of their sweet sweet non parent
freedom this week we're talking about
gaming companies porting their games
over to mobile vine versus Instagram new
tech this year and the earliest chances
at success this is ask the Buffalo
let's get answering our very first
question is from TechnoBuffalo commenter
mick kyle who asks do you think gaming
companies will be willing to release
their popular games on Apple's iOS now
that it has added controller support
games such as Super Mario Pokemon and
Zelda would be huge successes and open
up markets for games on the App Store
upwards of $20 mikail that is a really
good question and I think what it boils
down to is Nintendo or any other
developer major console developers
willingness to let Apple Android Google
take 30% of those sales so everybody
through Apple has to give 30% same thing
with Android I'm guessing the same thing
with Amazon so it's not really likely
that we'll see a Nintendo who generally
speaking is really protective of those
first party IPs like Mario and bring
them over to iOS even with that
controller support I think the
controller support for iOS 7 is really
exciting for indie developers and people
who make games that can be actually
enhanced by a controller and sometimes
touch gaming is not exactly the way that
you'd want to play say a side-scrolling
platformer I think generally speaking I
wouldn't hold your breath on those
titles those first party titles from
nintendo but there's always a chance
that they could find themselves in dire
straits or even take the route of sega
who ended up licensing their IPS to
Nintendo's
we may see something like that in the
future twitter user at mini tough wants
to know what new technology phones
tablets laptops etc are you looking
forward to most in the near future
well minis off I can't speak for John
but I know that I am very excited about
the Mac Pro so the new Mac Pro is so
tiny it's like carrying around a little
thermos and as somebody who edits video
for TechnoBuffalo every single day
almost it's one of those things that I
would love to have to be able to travel
with because if you can carry around
what the equivalent of a desktop Mac
computer is with two video cards a crazy
amount of processing power I am down for
that anytime I can make something more
portable fast and easy to use that's
what I wanted on so I'm really curious
to see because the Mac Pro is assembled
here in the US how expensive it's going
to be it could be really really pricey
but Apple could surprise us and make it
really cheap so gotta keep an eye out
for the Mac Pro later this year that's
what I'm looking forward to Twitter user
at Kirby qu9 and many other viewers
wanted the answer to this question who
do you think will win the social network
battle now vine or the new video capable
Instagram that question is great because
obviously it's new it's timely Instagram
now has video with filters and all this
other great stuff some people really
like vine in that you can't add filters
to anything it has to look great right
when you shoot it out of your phone you
don't have to rely on filters to make
your video look better so for maybe
video purists vine is the way to go
I also like the fact that vine can still
embed in a browser which you can't
actually do at Instagram that was a big
surprise to me this week but Instagram
really they have the user base obviously
they're writing on the back of Facebook
because they're owned by them they have
that huge user install base that
obviously loves to use Instagram for
pictures so it's not a stretch to think
that because vine is a new service
Instagram definitely has the advantage
here and lastly Twitter user at mobile
underscore Dom asks do you think the
Ouya will ever reach mainstream success
maybe not this gen or next but one down
road.the Illya is a really interesting
concept and I think idealistic alee this
is what everybody wants an open console
that developers can let their games get
published on without having to go
through a third-party publisher or meet
demands of an investor and things like
that
however this generation of the Lea is
definitely a little bit lacking so it's
kind of behind in terms of processor
obviously they're running a Tegra 3
instead of the now current Tegra 4 so
out of the box it's a little bit
outdated that's not to say that they
could catch up very easily in the future
and expand their software to really take
advantage of what the Ouya x' idea can
offer developers and consumers so I
really like the idea that everything
needs to have a demo and a lot of times
in a family you definitely want that
demo experience so you want to make sure
that the game that you're about to buy
even if it's only a dollar or two
dollars is gonna be worth your time so I
think Lea can absolutely expand on their
services I think if they can combine the
console part of booyah
which is what they have now with
something along the lines of an Apple TV
or even a Roku where they have different
channels that you can access like
revision3 with TechnoBuffalo and ask the
buffalo on it and Netflix Hulu Plus and
other streaming services I absolutely
think it would have a real winner on
their hands if they could keep it at
that $99 price point but time will tell
the story of the Ouya well that's it for
our questions but right now we'd like to
