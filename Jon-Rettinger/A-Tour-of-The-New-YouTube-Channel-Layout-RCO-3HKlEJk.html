technobuffalo calm here beginning next
week July thirteenth YouTube is going to
be transitioning all of their channels
over to a new channel design you may
have seen it on some other people's home
pages you may have not so I thought this
would be a good opportunity to walk you
through not only my new channel layout
but also the new layout in general cuz
you're going to be seeing it really
across the entire site let's go ahead
and get started the first thing you're
going to notice is this new interactive
branding bar I just moved my site over
today so I'm still learning how to use
it but you can go ahead and make this
hot linkable you can actually set
different modules within it to link to
different sites so right here I've got
it linked to technobuffalo I can go
ahead and click and away I go you also
have a new bar on the bottom that you
can customize for uploads and different
channel options if your video producer
you really have more flexibility with
this new channel layout but the big
thing obviously about YouTube is the
video let's take a look at what the
videos look like one thing I should
mention that as i'm clicking you'll see
these little waves that sort of pull say
down and that's just from my screen
recording program so certainly the video
is the main feature of the channel and
plays right as it did on the old version
but now instead of having your previous
videos laid out in a grid below you've
got this module on the side right here
lets you scroll through all the content
that the producer is done so i can
scroll right down to the bottom you can
see some my first videos here so here's
a review i did over two years ago of my
bluetooth Mighty Mouse I can click it
and it starts playing right in the
YouTube channel you guys just got back
from dinner you can see really see how
nervous I was and how awful I was in
front of a camera just over two years
ago so it is nice that you don't have to
leave the channel to look at a new video
it's all done on the same as grant think
that's what YouTube was going for but
what if you want to leave a comment you
want a favorite it or whatever you like
to do with videos let me show you how to
do that right below you've got this bar
that the light and do all of your main
YouTube control so here's the info on it
here are the comments if you want to
leave a comment and go ahead and just
type it in post limited to 500 character
you want to see comments all comments
video responses can go ahead and click
right there and you can scroll through
and see what there is if you want two
favorite it certainly can go ahead and
do that there's a lot of sharing options
down so you can send it if you'd like to
add it to a playlist or if you want to
export it again to any of these options
you can go ahead and do that nice and
easily but what if you like the old
version better and you want to view
videos as you did before well you can
click this link right below each video
or you can click view comments related
videos and more I'll click this one
right here and it takes you to the main
page that you guys were all used to and
the video we'll just play as it did you
can comment sort of just as you could
before let's go ahead and go back and
let's keep walking through the channel
lesson so you scroll down certainly
you're going to have your profile
information that you had before right
here with your name channel views and
all that kind of stuff important links
and channel comments you've got some
more branding options and a lot of
different modules you can customize this
site really looks very different but
functionally it's not that strange and
unique it definitely is just going to
take some getting used to I think that
in a few months we'll all be used to it
appreciate it but certainly right now it
is a very big change anyway guys leave
some comments down below let me know
what you think about YouTube channel
layout if there's a big trend that I see
I will take it upon myself to email
YouTube kind of let them know and give
them some feedback I know they're always
looking for ways to improve its never
hurts to let the community speak out
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed and for
