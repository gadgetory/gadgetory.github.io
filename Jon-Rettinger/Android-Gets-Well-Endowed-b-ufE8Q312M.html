here android is an operating system that
has been extremely well endowed it's got
the good fortune of some fantastic
hardware and the nexus one the droid and
the various hero devices it's an
operating system that's extremely
scalable offers a lot of customization
and for many people has really been the
perfect fit of form and function however
Android has been lacking one big feature
that I've been mentioning for since it
first came out a lack of native
multi-touch support American other
Android devices like the hero that have
added it but out of the box and really
did not support multitouch well those
days are long gone and let me show you
what multi-touch natively looks like on
Android particular than nexus one let's
start we're probably use it the most the
browser go ahead open that up surround
TechnoBuffalo and take two fingers and
do the of course pinch and zoom and on
hardware like a nexus one where you're
running the Snapdragon gigahertz
processor it is incredibly fast I mean
it zooms in zooms out as quickly as your
fingers go there is no delay and no lag
it looks like it's been there since day
one implemented really nicely you still
do get the plus and minus magnification
bars down there if you want to use it
but multi-touch just worked so well and
of course we rotate the landscape it
will work just as well for you assuming
it'll rotate it will work for you
exactly the same way so that's one way
that multi-touch has been implemented
and square still get the same options to
double tapping things like that let's
get out of this let me show you the
other way where it's implemented Google
Maps go ahead and put up the maps
application here push this off to the
side pinch and zoom is in full effect go
in right side that up and again works
just as well as it does on any other
multi-touch device it's quick it's fast
and adds a really nice feature add I'd
say to Android but that's not it that's
not the only place where you get that
let's take a look at the gallery here's
a picture I took her just my keyboard as
a test and zoom in zoom out really makes
for a very nice picture viewing
especially on the screen here like the
nexus one it's just so big it really can
that almost be too big for a picture you
can see that helps extends outside there
anyway she wanted to give you guys a
quick demonstration of multi-touch on
the Android device in particular here
the nexus one it works and in my review
the nexus one I gave it a 4.75 I sort of
lost that quarter of a point because
didn't have multitouch on revising my
review and giving it a complete five I
could see myself using the nexus one
every day and being thrilled with it
it's a great device Android is really
come into its own when it now offers a
fantastic extremely competitive feature
side with any mobile phone out there and
I guess jon rettinger hope you enjoyed I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
