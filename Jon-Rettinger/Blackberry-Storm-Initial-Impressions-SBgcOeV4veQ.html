lakers calm and i want to give you my
initial impression of the blackberry
storm I've had one since early Thursday
morning and I haven't had enough time to
really give it a thorough review but i
do want to give you my initial
impressions i did a comparison video at
the iphone and this video is going to be
just about the storm and I let it stand
on its own legs so first thing running
on verizon's network well this is going
to vary from your location I have been
very impressed the verizon's network I
haven't used them in about eight years
and call quality is clear I haven't had
a single dropped call and there evdo
network when they have strength is
almost as fast as Wi-Fi very impressive
network well that's really going to vary
just my impressions of the call called
on the device has been absolutely
fantastic so one thing to note about the
blackberry is REM has traditionally made
non touch screen devices what they've
done with the storm is adapt their
operating system I'm not going to go
into numbers of operating systems but
what they did is they adapted it for
touchscreen beginning it wasn't
initially made for a touchscreen device
and oftentimes that shows menus can be a
little bit laggy moving through menus
can be laggy selecting things can be
laggy I'm gonna get to all that in a
minute but it definitely shows that this
was not developed as a touchscreen
device it was more adapted for a
touchscreen device so those are some of
the negatives one thing that I really
have to say I do love and I'm getting
very used to is the click screen on the
blackberry storm and think you can
really see that but it does depress just
a little bit when you're when you're
typing or pushing any sort of button on
it it feels very similar to the track
pad on the macbook actually feels almost
identical and it really is intuitive I
know there's been some concerns that you
can't type as fast because you have to
wait for the screen to pop back up but
that has not that issue for me it pops
up almost instantaneously although a
concern I do have is possibly dust
getting around the outside of the phone
when it's pushed in but it seems like
rim to care that and there appears to be
a small membrane around it build quality
of device is fantastic it's solid it
feels good in the hand the back is made
of metal it's got a gorgeous 3.2
megapixel camera with autofocus and
video recording capabilities
mms it's got a full HTML browser and of
course got the blackberry email system
rims email system is fantastic I forgot
how good it was I haven't used a
blackberry in about a year and a half
and it is unbelievable pushes
instantaneous it's quick it's fast you
know I really couldn't be happier with
email aspect of it so one of the gripes
I do have with the phone I think one of
the ways where it shows that it wasn't
initially made for a touch brain is with
the accelerometer it is quite laggy
somebody give you guys a quick
demonstration of that here so I'm gonna
turn this on device is just simply
locked turn it notice there's two
seconds away and that's not so bad
occasionally to the lake and gums get
twice that long so let me go ahead and
show you another example here of that we
unlock the device accelerometer
something that you have to use very
often on the phone little bit laggy but
not terribly bad so let me show you a
website happen to have John for lakers
calm queued up here i'ma show you they
saw her ometer again on the website I've
made the brightness as low as i can so i
hope you guys can see that so not so bad
so let me give you another example here
go back to the home screen i get the
blackberry menu button there still is a
little bit of a delay so we couldn't
push that it takes about a second
forward to pop up now i'm going to
compare that to let's say the blackberry
bold which the operating system was made
for a device like this so when I hit the
blackberry button right there it's an
instantaneous pop-up scrolling through
menus everything comes up you know
immediately it's not a big issue and the
lag is not that substantial but when
you're using an opt-in you're hitting a
lot of buttons it definitely becomes
noticeable so that's one thing to be
concerned about the phone does have a
visual voicemail service which is quite
nice and it looks similar to that other
phone that I'm not going to mention but
visual voicemail is great it tells you
who is calling one thing that I've heard
about the device and the reason that
there were a little bit of shortages on
launch day research in motion also noted
rim had plenty devices ready to go but
there was a glitch in operating system
they were getting ready to release if I
actually had to reflash all the phones
about a few days before release and
obviously that is quite time consuming
so there weren't as many initially out
for launch day as there should have been
so what that means is that this device
is running an older version of a
firmware now what is ok about that is
that this phone is over the air
upgradable meeting the operating system
can be upgraded over there so I'm not
that concerned I think things like the
lagging and the accelerometer slow down
will be fixed with an over there update
this is the first time it's been
released and it does have a fair amount
way to go before it's perfected but it
is a great device it can play music play
videos the screen is gorgeous you can
view your pictures I gotta say I really
have been very happy with the device
while it says I have actually been using
this as my primary phone uh since
Thursday and I've been very happy with
it um now am I going to switch to use
this as my primary device that's yet to
be seen but I can't say that I'm
enjoying using it right now so guys stay
tuned to the channel on the website for
some more reviews and some more thoughts
and musings on the blackberry storm I
have other phones kind of in the docket
here that I want to review and share
with you guys as well but want to give
you guys just my initial impressions of
the blackberry storm if you're with
verizon or you're thinking about
switching i recommend going to a verizon
store and playing with the phone it's
certainly not for everybody but it is
for a lot of people texting on it is
very quick the keyboard can be a little
bit squirrely it's hard when you push
the button you get a little blue light
that glows but you can't always tell
where that blue light is coming from so
you frequently have miss types but that
may just because I'm not used to the
keyboard yet so I'm gonna hold judgment
on that and I have gotten used to the
suretype keyboard very quickly so guys
if you want to get the phone you know
like I said go check it out at a store
and make your own decision I'm not here
to convince your one way or another just
to help educate so guys jon rettinger

initial overview and musings and
thoughts to the device and I'm off to
dinner and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
