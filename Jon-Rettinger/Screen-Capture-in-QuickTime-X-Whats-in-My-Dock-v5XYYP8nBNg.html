technobuffalo here I want to give you a
demonstration of quicktime ex's new
screen recording feature so i'm going to
give you a tour of what's in my dock and
i'm using the new quicktime screen
recording functionality so you can see
how it works so in my dock right down
here you've got the finder I don't keep
banging that exciting down there
dashboard I don't really use dashboard
too much I've sort of been straying away
from the widget tell i would like to get
back to it firefox is my browser of
choice i also use safari I check for my
chat needs itunes quite obviously my
twitter client of choice i use tweetie i
think it does a very good job this is a
free version with a little bit of ads
but you can pay i believe 15 bucks and
get rid of those if you'd like I photo
for all my photo I movie so where I do
almost my editing I web I really do use
that webbing one I make sure why it's
there facts let's get rid of it now i'm
going to start using the mail client
with the exchange server and see how it
works that's something new feature
that's found in snow leopard my address
book I can't let me start using ical as
well since I can sink my calendar with
an exchange server calculator obviously
a calculator the new quicktime part that
icon no icons pretty sick-looking
actually skype parallels desktop i
hardly ever use windows anymore but this
is a virtualization program that
virtualized windows on your mac system
preferences time machine hopefully I'm
to use that very often it has saved my
butt those several times i'm glad that i
have it I've got Microsoft Word
Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint I do not
use the iwork suite I'm sticking with a
microsoft office I've got a shortcut
here some documents that I use quite
regularly and I've got all my
applications one of the cool things
actually in applications now with snow
leopard so you can scroll through them
there's a little scroll bar there on the
side kind of neat little bit hand you
can see some of the applications that i
have and use so it does it guy just want
to do a quick demonstration the screen
capture program found in quicktime
player it's really nice it's very simple
to use if you want to use it you just
open up quick time
go to new screen recording it's not
going to show up now because I'm using
it and that's really it and in the upper
right hand corner you got a button here
that'll say stop recording and when you
want to stop recording yeah just hit it
so that's it guys for exclusive content
sure check me out on twitter twitter com
so that's John for lakers and to learn
more about technobuffalo check out
technobuffalo com I will see you in the
next video and the zooming that I'm
doing is just by holding down the
command key and rolling my mouth lets
you zoom around really anywhere on the
screen that's not a QuickTime feature
that's just a Mac os10 feature see you
guys the next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
