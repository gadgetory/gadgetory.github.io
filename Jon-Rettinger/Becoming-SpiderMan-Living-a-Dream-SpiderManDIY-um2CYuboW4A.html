video I have to say this video sponsored
by Sony but in reality I feel like this
video is sponsored by spider-man
he was sponsored by freaking spider-man
Sony reached out it was like hey
spider-man homecomings coming out July
7th they have a cool opportunity to be a
part of the promotion for the movie you
want to do it I've never replies like
hell yeah faster than that you know if
you don't notice about me I'm a huge
comic nerd not like a johnny-come-lately
comic nerve and like MC you started but
like since I was a little kid this is my
comic collection from when I was tiny
and I've been collecting comics for ever
I mean I was a cub of them I've got two
more tubs at home I lived and breathed
this stuff when I was little and served
the geek culture become something cool
look see these characters that I loved
as a kid on the silver screen or on the
movies has been absolutely awesome so a
chance to be on the periphery of
something that had to do with that world
was beyond incredible and I guess this
was very different in typical text video
that we've done but this was an
opportunity for me to live a dream so
like it was that we can make our own
spider-man costume promote the
spider-man DIY that you could sort of
make your own spider-man costume Sony
was working in conjunction with goodwill
it was sort of goodwill find stuff so
make a spider-man costume you could make
one and then we got a chance to present
our costume to spider-man himself Tom
Holland you got to go to the YouTube
space enter latest film which was cool
in its own right and they wouldn't let
me see the steps days built for the
spider-man stuff it was like very
secretive and they had to cover my eyes
before I went in and I walked in and now
I know why they did it they defensively
built Peter Parker's labs at the YouTube
space they had actual props in the
movies they had the actual homemade
spider-man costume they had a vulture
costume big guns and other stuff from
the movie it was incredible deceit and I
I mean they got my initial reaction on
camera and I was
Lord in fact if the actual cost me were
there they had the Tony Stark costumes
from draped in a corner just all the
things that were there with like my
whole childhood coming back to me sort
of coming to life which is a insanely
awesome opportunity and I got to sort of
build my costume in this set I got to
feel like Peter Parker was just such a
badass
time and cool thing to do we had our
idea already in place for the costume
that we wanted to go with but we got
there they're like a table just like
biter stuff out everywhere from like
sequins like belt buckles like Seuss and
sock I always like the Scarlet Spider
kind of look we took a kind of a hipster
look at hoodie and cut it and then we
use stencils to make a spider logo we
want to like a battle-worn
type look for a costume to use like
feeds blood and we cut it we found these
really cool like scoop of boots that
really web base that look like a costume
and then we've got to make goggles and
put a hood over it I think the costumes
would look bad at it looks kind of
homemade it looks like Peter Parker's
costume from the movie before he gets
that Tony Stark dude
I was really proud of how it looked and
then when I showed my son the video
telling him Spider Man I will for my
whole life remember to look on the face
it was something that I will never
forget we've done a lot of sponsored
videos have done a lot of videos in jail
over the years but there are some
memories that stand out of this
professional career getting the dress up
like spider-man meeting spider-man and
the look on my son's face is the answer
sadly if every man was absolutely
incredible it was just a really
inspiring experience to be a part of and
again I know not a tech video this is a
chance for me to live my dream like
really live my dream and I decided I
wanted to share it with you guys
so I've talked about the costume and I
hope you guys want to see it so if
you're watching this after June I link
down below to go to the Sony YouTube
channel to check it out

come true and if you guys had a chance
to make your own spider-man suit what
kind of style would you go with you or
