iPhone 10 up against the pixel to excel
this video is guaranteed to piss off 50%
of you there won't be any cop-out
whatever is best for you I'm going to
declare a winner at the end so the five
categories we're using to determine a
winner our design camera display
performance and intangibles clearly we
could have done another 30 categories
but I want this video to be 45 minutes
so I picked the five that I thought best
sum up a phone and hit every aspect of
the device can't offer so let's start
with design every company's trying to
make a rectangle look sexy and Apple is
no exception
holding the iPhone 10 is like holding a
screen albeit with my hairline not right
at the top people need to be pretty
split on the notch it's not my favorite
design feature but overall I really like
the way the phone looks I like that the
front is completely devoid of buttons it
is a beautiful looking device the glass
on the back makes a phone feel really
nice and premium as well I'm split on
how I feel about the banding on the
sides I like it on the Space Gray
version on the silver version you look
shiny prone to scratches it makes it
look cheap to my eye the back is made of
glass and Annapolis claims it's the
strongest glass ever on a device and it
may be I don't want to test it but is a
fingerprint magnet so at least bear that
in mind the biggest design flaw of the
iPhone 10 comes from the camera and the
hump that comes with those two 12
megapixel sensors you can't put it on a
desk and use it without it wobbling back
and forth understand why this still has
such a big camera top I would easily
settle for a thicker phone the bigger
battery and no camera hump but if your
photo on a desk you're constantly typing
you're watching a video that wobble is
going to get really annoying so next
let's jump over to the pixel 2x L the
two-tone designs not for everybody I've
got the black version here I kind of dig
the look it's more of an industrial
design it is certainly not bezel as a
lot of companies are going nowadays but
the fact that it does have bezels on the
top and bottom mean you get front-facing
speakers the phone has a very functional
feel to it I love the way the aluminum
fits on the back it's got that cold kind
of feel to it the fingerprint sensors on
the back but they meet the texture
inside of the button the same as the
texture on the back of the phone I
really like that at
setec designer pixel 2 is relatively
uninspiring I'll be an extremely
functional on the camera outside it's
got a teeny tiny ones but not nearly as
egregious as what you get on the iPhone
so when it comes down to just design
looking at both of these phones you can
see clearly different design directions
the iPhone 10 rises far above when it
comes to design design category goes to
Apple so next let's jump to cameras and
both these devices have incredible
camera setups but let's start with the
iPhone 10 it's got two 12 megapixel
sensors in the typical format you'd
expect a wide angle and a telephoto it's
almost an identical setup actually just
different orientation than what you've
got on the A+ except now both sensors
have oh is built-in I was really
impressed with the dynamic range I
thought saturation really hit a sweet
spot and pictures came out looking
really good overall and almost every
scenario that I threw at it on the video
side 4k at 60 frames per second was
pretty nice but while you are recording
video again oh is you can almost run
with this thing and the video is gonna
look really stable portrait lighting on
the other hand has been a completely
mixed bag in fact I stopped using
completely excited entrie lie on the
results perhaps when it comes out of
beta beat a bit more useful but if you
have a long hair you can pretty much
cross off whatever finding much would be
used for it
alright so onto the front it's got a
true depth sensor enables all that stuff
like face ID but it also enables
portrait mode through its 7 megapixel
sensor which is awesome at least in
theory for a front-facing camera it
looks really bad sometimes half of a
background would be blurred half
wouldn't it was completely inconsistent
and all over the board I expected much
better from Apple if you're taking just
regular non portrait selfies though they
do look pretty decent alright so on to
the pixel if you look at this just on
paper you think this would be a blowout
from the iPhone standpoint it's got two
two megapixel sensors as opposed to just
the one on the pixel 2xl but fortunately
that is not the case
damn this is an incredible camera that
Google is put into the pixel to excel
the pictures in normal light looked
incredible about being oversaturated it
really shined in low-light and direct
sunlight it was perfect
I couldn't find a scenario where this
camera didn't take good pictures on the
video side the 4k is capped at 30 frames
per second it did look good portrait
mode is also here on
rear and the front and it works
incredible on the rear it uses machine
learning to sort of get better as you
use it all right so it's a familiar
story
pork remote looks good on the back but
what about the front pixel to pixel to
excels rocket an eight megapixel sensor
pictures coming out of the eight
megapixel sensor especially on the
portrait mode setting look ridiculously
good and again they've gotten better
over time when it comes to front-facing
portrait the pixel spanx the iPhone 10
the rear photos that's really a coin
toss which one you like but all around
package of cameras Google did an
incredible job here with the pixel
through the pixel 2xl it is definitely a
win for Google that's an X let's jump
over to arguably the most important part
of the phone with the display and this
is essentially the OLED Wars let's start
with the iPhone Apple is really first to
move into a lot of new technologies but
when they move in that direction they
usually do it right and OLED is no
exception they did a really good job
with the screen on the iPhone 10 so the
5.8 inch OLED panel is extra tall it's a
little bit strange to hold it first it's
got an aspect ratio of nineteen point
five by nine the PPI is not as high as
what you get on the pixel 2xl it's only
458 with a 24 36 by 1125 resolution is
plenty of pixels here the screen is a
great job balancing color saturation
there is some slight color shifting at
off angles a lot of people love the true
tone display I mostly turned it off but
that's gonna be a personal preference
thing HDR content looks really good due
to the wide color gamut I was able to
see the screen in direct sunlight which
is a big worry that I had with OLED
panels overall it's a really
well-balanced panel that looks good
showing almost any content of any color
all right so next let's jump into the
pixel to excel and I do want to say that
this review was filmed post the November
update so display on the pixel 2 XL is 6
inches in a more conventional 18 by 9
aspect ratio really high PPI
538 and it's 28 80 by 1440 HDR content
here is gonna look good same wide color
gamut you've got on the iPhone 10 but
there's a definite blue hue here to the
device some people might like
get it really didn't sit well with my
eye the display looks good
I think it looks better post update but
do you compare the quality of the OLED
panels on the XL fours on the iPhone it
is a clear win for Apple and the iPhone
10 let's jump in to performance both
these phones are the current king of
speed for respective operating systems
the iPhone is an absolute screamer the
pixel to excel is a beast and everyday
usage both are really fast it's only way
like a quantify speed let's go to the
benchmarks so the iPhone 10th is rocking
a 11 Bionic that's got two high powered
cores and for low power cores pair with
three gigs of RAM although Apple doesn't
like to tell you how much RAM is in
their phone the pixel he's using the
familiar snapdragon 835 with four high
powered cores and for low-power cores
and again you look at paper and thick
benchmarks would tell the story clearly
seems like the pixel is more perceived
power but damn the results here were
surprising so a Geekbench the iPhone got
a single core score of four thousand
three hundred and thirty four and a
multi-core score of ten thousand eight
hundred and forty two so keep that in
mind when I tell you at the pixel of two
XL got a single core score of 1898 and a
multi-core score of six thousand 356 so
those are the benchmarks and I get it
the benchmarks don't tell the full story
what matters is end user experience and
both end user experiences are really
good but I promise no cop-out gotta pick
a winner and looking at those numbers is
staggering what Apple has done at least
it perceived a lower power at least
lower ram they've done an awesome job
optimising 11 bionic the iPhone 10
clearly takes this category and for the
last category let's move to intangibles
phones are becoming more and more like
this intangible category I think helps
separate one device from another the
little things that make it shine and
make it the best advice for you let's
start with the iPhone so perhaps the
biggest reason a lot of folks buy an
iPhone as Apple's ecosystem things like
iMessage and Apple pay make it just
really easy to use you're also getting
wireless charging ip67 water and dust
resistance it's fast
charge capable carplay you get the
novelty of face ID you're getting pretty
quick updates from Apple and the device
is crazy fast as we saw from the
benchmarks alright so the iPhone 10
brings a lot to the table the pixel to
excel is clearly no slouch you are
getting really good speakers for a
mobile device way faster quick charging
lower price of 849 bucks and always-on
display I use quite a bit you're getting
the Google assistant which I prefer
you're getting the squeeze on the sides
access Google assistant you're getting
Android auto you're getting Android pay
no notch at the top again ip67 water and
dust resistance and the last intangible
but definitely not least the aluminum on
the back makes this phone incredibly
more durable so you're looking at the
intangibles both phones have a lot to
offer but find it pick one based on the
little things I'm going pixel qxl it
takes this round so before we tell you
up a winner and perhaps to come your
rage I want to thank our sponsors
Sennheiser and their AM Bo smart headset
for making this video possible
especially in the intangible category
both phones lost their headset jacks you
got to deal with either lightning or
USBC and these are an awesome option so
first they do all the stuff you'd expect
from a high-end pair of headphones
there's an app you can download it can
control different modes there's a really
good job with noise cancelling is
probably my favorite way to use it you
can also get some of the ambient noise
piped in if you want to hear somebody
talking to you but perhaps the coolest
thing is binaural audio which is more
commonly known as 3d audio so when you
plug these things into your phone in
your recording when you play it back
with the headphones in you're going to
hear them as they were when you recorded
it so you'll hear a matter the left here
or the right ear depending on where they
were located it is an absolutely
incredible way to listen back to audio
so right now the nvo smart headset 6
advantage of the lightning protocol in
the iPhone but there's an Android
version that'll be coming later it's
gonna work with Apple's camera app of
course the Apogee meadow recorder filmic
Pro voice memos and with any other
stereo audio recording app you could
find there's a microphone built in to
each earpiece
so it's plugging point right out of the
box but there is an app of a
to download and give you a lot more
settings and customization options so
again this is the Ambu smart headset
thank you to Sennheiser for making as
versus video possible we'll link to it
down below if you want to learn more
it's been a hard-fought battle 50% of
you are probably crazy pissed at me but
don't be pissed you picked up one of
these two phones you got an incredible
device but only one can reign supreme
so the winner by total of three to two
is the iPhone 10 it's been an incredible
device I love having a big screen with
almost no bezels on an iPhone I am
getting one of the best phones I have
ever used
that is incredibly fast powerful and
offers a lot of features I've been
hoping Apple is gonna offer like quick
charging and wireless charging are here
finally Apple is caught up to the best
of Android and a lot of ways has
exceeded it so what do you guys think
you probably already let me know in the
comments do you agree with the iPhone 10
taking this battle what do you want to
see next
for our vs. leave in the comments down
below cut the video a thumbs up because
appreciate it and most importantly don't
forget hit that little bell to get
notified when new videos are coming
we've got a few awesome vs. lined up and
you don't want to miss it hope you guys
enjoyed until next time I'm John R
