Hazleton from technobuffalo I'm here to
very crowded Aoife trade show in berlin
checking out the brand new Galaxy Note 4
just announced today going to hit every
carrier in the United States all four
major ones and US cellular are you
looking right up front here at the 5.7
inch display its 2560 x 1440 pixel
resolution under the hood you're getting
three gigs of ram Snapdragon 805
processor and more 32 gigs of storage
expandable obviously you've got the
heart rate monitor that we saw before in
addition LED flash and a UV sensor this
time around on the bottom is the hole
for the s pen which is here and also we
improved and then up top you've got the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack the IR
blaster power button on the right and
then you can notice you look close these
chamfered edges sort of the silver there
you go to get the glimmer there so it's
a nice more premium look than what we've
seen before a lot of other changes here
you can use the S Pen to swipe and
select things I can't do that because
I'm holding the camera with one other
hand for pop-up windows and also to
select pictures say if you're in a
gallery sort of the way like a mouse
would operate in a lot of ways and then
that's just a quick look here at some of
the features you also get the new widget
for S Pen for quickly editing things and
I'll just dive into some of the
preloaded software SL 3.5 obviously and
then since this is the galaxy note 4
it's also the only heads handset right
now that will work with the VR headset
but that's just a quick look here at the
galaxy note 4 this is how Hazleton from
