from technobuffalo here over the past
few years we've done some awesome
contest and giveaway some great prizes
this time though we've got some
brand-new that's never been done before
that we've been trying to put together
for literally years I'm so excited to
announce this next contest stick around
let me tell you what it is
so we get a lot of questions here on
TechnoBuffalo whether or not it's via
ask the buffalo or send through us to
our contact us form I read every one of
those an overwhelmingly people want to
know how they can get into tech review
and they can see the fun we have the
passion or they want to know if they can
come work for TechnoBuffalo well the
answer to both of those is yes yes you
can and I'm going to tell you how thank
you to the folks at eighteen t for
sponsoring this has literally been years
in the making and I'm so excited to be
able to bring this to you in all
awesomeness we are offering an
incredible contest to come work for
TechnoBuffalo at CES we will pay for
your travel we will pay for all the
airfare and hotel all you have to do is
come be a part of the TechnoBuffalo team
at CES 2013 incredibly awesome so the
contest is going to run from today
December 11th it'll can only run for 10
days because CES it's coming up nice and
quick who's gonna run through the 21st
of December gonna end at eleven
fifty-nine p.m. pacific time on december
21st so just right before the 22nd you
will come to CES with us from the 6th to
9th of january this isn't just a random
contest where I'm gonna pick a winner at
random this is someone who's going to be
on the site whether text or videos got
to make sure we are hiring essentially
at least for the few days the right
person so here are the rules first you
have to be 18 or over those are CES
rules not ours so if you're under 18
state to hopefully be able to do a
contest like this and upcoming years you
just have to be 18 or over to enter and
we're making this international song do
you live on this planet and you can
speak English pretty well since that's
what we speak in the videos you can
enter Steve got two ways to enter either
as a writer or as a video producer or
even a third way I guess is a
combination of both so if you fancy
yourself a writer and you think that
your writing has what it takes to be on
a TechnoBuffalo site especially to be on
the site with your own byline there for
CES all you gotta do is submit a little
bio about yourself submit to original
articles and let me stress or Ridge
we're going to check for plagiarism
don't copy anything else if you
plagiarize you'll immediately be canned
I'd send those to contest at
TechnoBuffalo calm all the information
is going to be down below and on
TechnoBuffalo calm I can send those
anytime between now and the 22nd we're
gonna ask if we can keep one entry per
person not going to qualify if you
submit yourself again we're going to go
through and read every one of those so
write your two best articles don't rush
read it through spell check it look for
typos don't abbreviate words or use
smiley faces in your articles make them
as professional as you possibly can and
we will go ahead and we'll pick from
those or you can go ahead and use a
video side of things if you're like me
and you're more comfortable in front of
the camera than perhaps you are writing
you can go ahead and leave a video
response to this video on youtube and we
will watch every one of those now
because we are essentially hiring some
for TechnoBuffalo this is going to be
subjective meaning i'm going to pick the
winner i'm gonna pick either someone who
I think is the best writer or someone
who's the best on camera there's not
going to be any sort of random this year
I'm going to pick the best talent I
think is going to be a perfect fit for a
technobuffalo at CES you get to come
with us to AT&amp;amp;T is developer summit to
come with us to events and you'll write
with us and you'll be a part of the team
for those three days and we're really
excited of course when you're not
working for us you'll be able to use
your bed and walk around CES and explore
everything that CES and the city it's
hosted in Las Vegas has to offer so let
me recap all the rules there's a lot of
stuff here so from today December 11th
through december twenty first contest is
going to run 18 or over speak english
live anywhere in the world submit to
articles and a bio to contest
technobuffalo make sure they are
absolutely your best or submit a video
response to this video you can either
win as a writer or win as a video person
so you don't have to do both at all you
can be one or the other I need to be 18
or over and you'll be at CES with us
from the 62 the ninth and I will pay
your airfare I will pay for your hotel
you'll be the same hotel at the rest of
the staff is and we can have a lot of
fun so thank you to AT&amp;amp;T for helping
make this possible I'm glad we found a
great sponsor that believes and sort of
giving the audience a voice and I'm
thrilled
able to do this for you wntd want to do
this for absolutely years since the
first time I went to sea ES and I'm just
excited to give somebody a chant if you
don't win don't be discouraged hopefully
be able to do this every year fingers
crossed i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and hopefully you will be
to see you next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
