we're always trying to fight against we
have preconceived notions going to any
sort of testing but our job is to push
those to the side and review a product
objectively I'm gonna pull back the
curtain a little bit when the iPhone 8
and I thought 8 plus were announced I
was not excited about it I didn't think
it was anything revolutionary were giant
we knew and I expected to be
overwhelmingly disappointed with the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus but in my
five days of testing I've actually been
pleasantly surprised with what Apple has
done here so I'm going to talk about the
iPhone 8 in the iPhone 8 plus its review
for both devices and I'm gonna try to
not talk about the iPhone 10 and focus
on these devices as they exist on their
own let's get started for me one of the
most appealing things about Apple
products in the past has always been the
design and a look and feel and this is a
very familiar design for an iPhone it's
the fourth iteration of the same design
that we saw with the iPhone 6 when you
flip the devices over though it's an
entirely different story these things
look much different than the press
photos maybe hands-on videos like you to
believe Apple has no uniform color for
Space Gray at all this version around is
almost a dark gray and I love the way
these colors look the silver is kind of
an eggshell white the gold is now a more
muted gold all three colors tree looked
drastically different and I think very
much improved over their namesakes from
last generation the glass back to make
the phone field pretty different as well
if you've held a modern Samsung device
if you've held you know an s8 or Note 8
you're gonna know what that glass back
feels like a lot of people like it I'm
one of those if you get the darker color
it's gonna be a fingerprint magnet and
it can't make it a little bit slippery
so if you want to sort of protect that
you can put a D brand skin on the back
of it link to them down below
at long last wireless charging is here
and maybe you don't care about what I
was charging but for me it is a giant
deal and I am so happy that it is here
and I give Apple credit cruising the Qi
standard not going with some weird
proprietary Apple only wireless charging
I've got the Samsung quick charger I use
with my note 8 put this on it and it
worked
immediately which is really nice to have
I will say though the charging rate was
definitely slower than most modern
wireless charging capable Android
devices I've tested but for me I put it
on
turn off the phone wake up in the
morning and it's charged so for that use
case why those charging works and works
as advertised so I mentioned the
beginning I was surprised by the iPhone
8 and 8 plus I've primarily been using
the plus for my testing and battery life
has been way better than I thought I
could have not only on a mobile device
but on an iPhone in particular by the
end of the day I'm generally at fifty
five to sixty percent battery life left
and that is a staggering number for me
and about twenty percent higher than
when I'm at with almost any other phone
including when I was with the iPhone 7
plus but if you're traveling got a day
trip you almost don't have to bring your
chargers you put on battery saving mode
and you turn off some app so you turn on
your screen brightness so might be able
to push it to two and a half three days
hats off to Apple making a phone with
pretty damn good battery life we've done
something I get a chance to say very
often performance tears really fast now
with performance and might be a little
bit psychosomatic I know we've seen the
Geekbench scores and it's crazy fast off
the charts so it seemed fast to me but
the things I notice that I can quantify
boot up is stupid fast now on the iPhone
8 and iPhone 8 plus apps open and
definitely faster on the iPhone 8 and 8
plus vs. previous gen phones everything
else just filled zippier to me I never
felt that iPhones were slow my church
the imagination but it handles iOS 11
smoothly I can multitask it out any
problem or these how app allows you to
multitask without any problems games
works really quickly the phone is just
quick and it's probably going to be very
quick continuing into the 12 18 to
perhaps 24 months that you might have
this phone screen there are two schools
of thought when it comes to apples Apple
screen you're like I don't mind 1080p
for battery life and why can't I get a
high res screen on the iPhone 8 plus I
think that I maybe somewhere in the
middle I don't want to be a Prakrit and
say battery life is awesome but should
have higher risk rings I know there'd be
a trade-off there but as far as 1080p
screens go it looks good it doesn't look
best in class anymore I think by any
stretch of the imagination it is above
average though in direct sunlight which
is odd it's not the brightest screen in
the world but you can definitely see it
when you go out and if that trade-off
for battery life is important
you you're gonna be fine with the screen
if you've been served longingly looking
at Android phones with 2k and a higher
resolution screens then you might be as
appointed here but know that going in
the screens fine it's serviceable it
works well it's just not the best
anymore in the business so true tone is
a new addition to the 8 and EA plus it
mattered legs between 0 and next to 0 to
me I guess you only notice that we have
another phone next to it that doesn't
have true tone but it really didn't
impact my impressions on the screen at
all here cameras are perhaps the biggest
reason people choose phones a generation
over generation if you look at just a
spec sheet between the iPhone 8 + a +
versus the lash ID and in fact we did a
versus video comparing the two you might
think they are identical same megapixel
same apertures but that is not the full
story at all especially when it comes to
the 8 + this is an instance where the
processor makes all the difference
these cameras are incredible in direct
sunlight photos look beautiful they're
not as saturated to get with the Samsung
phones the color reproduction is more
true to real life in low-light they were
great the shutter speed is incredibly
fast the video capture looks great I
like still having a 2 x optical zoom I
very rarely used a ten-time digital but
it's there if you need it
portrait mode we had with the last gen
with the iPhone 7 plus it's here as well
and our process is that portrait mode
way faster than the 7 + so portrait
lighting is also here on the A+ and that
was a cool almost like a cool party
trick I liked trying it I had
inconsistent results Bona worked it
worked really well
we've done some portrait lighting for
our headshots here at the office and
they looked pretty close I'll forgive
inconsistency so since it is definitely
still in beta but it does come damn
close to working exactly as every time I
give a lot of questions I reviews on the
speakers on the phones so I'll run
through this really quickly the speakers
are actually pretty good about 25
percent louder that we have for the last
gen they don't sound this tinny as the
iPhone 7 plus they sound loud they sound
fine they're on the higher end of
average when it comes to phone speakers
so another instance where I was
surprised was actually when it came to
storage so these phones ship either 64
to
the six which are big size discrepancies
and you're probably like me think you
need the larger size I set up my f-18
Plus from scratch and I haven't you done
that probably the past five gens of
phones and I was shocked when I set the
phone up from scratch and I had all of
my photos backed up in the cloud I was
using less than 18 gigs of storage
Apple's got a new file system with iOS
11 I'm sure that plays a big part of it
I might want to even consider that 64
gigs for the $6.99 or $7.99 depending if
you go for the 8 or the 8 plus you might
not need as much as you think but
obviously you're used to a very I think
I would be completely fine in the 64 I
never thought I would say that if you
can't tell I came away impressed with
the IFO dating A+ and I didn't think I
was going to there's a lot of little
things that make up a really nice whole
when it comes to the phone I like the
way it feels I like to speed the
speakers are surprising coming back to
iOS has been a nice experience it was
kind of a welcome home I still wish a
lot of things could change but the OS
still is what it is it's still the grid
array of icons and if you like that or
if you're okay with that
this is the best implementation of it
quite obviously now there's a specter of
what's coming next from Apple what the
iPhone 10 is going to be but this phone
as it exists in the market it's still a
really good choice it brings it up to
close to parity with those features
inspect to Android has and that's what a
lot of Apple aficionados and a lot of
Apple fans have been asking for you've
got things like wireless charging you've
got water resistance here and it just
works out of the box and for a lot of
people that is the ideal mobile
experience and it might be one of those
folks again so that's my take on the 88
plus what matters is what you do and
what you do with your wallet are you
spending your hard-earned money towards
an 8 or a + are you waiting for the
iPhone 10 you switching to Android let
us know why down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
