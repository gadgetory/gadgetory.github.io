TechnoBuffalo with my unboxing of the
2012 Mac Mini what you know has been out
for a few weeks now but this is a custom
built to order quad core model with a
one terabyte fusion drive so let's go
and find out what comes in the box and
exactly how fast that fusion drive is so
on the front of the box we have the Mac
Mini text and the little guy hanging out
down below and it's actually about the
size of this box on the flip side they
give us a little overview of the ins and
the outs but I'm gonna give you guys a
close-up look and actually give you a
real tour of that so we can go and skip
that for now so we'll go to flip the box
back over so we can begin the unboxing
by sliding out the Mac Mini like so
we're gonna lift from the little tab
right here and then we're gonna set the
Mac Mini to the side just for a second
as we go through the accessories first
up we have a quick start guide which
kindly says hello then we have some
documentation on the Mac Mini itself and
then of course it would not be an Apple
unboxing without those Apple stickers
beyond that we have an HDMI to DVI
adapter which is cool of Apple to
include because you know as well as I do
they will gouge you any chance they get
with an adapter cable lastly we have a
power cable and that wraps up the
accessories so we can go and unwrap the
Mac Mini and take a closer look so you
guys can see it's got a nice brushed
aluminum finish doesn't take up a whole
lot of space it's very compact we've got
the Apple logo up towards the top and
giving you guys a closer look at the ins
and the outs we'll go to start to Alex
with the physical power button and then
right next to that we have the actual
power input followed by the Ethernet
port we then have a firewire 800 port to
HDMI out a Thunderbolt port for USB 3.0
ports an SD card slot and an audio in as
well as out now like I said this is the
quad-core model so here is an initial
Geekbench score and you can see it does
perform quite well and it actually does
beat out some of the older Mac pros
again this is equipped with a fusion
drive which takes the speed and
performance of a solid-state drive
and combines it with the lower-cost
capacity of a traditional hard disk
drive now even though these are
physically two separate drives you guys
can see it does come up as one volume in
the Mac OS profile tab as far as speeds
go you can see it does operate really
really quick with read speeds over 400
megabytes per second and write speeds
topping over 300 megabytes per second to
give
an idea of how that actually affects you
in terms of a real-world test I'm gonna
duplicate a four gigabyte file and you
guys can see exactly how much faster the
fusion drive is that a standard 5400 RPM
hard disk drive so I'm gonna go in an
interrupt right here and stop it not
make you guys sit through the entire
thing you can see the actual hard drive
had quite a ways to go whereas a fusion
drive finished it up very very fast I
know a lot of people will mistakenly
compare it to a traditional SSD cache
and drive like a CGI Momentis or
something like Intel Smart Response
technology but those actually operate in
terms of hard drive first SSD second
whereas the fusion drive tries to do
everything first through the SSD and
then intelligently moves things that you
don't use to the hard drive and then
things you do back to the SSD so thank
you guys very much for watching this
video hopefully it gave a little clarity
to those of you interested in the fusion
drive make sure to check out
TechnoBuffalo comm for the latest and
greatest tech content this is John M or
John for Bulls signing out I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
