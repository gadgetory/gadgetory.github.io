from technobuffalo here day by day
android games market share more devices
are released there's more carriers
important with that comes more
developers and today I am very proud and
happy to show you probably the best
application for Android it's been
available it's called skyfire and it's a
new browser I've closed you that are
maybe you've used windows mobile device
in the past or a few other mobile
platforms you're very familiar with
skyfire it was the first mobile browser
that brought actually a real internet to
windows mobile devices previously they
can suck with a very antiquated mobile
internet explorer and skyfire really
brought the reel web to windows mobile
and they serve carried that tradition
through to android so we've got a
demonstration of skyfire two point oh
i'm going to show you a little bit of
how it worked and do a comparison i was
probably the biggest competition to see
how it stacks up skyfire the way it
works is actually takes the content
caches and stores it on the server side
and pushes it out to the device so
generally that translates to a faster
load time as opposed to mobile safari or
the default browser that's built into
android which actually builds up the
content right on your phone so enough of
me yapping let me show you what it looks
like we'll go ahead and the launch
skyfire instance got a brand new icon
right there and here it is i'm fat
technobuffalo already queued up so
you're going to notice a few things
probably right off the bat so the first
thing that you're going to notice is
this big navigation bar across the top
and let me show you what that does so
first obviously you've got your address
bar back button you can go ahead and add
to favorites right there you can tap it
or favorites you'd like this is your tab
switcher handles tab sort of interesting
in a very graphically friendly way so
you go ahead tabs you want find one that
you like close it obviously by the X and
go ahead and just keep tapping I'm one
of the many really cool features about
skyfire probably one of the ones that I
find
most useful is this next button here it
looks sort of like half an android guy
and half of a desktop computer and
there's a reason for that those of you
guys that use your mobile phone for a
lot of web browsing like I do often
times you're stuck looking at mobile
content you have to navigate the bottom
to say the view standard page button
skyfire actually makes it pretty easy
you can have it select mr. which way the
website and the servers are going to
view your device to either view it adds
Android device desktop or an iPhone let
me give you a quick demonstration of how
that works so let me go ahead and go
back to the tab switcher here go ahead
and jump over to espn.com I'll go ahead
and just run a will refresh it so put
the X right there hit refresh I'm just
going to load up espn.com the desktop
version as you're familiar and as you've
seen on really other devices I'll show
you what that pop up was in just a
minute can I go ahead and select that
again and let's go to have it view as
Android and will stop the load and go
ahead and hit refresh and it's going to
load the mobile version so immediately
you see em espn.com and he gets her the
mobile optimized version it's very neat
all right so let me show you something
other cool stuff that skyfire does we'll
continue the tour odds last button here
at the top is going to load all your
settings forward find on page the
settings are pretty similar to what
you'd find on most mobile browsers it
looks sort of natively Android but
there's something other kind of cool and
hidden as well I know your eyes are
probably thinking all right good browser
how does it handle Flash content that
seems to be the buzz word on everybody's
lips now it doesn't sort of
interestingly I'm testing it here on the
HTC droid incredible which natively has
flash support but for using another
Android device like the nexus one or the
droid a stock android 2.1 phone that
doesn't have flash support your sort of
out of luck however skyfire has a pretty
cool word around let me scroll down here
we'll go to what would be a youtube
video YouTube embeds obviously in flash
so here it is what goes well with
blackberry is dancing article post early
today on nothing there to hit the menu
button however you get a little icon
that says video what that's going to do
it's actually going to work around the
Flash content
and lets you load up flash a video now
you can't play flash games or anything
but you will be able to view really all
the flash video there which is kind of
neat oq it upload it play it in full
screen so you can few sort of Flash
content that you get with on you know
MSNBC com or other sites that rely on
flash for streaming video it's very neat
and sort of a ingenious work around i'd
say so continuing the tour down here
I've gotten explorer button you can sort
of explore things or people are talking
about and sharing is very easy here with
skyfire as well I can go ahead and send
it to french stream facebook peep which
is the built-in Twitter client on the
droid incredible messages mail or gmail
and send it off to whomever you'd like
really works very well so I talked
earlier about how it loads web pages and
how accused things up just very very
quickly and let's put that to the test
so we've got probably as big as
competitors sort of here and we'll line
them up so you guys can see we've got
the Nexus One and we've got the iphone
3gs these are all running on the same
Wi-Fi network we're not relying on any
sort of mobile network speeds or not
going to test verizon eighteen t or t
mobile we're just testing the same
network speed on all devices these two
here are running pretty much the same
hardware a snapdragon 1 gigahertz
processor the iphone 3gs is a bit older
probably about a year older now and it
is of course running about a 600
megahertz processor so it is a bit
slower so the real test is going to be
between the native browser on android
and skyfire here from the droid
incredible so I'm go ahead and try and
refresh it at the same time or at least
close the same times you can get a sort
of a fair comparison we'll go ahead and
launch up the menu here and we'll do the
same thing on top see we can lease hit
refresh here and then I'll hit refresh
on the iphone to the second afterwards
you can see how how that works so I hit
this just about a second earlier this is
off to the races and we'll hit you here
on the iPhone about two or three seconds
later we can see if that's were that
same
speed translates through so we're sort
of first to see the content cued up
right here you can see that video pop up
like you know that there is indeed Flash
content and I can already see the
content on skyfire sorry load through
and start scrolling and the sky fire is
just about done you can view the whole
site here and scroll through Android is
still loading iphone still loading
they're all so the going sky fire is
just about done and the rest of them are
still loading which is pretty true for a
real world experience no sky fires down
the rest when we're all done very quick
as far as loading websites now how do
you zoom in certainly this supports
multi-touch so you've got your zoom in
zoom out you don't have sore your double
tap but if you want to zoom in you've
got sort of your stock Android way with
the plus and minus magnifying glass of
there that we've seen on other Android
browsers the other phone certainly if
you want to zoom in and out you have
multitouch and you can double tap to
zoom in certainly the same thing is true
with the iphone sort of pioneered that
you can see sort of the same thing on
skyfire so all in all in real world
testing up and using skyfire for a
little while it is noticeably quicker
for browsing and you're getting sore
that full immersive browsing experience
I really like that I can set it to view
my phone as a mobile or a desktop or
even an iphone lot of sites hit by
specific content it's just a very neat
feature and something that I think sky
fires did a fantastic job of
implementing overall which is definitely
going to be my default browser for
Android and take the features that it
offers are really incredible and just a
very nice package for a mobile browser
so what do you guys think skyfire
something that you want to check out not
check out sure it curious what you guys
have to say anyway jon rettinger from
