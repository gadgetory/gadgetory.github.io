TechnoBuffalo here the iPhone 6 plus is
here and I wanted to share my first
impression if you're deciding whether or
not you want a 6 plus or maybe you want
a six maybe you don't want an iPhone at
all
hopefully this will help you decide and
of course as I use the device for the
couple of days in a couple of weeks I'll
update when we get to our full review
it's gonna get started
so case you guys don't know we do things
a bit differently here TechnoBuffalo we
use our devices for quite a while before
we do a review i've always disclosed how
long we use them so this is not a review
just my first impressions from picking
up and using the iphone six-plus for
just a few hours and of course seeing
and demonstrating it at Apple's launch
event a week and a half ago so the first
thing about the six plus you're gonna
notice is it's big I personally have
been using larger phones for a while I
was coming over from a oneplus one I'm
using the LG g3 larger phones are sort
of used to me it's sort of more strange
out to have almost a smaller device but
it is bizarre to see iOS on a gigantic
screen it just seems strange so you just
singing out a teeny tiny little display
now just to see it just jumbo it seems a
little bit odd to me it does still have
a couple of cool things if you think
that maybe you want your icons to be
bigger you can make it bigger and sort
of make it easier to sort of get where
you want to go I call it just the old
people mode which I like to set might do
because my eyes I have like the eyes of
leg in 80 85 year old Apple tried to
make one into navigation a bit easier
now if you double tap the touch ID but
not push it in not push the home button
just double tap it lightly the screen is
going to sort of shrink down and I'll do
that on almost any screen you're on sort
of make it easier access with one hand
to get to where you want to go I'm
speaking of one hand the power button is
now on the right hand side of the device
all iPhones before I had it on top and
of course with the giant screen that's
just not possible your thumb gets used
to it really quickly and maybe I was are
used to it so it came from the oneplus
again but it feels really nice and very
easy to use the device also is
incredibly thin so then you almost feel
like there's no battery not inside of it
a lot has been made to about the curved
screen on the device and it's a curved
screen it's curved glass rather not the
curved screen so what that means that
you swept your finger over it it just
feels nice Apple made just a gigantic
deal about how I felt natural and smooth
it feels good you're not hitting a
corner that's really just of it it's not
like I must buy you because you have
curved edges it works fine the other
thing people are talking about a lot is
the camera so yes it is still a
megapixel are focused pixels we did a
video showing what the quiet camcorder
quality was like we showed the optical
stabilization on it but now let's say
megapixel sensor has focused pixels so
it'll focus a little bit quicker and it
does focus very quickly so you can take
shots very fast I've got a one year old
at home and then dude is a little fast
moving sometimes I wanna get my shots
really quickly what impressed me was how
optical and image stabilization worked
you can check out the video down below
if you want to see our tests of what
look like with Marcus filming me just
jumping around it stabilized really
really well without making things look
worked I was also surprised to the
built-in microphone I also worked really
really well I'm in a lot of meetings
maybe you are too you might have your
phone and vibrate a lot the vibration
engine in here is ridiculously loud it's
like four times as powerful that's just
made that number up versus what you saw
a mass generations iPhone I mean you can
hear the thing vibrate sounds like a
real ton if you have it on a table is
going to buzz all over the place so
definitely be aware of that now one of
the nice things that I really liked
about iOS 8 of course is customizable
keyboards but just a stock keyboard on a
large screen makes typing way easier
I've got bigger hands and kind of fat
thumbs and I used to type awfully on the
iPhone 5 or 5s keyboard or anything that
came before that way more accurate now
on the larger screen also because you
have a larger screen now have you turned
keyboard into landscape mode because
they're just crazy amount of real estate
you get cut copy and paste options you
get arrow keys so if you can do a ton
more things take advantage that larger
space just makes typing much easier and
also in landscape you now have a
landscape view which is unique to the 6
plus not didn't get that with the six so
if you like that you can go ahead and
use it using it like this phone just
feels like a mini iPad Mini to me what
it jism mini squared I don't know if I'm
gonna really use my iPad main that much
anymore so sort of a really nice
milligram it looks exactly the same I've
got my phone calls on here I can do
everything I could on my iPad Mini but
now just you know on a little smaller
screen it is too early to test battery
life I will say though we've had the
phone on now for about two hours and
it's been on non-stop was doing a
restore and downloading apps I've only
lost about 8 percent of battery life we
also filmed outside so it seems to be
pretty impressed with battery life but
of course we'll test that as we go
through the days and the weeks that I
use the device but first impressions
lease on battery seemed really good also
seems really good are the speakers it's
you'll be loud a much louder than what
we saw on laceration so if we rely a lot
on speakerphone you want to play our
music at a party whatever you're going
to be pretty happy with that
a lot of people were asking how the
phone fits your pants you may not be
used to carrying a larger phone
especially if you've been to serve an
Apple purist I'll show you right now if
it's very nicely in the pants is really
if you're wearing normal dude pants not
gonna have much issue it's really thin
ladies I wouldn't put it in your back
pocket or do two things put things in
your back pocket because it'll
definitely crack if you sit on it but in
just regular pants no problem at all I
have to get used to it but no issue I
don't use cases on my phone either
taking it in and out of my pocket if it
feels a little bit slippery so if you're
like me like to take your phones naked
take extra care with your phone the
other sort of weird thing too with this
is the camera now it's got a little bit
of a hump on it which seems strange for
Apple design they really pay a lot
attention to every small thing that
seems to be a really big oversight I can
kind of forgive it on the six plus
because it's optical image stabilization
so things have to move but on the six
doesn't make much sense but that also
means that you put on a table it Wiggles
a little bit which is I'm not kind of
annoying you have to get used to it I
guess but funny story if you look at the
press pictures on Apple's website they
use very special angles to make it look
like you can't even see that camera I'm
just fun thing to do go check it out and
you almost don't see it overall I'm
really enjoying using the phone I like a
big screen I like iOS it's nice to have
those two sort of married whether or not
it's going to be the perfect phone I
don't know it's still the same is it
just a bigger version of it hopefully
battery life is gonna be a bit better as
well of course there was things changed
we get through the review process I will
update this let you guys know what you
know what might be different anything
else you guys want to see though be sure
