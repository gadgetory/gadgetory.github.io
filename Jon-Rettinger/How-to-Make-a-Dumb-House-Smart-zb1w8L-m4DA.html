to you by the LG twins wash two loads at
the same time smart watches smart phones
smart cars smart everything and as more
and more of these smart objects start to
permeate our places of inhabitants we
get closer and closer to a truly smart
home not smart house like katey sagal in
the Disney Channel original movie a
smart home like a place where you live
that makes your life a little bit easier
by automating some of the things that
you would normally do on a daily basis
anyway well how is a smart home even
possible well a lot of devices these
days come with some sort of a
connectivity option the main one you're
probably gonna hear about most often is
is what Nest does it's got Wi-Fi
connectivity so connects directly of
your Wi-Fi network connects directly to
the Internet can do things like pull
updates find information about the
weather see what temperature it is
outside do all kinds of fun stuff all
over Wi-Fi but if you want to have some
conversations between the devices in
your home
locally you're gonna need a different
technology because Wi-Fi needs to go to
the Internet and then back down so what
you have in terms of local mesh
connectivity is two things
z-wave which is a proprietary platform
that's owned by a company but a lot of
platforms excuse me a lot of devices do
still support and then you've got ZigBee
which is an open source platform that a
lot of devices also support many devices
support both z-wave and ZigBee and of
course you're gonna need a way for those
devices to have a home base somewhere to
control them from so you're gonna need
some sort of a hub whether it's a smart
things hub or a wink hub there's a
number of options on the market these
days and once you have those things all
in the same place on the same network
those devices can start to have
conversations with not one or another
for example when I leave the house my
nest goes into auto-away mode so it's
set to make sure that all the lights are
turned off when I'm not home when I come
home it comes from a way mode to home
mode and then once it hits home it sends
a message to our lights through so
through smart things to turn the lights
on because we've come home you can do
all kinds of other things too with hubs
if you have a device that's z-wave or
ZigBee enabled you can
yet for example a door contact so that
when the door opens up it'll send a
message to smart things you can do
things like motion sensors so if someone
is broken into your home it'll set an
alarm off or send you a text or send you
a phone call you can also do things like
moisture sensors so you can set up
really cool stuff at home with like a
Raspberry Pi stick a moisture sensor
into one of your important plants when
it needs water you can set it to
automatically water itself or at the
very least send you a text when it needs
it there's also one other platform
that's on its way that was announced
from Google this past year at i/o Google
we've is is the latest entry into the
sort of Internet of Things mesh network
situation that we're looking to build in
our homes we've is also open source just
like Google's stuff tends to be and
Android is basically shrunk down to run
on tiny tiny devices whether it be a
dishwasher or coffee machine or in this
case a washing machine it doesn't
actually run on the LG twin wash line
but they do have a lot of connectivity
they've got NFC and Wi-Fi on these
things and they're actually really nice
washers it's a front-loading washer and
you can get a cute little tiny pedestal
washer for underneath it as well so you
can do two loads at the same time but
since it's Wi-Fi enabled it'll let you
know on your phone when your run is done
it'll also allow you to do things like
download cycles from the internet like
from a curated list if you need to do
you know colored stuff or you need to do
all whites or just delicates or certain
kinds of fabrics you can download those
cycles from the internet and you can
just wash watch no not wash you don't
want to wash your washing machine in
progress you want to watch your wash in
progress which you can totally do from
the app but that's all that there's all
kinds of other devices that we can do in
our home these days you can get a Wi-Fi
enabled coffee machines so that when
your alarm goes off in the morning your
coffee is already going by the time you
go downstairs you can get a nest protect
which is basically very similar to a
nest but it's focused on carbon monoxide
and smoke detection and you can get
something like a Luna will actually used
to be called a Luna now it's called an
eight this is a project on IndieGoGo a
while back my parents actually got me
one for my wedding we don't have it just
yet but
a network-enabled mattress cover so it
actually uses a ton of sensors to track
the way that you sleep make sure that
you wake up at the right time in between
REM cycles and it even heats the bed for
you and that's a great way to let your
coffee maker know when you've actually
gotten out of bed so as more and more of
these things that we would tend to have
in our homes become Wi-Fi and
connectivity enabled we get closer and
closer and closer to a smart home which
I for one think is incredibly cool but
what do you guys think is a smart home
something that you're excited or about
or are you like my wife and think that's
probably a little more on the grid than
you would like to be if you're into
smart homes let me know what devices you
have at home I would love to hear your
experiences with a wink hub because my
smartthings hub is pretty old since it's
a backer version I need to replace it
soon anyway anyway thank you guys so
much for watching I really appreciate
you guys taking the time be kind to one
another and I'll catch you in the next
