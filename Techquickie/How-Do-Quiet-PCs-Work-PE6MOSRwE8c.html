the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos have you
ever gotten all excited over your
powerful new pc build then realized once
you started gaming on it that it sounds
like a miniature wind tunnel in your
bedroom
indeed excess computer noise has been an
issue for a long time so it isn't
surprising that these days just about
every major case and cooling
manufacturer including be quiet who
sponsored this video offers some kind of
quiet series but what makes them quiet
and what else can you do to cut down on
noise let's start by looking at the
cases themselves many cases marketed as
low noise add some kind of dampening
material to the inside usually foam the
reason for this is pretty simple you
know how an empty room with hardwood
floors makes your voice echo when you
say something but laying down some
carpet has the opposite effect same
principle softer surfaces have a
microscopic structure that allows them
to trap sound rather than reflecting it
making foam a cost-effective and popular
choice well-built quiet cases will also
often feature vibration dampening
features such as small rubber grommets
that hold mechanical drives in place to
keep them from transferring vibration to
your cases plastic or metal frame of
course you still need a way to push heat
out of your case so oftentimes
quiet cases will come with you guessed
it quiet fans computer fans are equipped
with a wide variety of different bearing
types these are the little bits in the
center of the fan that actually enabled
it to spin you can learn more about them
here but here's a tldr common sleeve
bearing fans are cheap for manufacturers
and can be reasonably quiet when they
are new the problem is that compared to
ball bearing fans which are a bit more
expensive and typically louder they tend
to wear out much faster and any worn-out
fan is a loud fan trust me as you move
up into higher-end designs you can get
to have your cake and eat some of it too
rifle bearing fans share some design
similarities with sleeves but they are
better lubricated which increases their
longevity moving further up the food
chain we find fluid dynamic bearing fans
that do a better job of keeping the
lubricant between the fan and the seal
using high pressure this cuts down on
friction may
them much quieter and finally you can
even get magnetic bearings where the
bearing doesn't even touch the body of
the fan kind of like a maglev train
which makes them insanely quiet but
because those are also quite expensive
you'll often see quiet cases designed to
use fewer larger fans as they give you
lots of airflow at lower rpms which
helps them stay quieter than their
smaller counterparts which leads us
perfectly to another way to cut down on
fan noise if a slower fan is quieter
surely one that's off is even better
some high efficiency power supplies
feature a zero rpm fan mode which means
the fan won't spin up at all when the
system is idle though it should be noted
that once you fire up a game the fan
will need to spin so zero rpm mode isn't
an excuse for a manufacturer to cheap
out on it the same is true for graphics
cards which can have as many as three or
four fans on them and be a huge source
of noise under load so keep a lookout
for GPUs that are cooled well enough to
not need the fans all the time some can
even play basic games with the fans off
crazy regardless of what kind of fan
setup you have in your PC though keep an
eye out for components that allow you to
set custom fan curves some motherboards
and cases include a fan controller so
you won't be fighting a losing battle
against a PC that thinks it knows better
than you how much cooling it needs right
but what if you simply don't want to
mess around with more fans than you
absolutely have to well it is possible
to buy passive heat sinks for your CPU
and GPU that you don't strap fans to and
therefore are totally silent but not
only can they limit your overclocking
potential they can also be really bulky
and unsightly so you may want to pass on
a case with a window if you go this
route route a more popular option is to
liquid cool your rig and simply place
water blocks on your CPU and graphics
card combined with a radiator with quiet
bearing fans the only thing to watch for
here is the quality of your pump so make
sure to thoroughly check reviews as just
like cheap fans cheap pumps can wear out
quickly and get very noisy and finally
keep in mind that even if your cooling
system is quieter than a Churchmouse
it's still important to pick components
like power supplies and graphics cards
that won't suffer from coil whine or
electrical noise so make sure to read
reviews and see if a certain model
you're looking at
is susceptible to it otherwise that
high-pitched distraction might totally
wipe out any acoustic benefits you got
from spending your entire tax refund on
an RGB nickel-plated waterblock the be
quiet silent based 601 delivers the
perfect combination of maximum silence
and an excellent usability for
remarkably quiet configurations
it's got noise dampening vents providing
excellent air permeability with maximum
silence extra thick insulation mats of
10 millimeters in the front top and
sides and 2 pre-installed peer wings to
140 millimeter fans there's also a
three-step fan controller catering up to
3 fans a power supply shroud and smart
hard drive slot covers providing a neat
interior it's ready for radiators up to
360 millimeters and it's got a side
panel made of tinted and tempered glass
there's a three year manufacturer's
warranty and the product was conceived
design and quality controlled in Germany
