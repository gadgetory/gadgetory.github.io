marvel at how some of the most advanced
complicated devices ever invented can be
defeated by crude simple instruments and
perhaps nothing demonstrates this idea
better than the Faraday cage essentially
a metal container that blocks wireless
signals but wait a minute Linus metal I
mean it kind of makes sense to me why
thick concrete is bad for your cell
signal but wouldn't metal just like
conducts electricity
well okay of course yes it does which is
why you shouldn't stand outside with a
Festivus pool during a thunderstorm
but that doesn't mean that metal will
allow radio waves to pass through it you
see a Faraday cage works because radio
waves move through electric fields which
interact with the charges that are
naturally present in metal electric
fields push positive charges away from
them meaning that when they hit a
Faraday cage negative charge collects on
the side of the cage nearest the signal
source while positive charge accumulates
on the other side because the incoming
field is oriented in a positive to
negative direction now since the charges
in the metal have now oriented
themselves in the opposite direction
they produced their own electric field
going the other way meaning that they
cancel each other out inside the cage
and the radio waves can't pass through
it the simplicity with which a Faraday
cage can be constructed has led them to
appear in plenty of electronic
applications notably in microwave ovens
where they keep radiation from leaking
out into your kitchen and turning you
into a human hot pocket you've probably
also seen smaller Faraday cages for sale
in the form of RFID blockers which
purport to shield your credit cards from
attackers who might try to steal
information off of them with scanners
and although it's actually pretty
difficult for identity thieves to use
this information as the RFID chips
inside of cards don't contain enough
information on their own to do much real
damage the market for these protective
sleeves and wallets is thriving
none the
less another less obvious example is the
metal layer commonly found inside the
cables for your electronics these serve
as a shield around the copper wire that
actually transmits the signal this
shield is effectively a tubular Faraday
cage that keeps external signals from
getting into the wire and screwing up
your content as well as preventing its
own signals from escaping and
interfering with your other wires and
gadgets and one of the coolest things
about Faraday cages is that due to their
simplicity there are some really
interesting DIY applications some folks
out of concern for their personal
privacy for example will keep their cell
phone in a metal container while
charging also UK police have advised
people with wireless ignition systems to
keep their keys in a similar enclosure
to prevent what's called relay car theft
where thieves read the signal off of
your key fob from outside the house
start your car and then drive away and
another common use is wannabe criminals
lining their shopping bags or pockets
with foil to try to prevent the RFID
tags on stolen items from setting off
alarms when they leave the store though
before you run out and try that one many
retailers are wise to this technique can
have installed metal detectors to defeat
these so-called booster bags on that
note if you're building your own for
whatever reason Faraday cages can't shut
everything out and it should be noted
that any holes in the cage
need to be smaller than the signal
wavelength to attenuate outside
broadcasts so in some situations one
phone might work inside a Faraday cage
while another one might not due to
different carriers using different
frequencies this is something that you
may have noticed in nature's
unintentional Faraday cage the metal
elevator so we recommend a more
purpose-built solution for your Faraday
cage needs KFC of all companies is
offering a Faraday tent that it calls
the Internet escape pod for the low
price of what $5,000
why do they even sell this what are they
even I mean at that price I hope it at
least comes with extra gravy synergy to
is designed to be easier and more
seamless to use than synergy one synergy
is a mouse and keyboard sharing software
that works on Windows Mac and Linux
computers with features like being able
to share from anywhere so you can
automatically control any other computer
without reconfiguring SSL encryption to
protect your keystrokes from attackers
dynamic networking which intelligently
detects the best route based on your
networking setup and the ability to
always run in the background on all
operating systems so you can just set
and forget it if you get the pro version
you can even get access to other cool
features like clipboard sharing dragging
and dropping files copy pasting lock
screen synchronization and tons more so
get 50% off synergy 2 today at the link

watching guys if you just like this
video you can hit that button but
otherwise hit like get subscribed check
out our other channels and leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
