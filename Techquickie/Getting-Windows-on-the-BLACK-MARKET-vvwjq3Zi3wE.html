pay big money to use Windows even to
just install it but crazily enough these
days anyone can download a completely
free Windows 10 disk image directly from
Microsoft as part of the company's push
to get as many people on its latest
operating system as possible and believe
it or not it'll actually work just like
a regular old copy of Windows 10 that
you pay for with a couple of exceptions
first personalization features like
changing your wallpaper will be disabled
and second you'll get an annoying
watermark in the corner of your screen
reminding you to cough up some dough and
activate Windows so let's say that
you've just finished building your
system then and you find these two
annoyances just far too much to tolerate
so you ran up your browser to go buy a
Windows license only to find that most
online retailers want a hundred bucks or
even more just for an OEM product key
remember
that's the one that comes with no
support and that can't be transferred to
a new machine understandably you feel
like this is a massive ripoff and you
begin your search for cheaper
alternatives and lo and behold you find
a few online marketplaces that are
selling Windows Keys for less than 20
bucks
great deal right oh well maybe not just
like anything that's 80% off deeply
discounted Windows Keys do come with
some question marks because for one
thing it's nearly impossible to know
exactly where these keys came from
oftentimes the marketplaces that do
actually say something about the source
of these keys will tell you that they're
simply reselling extra keys from
wholesalers but what does that mean I
mean last time I went to Costco
the bin of extra Windows Keys was
notably absent so then as it turns out
many of these keys are actually coming
from volume licenses this means that the
key was one of many that were sold to a
large business or organization at a
lower bulk price
but the issue here is that Microsoft
doesn't officially allow these keys to
be resold due to the significant
discounts that they initially offered
others might have originally been free
or heavily discounted keys that are
offered to university students or even
simply keys that were purchased
legitimately but in a different part of
the world for a lower price to reflect
the lower earning power of the people
who live there so none of that stuff
actually sounds that bad does it
I'd say it's all kind of gray at best
but you can run into more serious issues
as well many times these keys have
actually been purchased with a stolen
credit or debit card then flipped at an
extraordinarily low price before the
original credit cards owner wises up
because after all if a thief originally
got the key for free then they're gonna
come out way ahead even if they're only
charging 15 bucks for it and I don't
know about you but knowingly accepting
stolen goods even if you did pay for
them here in Canada anyway is illegal
anyway though let's assume you don't
want to knowingly buy a stolen windows
key and you just want to score a deal
are these cheap keys a good idea really
it just comes down to how much risk
you're willing to absorb and your own
sense of personal ethics buying a key
that was originally part of a volume or
education package is a violation of
Microsoft's license agreement but such a
key might work just fine indefinitely
Microsoft does in theory anyway
revoke keys if they find out that
they're being used in an unauthorized
manner but enforcement is spotty at best
and quite frankly at 1/5 the price even
if they did revoke a license you could
go buy another one and you'd still be up
on the deal now as for the ones that are
purchased fraudulently on a stolen card
if the victim contacts their credit card
company or bank and the purchase gets
marked as fraudulent Microsoft could
easily find out and mark that key as
invalid my understanding is that this
doesn't happen very often though so it's
more down to the issue of whether you
want your money going to credit card
thieves or Microsoft you're gonna have
to work that one out for yourself now
some of these mark
places offer buyer protection for
additional peace of mind but anecdotal
evidence suggests that it might not be
completely reliable so if your plan was
to grab a cut-rate Windows key and spend
the savings on a hyped up game pre-order
you may end up disappointed twice
speaking of disappointment FreshBooks
that's not disappointing it's the super
simple to use invoicing tool that
actually does a lot more than just help
you create and send slick-looking
invoices quickly it helps you track your
time with their timesheet function
manage your expenses and even keep track
of who owes you what they've got this
really cool feature too that tells you
when your clients look at your invoice
for the first time so there's no more
back and forth oh yeah I didn't pay well
I'm sorry I didn't get it yet
haha yes you did I have fresh books the
mobile app has all the functionality of
the desktop version so you can take
fresh ebooks with you wherever you go
and if you have any questions you can
just reach out to their support staff
you'll speak to a real human with no
