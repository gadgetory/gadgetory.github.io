Express what works with what what
doesn't work with what what are the
different generations what does it all
mean so today we're going to tell you
everything you need to know about PCI
Express 3.0 as fast as possible so let's
start with the very basics PCI Express
is the interface that is used to plug
modern expansion cards into modern
computers or motherboards it completely
replaced PCI and AGP which is great
because AGP was only for graphics cards
and PCI had to be used for pretty much
everything else PCI Express works with
pretty much anything sound cards network
cards raid cards video cards they'll all
pretty much fit as long as you're aware
of a few simple guidelines now I said
they're Universal but PCI Express slots
are available in a variety of different
physical configurations the most common
ones are 1 X 4 X 8 X + 16 X all of these
types have different slots on the cards
themselves and different slots on the
motherboard the cool part about that is
that they're upwards and downwards
compatible though Here I am plugging a
PCI Express One X card into a 16 X slot
it gets the same power delivery
it just gets less bandwidth delivered to
it because that's all a sound card
actually needs and not only that but I
can take this PCIe 8 X rayed card and
plug it into a PCIe 4x slot it'll still
work but it will only have half of the
bandwidth available to it that it would
have otherwise had if you plugged it
into an 8 X slot the other thing that
affects the performance of PCI Express
is the generation here I'm holding a PCI
Express generation to 16 X card and here
I'm holding a PCI Express generation 3
16 X card they look physically the same
on the connectors but the actual
available bandwidth has doubled in fact
the available bandwidth of PCI Express
cards has doubled with each generation
so a PCI Express generation 1 at 16 X
slot is only equivalent in performance
to a PCI Express generation 3 4x slot so
the takeaways from this are pretty
straightforward PCI Express cards work
in PCI Express slots as long as there's
nothing physically in the way
performance on the other hand is going
to be dictated by what generation of PCI
Express the card and the slaughter
running at so it will run at whatever
is the lowest generation of either the
two components so Gen 2 card gen 3 slot
plug them together they run at Gen 2 and
then performance is also determined by
the length of the card and the length of
the slot so for example this quad port
gigabit Nick needs at least 500
megabytes per second of bandwidth in
order to operate at peak efficiency that
means if I have an older PCIe Gen 1
motherboard I'll need at least a 4x slot
or a hypothetical 2x lot to get the
bandwidth I need because it's only 250
megabytes per second in a 1x slot
however if I have a PCI Express Gen 2
motherboard I could even use a 1x slot
to get everything I need because that'll
be about 500 megabytes per second thanks
