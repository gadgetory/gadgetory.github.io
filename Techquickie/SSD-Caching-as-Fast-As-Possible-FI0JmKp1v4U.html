maybe it's like you've won a picture of
like the Queen on your SSD and then oh
not that kind of cash we're talking
about cash storage so it starts with the
CPU where there's a tiny little bit of
storage that is lightning fast we're
talking nanoseconds the most frequently
used data that your computer needs goes
there next up we've got RAM which is
orders of magnitude more storage but is
not nearly as fast as CPU cache but it's
much faster than this guy right here so
most computers are still running
mechanical hard drives which are again
orders of magnitude larger in terms of
capacity than something like memory but
orders of magnitude slower as well so
we're an SSD cache comes in is it's kind
of like strapping something that's in
between RAM and in between mechanical
hard drives to this solution so the
system can dynamically automatically
intelligently take the data that it
needs most often but not that often and
keep it on an SSD drive this is great
for at things like applications or games
where it's huge amounts of data but you
still want lightning-fast loading time
now this solution obviously isn't great
for something like a notebook where you
have two separate drives going into the
device but what if we had something that
integrated both of these concepts
together in one small device so this is
a Seagate momentous drive this is what's
called a hybrid drive or an sshd
where it actually has a hard drive
inside and SSD components that are never
even visible to the end-user it just
behaves like a faster hard drive but
that's not where it ends
this technology scales all the way up to
the enterprise where huge arrays of SSDs
might be backing up even more massive
arrays of hard drives that's what keeps
pages like Facebook loading extremely
quickly without the company completely
running out of space to store all the
photos and all of the data that gets
uploaded to them so the hard drive is
big and cheap the SSD is small and
expensive and this is where the marriage
of the two makes a lot of sense
performance isn't going to be as fast as
a purely SSD based system but it's going
to be much faster than a hard drive
based system particularly for your most
frequent
used applications and data I hope you
guys have enjoyed this tech quickie as
fast as possible don't forget to like
the video share the video with anyone
who you think might benefit from it and
as always don't forget to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
