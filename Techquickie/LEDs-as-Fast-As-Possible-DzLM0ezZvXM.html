are busy drooling over which
multicolored LED peripheral they wish to
purchase or defending the ones they
currently own as the best and the
brightest
it seems few individuals can deny the
current drawing power of this particular
fashion feature and while these days one
can find pretty much anything they could
desire fitted with flashy color changing
LEDs it seems like not that long ago we
were still talking about how cool the
changing color scheme on the police
station moves remote was which was
incidentally pretty much the last and
only good thing anyone ever said about
it now the invention of LEDs in general
or light-emitting diodes was a process
that began only a few years after the
turn of the 20th century but didn't
really see the light of day until a
short time after Woodstock when
production costs and output capacities
became more reasonable and although many
people today associate LEDs with the
bright lights and colors that they
produce allowing them to generally
outshine their predecessor the
incandescent light bulb the irony is
that most consumer grade products first
utilizing these lights actually produced
infrared waves that were completely
undetectable by the human eye these
infrared diodes were commonly used in
controllers of varying sorts one of
which many viewers today are likely
thankful to have within arm's reach as
is evidenced any time it becomes lost
the television remote actually it wasn't
until the mid 90s when further advances
were made in our abilities to produce
visible light that LEDs became feasible
for use in things such as emergency
equipment televisions and well just that
regular lights so while the construction
of an average LED cannot be called
greater than that of a traditional bulb
their reduced size power consumption and
most importantly savings make them a
pretty tough competitor at the very
least add to this their increased
lifespan about three to twenty times
that of fluorescent or incandescent
bulbs respectively and it seems that
LEDs have become a shining champion
among light sources you see instead of
heating flimsy filaments which have been
sheathed in a globe of ultra durable
baby-safe materials such as glass LEDs
use two oppositely charged diodes placed
adjacent Leon
Electrical lead inside a plastic lens
which are then manipulated by way of the
circuit board the addition of current
causes negatively charged electrons from
one end to combine with positively
charged holes from the other leading the
bonding electron to disperse energy in
the form of visible photons until more
recently when manufacturers wanted to
change the color of the light produced
by an LED they simply changed the
plastic refracting bow that was set in
leaving users who wished for conformity
amongst all their products were those
who wanted to create specialized
lighting themes pretty much in the dark
that was until someone had the bright
idea of placing three separate diodes
one in each red green and blue within
the same bulb for those who may be
unfamiliar with the trichromatic theory
of vision it basically states that the
photoreceptor cones in our eyes come in
one of three brands which are based on
sensitivities to long medium and short
wavelengths to experience the myriad of
colors we see in the rainbow our brains
interpret these varying color signals
and produce a multicolored image like
many good inventions RGB lighting is
reverse engineered from it's more
complex biological counterpart and
produces its effect by manipulating the
intensity of the aforementioned three
diodes independently allowing the user
to choose the desired color so I guess
that pretty much settles it then
things with LED lights are awesome and
that goes doubly for ones that are color
changing well for the most part actually
yeah it is worth noting though that the
cost of an LED bulb versus a standard
one can be significantly higher and the
monetary benefits often don't kick in
until long they're like very long-term
energy savings and replacement costs
have been factored in also there are
still some things LEDs don't do
particularly well like creating natural
light spectrums for things like nursery
operations speaking of light you need it
