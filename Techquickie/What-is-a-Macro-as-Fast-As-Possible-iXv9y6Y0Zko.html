keyboards and mice with support for
macros but the assumption being made
here is that every customer knows what
they are and what they're good for
without anyone actually taking the time
to explain it so in just a few words a
macro is a way of creating a faster
easier shortcut that lets you perform an
otherwise multiple step process in just
one step they're most often created to
speed up and simplify the execution of
repetitive tasks some applications like
Microsoft Office actually have excellent
built-in support for macros allowing you
to create your own shortcuts to execute
complicated pre-scripted strings of
commands something I used to use quite
often in my old job in marketing and
product management when sorting out
gigantic spreadsheets but most of the
programs you use including games have no
or very limited inherent macro support
so that is where fancy peripherals with
macros come in
while some allow macros to be recorded
directly on the device most use their
own custom software to create multi-step
commands and save them to a small
built-in memory chip on the device where
they can be executed with a single
button press this allows the user more
flexibility to customize their macros
all right - this seems pretty simple I
pre record something like lul that's so
funny thanks for sharing it then I only
have to press one button to have the
perfect reply ready every time someone
sends me a sweet picture of like a cat
wearing a hat or something what could I
want to customize about that well
actually a couple of things the most
important of which is the recorded delay
between each of the discreet commands
that pre-programmed input bit from
before is a perfect example normally I
can only type as fast as my fingers can
move but an email client or word
processor could easily accept that
entire sentence all at the same time in
this case I would actually want to
execute my macro with no delay but
that's not always ideal in a game it
might be beneficial to create a macro
that calls it a hole strike waits two
seconds
it's a lightning resistant bus and then
three seconds later casts
I don't know Firefly swarm or something
like that so you can see how this would
be a great thing to be able to control
generally speaking macros support
playing back with the same delay with
which they were recorded injecting a
fixed delay or removing all delays for
instant input with some supporting
manual input of the delays while this
feature is most often present on
products targeted at gamers there are
plenty of legitimate uses for
reprogrammable keys that support macros
outside of games as well and in fact
when the Logitech G 15 keyboard first
launched with its impressive 18
programmable G keys it was a gamer and
productivity enthusiasts dream come true
and both of those groups of people were
flocking to buy it so there you have it
if you've got a gaming keyboard or mouse
there's actually a very good chance that
using the software included with the
aforementioned computer peripheral will
unlock this functionality for you and
once you get the hang of using macros
they're fast and easy to create and very
very useful speaking of very useful Josh
from fractal design gave me a call the
other day about advertising on tech wiki
and it kind of goes well yeah I was
talking to some of your viewers and they
were telling me they're tired of hearing
you blab on and on about sponsors at the
end of every video so if we do this I
wanna do something a little different
instead of a normal integration where
you talk about our quality PC cases and
power supplies with minimalistic
Scandinavian design and outstanding
customer support I just want to buy the
sponsor spot and watch you get pied in
the face instead I figure that'll be
pretty fun for everyone
so I pondered his idea for a moment and
then it hit me I've done worse for 20
bucks nevermind what one of these
sponsors bought costs so here we go
so if you guys appreciate Josh's
approach to sponsoring tech quickie and
you want to see more of it hit up the
fractal design Facebook page linked in
the video description and give it a big
ol like while you're at it don't forget
to like this video and share it if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
and leave a comment with your favorite
uses for macros or any suggestions you
have for future fast as possible
episodes thanks for watching and as
always don't forget to subscribe if you
haven't already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
