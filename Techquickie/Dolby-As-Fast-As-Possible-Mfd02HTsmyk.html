pay out the freaking nose for movie
tickets is that primo sound you get at
the theater and indeed a huge part of
marketing these days for cinema chains
is pushing their audio technology that
promises some sort of transcendental
experience for your ears but years ago
Dolby Laboratories you may recognize a
little indication on games movies or
even someone's receiver under their TV
started trying to bring a theater like
experience to the home they like other
competing companies such as DTS provide
compression technologies for audio
streams so that they'll fit onto a disc
much like how one might compress a video
file to make it suitable for the net I'm
looking at you h.264 Dolby's technology
was born many years back with Dolby
stereo if you are budding audio
enthusiasts in 1975 you might remember
seeing Dolby stereo being tossed around
what was special about it was that it
took your conventional stereo sound and
created a four channel surround
experience in the theater through some
mathematical trickery with the sound
encoding but it wasn't until 1982 that
the home was first introduced to Dolby
technology with Dolby Surround
another analog technology that added a
mono surround channel to the usual front
left and right this was improved with
Dolby Pro Logic which added a center
channel and used in more advanced
algorithms who not only extract the
extra channels but to also improve the
movement and discreteness between them
Pro Logic still exists today in a new
and improved form with the ability to
mix stereo or surround 29.1 channels as
technology progressed it became easier
to record multi-channel sound natively
and so Dolby Digital debuted in 1992
featuring six discrete channels of audio
in the ubiquitous 5.1 setup five
speakers one subwoofer since then we've
seen incremental updates to the
technologies with improvements to the
number of channels as well as maximum
bitrate and sample rate in the case of
Dolby true HD a lossless audio codec so
what does the future look like well in
order to blow
your mind the new dolby atmos now
supports up to 128 audio objects that
are independent of a channel assignment
why is this better well imagine a
helicopter flying over you instead of a
conventional system vaguely telling your
ears where the chopper is flying with
Dolby Atmos sounds can be created
independently and maps to a specific
location so you'll be able to pick out
exactly where it is at most also scales
the specific speaker structure of the
theater and does this in real-time so in
theory you should hear a spatially
accurate effect no matter where you sit
put this all together and voila you can
almost feel like you're there and if you
don't want to pay 9 freaking dollars for
a bucket of popcorn dolby has now
expanded this technology into the home
it does require a compatible AV receiver
which supports the extra channels needed
to make this possible the more speakers
you have by the way the better but at
most will work with at least 6 so you
won't necessarily need to sell an entire
kidney to make it happen audible.com is
the leading provider of audiobooks with
more than a hundred and fifty thousand
