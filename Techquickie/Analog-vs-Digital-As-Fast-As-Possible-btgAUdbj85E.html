been slapped on so many things that it
sort of become a marketing buzzword to
convince people that something is
high-tech or better in some way of
course most modern electronics are
digital by definition as opposed to
analog but what do these terms even mean
and is digital necessarily even better
for a long time most consumer
electronics like televisions and
cassette decks works by using analog
signals which you can think of as being
similar to one of those wall clocks with
a perpetually moving second hand just as
the second hand continuously moves to
represent the time analog signals use
some type of thing that's constantly
changing to represent data for example
both AM radio and old-school broadcast
TV use a signal with a continuously
variable wave height or amplitude to
represent sounds or visuals these sorts
of analog waves can be decoded or D
modulated fairly easily with diodes that
can relay actual data to a screen or a
speaker but as any child of the 1980s
who grew up watching rabbit ears
connected TVs or dubbing cassette tapes
knows a massive drawback to analogue
tech is the possibility of interference
the variations in waves that encode
analog data are so small that
interference can easily disrupt the
analog waveforms and cause snow on your
TV static on your radio or even problems
with monitors that use older VGA cables
which are actually analog despite most
other modern computer components being
digital digital technology attempts to
solve this problem by encoding and
transmitting data as clear-cut discrete
units namely ones and zeros instead of
always changing waveforms that are super
sensitive to interference these ones and
zeros are actually just representations
of electrical signals being on or off
when you view it on a square wave that's
either up or down these positions are
easy representations since any piece of
a square wave can only be read in one of
two states on or off up or down they
aren't nearly as vulnerable to
interference making digital transmission
normally a heck of a lot more reliable
across longer distances which is why the
length
speaker wire in your home theater
matters but the length of a digital HDMI
cable usually doesn't at least not for
resisting interference and since digital
data is stored as an exact finite set of
ones and zeros it can be perfectly
replicated anytime you need to make a
copy
unlike analog recordings that degrade
over time due to the difficulty in
duplicating an analog wave at every
single point this is the reason that an
mp3 copied to a million iPods will sound
the same on every one but a cassette
tapes that are copied a whole bunch will
eventually sound like garbage after you
dub them enough times but even though
digital has obvious advantages we live
to a great extent in an analog world
take the sound for instance the sound
waves that come out of your mouth when
you talk are analog in nature so how
does a singer record albums that are
stored digitally on say a Spotify server
well digital recording primarily works
by sampling instead of recording all of
the infant testimony small changes in an
analog waveform an analog to digital
converter takes snapshots of analog
sound or video and stores them as
digital bits this is typically done many
times per second with higher sampling
rates resulting in more data and usually
better quality allowing a digital
recording to achieve pretty close
fidelity to the original performance
while taking up much less space on a
disc of course since you can't exactly
hear ones and zeros digital recording
sound needs to go back through a digital
to analog converter or a DAC which will
convert your mp3 or AAC to an electrical
signal that has a constantly changing
voltage that the drivers in your
headphones will turn into actual sound
so while digital tech has been
extraordinarily useful it's really the
way the digital and analog work together
that makes the brave new world of tweets
Netflix and dankmemes possible speaking
of digital things audible.com is the
leading provider of audiobooks with more
than 180,000 downloadable titles across
all types of literature including
fiction nonfiction and periodicals
audiobooks are a great way to listen to
something while you're saying in transit
on your way to work or just trying to
run or
on the track at school in your super
bored and whatnot anyways that physical
activity whatever at least you can
listen to a book for our audience
members however audible is offering a
free 30-day trial just check out
audible.com slash tech quickie and
browse there over 180,000 audio programs
I would yet again recommend the entire
Harry Potter series there's a ton of
different gems in there and there's
gonna be the movies coming out in I'm
not entirely sure which will have more
stuff in that realm they're not based on
the original series of books but they're
based on books within the books like
inception books maybe I shouldn't
reference another movie when talking
about a single movie either way don't
forget to get a free 30-day trial at
audible.com slash tech quickie don't
forget to like the video if you liked it
dislike the video if you disliked it put
a comment down below with something
you'd like us to check out in the future
check out channel super-fun they did a
video on little mini drones and doing
cool things I wasn't there for it I
wanted to be but I was like literally
across the entire country so that didn't
really work out don't forget to
subscribe you shall see everyone if you
like that video and subscribe to tech
