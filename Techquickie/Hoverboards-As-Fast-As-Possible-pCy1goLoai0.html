down I know it's not really a hoverboard
and I agree with you it's a stupid name
it doesn't hover I get it they're on
wheels nothing has to do with hovering
around the office we usually call them
swag ways but the internet seems to have
decided that they are now called
hoverboards and outside of that there
doesn't seem to be a universally
accepted name other than self balancing
boards which is too long and not catchy
and no one calls it that so we're just
going to call them hoverboards so that
it's easier for everyone to understand
so with that being said hoverboards are
essentially a horizontal self bouncing
board with wheels on each end controlled
by the riders feet and as cool as it is
the technology that makes up the
hoverboard hoverboard whatever is not
that new other devices using similar
technology have been around for
consumers since around 2001 when the
original Segway was unveiled this Segway
had two wheels one on each side was self
balancing and had a set of handlebars so
that the rider could balance more easily
and although hoverboards don't have the
handlebars both vehicles operate a cut
off a concept called the inverted
pendulum which is a pendulum that has a
center of mass namely your body above
its pivot point amazingly enough
inverted pendulum devices have been
around since the early 1970s though it's
not surprising you didn't see people
riding them down the streets back then
you see the processing needed to make
quick corrective calculations has to be
extremely fast and accurate not only
that but the equipment has to be highly
sensitive all of these things add up to
what was until recently a very expensive
combination another inherent property of
the inverted pendulum is that compared
to a standard pendulum it's incredibly
unstable
therefore the pivot point aka the board
must make constant corrective movements
to balance the center of mass which is
the rider almost like balancing a pole
on your palm and having to run around to
keep it upright so how does a self
balancing device counteract this well
with a crap ton of math first off but we
aren't going to get into that mainly
they use gyroscopic sensors which use
multiple gimbal rings to determine an
angle you can learn more about Gimbels
here and an accelerometer based on
leveling sensors to detect the board's
pitch and angle the board uses this
information to take corrective measures
and keep itself upright for example if
you start to lean forward the board will
try to start rolling forward at the
exact speed necessary to keep you from
falling on your face unless you straight
up try to fall on your face then that
will probably happen interestingly
enough these boards have two sets of
these sensors on each side with a joint
in the middle separating the two halves
this allows the sides to move
independently so if you want you can say
spin in a circle if you just lean one
foot forward and one foot backwards
pretty cool right so what's going to
happen if you use down the road
well since self-balancing boards just
kind of became popular recently there
might be quite a few possibilities since
these boards are now becoming affordable
we might see many other types of self
balancing devices in the near future
like the self-balancing unicycle we did
a video on not surprisingly though these
devices have been banned in many major
cities in the US and UK due to safety
concerns these bands are limited to
public places though so I wouldn't worry
about having a SWAT team breaking down
your door for riding around your own
property freshbooks is on a mission and
that mission is to make freelancers less
stressed-out and more organized through
their easy-to-use tool and for crafting
and sending professional invoices in

about us section alright guys thanks for
watching I thought about doing this
video on a hoverboard but they've been
more or less banned at the office so
I don't know like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it
check out our channel super fun video
where we've made videos on hover boards
including jousting each other also
comment in the video and not in the
video description come into the comment
