notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos at the turn
of the 20th century people had all kinds
of fantastical visions of the future
everything from weather machines to fire
fighters that look like Batman but one
idea kept popping up over and over again
the flying car and now here we are
almost 120 years later we have real-time
video chat and robots that can clean
your house hey we even have tinder too I
guess but flying cars still seem like
almost as much of a fantasy today as
they did back then turns out it's just
gosh darn difficult to make a vehicle
that's as good in the air as it is on
the ground oh and then there's the human
element if you think the motorist in
your city are bad at driving in 2d just
imagine giving them each a pair of wings
but that doesn't mean that more personal
air travel will never happen passenger
drones that aim to make short trips a
little easier are in development today
but how do these differ from the flying
cars of our dreams
well for starters passenger drones are
purpose-built for air travel only and
unlike airplanes they usually don't even
have wheels instead they rely on
vertical takeoff and landing or VTOL
just like the drone collecting dust in
your garage right now this means that
they shouldn't need air strips or even a
dedicated landing pad like helicopters
since there's so much lighter but what
about safety well there are a number
approaches to this similar to the hobby
Jones that people fly around to capture
video and spy on their neighbors some
current passenger drone projects are
meant to be operated remotely by a
command center the e hong-won 84 for
example doesn't even have any controls
inside for the passenger except for a
screen that allows them to enter their
destination others though like the one
in development from astro aerospace are
fully autonomous and are designed to get
you from A to B safely with nothing more
than onboard sensors to measure speed
balance and altitude essentially making
them bigger versions of the retail cell
flying drones you can pick up now for
under three grand so maybe it will
actually help matters that you won't
have to rely on your idiot next-door
neighbor to pilot the thing but there
are other considerations as well like
their hobbyist cousins passenger drones
aren't
designed to stay in the air for as long
as 747s with many models currently in
development intended for quick trips
across town or maybe to the next city
over e Hong for example is only
certifying there 184 for 10 miles or 23
minutes of flight not exactly i popping
but certainly better than driving 10
miles if you live in some horribly
congested place like LA or even here in
Vancouver for that matter with that said
gradual improvements to the technology
already have some pretty big names in
the transportation sector looking at the
possibility of using passenger drones as
the backbone of an air taxi service in
seizures around the world
uber for example is currently looking
for a third city to join LA in Dallas as
launch locations for its uber air
service to debut in 2023 which will
transport up to four passengers per
drone and Airbus is looking to launch
their own line of four seater drones
that can cruise up to around 75 miles
per hour and passenger drones may be
able to take you even farther and faster
later on down the road as German company
lilium recently tested a small aircraft
that combines VTOL with actual electric
jet engines to travel across its 300
kilometer range in just one hour and
these guys also intend to market an air
taxi but of course there are many legal
and political hurdles to clear before
we're all zipping around in the air and
drones and it's likely that many of
these drone air taxi services will also
feature human pilots on board until
safety concerns with fully autonomous
flight can be completely resolved but
even though we might have to wait a few
years and wait and see if these drones
won't just become another form of luxury
travel for the rich the tech might have
real potential to make our cities a
little less congested like a cell flying
