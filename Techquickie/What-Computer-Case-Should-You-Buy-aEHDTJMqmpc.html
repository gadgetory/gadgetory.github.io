1990s your choice in cases was pretty
much the following white beige or
whitish beige looking for case lighting
or side panels with windows in it forget
about it but nowadays that the amount of
case choice is out there you could
legitimately argue that your preference
in cases is a bonafide form of
self-expression but what should you be
looking for other than what you think is
aesthetically pleasing well the most
fundamental decision that you can
probably make is what size you want
generally cases come in three basic form
factors that tie into motherboard sizes
ATX micro ATX and mini ITX from largest
to smallest a small case is great for
apartment life or if you frequently
attend land parties but larger cases are
generally easier to work in and give you
more room to upgrade and expand that
being said not all cases within a size
category are made equal once you know
what form factor you want do some
digging into the spec sheet some can
only fit certain graphics card lengths
while other may not support larger
radiators and others still may not fit
beefy tower cooler since they'll stick
out too far to install a side panel oops
and on the subject of fitting things in
a great feature to look out for is
modularity meaning being able to
rearrange parts inside the case for
example some cases offer removable hard
drive cages to allow for long graphics
cards others take this idea as far as
they can and make nearly every component
and fitting removable allowing the
Builder to lay out the interior exactly
how they want one more spatial
consideration is fitting in the extra
components required for custom water
cooling parts like pumps and reservoirs
will need additional space so make sure
if the case actually offers somewhere to
mount them or be prepared to do it
yourself but even if a fancy custom loop
isn't in your budget pay attention to
the cases fan configuration as the
number of included fans varies wildly
and so do the solutions for powering
them with some cases including hubs or
even speed controllers and whatever fans
up you go with it's worth it to find a
case with dust filters
these will keep well you guessed it
dusts from building up on components and
causing thermal problems the nicer ones
will have magnetic frames you can remove
clean and reinstall them easily cases
are increasingly coming with additional
ways to help with cable management -
such as holes surrounding the
motherboard tray so you can route most
of the messy guts out of sight behind
the back panel nicer cases will have
rubber grommets around these holes to
make things look cleaner but arguably
even more important is the placement of
these holes typically you'll get some to
the right of the motherboard but
additional holes above the board for EPS
power and case fans and below the board
for front panel headers and more case
fans are incredibly useful also look out
for cable management shrouds to make
things look even nicer such as around
the power supply and behind the back
panel for more organized routing
although it used to be that you can
always just cram all those cables behind
your motherboard tray and no one would
know there are now a number of cases on
the market featuring tempered glass all
around the outside including the back
panel so just remember that while they
look cool they'll also reveal your messy
cable routing you did behind your
motherboard two more Pro tips I
recommend looking for something with
lots of tool list features being able to
install drives without having to deal
with lots of tiny mounting screws can be
a tremendous time and frustration saver
and look for a motherboard tray with a
cutout for your CPU cooler that way if
you ever have to remove it you want us
to take out your entire motherboard just
to get to the backplate finally do a bit
of homework on the cases build quality
lower quality cases will often have
sharper edges that aren't filed down
properly that are too easy to cut
yourself on during the build process and
could be made of flimsier materials that
bend or warp easily high-quality cases
will feel more robust regardless of
whether the made of plastic or metal and
will have durable finishes so they don't
look worn out so quickly and may also
feature padding to cut down on
vibrations and fan noise hopefully this
guide has helped you narrow down your
search for your next computer case or if
all this sounds too complicated you can
just build your rig
of a cardboard box and hope that nothing
goes wrong another way to make sure
