would be something sweet and delicious
that Chrome Firefox or edge would shoot
out of the screen so that you could
enjoy filling up on empty calories while
you watch tech quickie but tragically we
don't live in a perfect world and in a
computing context the term cookie
doesn't refer to free desserts
instead cookies are actually small files
stored in your browser cache that can do
a number of useful things but have also
been scrutinized for potentially
compromising user privacy so how exactly
do these things work and why the heck
are they even called cookies the name
actually comes from magic cookie which
was an early term for a small piece of
data passed between computers usually
for identification purposes modern
browser cookies also identify your
computer but they serve the additional
purpose of tracking your activity which
actually isn't always as nefarious as it
sounds the way it works is that when you
visit a cookie enabled site for the
first time let's say Amazon the site
will put a cookie on your computer that
contains a unique ID Amazon uses this ID
to keep track of your session so that
the site knows which shopping card is
yours and what you've looked at so it
can suggest stuff like toilet paper to
you if you were browsing for
industrial-sized packs of microwave
burritos session management with cookies
has many more applications though than
just virtual shopping carts the
identifier in a cookie can allow a
server to keep track of your logins so
you don't have to keep punching in your
password every time you visit a site and
it can remember how you've customized
the layout or appearance of a page
previously cookies also allow sites to
figure out how many unique visitors they
get since each unique visitor has their
own ID contained within a cookie which
is important for webmasters who need
analytics data for business development
ok Linus I get that cookies make things
more convenient but I heard they can
also make me fat I mean spy on me
what's the deal with that well one of
the most common ways that your browser
can compromise your
privacy is by allowing third party
cookies which are sent from sites other
than the one that you're visiting for
instance banner ads are often hosted on
a different domain than the one that
you're actually browsing and can plant
cookies on your computer that track you
across multiple sites which many people
find intrusive and downright creepy but
even worse is the potential for cookie
theft which is exactly what it sounds
like usually super sensitive things like
website passwords aren't stored in
cookies but the identifiers in the
cookie can be used to essentially steal
a logged in session meaning that an
attacker could access your shopping cart
bank account or even medical records
without even knowing your password and
get this browsers usually just store
your cookies in plain text without any
encryption making them a vulnerable
target though using websites that
transmit cookie data over a secure
connection can help somewhat so what can
you do then to mitigate these privacy
risks well first of all most browsers
will allow you to disable third-party
cookies with a simple option so you'll
only get cookies directly from the site
that you're visiting and if you want to
take it a step further you can disable
cookies entirely if you don't mind
missing out on the features that they
offer number two is if you've got
cookies on or even just in general be
careful about what you click on
and what sites you're browsing if you're
only navigating to trusted sites that
are going to not spy on you then no one
will be spying on you although it's not
always easy to tell who to trust these
days and finally keeping the hard drive
on your computer encrypted is actually a
pretty key one because if someone walks
off with your entire computer and all
the cookies on it it's an easy way to
have the bad guys putting their hands in
your cookie jar so to speak and on the
subject of bad guys you know who's not
bad guys lynda.com over at lynda.com you
can watch and learn from top experts
about all kinds of stuff like they've
got thousands of
video courses you can take up digital
photography or Photoshop or video
editing or business or whatever the case
may be you can browse course transcripts
to follow along or search for answers
and skip to that point in the video this
is actually a relatively new feature you
can download the tutorials and watch
them on the go including access on your
iOS or Android device you can create
playlists and share with your friends or
watch playlists that your friends have
created so you guys can go through your
coursework together
it's great stuff and it's free to try
for 10 days after that it starts at a
flat rate of just $25 a month so whether
you're looking to become an industry
expert or you're just passionate about a
hobby or whatever else
check out lynda.com/tekzilla slike tit
do the other thing if you want to check
out our other channels we've got a great
video over on channel super fun where we
like threw darts at pizza and ate
Marmite which is apparently something
people down in the southern hemisphere
actually like for whatever reason thanks
again for watching as always don't
forget to subscribe and follow and all
that good stuff and I will see you again
next time
cue the angry comments from Australians
and New Zealanders in the below the
