some video now you want to step your
game up you've kind of looked at the Tri
trusted and true DSLRs but what about
those fancy new mirrorless cameras well
right off the bat the biggest visual
clue when identifying a mirrorless
versus DSLR camera is the size
difference something important to keep
in mind if you care about portability
DSLR systems are a lot bigger because
they use the same design for the most
part as a traditional 35 millimeter film
camera that your parents might have used
there's a dedicated area inside the body
where a mirror reflects the light to the
viewfinder this mirror then flips up
when you press the shutter exposing the
image onto the sensor this setup is
considered robust by many because well
it's worked for a long time but it also
adds to the overall weight and size
comparatively mirrorless systems are
lighter smaller and in some ways more
versatile there's no need for a
dedicated space inside the body because
the system is inherently mirrorless in
this scenario the light passes through
the lens and right onto the sensor now
you might be thinking okay look if
there's no mirror then how does the
viewfinder work on a mirrorless system
the viewfinder is electronic and
displays the image directly from the
sensor compared to a traditional optical
viewfinder of a DSLR there are benefits
to this for instance more information
can be displayed such as visual tools to
help exposure focus and more which are
especially helpful for those that like
to shoot video but although electronic
viewfinders are improving rapidly
they're still not perfect and they're
susceptible to things like lag or
pixelation which is why many still
prefer seeing the real thing with the
optical viewfinder of a DSLR rather than
seeing a simulated image on the screen
of a mirrorless camera but outside the
viewfinders another important
consideration is lenses different lenses
provide many different types of
functionality almost to the point where
they're like apps for your phone kind of
if you want to look at it that way for
now history is on the side with DSLRs
there are a plethora of lenses available
to buy but mirrorless systems offer
incredibly little small and light lenses
which are further cut downs on bulk so
now we know the physical difference is
but who should be
buying what if you're into sports
photography then you should pay
particular interest to mirrorless
systems advancements in the field are
making these systems excellent for
continuous shooting as mirrorless
systems don't have well a mirror that
needs to constantly move up and down
making them operate more quickly
mirrorless systems are also catching up
to DSLRs with autofocus speed as they
used to be fairly notorious for being
slower
however DSLRs offer more for your money
on the lower end of the price spectrum
as they usually offer a more feature
complete camera which is not necessarily
the case for mirrorless systems
mirrorless cameras tend to be more
compact but miss out on features such as
a viewfinder leaving you to rely on the
screen on the back of the camera at the
lower price bracket but whatever you
want to go with camera tech is moving
incredibly fast and more advanced
features are trickling down into both
lower price ranges and smaller camera
bodies so maybe it will soon again make
sense to for more people to carry around
both a smartphone and a separate camera
around or they can just use like that
yellow Batman utility belt in the
meantime I don't know FreshBooks is on a
mission to make freelancers less
stressed and more organised through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
sending professional invoices in seconds
fresh books also helps you track your
hours so when it comes time to create
that invoice you know exactly what you
did when you did it and who you did it
for you can even accept deposits through
their platform so your work is paid for
on your schedule they also have a tool
to manage your expense reports their
mobile app lets you take a picture of
your receipt and pretty much just
handles the rest getting started on
fresh books is extremely simple even if
you're not a numbers person actually
especially if you're not a numbers
person you can try fresh books for free
for 30 days by going to fresh books calm
forward slash tech quickie and entering
tech quickie and how did you hear about
us section let's experiment a little bit
here instead of like new video if you
liked it and dislike in video if you
just liked it like the video if you're
still sticking with DSLRs dislike the
video if you're more into mirrorless
cameras
I might have to explain the Lynas why
the like to dislike on this video is
super screwed but do it anyways I'm
really interested in the results all
so another thing to do check out this
video which is probably covering my face
it's a mini drone little kind of video
thing I'll channel super fun that's
super well fun and you should check it
out get subscribed over there get
subscribed over here and then have a
wonderful freaking day man yeah
just enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
