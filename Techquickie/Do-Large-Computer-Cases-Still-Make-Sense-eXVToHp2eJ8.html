the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so the ATX
standard that's so common from other
boards came out all the way back in 1995
and while modern ones have become packed
with features our technology back then
was so primitive but not only did we
have to clap our hands to turn our
lights on and off but sound chips
networking drive controllers etc often
required separate adapter cards not only
that but drives don't need as much space
anymore both because single drives are
much higher capacity than they were 20
years ago
and because physically smaller SSDs have
taken off in popularity plus internal
optical drives are becoming rare on
desktop pcs thanks to digital
distribution of games movies music so
why is it still so easy to buy large mid
and full tower cases I mean who actually
needs these things well believe it or
not there are still a number of reasons
that you might want to consider an
impressively sized case with perhaps the
most obvious being that you're building
a powerful rig that needs more
components using your computer as a home
server such as an as for storing video
or as a big time editing workstation can
require multiple high capacity hard
drives especially if you're using a raid
array to backup your work or speed up
performance video footage tends to take
up lots of space and bulky hard drives
do hold more footage more cheaply than
smaller SSDs and more drives means you
might need more Drive headers to connect
them too which will mean a higher-end
motherboard with more of them built-in
or more likely an inexpensive add-in
card that has extra headers on it but
what if you're not video editing or
running a server well even though many
smaller cases can hold up to two
graphics cards no problem you might
still consider a bigger case if you
still need to add more adapter cards
such as a sound card a video capture
card PCI Express SSDs
that drive adapter I just mentioned or
legacy i/o cards that can add
older-style ports to a new system for
old devices you'd still like to use
scientific instruments are notorious for
this and even if none of this applies to
you you still may have components that
run hot and a larger case may be able to
help you cool things off
not only will larger cases give you more
room for both air and water cooling
accessories like pumps radiators and
fans they can provide more breathing
space for your components especially if
you're a tinkerer and you're into
overclocking your CPU or GPU on the
subject of cooling larger cases usually
offer more flexibility in terms of how
you configure them with some of them
allowing you to relocate components like
pumps or drive cages in a matter of
minutes with some even going as far as
to allow you to move the graphics card
to a flashy location next to the window
or even flip around the motherboard
itself but we'd be remiss if we didn't
talk about two of the most
straightforward reasons one large cases
give you more space to work in making
building and upgrading easier and to
aesthetics some people just like the
look of an imposing beefy case and
you'll get more room to trick it out
with RGB fans custom lighting or even
fancy designs etched onto the side panel
so while these behemoths of the battle
station world aren't for everyone there
are definitely some cases where bigger
is indeed better speaking of whatever I
was just talking about
check out private Internet access VPN
not only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once --is by hiding your true
IP address and allowing you to bypass
geo restrictions and censorship by
making you appear as though you're
connecting from somewhere else it also
blocks unwanted connections to help
prevent attacks it Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects keeping
your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other snoops who are
tracking your activity it prevents DNS
Li
and even includes mace P I is built-in
malware blocker P ia supports multiple
VPN protocols and encryption levels
allowing you to dial in the exact level
of protection that you need and they've
got apps for Windows Mac Android iOS
Linux and the Chrome extension with
support for more platforms coming soon
P ia has over 3,000 servers in 28
countries and does not log user activity
so what are you waiting for check them
out today at the link below so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video hit that button but if you liked
it hit like check out our other channels
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible and get
subscribed I promise I'll never make a
joke like that again I lied I will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
