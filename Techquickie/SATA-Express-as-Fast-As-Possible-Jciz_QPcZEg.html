of solid-state drives or SSDs you might
have noticed a trend over the last few
years
peak throughput the maximum speed that
you can read from or write to an SSD was
increasing by leaps and bounds
approaching 600 megabytes per second and
then poof it stopped now that's not
because SSDs can be faster but because
say two three six gigabit per second the
interface that they use to connect to
your PC tops out at around that speed
creating a bottleneck of course this
problem is nothing new history lesson
time serial ata or SATA was actually
introduced way back in 2003 to replace
parallel ata or peda
which you might remember as those bulky
flat gray cables that you saw inside
your parents old packard-bell
kata topped out at around 133 megabytes
per second which was fine for slow
mechanical hard drives and since SSDs
were virtually unknown in the consumer
PC space there wasn't much need for
anything faster for most users I mean
even the jump from pay to 100 to pay to
133 was considered superfluous at the
time with the first revision of SATA we
saw throughput modestly increased to 150
megabytes per second then it doubled to
300 megabytes per second on the second
Rev and doubled again to 600 megabytes
per second on the third to try to keep
up with user demand test and SSDs became
more ubiquitous and at this point you
may be asking okay Ben Linus why don't
they just double it again and give us
twelve hundred megabytes per second of
throughput with those little SATA cables
that are so good for case airflow well
one of the main hurdles is actually
power simply boosting the speed of the
SATA connection beyond six gigabit per
second takes a lot more juice so the
powers that be decided to go in a bit of
a different direction
enter SATA Express unlike previous SATA
revisions this isn't just a faster
version of the same fundamental
technology SATA Express is truly
different in that it really isn't its
own interface at all what's it Express
does is it connects your SSDs directly
to your computer's PCI Express Lanes PCI
Express is such an efficient and
FASS interface but even the previous
revision pcie 2.0 wouldn't bottleneck
the latest graphics cards in most
situations so it should be pretty easy
to imagine the performance gains you
could get by using PCIe to connect to
your storage devices modern
implementations of SATA Express can
achieve anywhere from one gigabyte per
second to four gigabytes per second and
can continue to scale in the future
there are some other cool things about
SATA Express - one is called MDOT -
which is okay not quite say it Express
but a closely related standard that
allows little tiny high performance SSDs
to be mounted on adding cards with MDOT
to slots and a second is called nvme or
non-volatile memory express this is a
new logical way to access storage that
is correctly optimized for high speed
solid-state devices it replaces ahci the
older driver that controls SATA drives
and was designed for magnetic drives
nvme was specifically made for PCI
Express based SSDs and will offer lower
latency and take better advantage of the
high degree of parallelization that is
possible with these sorts of devices
among other performance improvements
well Linus all this sounds just peachy
but how do I get my hands on SATA
Express the answer is that you can't yet
many motherboards with either an Intel
h97 or z97 chipset will have SATA
Express ports which are thankfully
backwards compatible with a couple of
SATA plugs to regular 6-game bit per
second drives but at this time there are
no SATA Express drives available to
general consumers to plug into them of
course if you're a real speed demon who
just can't wait remember that right now
you can pick up true PCI Express SSDs
that slot directly into the board or and
dot two SSDs that also utilize the PCI
Express bus as I mentioned before both
of these will be able to give you speeds
far beyond what you'd be able to get
with SATA 3 in theory although in
practice ah the difference might not be
that noticeable to most people speaking
of differences that are noticeable to
most people do you ever feel like it's
time to take your personal potential
beyond what most people think it is Wow
terrible segue
where is he going with this you might
ask he's going to talk about today's
