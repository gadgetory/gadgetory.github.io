in the future quite like the
proliferation of self-driving cars now
granted they're not exactly all over the
roads yet but given the huge investments
that automakers and tech companies are
making in them it seems like it's a
matter of when rather than if but how
exactly do they work I mean most of our
trains aren't even self-driving and
those things aren't quite literally on
Rails well as you'd expect self-driving
cars are jam-packed with tons of
equipment to help them both see and
understand their environment some of it
is rather familiar such as a data
connection for traffic info and a GPS
transponder to allow the car to know
where it is but while GPS is fine for
providing driving directions in a human
controlled car it has a margin of error
of up to several meters and besides to
control a car with such a slow and
error-prone system would result in more
than a few fender-benders so to start
with self-driving cars also use freaking
laser beams to build a map of what's
around them lidar which you can learn
more about up here can be built into
units that can spin 360 degrees shooting
invisible lasers in all directions then
measuring how long it takes for each
beam to hit an object and bounce back
this allows the car to judge not only
the distances but even the shapes of the
objects immediately around it giving the
car even more information is traditional
radar to help it gauge speed gyroscopes
and accelerometers to provide more
movement data than would be possible
with a traditional speedometer and high
resolution cameras now you might think
well we've already got frickin laser
beams what are the cameras for well
although the cars other systems give it
a pretty good idea of what's in the
general vicinity the cameras really help
provide a complete picture as they can
see in color this helps your car
distinguish let's say a caution sign
from a Construction sign so you put all
of this together and the car has a
coherent 3d map that provides the data
that it needs to make this
visions for example lidar and video can
determine whether that thing up ahead is
telling the car to stop or yield whether
the vehicle in front is a small sports
car or a large truck so that it can
decide whether to pass or whether that
two wheeled contraption is a motorcycle
or a bicycle so the car can get around
the cyclist and give her a bit more
space
also many self-driving cars have
ultrasonic sensors in the wheels so the
car will know how close it is to the
curb and other vehicles while parking
and even microphones so that they can
hear a police or EMS siren to get out of
the way in a timely manner
I mean that's gonna be one improvement
on the roads around here once
self-driving cars are ubiquitous people
can be so rude going to an emergency
anyway that's how all the data gets
collected but what about the processing
an experienced driver can take in
information from the environment filter
out everything that's not important and
make all the kinds of decisions we
talked about before in a fraction of a
second so of course then you need a lot
of computing power for a self-driving
car to pull off the same thing this is
made possible by running many processors
in parallel to crunch these numbers it's
actually quite similar to how desktop
GPUs work these types of processors also
happen to be more trainable with machine
learning so for example you can teach a
car what a pedestrian looks like by
showing it a large data set with lots of
photos of people crossing the road
but what if a self-driving car didn't
only have to rely on its own sensors and
processors well another goal is to have
these cars communicate with each other
while they're on the road so they can
actually tell other cars what they're
doing and why enhancing safety and
taking some of the guesswork away from
the individual vehicles and if you think
about it having many cars working
together like this in unison could help
with lots of other issues - like easing
congestion by coordinating movement so
that traffic can keep flowing smoothly
also in the future especially wants
faster 5g connections become more common
we could even see smart infrastructure
that communicates with the
I mean think about a parking garage that
could tell a car that it's too full to
accommodate it or transponders in
construction zones that could tell them
to slow down and prepare for narrower
lanes of course we do still have a long
way to go before this kind of tech is
commonplace but given how many semi
autonomous cars are available for
purchase today and how much money is
being poured into this whole endeavor
along with the ever-rising processing
and data speeds we continue to enjoy the
hope is that in the near future our car
trips will be much easier and safer
since well over 90 percent of car
accidents are attributable to human
error and speaking of self-driving cars
today's episode was brought to you by
IBM spectrum storage did you know that a
self-driving car can generate up to 15
terabytes of data every hour and lots of
this is actually not even used while
they're driving so it's really common in
the AI industry to have to ingest just
tons of this raw data and transform it
after the fact while the car's not even
driving into intelligence and IBM is
using spectrum storage to help
automakers manage all this data so it's
optimized for AI and machine learning
with industry-leading GPU accelerated
servers and IBM spectrum scales
software-defined storage combined with
groundbreaking performance and
simplified deployment so get the fast
lane to insights into whatever field
you're in by learning more about data
storage for AI and IBM storage solutions
