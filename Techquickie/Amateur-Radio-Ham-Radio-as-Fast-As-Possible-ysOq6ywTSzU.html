truckers use to spot bears on their six
not quite most truckers actually use
citizens band or CB radio an unlicensed
set of channels set aside for use by the
general public
amateur radio also known as ham radio is
a non-commercial but licensed radio
service which uses allocated frequencies
that aren't being used by things like AM
and FM to allow radio enthusiasts to
provide emergency communications improve
their technical skills and enhance
international goodwill by having
discussions across country borders about
national snack foods or whatever the
case may be now you may be wondering
then why is amateur radio still relevant
when I can just go on my computer and
talk or play games with my friend across
the border like that well believe it or
not even in 2016 there are over 700,000
licensed ham radio operators in the
United States over 1.2 million in Japan
and an estimated combined 3 million
worldwide
and part of the reason they're still a
vibrant amateur radio community is due
to its simplicity compared to things
like the internet ham radio relies on no
pre-established communication grids and
a simple radio can be made out of spare
electronic parts in a pinch
not to mention that ham radio can be
quite reliable compared to some more
modern forms of communication in times
of crisis for example during the 9/11
attack on the World Trade Center cell
phone service was overloaded and utterly
crippled so amateur radio operators
helped victims contact their families
and provided communications for
emergency personnel participating in
search and rescue operations and while
emergency communications is normally
cited as a primary reason for amateur
radio it's not by any means the only
aspect of the hobby there are radio
sport contests where operators try to
contact as many people as possible
during a certain period of time some
operators enjoy making a game out of
making contacts which they'll use to get
different
Ward's such as you know worked all US
states or worked all continents and if
you operate on the high frequency
spectrum in combination with a computer
you can actually send the digital
signals including data packets amateur
radio has even found uses well above the
earth as astronauts aboard the
International Space Station
our ham radio operators and occasionally
use it to make contact or send pictures
other operators have moon bounce or eme
and meteor scatter setups where they
bounce signals off the moon and meteors
to make contacts around the world
repurposing space rocks as satellites
cool right I mean not to everyone but to
some people for sure but whether you're
sending signals into outer space or just
talking to someone down the street the
point is there's a great deal of
flexibility and fun in the ham radio
hobby and it can be I mean like anything
it can get expensive but it can be done
quite affordably many operators are
running DIY setups consisting of arduino
z' raspberry PI's and other
microcontrollers these can be utilized
to build gps trackers which are placed
in their cars or even high-altitude
balloons to transmit their location
through amateur radio you can even rig
up a ham to extend the range of a drone
if you find that your Wi-Fi connection
just isn't powerful enough so if any of
this sounds intriguing and you're
already sitting there coming up with
ways you would use an amateur radio
license getting a license is actually
relatively easy depending on which
country you live in so being in charge
of your own little radio station sounds
appealing check it out just make sure
that you do have your license first as
you don't want a dark suited g-man at
your door because you are making you
know pirate radio broadcasts about how
much your ISP is ripping you off
speaking of ISPs don't you hate it when
your ISP is snooping on what you're
doing on the Internet well tunnel Bayer
VPN lets you encrypt your connection and
while you're at it
tunnel your connection in one of 20
different countries allowing you to keep
the internet sites that you visit and
the online services that you use private
from your internet provider as well as
the aforementioned
websites and services they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they've also got a Chrome extension
and all you got to do with no dns
settings or port tomfoolery is click on
the button to turn it on select
whichever country you prefer to appear
as though you're coming from and boom
your connections encrypted your public
IP is switched and you are ready to
freakin go and the best thing about
tunnel bearers you do not have to take
my word for it all you got to do is head
to the link in the video description
that's tunnel bear comm slash Linus and
try it they'll give you 500 Meg's of
free data for nothing no credit card
required and if you want to upgrade to
unlimited data you can save 10% by again
going to tunnel bear comm slash Linus oh
and they have a great privacy policy as
well which you can check out on their
site when you're over there
so thanks for watching guys if you liked
the video like it if you just like to
dislike if you want to check out other
channels boom if you want to comment
with video suggestions for future fast
as possible down there and don't forget
to subscribe so you don't miss any fast
as possible just like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
