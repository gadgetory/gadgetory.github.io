went from distributing software on paper
tape to becoming the dominant force in
the consumer software industry up
through their launch of Windows XP in
2001 Windows XP was incredibly
successful in spite of Microsoft's
introduction of the unpopular product
activation feature designed to stop
piracy it was installed on an estimated
85% of desktop computers at one point
though another estimate put the
proportion of illegitimate installations
as 35% poor bill not that the European
Union had much sympathy for Microsoft
when it slaps the company with a half
billion euro fine in 2004 citing abuse
of its dominance with proprietary code
Microsoft was also forced to ship
Windows XP without media player for the
European market
sound familiar not to be deterred though
by royally teasing off regulators on at
least two continents by this point
Microsoft pushed forward with new
products like Zune and Windows Vista
both of which flopped harder than the
Star Wars Holiday Special
zoom was a portable music player and by
most accounts a really cool one too bad
that by the time Zune was released in
late 2006 iPod had already become
synonymous with taking your music with
you
Windows Vista that same year was in a
way the other side of the same coin in
the sense that it was released with a
lot of fanfare but was quickly penned by
veteran tech reviewers and novice
computer users alike although it looked
modern with appealing features like the
Aero theme and desktop widgets at launch
it lacked driver support it was unstable
it required more processing power than
mere mortals could afford and it
incorporated some extremely unpopular
DRM
technology's forcing Microsoft to offer
Vista license owners the option to
downgrade back to Windows XP oops the
mid-2000s weren't a total disaster for
Microsoft though the Xbox 360 released
in late 2005 went on to become a true
juggernaut in the world of console
gaming with its comfortable
intuitive controller that remains
popular to this day a well implemented
online experience through Xbox Live a
large game library and solid performance
at a lower cost than Sony's PlayStation
3 the Xbox 360 even outsold the ps3
despite Sony's greater experience in the
console market later in 2009 Microsoft
finally released a worthy successor to
the then 8-year old Windows XP - simply
named Windows 7 which retained the
visual appeal of Windows Vista but
featured vast improvements to
performance and stability as well as
modern features like better support for
multi-core CPUs and the ability to snap
windows to the sides of the screen
in fact in spite of Microsoft's free
upgrade offer to Windows 10 Windows 7 is
still the most used version of Windows
as of January 2017 but with smartphones
especially the iPhone from rival Apple
Computer exploding in popularity around
this time Microsoft knew it couldn't
focus primarily on the traditional PC
space forever and rolled out Windows
Phone 7 in 2010 with subsequent mobile
versions of Windows in the following
years
unfortunately for Microsoft Windows
Phone having been beaten to the punch by
ios and android more or less went the
same way as the Zune so app developers
didn't bother supporting Windows Phone
completing Microsoft's failure boogaloo
more successful though not entirely
without controversy was Windows 8 in
2012 which Microsoft
designed to function on traditional
desktops and laptops but also tablet PCs
with an interface designed to be more
modern and cool with terminology like
live tiles
unfortunately this concept did not
translate well to the millions of people
who still use mice and keyboards and
Windows 8 struggled to gain popularity I
mean you can't just take away the start
button and expect everybody to be ok
with that
maybe that's why Windows 8.1 was a free
upgrade Microsoft's Hardware designed
for Windows they did a little better
though and I'm not talking about the arm
powered Surface RT that bond but about
the full fat surface tablets which were
also introduced in 2012 since they ran
full versions of Windows versus the more
limited mobile OS azan competing tablets
like the iPad Microsoft started to gain
traction in the mobile computing scene
in spite of NFL announcers calling them
iPads as they watched coaches drop plays
on the sidelines it was also in 2012
that Microsoft started signing people up
for Microsoft accounts enabling a single
sign-in across devices as part of its
push to get users into the Microsoft
ecosystem that included services like
office 365 its subscription-based verse
of the beloved productivity suite
onedrive cloud storage and Skype which
it had purchased in 2011 indeed
Microsoft made seamlessness between its
own services a priority with the launch
of the Windows Store alongside Windows 8
as well as with the Xbox one in 2013
which was hyped as a do-it-all living
room box with enhanced connectivity with
Windows rather than just another game
console the concept was taken even
further in 2015 with the new Windows 10
featuring tight integration with the
Cortana voice assistant Microsoft's
answer to Siri and compatibility with
the universal Windows platform which
allows certain
to run on both desktop and mobile
windows as well as the Xbox one and
hololens a smart glasses product that
Microsoft is currently trying to get off
the ground of course with its fingers in
so many different parts of the tech
industry Microsoft is facing a lot more
competition than it did 10 or 15 years
ago but could this mean that they'll be
more consistent about producing quality
products in the future with their feet
to the fire
maybe so but Bing isn't the most
compelling argument for that hypothesis
tunnel Bayer VPN lets you tunnel through
up to 20 different countries well one at
a time
allowing you to browse the internet and
use online services as though you are
doing it from a different country
they've got easy-to-use apps for iOS and
Rho I don't have an Android phone in my
pocket okay well Android PC and Mac may
also have a Chrome extension just choose
a country in the app turn it on in boom
your connection gets encrypted and you
appear to the websites and services that
you're using as though you are someone
else from somewhere else it takes all
the hassle out of it and you don't have
to take my word for its ease of use you
can try it for nothing go check it out
at tunnel there calm down at the link in
the video description and if you decide
you like it you can save 10% on an
unlimited data plan by going to tunnel
