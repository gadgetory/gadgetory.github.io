your gaming setup and you don't know how
this episode of fast as possible seeks
to show you what you need to run triple
monitors on either a Radeon graphics
card or a GeForce graphics card for
Radeon cards the requirements are pretty
simple you have to have a 5000 series
card and you have to have three monitors
that are all running the same resolution
and refresh rate in order to span the
displays across multiple monitors the
last thing you'll also need is an active
adapter so most monitors these days
don't support DisplayPort natively but
the cards can only output two DVI or
HDMI signals at a time so you'll need to
pick yourself up an active DisplayPort
or mini DisplayPort to HDMI or DVI
adapter to make sure that the card will
be able to output all three displays in
videos requirements are a little bit
more complicated the minimum card
requirement is a GTX 260 however if
you're running surround off of the 260
you'll need to have two of them because
the 260 doesn't have any DisplayPort
outputs alright guys so the first cards
that can output single card Nvidia
surround are 600 series cards and you
need to make sure they have at least one
DisplayPort output because just like the
AMD cards they can only do 2 from DVI or
HDMI in a surround configuration Nvidia
also requires you to have three
identical monitors in order for surround
to run flawlessly but the cool thing
about Nvidia is that if you run three
surround 3d monitors you can actually
gain in stereoscopic 3d with your
surround set up because the Nvidia
configuration rules are a little bit
trickier they do have a config tool on
their website that you can check out to
find out if your system is compatible
with NVIDIA surround once you've got
your latest drivers installed and you
enable surround enly a driver remember
with AMD it's called eyefinity and with
nvidia it's called invidious around it's
just a matter of what your default
options are AMD by default sets up your
desktop to be one large display so if
you were to say for example maximize a
program it would automatically fill your
entire three screens you can manually
configure smaller virtual desktops
inside of your full-size desktop though
if you don't want say for example
Paige to have a little Google link in
the middle and then a bunch of weight
space on the side nvidia by default sets
up three virtual displays within your
entire multi-monitor setup so it's just
a little bit different in terms of how
they're configured in games though for
either solution you want to make sure
that you're setting it to your maximum
resolution whether that's fifty seven
sixty by 1080 or whatever other
resolution your monitors are running at
times three as always guys don't forget
to subscribe to tech quickie don't
forget to like the video and share it
