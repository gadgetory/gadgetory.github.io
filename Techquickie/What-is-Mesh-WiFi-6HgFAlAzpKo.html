the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos we've all
been there you get a fancy-looking
wireless router that promises
lightning-fast speeds and ridiculous
range only to find that you can't even
load a gift in your upstairs bedroom
heck maybe you're experiencing this
right now and I look blockier then the
questionable content you used to watch
on your parents 56k modem and with our
increasing reliance on mobile devices
these days like tablets and smart phones
and laptops solutions for extending the
range of your Wi-Fi have become more
popular than ever
including mesh networks and I'm not
talking about meetups of fishnet donning
fetishists you know I'm talking about a
Wi-Fi setup that uses multiple nodes
that can spread a Wi-Fi signal all of
your home office or pillow fort as it
were on the surface the way it operates
seems pretty simple just connect one of
the hockey puck looking nodes to your
modem and place the others around your
house or you need a signal boost each
node connects to the others in an
attempt to give you a stronger wireless
signal over a much larger area than
you'd get with a single router well hold
on a second James I have a cheap range
extender for my wireless networks then
it sounds like it does the same thing
what's the difference so here's the deal
bro Chacho garden-variety Wi-Fi
extenders or repeaters are notorious for
degrading the network speed because
their antennas have to communicate with
both client devices like your phone and
laptop as well as your main router your
effective speed can be reduced as much
as 50% while using one which is bunk
by contrast nodes in a mesh network are
typically engineered with separate
antennas so they can talk not just with
the main router but to each other
this helps them handle network backhaul
backhaul is all the traffic other than
what's being transmitted to and from the
iPhone in your hand although this isn't
a perfect system and mesh networks can
still slow down if you add lots of nodes
they do tend to be much quicker than
simple range extenders but hold on again
these days you can get fancy network
extenders with multiple antennas and
even models that support mu-mimo which
lets the extender
send and receive from multiple devices
simultaneously which you can learn about
right here so are there still benefits
to going with a mesh network instead as
it turns out yes there are you see what
an extender does is create a whole new
Wi-Fi network instead of being a true
extension of the one created by your
router this puts you into one of two
less than ideal situations one if your
extender uses a different network name
or SSID you have to manually switch to
it when you want to use it or two if
your extender shares the SSID with your
main network most devices aren't smart
enough to automatically switch to
whichever one is giving off the stronger
signals leading to frustration when you
walk between your router and the
extender mesh Wi-Fi on the other hand
uses one single glorious network that's
intelligently managed by whichever node
serves as your primary router making it
a seamless experience as you move around
your house
additionally mesh networks can adjust
automatically if you add or remove nodes
and quickly reroute the network traffic
between them to account for the new node
configuration and mesh networks also
come with creature comforts that are
harder to find on traditional wireless
routers everything from easy network
management with a mobile app to
integrated support for smart home
devices making them attractive to folks
who want a set it and forget it
experience however they do tend to be
pricier than extenders so make sure that
a mesh network isn't overkill for your
home you probably don't need one if
you're living in Tokyo and the only
thing you can afford is a studio
apartment the size of a sardine can
speaking of affordable private Internet
access not only does P ia work on up to
five devices at once by hiding your true
IP address and allowing you to bypass
your restrictions and censorship by
making you appear that you're connecting
from somewhere else it also blocks
unwanted connections to help you prevent
attacks Auto blocks all traffic if the
VPN disconnects keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and other
snoops who are trying to track your
activity prevents DNS leaks and even
includes MERS P is built-in malware
blocker PIAA supports multi
VPN protocols and encryption levels
allowing you to dial into the exact
level of protection that you need they
have apps for Windows Mac Android iOS
Linux and a Chrome extension with
support for more platforms coming soon
and P ia has over 3,000 servers in 28
countries and does not log user activity
