notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos remember
when we were all flinging songs back and
forth across a Napster and LimeWire and
getting cease and desist letters from
some suit at a record label or
alternatively trying to figure out how
many 99-cent songs we could fit into our
monthly budget and our 4 gig iPod well
much of that changed when Spotify
started offering free internet music
streaming in 2009 trying to appeal to
those who wanted a legal way to listen
to their favorite artists without
spending buckets of money on DRM
protected tracts and appeal they did
less than ten years later Spotify now
has 170 million active users and a
library of 35 million songs thanks to
licensing deals with three of the
biggest rights holders in the music
industry Sony Warner and Universal and
also Merlin a key agency that represents
a large number of smaller more
independent artists I mean to say things
have gone well would be an
understatement
they're even listed on the New York
freaking Stock Exchange and that's a big
deal but how exactly do they survive by
taking something that costs money music
and giving it away for free ok yes yes
the obvious answer is advertising hence
the guy shouting about the sales event
at the local car lot when you're just
trying to chill out to something mellow
but they've also featured a premium
subscription option since 2008
that offers offline listening the
ability to choose a specific song on
mobile and an ad-free experience similar
to Netflix is video streaming service
which launched the year before but
unlike Netflix Spotify isn't yet
profitable although it is making enough
to stay afloat ok but how does that work
well Spotify brings in significant
revenue from both advertising and
premium subscriptions but they also
spend a great deal on licensing songs
people actually want to hear around 10
billion dollars so far something that's
actually been a source of some
controversy you see even with these huge
sums of overall royalty fees the amount
of money that goes to the record label
per playback can seem insultingly small
with many rights holders only making
around three-quarters of a cent each
time someone listens to one of their
tracks leaving only some portion of that
for the actual artist you can't even say
they're making pennies per play in 2014
the situation escalated to the point
that Taylor Swift very publicly removed
all of her songs from Spotify though in
fairness to them at tea Swift's level of
Fame a solidly performing album could
net five or even six figures per month
so we don't blame you for not feeling
too bad for her and Radiohead
I mean I'll feel bad for Radiohead
they're artists of course
Spotify popularity isn't only due to its
vast song catalogue it used to rely on
its own servers and peer-to-peer
connections for content delivery but now
much of Spotify chopper ations are
handled through Google cloud similar to
how Netflix uses Amazon Web Services
instead of its own servers to process
user requests and recommendations which
you can learn more about appear
leveraging a large redundant cloud
service as well as storing its files in
OGG Vorbis which is not a malicious
alien race but a compressed format that
takes up less space than mp3 while
maintaining quality has given Spotify
reputation for being a fast reliable
streaming application at least so far
until they can figure out how to turn a
profit their future will always be in
question
but for now investors see enough
potential to continue to fund them maybe
the plan is to pull a page out of
Netflix's book and launch their own
record label cutting out the middleman
so both Spotify and artists could make
more money hopefully they'll do this by
the time tech wikis debut album bite me
