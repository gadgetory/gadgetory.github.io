not going to get all angsty and explain
why I think the Jedi are evil
it's the third episode of common PC
building traps you should be looking out
for whether you're a Padawan preparing
for your first build or you spend
weekends with your family bragging about
all these fully armed and operational
battle stations you've put together
let's start with something that you
should watch out for before you even
begin physically assembling the computer
balancing your build this means you want
to be sure that you're choosing
components that will work with each
other as a coordinated sensible whole or
computer for example if you've decided
to go with something like a low-end
pentium cpu don't pair it with a $600
graphics card as your underpowered
processor will likely be a bottleneck in
games not allowing your graphics card to
operate at peak performance not what you
want
after spending all that money in a
similar vein doing things like buying a
1200 watt power supply for a single
video card set up for buying 64 gigs of
ram for watching youtube videos not good
ideas so think about what you want to do
with your system and whether the parts
you're buying makes sense for each other
before pulling the trigger then after
you've picked a logical set of
components and you're putting it all
together don't forget to manage your
cables that's right you should do this
even if you're using a case that doesn't
have a side panel window as the benefits
aren't purely aesthetic proper cable
routing cannot only save you a lot of
headaches whenever you have to open up
your system to make an upgrade or repair
they can prevent your components from
being choked up with dust as poorly
managed cables that cross every which
way inside your case tend to be dust
magnets and can eventually restrict air
flow and you don't have to do some sort
of world-class cable management job to
reap the benefits
just use the routing holes in your case
plus a few zip ties for a massive
improvement versus having a cable jungle
like some kind of barbarian and while
we're on the subject of cables when you
finish your build and are getting ready
to plug in your monitor for the love of
all that is good don't plug it into your
motherboard if you're rocking a discreet
graphics card
although software solutions that allows
you to plug your monitor into either one
and still reap the performance benefits
all of your GPU once appeared as though
they had a bright future these days a
connection to your motherboard will
completely bypass your graphics card
leaving you wondering why you're getting
five frames per second in a game where
you were expecting to get 500 moving
right along with the plugging things in
theme don't assume that all the RAM
slots on your motherboard are the same
if you've got multiple six of RAM but
not enough to fill every slot maybe
you've got two sticks and a four slot
board check your motherboard manual and
follow the manufacturers recommended
configuration typically this means using
every other slot not following the
instructions could result in your RAM
not running in a faster multi-channel
mode and while memory speed doesn't have
a massive impact on performance except
in very specific applications these days
there also isn't a good reason to miss
out on a small boost that properly
inserted RAM can give you so you've got
everything plugged in properly and
you've been using your computer for a
short while but something seems amiss
you find out that a BIOS update from
your motherboard manufacturer might be
the cure for your ills however you need
to be very careful when flashing your
UEFI BIOS if something goes wrong during
the process like a power outage you
could end up irreversibly bricking your
motherboard so it's a good idea
especially if you haven't invested in a
motherboard with a dual BIOS
or a BIOS flashback feature that lets
you reflash it even if it is somewhat
bricked it's a good idea to be plugged
into a battery backup or a UPS while you
are doing it I mean and at the very
least don't do it during a thunderstorm
you don't want to be out the two hundred
bucks you spent on your board just
because mother nature decided to have a
little tempest tantrum so hopefully this
series has helped you in your quest to
have a mistake-free building experience
but what are some of your go-to tips for
PC assembly let us know in the comments
and maybe you'll see your ideas in
episode 4 will give you frustrated
Builders out there some new hope
tired of companies tracking what you're
doing on the Internet tunnel bear VPN is
the simple to use VPN that does the same
things as VPNs that are more difficult
to use so how could you go wrong
basically Tunnel bear is a quick
download it's available for iOS Android
PC and Mac they even have a Chrome
extension that lets you just press a
button boom
I want to tunnel through this country
and there you go your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
so you can show up as though you're in a
different country to the online services
and websites that you use they have a
great privacy policy and it is free with
no credit card required to try with 500
Meg's of data so you don't have to take
my word for it at all check it out at
tunnel bear comm slash Linus and at that
link when you sign up for an unlimited
data plan you can save 10% woo
