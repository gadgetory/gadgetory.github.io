storage can fill up these days between
space hogging video games and large
photo or video libraries and although
one popular solution is to just upload
extra data to cloud storage these
services have a monthly fee and you're
at the mercy of a potentially slow
internet connection meaning that
investing in dedicated external storage
for your computer can be a great
alternative
so Sabourin sponsored this video to talk
about some of the options you see while
external storage can comprise anything
from a simple USB stick to an army of
storage servers that takes up a whole
closet the fastest consumer-grade option
currently is going to be an external
drive or an enclosure which lets you
connect an internal drive like an MDOT
to SSD via an external port one that
supports nvme now you can learn more
about it up here but simply put nvme is
a storage protocol specifically designed
with solid-state drives in mind meaning
that it enables really fast speeds like
much faster than what you would get with
the older SATA protocol that was mostly
designed with mechanical hard drives in
mind however there's more to pay
attention to besides whether that
external SSD that you've been eyeballing
uses nvme you'll also want to figure out
what interface it uses and if you're
buying a high-speed nvme external SSD or
enclosure you'll probably want either
USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 so what's the
difference well USB 3.1 is the more
widely supported standard of the two
that can handle maximum data rates of
either five gigabits per second for Gen
1 or 10 gigabits per second for Gen 2
Thunderbolt 3 on the other hand supports
up to 40 gigabits per second that means
that it's fast enough to not bottleneck
even the fastest PCI Express SSDs on the
market and because Thunderbolt 3
connects to your computer's PCI Express
bus the performance penalty that you
would usually have to deal with for
external drives will be less than with
USB since USB drives have to run
the data through a slower controller
however Thunderbolt 3 has a downside or
two for one thing
fewer computers have support for it and
for another these SSDs also tend to be
significantly more expensive than their
USB based counterparts so then which one
should you get well either USB 3.1 gen2
or Thunderbolt 3 is gonna give you
speeds beyond a standard SATA connection
when paired with an nvme drive and
although Thunderbolt 3 is obviously
faster on paper in the real world you
might not notice the difference too much
unless all you do is use your drive for
moving around lots of large files what
you want to make sure that you aren't
getting is a USB 3.1 gen2 vise which
will not be as fast as a standard SATA
connection and you should definitely
triple check that it doesn't connect via
USB 2 it's cheaper but it's much lower
than any of the standards that we
mentioned and really only suitable for
entry-level thumb drives that you just
use to store your exciting PowerPoint
presentations another thing here is
don't assume that just because the drive
or enclosure uses the new USB type-c
standard that it uses 10 gig USB 3.1 or
Thunderbolt 3 USB C is great it's super
useful especially since you can insert
it either way to avoid a lot of
frustration but it's just a connector
and it can actually be used with slower
data transmission standards so just take
a quick moment to read the spec sheet
instead of just glancing at the dongle a
bit and assuming it'll be ok other than
that drives are enclosures with a metal
body can help to dissipate some heat
that can be useful but again as long as
you're picking a product with support
for 10 gigabit or greater you're not
going to be losing much performance
compared to an internal drive unless
you're the kind of person who just
really likes sitting around and
measuring your file transfers down to
the millisecond I don't know anyone like
that with that said if you do like
running benchmarks or using your SSD for
actual file storage look no further than
our sponsor for today's episode
who has a great lineup of external SSDs
to fit any need you can check out their
rocket Pro which features not only a
sleek aluminum body but also a
lightning-quick nvme SSD inside and USB
3.1 gen2 for great compatibility or for
the ultimate in performance check out
their rocket xt RM which utilizes a
Thunderbolt 3 connection for the fastest
possible data speeds making it an ideal
partner for video editing or other
bandwidth heavy tasks it even comes with
a bumper guard to keep your data
protected on the go so learn more about
Sabourin at the links in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
like just like check out our other
videos and don't forget to leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible we really need
them because at the end of the video I'm
supposed to do this shoutout for people
subscribing and following and hitting
the bell so they don't miss our videos
but how will we make more videos if we
don't know what to make them about we
need you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
