before is the dark heart forcing your
electronics to perform better than the
manufacturer intended your computer CPU
tablet phone and any other modern
computing devices you might own have
processors inside them that all have
something in common their performance is
dictated by the design or architecture
and the number of cycles that they can
perform per second which is usually
represented as frequency or clock speed
so that is where the term overclocking
comes from you're taking the clock speed
and turning it up over the manufacturers
recommendation to get more performance
now as I said before clock speed is not
the only factor so it's not like you can
overclock a calculator to perform as
well as a gaming PC with that said you
can make the calculator faster relative
to its original state so how do you do
it
well first you have to decide if you
actually want to overclocking often
requires other aspects of your device to
be run outside of specifications what
will happen is your device will become
unstable as you turn up the speed you
can compensate by turning up voltage but
that can cause additional power
consumption and more heat output
seasoned overclockers will have
experience with anything from large heat
sinks with fans for cooling to liquid
cooling or even more exotic sub-zero
cooling if they're trying to get maximum
performance more voltage also increases
the risk of failure so for this reason
many manufacturers will actually refused
outright to provide warranty service on
overclocked electronics still want to do
it you're not alone lots of people are
willing to make these trade-offs that I
just mentioned for more performance
there are comprehensive guides that
exist for overclocking pretty much any
device that would benefit from it many
Android phones can be overclocked with a
simple app download and PC overclocking
is a very popular pastime with gamers
video editors or anyone else who needs
more performance from his or her
computer you can check out the link in
the video description for my most recent
PC overclocking guide you can also check
out audible.com slash tech wiki for a
free audio book audible.com has over a
hundred and fifty thousand audiobooks
available and while you won't need an
overclocked phone to listen to them in
the car while you're on the way to work
it certainly couldn't hurt all you have
to do is sign up for an
new account and the first one is free I
tried finding an audio book about
overclocking but instead it came up with
the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
which if you haven't already read it is
awesome
so that's audible.com slash tech quickie
