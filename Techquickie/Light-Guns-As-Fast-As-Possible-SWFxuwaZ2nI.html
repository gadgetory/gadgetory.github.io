video games out there but throughout the
history of gaming a huge part of the
appeal of games has been the fact that
many of them allow us to pretend to
shoot at things and although we do most
of our shooting these days with a
gamepad or a mouse and keyboard a lot of
you might remember the days when we had
actual replica guns to fire at the
screen I'm talking of course about light
guns those things that you could use
with your NES to play duck hunt and just
shoot that stupid dog over and over
again because he keeps laughing at you
but even though light guns are a rarity
these days they were a little ahead of
their time back in the mid 1980s
considering that the concept of
controlling your video games by pointing
something at the screen didn't really
take off again until Nintendo introduced
the Wii in 2006 however the light gun
actually has a history that goes way
back before home video games in fact all
the way back to 1936 with a contraption
called the Seberg ray o light that
appeared as a wooden cabinet containing
you guessed it a mechanical duck with a
tube attached to it that could sense
light a rifle that came with it fired a
light beam that would make the duck fall
mechanical light gun games like these
eventually gave way to arcade games that
used a light gun that worked with CRT
monitors which found their way into the
home as accessories for consoles like
the Ness and Sega Master System so when
you pointed your nest zapper or Sega
light phaser at the screen and fired at
a criminal a waterfowl or whatever the
case may be the screen would very
briefly go blank then redraw only the
targets as white blocks the light gun
could then detect whether it was pointed
at one of the white areas and that if so
the game registered a hit later light
guns like the Nintendo Super scope which
looked like something you might use to
invade a small
country defended by a clone army of
Marcus Fenix allowed for greater
precision by detecting the change in
brightness at a certain point on the
screen once it was refreshed to figure
out where the gun was pointed but hold
on a second the way that light guns work
sounds pretty straightforward so why
have they gone out of style oh well
sometimes as technology moves forward
stuff gets relegated to history's
dustbin simply because it was designed
to work with something else older which
is exactly what happened to our beloved
light guns you see old CRT screens had
much lower display lag than modern LCDs
when LCDs started to dominate the market
they offered crisp images and low power
consumption not to mention being lighter
and thinner but they've never been as
quick as two monitors due to fundamental
differences in how they work light guns
don't work with modern screens because
their display leg is just too high so
they can't draw those white targets or
change the brightness quickly enough for
the gun to register it and even though
the light gun is considered a retro
piece of tech the quick response that
you could get from a light gun paired
with a CRT actually hasn't been matched
by modern solutions like the Wii Remote
which tend to have a much higher very
perceptible latency when you're pointing
them around but of course if you can't
still play games with them you can at
least use your light guns as accessories
for your next Halloween costume just

security with one speaking of airport
