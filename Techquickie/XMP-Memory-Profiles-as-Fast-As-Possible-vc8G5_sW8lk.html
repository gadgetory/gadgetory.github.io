there's all these turn seal 10 13 33
megahertz 1.65 volts all that stuff just
needs to go away because we're going to
tell you how XMP makes your life a lot
easier if you're using an Intel platform
now you can buy the highest performance
memory in the world but by default
motherboards will set it to a safe
setting a safe profile that is
guaranteed to boot by default this is to
ensure that you get an opportunity to go
into the motherboard BIOS and
reconfigure things manually if you need
to because if it just doesn't turn on at
all then it's no good to anyone however
once you're in there if you want to set
it to run at its proper speeds at the
rated speeds you can either dial
everything in manually the way we used
to or you can just set up an XMP profile
most high-performance memory comes with
at least one XMP profile sometimes two
and as long as your motherboard supports
XMP which most of the performance grade
Intel motherboards do then it's as
simple as dialing it in and all those
settings are done for you within the
UEFI of your motherboard or the BIOS
it's usually very simple to find the XMP
settings but if you're not sure you can
always consult your manual so it might
be called extreme memory profile or XMP
or memory profile and then you'll be
able to scroll through something that
will say auto air or and then like
profile 1 and profile 2 it'll actually
give you a preview of what it's going to
run at before you press f10 to commit
the changes and reboot the computer but
the one thing to note about XMP is that
if you fully populate all of the module
slots on your motherboard your XMP
profiles might not be fine-tuned for
that unless you buy a multi dim kit so
on this motherboard for example if you
bought 2 2 sticked kits and run it in
XMP it might not work whereas if we
bought one for stick kit it would be
guaranteed to work as always guys don't
