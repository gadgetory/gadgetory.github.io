hour and seen an incredibly expensive
supercar wondering to yourself what is
the point of buying a high-performance
six-figure vehicle if you can only go a
few miles an hour during the evening
commute well that actually tends to
happen a lot here in Vancouver but no
matter where you live this is probably
how you feel if you've ever had a fast
internet connection yet your favorite
website still often takes a long time to
load so in this age of gigabit fiber
service 4k video streaming and massively
multiplayer online games why are we
still so often waiting around for pages
that might only consist of text and
images to hit our screens well
ultimately most issues that cause pages
to load slowly can be classified as some
form of latency a concept we've talked
about quite a few times here on tech
wiki
simply put latency is the delay between
an input and the corresponding action
something you've probably noticed if
you've ever tried to watch a video with
an out of sync Bluetooth speaker but
when it comes to loading websites
latency is often caused by something
either server-side or on your own end
that needs to be handled independently
of your hundred megabit internet
connection thus creating a bottleneck
you might not be able to avoid no matter
how fast your connection is one frequent
culprit is a page that relies heavily on
scripts such as JavaScript that require
additional processing by your device you
see with a reasonably fast connection it
doesn't take long for a browser to
understand the command to load up some
text or images and place them in the
appropriate spots on your screen however
webpage scripts are almost like little
programs that your computer has to run
in addition to loading the page actual
content meaning additional time is often
required to process them scripts are
responsible for handling certain
interactive elements of webpages but
perhaps unsurprisingly many of them are
put there for advertising purposes add
scripts both fetch ads to place on
webpages and send information back to ad
servers to keep track of analytics and
user browsing habits so a marketer
tracking the embarrassing music that you
might like to listen to could be behind
your favorite site loading slowly or
respond
slowly when you try to click on
something but even if you're loading up
a site that's mostly free of big clunky
scripts a page can still be written
poorly asking the browser to make tons
of requests for different elements like
scripts and images aside from the
intricacies of how web pages are written
another frequent source of frustration
is ping the time it takes for a packet
to leave your computer reach the server
and the response to be returned to you
packets used to measure ping time are
doesn't bite so ping time really is not
dependent on how many megabits per
second your ISP is offering it's better
to think of high ping time as another
form of latency that's usually caused by
a server being very far away because
even though the electrical impulses that
carry information over the internet
travel at incredibly fast speeds they
still take time to reach servers and if
you're sitting in Los Angeles trying to
access a server in London that amount of
time is going to be noticeable any ping
above about a hundred milliseconds will
probably cause web browsing to feel at
least a little bit slower thanks to the
additional delay caused by these vast
distances and although this video is
about why websites load slowly this is
also part of the reason why gamers
prefer servers that are geographically
closer to them as a ping higher than
just 50 milliseconds can cause leg due
to the real-time nature of many games
but back to websites are there any ways
that developers can get around slow
loading times well yeah both by coding
their pages efficiently need to cut down
on how much work your browser has to do
and by caching frequently accessed data
through schemes like amp which you can
learn about more in this video with
these best practices developers can make
your life a little bit easier and that's
important as a recent survey indicated
that 40% of users give up if a website
takes just just three seconds or more to
load Oh
given how impatient many of us are these
days I'd hate to be the developer who
got kin because their website wasn't
loading fast enough but you know it is
fast enough fresh books fresh books
cloud accounting solution is great and
works anywhere with a fresh ebooks
mobile app you can create
professional-looking invoices on the go
