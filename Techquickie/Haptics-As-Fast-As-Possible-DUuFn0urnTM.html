are gonna get a little touchy-feely
which no no not like that but we are
gonna talk about haptics technologies
that create real-time feedback effects
with touch rather than relying only on
the sounds from a pair of headphones or
images on a screen so arcade games going
all the way back to the mid-1970s have
used force feedback particularly in
things like driving games where your
steering wheel or your handlebars would
shake after you spent another 25 cents
on crashing and burning yet again theme
parks later took this idea a few steps
further with moving theater rides where
your seat or even the entire room would
shake and vibrate to simulate an
adventure through some fantastical land
but in the mid-1990s we started to
finally see consumer grade haptics like
the interactor vest in 1994 an early
wearable technology that plugged into
your TV and converted certain
frequencies of audio into vibrations
that you could feel in your chest with
the idea being to make sounds like
explosions more realistic and immersive
of course what you were really doing was
strapping a glorified subwoofer to your
body but progress is progress three
years later in 1997 Nintendo released
the rumble pack for its Nintendo 64
controller adding an extra bit of punch
to now famous titles like Star Fox and
Super Smash Brothers and while the
gentle rumbling of the pack in your hand
wouldn't truly make you feel like you
were in the cockpit of an x-wing having
just gotten black
stood it was a nice additional feature
that enhanced the gaming experience
enough that this sort of force feedback
is now a standard feature in many modern
controllers today though there's far
more in the works than just making your
game pad shake a bit modern haptic
technologies typically take the form of
physical actuators that can vibrate in
precise ways to mimic textures or
provide more precise feedback than
earlier solutions the recently released
steam controller features track pads
that simulate a wide variety of in-game
effects such as recoil from a gun and
can also fool your fingers into thinking
they're using a clicky mouse wheel or a
trackball although the actual surface
itself is smooth and apple's
tactic engine is capable of making your
laptop touchpad emulate bumpy or pitted
surfaces and downward clicks in addition
to the usual force feedback so other
types of controllers and input devices
we may see in the future could offer so
much more even things like resistance
effects we're picking up a heavy object
in-game can feel heavier to your fingers
and we're also starting to explore how
haptics can be used to put more reality
in virtual reality especially when it
comes to haptic devices that can be
paired with VR headsets several kinds of
prototype haptic gloves have been
developed using physical actuators in
individual fingers or even selectively
inflatable air pockets to give users the
sense of touching and moving around a
virtual world but lioness does this
stuff have any application beyond gaming
and showing off my expensive Apple toys
to my friends well of course it does
designers that work with 3d models will
benefit from haptics in a huge way as
they'll be able to use haptic gloves to
feel an object modeled on-screen or
perhaps as an augmented reality hologram
right in front of them before it's
manufactured and for folks that have
been afflicted by blindness haptics may
offer a window to the world through
devices like tacet which provides force
feedback to let patients know what's
around them using sonar and speaking of
medical applications engineers are also
looking at way
to provide tactile feedback to
physicians that need to perform surgery
on faraway patients using a robot arm
and remote controller that can mimic the
feeling of the patient's body part
allowing for much greater precision in
situations where a supervising surgeon
can't physically be in the operating
room I mean just think one day haptic
feedback will not only be the way to
give yourself carpal tunnel because you
can't put down your oculus rift it might
be the way your surgeon heals your hand
speaking of learning self surgery just
kidding they teach lots of things but
