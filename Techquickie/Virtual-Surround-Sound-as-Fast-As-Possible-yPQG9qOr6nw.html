representation of human ingenuity and
the advances that scientific research
can have on technology it essentially
tricks your ears into thinking that
sound which is coming from a 2.1 channel
set up or a small strip of speakers
using a technique called digital sound
projection is actually coming from a 5.1
channel or higher speaker setup if
anyone doesn't know what the naming
scheme for a surround speaker setup
means the first number 5 in this case
refers to the number of speakers in the
system and the number after the point in
this case 1 refers to the number of
subwoofers in the system both 2.1 and
digital sound projection work because of
advancements in psycho acoustics which
is the study of sound perception they
trick your ears by carefully directing
sound waves at specific angles and
bouncing them off walls to make you
think that the sound is actually coming
from behind or beside you rather than in
front of you you see your ears are
pretty adept at recognizing where sound
is coming from this is why when you hear
something drop in a silent room you're
often able to instantly identify whether
the sound is to your left or right we
can tell what direction a sound is
coming from because we have two ears
which have a certain distance between
them so for example a sound to your left
will be louder in your left ear than in
your right ear also the sound waves will
hit your left ear a fraction of a second
sooner than your right it's these slight
differences in timing and volume that
tell you what direction a sound is
coming from on the x-axis this is called
the interaural level difference and
interaural time difference lucky for
developers of virtual surround sound
systems the x-axis is the only one they
have to worry about this is because of
something that many refer to as the cone
of confusion which is an area in which
objects which are above or below us
caused the same interaural level
difference and interaural time
difference this also applies to objects
which are in front of us or behind us at
certain angles so how do virtual
surround systems know how to simulate a
5.1 or higher channel system quite
simply through recording a system of
that size with directional microphones
in a real world setting which takes into
account the interruptions of a sound
wave by your head neck and shoulders and
simulating that with an algorithm this
is why some systems will have a room
size rating
and why some even need to be configured
with a microphone to work properly the
size of the room needs to be accounted
for so the waves can properly bounce off
the walls to simulate full surround
experience virtual surround headphones
do something similar by using the shape
of your ears to projects town from
different angles many of these have a
general one-size-fits-all setting based
on average ear sizes but options like
Razer surround are quite customizable so
you can tweak the placement of each
virtual speaker to perfect your
listening experience if you so choose to
give an example of what good virtual
surround should sound like through
headphones check out this video which
uses bio-neural sound recording to
simulate surround sound so that's it
virtual surround in itself isn't that
complicated but it's made possible by a
variety of extremely complicated
scientific studies and tests but the
execution is actually quite simple
