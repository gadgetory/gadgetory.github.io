companies that try to draw you in with
slick looking graphics and marketing
think of the casinos on the Las Vegas
Strip or Google's much-discussed recent
logo change or even the sign we put in
our front lobby to try to make it look
like we're a real company to some degree
and the reasons for this go beyond the
speculative research has indicated that
fonts can actually affect our physical
perceptions one experiment involves
serving identical jellybeans to two
different groups labeled with the words
eat me however eat me was printed in a
rounded font for one group and a jagged
font for the other group and it turned
out that the people in the jagged font
group perceived the jellybeans as quite
a bit more sour than the other group due
to the subconscious suggestion from the
way the words were written so the reason
that organizations all don't just use
one plain readable font for everything
like Helvetica or Arial is because
different fonts have a real power to
make us feel certain ways and conjure up
emotions that might make us more likely
to spend our money if we're at a store
or to feel a bit calmer if we're at the
dentist or something but how can mere
letters on a page or a sign kick us
right in the fields a lot of this has to
do with perceptions of fonts that we
develop over the years through a process
called psychological priming similar to
how people form stereotypes and first
impressions for example sans-serif fonts
have become much more common in modern
life due to their widespread use on
computer screens a sans-serif font by
the way is anything that doesn't have
serifs which are those little lines at
the edges of letters that make them
easier to read on a printed page
but since monitors were actually lower
resolution in terms of dots per inch
than books or magazines for a long time
many websites and computer graphic
designers used sans-serif fonts as it
was thought serifs would actually make
text on low res screens harder to read
nowadays with high res HD displays this
was less of an issue but sense
eris perception as modern and clean
persisted leading to it becoming a
popular font style for startups and
online businesses that want to appear
current and forward-thinking sensor
simplicity has also made it a go-to for
places that want to appear stable and
professional in fact many people
associate the sans-serif font Helvetica
with the IRS in the states since they
use it heavily on their tax forms of
course on the flip side its minimalism
and popularity as a modern font back in
the 1960s might explain why hipsters
have taken to it so much and speaking of
hipsters many fonts have fallen out of
favor due to their overuse in certain
applications Comic Sans for instance was
originally supposed to be just a fun
font reminiscent of old comic books now
it draws tons of iron do its association
with pakhi flyers for child-centric
activities impact doesn't quite annoy
people the way Comic Sans does but with
advice animal memes being as prevalent
as they are many places have started to
shy away from using it due to the strong
association with bad luck Brian and
insanity wolf which can make things seem
less trustworthy and while super tacky
fonts like papyrus don't usually have a
lot of staying power due to things like
restaurants massively overusing it they
can still be effective for building a
cohesive brand identity a commonly cited
example for this is the famous Disney
logo which people recognize immediately
despite the D and the Y not really
looking how they're supposed to harder
to read fonts are even intentionally
used by some restaurants and stores to
suggest that something on sale is higher
quality and it took a lot of effort to
make and as marketing strategies and
tastes continue to evolve
what kind of fonts strike us as fresh
trite or even offensive are sure to
change as well but if that's too much to
keep up with you can always play it safe
and use the affer mentioned Helvetica
which was named after the Latin name for
Switzerland because
as well you guessed it its neutrality so
just like Switzerland it's stayed out of
wars may be using Helvetica can help you
avoid conflict as well

traumatic experience with a bar of
