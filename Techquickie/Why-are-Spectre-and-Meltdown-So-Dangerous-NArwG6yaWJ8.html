Spector and meltdown first made
headlines you'd have been forgiven for
thinking that dr. no found a way to
cause mayhem at a nuclear power plant
somewhere
but while thankfully that isn't what
happened The Spectre and meltdown
security bugs have the potential to
inflict ma'am on nearly every computer
in the world between them you see most
software bugs and viruses affect systems
by trying to exploit some weakness in
the code of a particular program or
operating system meaning that they can't
hurt a system they weren't designed to
run on what makes spectre and meltdown
so dangerous is that they function on a
level that is much closer to the actual
hardware meaning that they can exploit
tons of different CPU models and
operating systems in fact meltdown
affects nearly every Intel CPU
manufactured since 1995 and specter
effects these and most AMD processors as
well Spectre clasp vulnerabilities can
even successfully attack a number of
smartphone CPUs holy crap so what
happened why exactly are these bugs so
widespread well it boils down to a
feature present on virtually all modern
processors called speculative execution
which is a key way that CPU
significantly boosts their performance
thanks to speculative execution when a
CPU is carrying out program instructions
it can guess which instructions it might
have to process next allowing a modern
processor to read ahead on the page so
to speak
processing data that it thinks it will
need shortly and then storing it on the
very fast CPU cache memory one way that
CPUs read ahead is by starting to
process the data in memory as soon
program asks for it rather than first
checking to see if that program is even
allowed to access that data you see
whenever you have more than one program
running your CPU will separate your
system ram into different chunks that
can only be accessed by one program to
keep other ones including malicious
programs from seeing data that they
shouldn't so let's say then that program
a asks to see some data from program B's
memory space the CPU will say no but
only after it starts to read that memory
and whatever was in that memory space is
already in the CPUs cache now although
the CPU won't directly pass that data at
a program a meltdown can figure out what
the data is by tricking the CPU instead
of just asking for the data directly
meltdown will ask the CPU to add the
value being held in cache to some
arbitrary number which will correspond
to a certain memory location or address
the CPU still won't reveal the
information at that memory address to
meltdown directly but the data will
still be cached beforehand so I know
this is pretty technical here but stick
with me for its next trick meltdown will
ask the CPU to read more memory
addresses noting the one that loads more
quickly than the others because it was
stored in the high-speed cache in the
previous step rather than the slower
system Ram this process allows meltdown
to figure out what data was in the
address it initially asked for as the
cached address will just be whatever the
arbitrary number that meltdown picked
plus the actual value the system was
trying to keep hidden was let's move on
to Spector now although Spector also
takes advantage of speculative execution
it works a little bit differently by
exploiting a CPUs branch predictor this
processor component watches for patterns
in program execution so if it sees a
particular function over and over again
the CPU will eventually pick up on it
and start to process this function on
its own repeatedly
like how you can train your pet to do
tricks by giving it food every time so
Spectre trains your CPU by telling it
over and over to execute instructions
that will dump the information the
attacker wants into cash after this
Specter can access the information by
using various timing tricks to work out
exactly what the data contains sometimes
by asking the CPU to use the data
located at a certain memory address in a
different function similarly to meltdown
and getting back to why this problem is
so widespread Spectre is a whole class
of attacks which means combined with the
fact that branch prediction is
incredibly important for performance in
nearly all modern CPUs means that there
isn't a quick fix for every variation of
it meltdown by contrast is a somewhat
easier fix that involves more thoroughly
separating different memory spaces but
since the patches also cut into a CPUs
ability to read ahead as we described
earlier the fixes can result in serious
slowdowns for processor intensive
programs as current CPUs have actually
gotten really good at predicting what
they'll need to do next a sad irony now
both Intel and AMD are working to fix
the vulnerabilities on a hardware level
in their future chips which is certainly
good news but because speculative
execution is so fundamental to modern
CPU design only time will tell if even
brand-new processors can actually plug
these holes for good and obviously that
solution isn't going to do anything for
the literally billions of CPUs that are
already out in the wild so yes this
means you Jeff from New York proud owner
of an overclocked 46 70 K unless you
want to go buy new hardware all you can
really do is be careful what you click
on out there a cleverly designed attack
that takes advantage of specter warm

your PC so you may not even find out
about it until your bank accounts have
been emptied and you have a
