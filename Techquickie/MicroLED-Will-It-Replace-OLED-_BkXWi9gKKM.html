we've gotten pretty used to the idea of
incredibly high resolution displays in
tiny amounts of space I mean the cell
phone in your pocket
probably packs in as many or possibly
more pixels than the 60-inch TV in your
living room but the never-ending quest
for higher and higher pixel densities
stops for absolutely no one which is why
Apple has made headlines recently for
syncing a ton of money into making its
own micro LEDs but what are those and
what's the point when current mobile
display tech seems to be serving us just
fine
well micro LEDs bear resemblance to the
organic LEDs or Ã¶hlins that have become
popular over the last few years unlike
traditional LCD screens each pixel on an
OLED based display can generate its own
light meaning that there is no need for
a backlight that adds thickness and can
wash the image out or make its colors
look uneven the result is an accurate
clear picture with very deep blacks
and contrast ratios that are marketed as
infinite not to mention a lower power
draw which is key for battery dependent
mobile devices o LEDs are great but
they're kind of fatally flawed in a
sense because the organic part of the o
LED refers to carbon-based molecules
that deteriorate over time so the pixels
themselves especially the ones
displaying white can suffer from burnin
as some owners of OLED screens have
found if they spend lots of time playing
games with static UI elements or
watching the same TV channel with a logo
in the bottom corner micro LED by
contrast uses inorganic materials
specifically gallium nitride which not
only lasts longer than the materials in
OLED screens but it isn't susceptible to
burnin meaning that micro LED offers
the benefits of OLED without the common
drawbacks and it can be made much
brighter as well while using less power
for the same brightness level micro LED
screens are also more versatile in that
they are easier to manufacture in
whatever sizes and shapes that you want
Samsung notably demonstrated this at CES
2018 with a 146 inch prototype
television that it calls the wall made
up of smaller borderless micro LED
panels so in the future we might finally
break through the 65 inch barrier you
know where TVs stopped getting bigger
because they became impractical to
transport home from the local Best Buy I
mean imagine this instead of buying a
whole new television set because of one
patch of dead pixels you could just go
swap in a new modular panel and get on
with your mindless consumption so
because of all of these benefits micro
LEDs are interesting to more than just
the traditional display manufacturers so
Apple reportedly has a team of engineers
working on implementing them into its
own devices but they'll probably be
starting out small with like something
like an apple watch being a prime
candidate for a finished product with
micro LEDs a few years down the road
years down the road although a minute
this sounds great why wait so long good
question
the biggest drawback right now is
manufacturing complexity it takes a long
time to put together a micro LED display
as they have to be built one sub pixel
at a time think about how many of those
there would be on a standard 4k TV so as
is the case with a lot of cool sounding
emerging technologies we're going to
have to wait a bit before we're all
walking around with micro LED gadgets in
our pockets but since Apple Samsung and
LG all own multiple patents relating to
micro LEDs it appears that the giants of
the tech world are serious about
releasing displays with pixels that
don't burn assuming of course that you
have money that you can burn
are you interested in computer science
then check out brilliant a
problem-solving website that teaches you
to think like a computer scientist
instead of passively listening to
lectures you get to master concepts by
solving fun and challenging problems and
brilliant provides the tools and
framework that you need to tackle these
challenges brilliance thought-provoking
content based around breaking up
complexities into bite-sized
understandable chunks will lead you from
