escape our mundane lives for something a
little more fantastical the concept of
virtual reality is still a little ways
away from completely fooling our brains
into thinking we're actually in
middle-earth or whatever but for your
computer it's pretty simple to fool it
into thinking that a fake virtual
environment is the real deal I'm talking
of course about virtualization which has
become a really useful tool for home
users and IT pros alike but what the
heck is it well in a general sense it
means putting layers of software between
your computer's hardware and some other
software that you're trying to run but
more commonly it means running one
operating system on top of another one
on top of another one on top another
inception ah no usually it's one layer
and then more operating systems so
you've probably seen this in the form of
running one version of Windows as a
virtual machine or a VM inside a window
in a newer version this has all sorts of
real-world applications but before we
get into this it helps to understand
something about how your computer
achieves this you see your computer
grants different pieces of software
different privileges depending on what
they are your operating system has a lot
more privileges than regular programs
like being able to directly access
hardware like your memory or your CPU
the idea being to stop malicious
applications from attacking your system
or crashing it because of this early
virtualization software that was forced
to run as a regular program without
privileged access to Hardware directly
had to translate the actual instruction
set of the processor which you can learn
about here by the way so that the
virtual OS could actually make any use
of it or as an alternative you can
install a small program called a
hypervisor
as the main OS on the computer then
virtualize your main OS like Linux or
Windows or whatever else on top of that
to actually run programs but because of
the overhead involved with translating
instructions this resulted in some
serious slowdowns in terms of
performance but in the mid-2000s both
AMD and Intel started making processors
that natively supported virtual machines
allowing a hypervisor to run below the
layer where an OS would usually be which
means that the system wouldn't have to
spend time translating instructions
enabling much faster near native
performance ok Linus so that's a lot of
technical talk about hypervisors and
layers and onions or whatever else but
what does that mean for me can I
actually use this stuff well yeah
actually if you have older games you
still love that just won't play nicely
on your modern 64-bit operating system
you can run an old 32-bit version of
Windows in a virtual machine and play to
your heart's content cool right
vans are also useful for testing new
software or even like a website that
you're not sure whether it contains
malware or not because you can just
delete the entire virtual machine
without touching any of the important
data on your main OS or even your
network if you quarantine it effectively
and speaking of your main operating
system if you're thinking about
switching to something else completely
different you can actually try your new
OS in a virtual machine without nuking
your existing hard drive and your
existing OS not to mention compatibility
between operating systems remember
parallels that I mentioned before
Windows applications on the Mac that's
right and if you have important data
that you can't lose VMS are also a very
easy way to back up most vm software can
take snapshots of the entire virtual
system at a given point in time kind of
like an uber System Restore this
capability has made it very popular on
servers which often need redundancy and
backups to ensure constant operation not
to mention the fact that running
multiple virtual machines on one server
can put all of that processing power to
better use as modern server hardware is
notoriously underutilized especially if
the workloads don't natively take
advantage of many processing threads at
a time but if you want to do something
really cool you can virtualize
is your gaming rig and turn one beastly
PC into three virtual machines an ass
and then to gaming boxes that two
players can use at once so you can check
out this video for a practical
demonstration of how it's done and the
results
speaking of practical you know what's
practical ifixit.com the world's free
online repair manual they've got
step-by-step repair and teardown guides
for all kinds of stuff like seriously
we've got like fifteen thousand plus
guides for iphones ipads macs computers
android phones tablets you pretty much
name it and it's totally free with no
ads or annoying login portals or
anything like that what supports this
business you might ask great question
well they've also got a line of the
tools and that you need in order to
perform these repairs that you can buy
over on ifixit.com so they've got that
fantastic screwdriver kit that I use all
the time
they've also got their larger protec bag
that has the tool kit along with like
the magnetic screw holder and all that
kind of stuff in it and all you got to
do to check it out is head over to
ifixit.com slash tech quickie to a learn
how to repair your devices and get all
the tools you need which by the way come
with a lifetime warranty so thanks for
watching guys if you like this video do
that thing if you just liked it do the
other thing check out our other channels
as well we've got some great videos over
on channel super-fun like hotdogs
Olympics whatever that is
see you're curious now right you got to
check it out as always if you leave a
comment below we'll try and check that
out and see if we can make a fast as
possible episode with your suggestion
