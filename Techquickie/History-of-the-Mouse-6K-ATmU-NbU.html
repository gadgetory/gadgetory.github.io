the 1960s an animator slash business
tycoon bought a bunch of land in Central
Florida turning it into a sprawling

family fun at unreasonable price hahaha
no not that Mouse today's episode is
about the computer mouse and at first
you might not think there's much history
to discuss because they didn't start
becoming widespread on personal
computers until the mid to late 80s but
it turns out that the concept of using
something other than those clunky arrow
keys to move a cursor around predates
the modern mouse by several decades I'm
talking about the trackball which sprang
into existence all the way back in 1946
as part of a British Navy project to
help track aircraft on radar this
concept was later adapted by the
Canadian Navy for their own tracking
system which used a small 5 pin bowling
ball of all things for the ball because
presumably they couldn't get funding for
a real one anywho these early
implementations were rather crude with
the ball placed on top of spinning metal
discs that came into contact with wires
but because the UK considered it a
military secret the idea of using a
spinning or rolling object as a computer
input device wouldn't end up being
realized in the civilian world until
years later when the first true Mouse
was invented in 1964 at Stanford
University now unlike modern mice which
have total freedom of movement in one
plane this early Mouse only had two
pizza cutter looking wheels that allowed
movement up and down or side to side but
not at the same time the inventors
decided to call their creation a mouse
because the wire sticking out of the end
looked like a rodents tail and they used
it in conjunction with the NL s a DARPA
funded computer system that included
clickable hyperlinks
remember this was nearly 30 years before
the internet started becoming widespread
soon after that the mouse was picked up
by Xerox who developed a personal
computer called the alto in 1973 which
used an actual graphical user interface
complete with mouse support and Xerox
was actually also developing ball mice
while they worked on the alto which
would allow users to move the mouse in
any direction they pleased
these worked by keeping the ball in
contact with axles attached to wheels
with holes in them as the mouse moved
the axles would turn the wheels causing
beams of light to repeatedly break into
pulses which hit sensors that registered
which way the mouse was moving this
design revolutionized the way we
interact with our computers but Xerox
was and still is a company that's
focused on producing products for
business rather than home use meaning
that the mouse wasn't very well known
until Apple came along made a deal with
Xerox to give them partial ownership of
Apple in return for the use of Xeroxes
technology and then popularized the
device with the original Macintosh in
1984
even though Xerox had already switched
to ball mice and Microsoft was already
selling them for use with word
processors no doubt Apple's clever
marketing played a role in pushing a
pre-existing technology into the
mainstream consciousness some things
never do change am i right anyway
aside from changes in economic switch
gave mice a shape more suited to the
hand than that original plastic brick
form the basic way that they worked
didn't really change between the mid 80s
and the mid 90s though we did get
laptops with those little nub style
pointing sticks and the first track pads
in the interim so users of external mice
had to wait until 1966 for the first
widespread mouse with a scroll wheel
even though that concept had actually
been realized back in 1985 with the
Mighty Mouse featuring a wheel on the
side instead of the top that you
controlled with your thumb then the late
90s also brought an even
bigger sea change optical mice like the
scroll wheel Mouse the optical mouse was
first developed long before it hit the
market in fact early versions that used
specific tracking surfaces were actually
invented back in 1980 when even ball
mice were relatively unknown but
development of optical mice that could
work with generic surfaces like mouse
pads table tops or your pants didn't
happen until much later and it also took
awhile for component costs to come down
to the point where they were cheap
enough to mass-produce when they finally
did appear on the consumer market in
1999 optical mice were still expensive
with some of Microsoft's early offerings
retailing for around 70 US dollars in
fact the first ever gaming mouse the
Razer Boomslang also launched in 1999
but that one still used a mechanical
ball the upsides to optical mice
included not only more accurate tracking
than with a ball mouse but also better
reliability the optical sensors which
worked by taking many photos of the
surface that the mouse sat on every
second and then sending them to a chip
that would process those images to
detect movement were much more resistant
to the dirt and gunk that all too often
fouled up mouse balls and degraded
performance later in 2004 logitech
released a frickin laser mouse which
would not only incinerate your enemies
but also sport even more accurate
tracking thanks to the use of a laser
beam which could see surfaces under the
mouse with more precision than standard
LEDs this was a boon for more serious PC
gamers that wanted the more granular
tracking during the heat of battle and
other significant advances in Mouse
technology began to be driven by gamers
over the coming years such as more
powerful processors inside the mice
themselves so they could scan surfaces
and process movement more frequently and
allowing users to adjust the sensitivity
of the mouse on the fly for situations
that require precise aiming
like we've seen with the ever-popular
sniper button now there have been other
improvements too mice in recent years
but they mostly come in the form of
adding more general technologies to mice
to make them more versatile like
replacing ps2 with USB which you can
learn about here
implementing scroll wheels that can
switch between smooth or clicky
operation adding wireless data and even
charging support peppering them with
programmable macro buttons adding the
ability to track on glass by scanning
for small scratches and dust particles
and of course covering them with the oh
so important RGB lighting that you know
that you crave so today then it's been a
long time since doug engelbart and bill
english gave us their original wooden
box on wheels but the simplicity and
intuitiveness of the mouse has ensured
its continuation as an extremely
important input device even in the age
of touchscreens and voice control
maybe it'll finally be usurped by the
development of something like a neural
interface but by that time we'll
probably be dealing with a whole new set
of problems
thanks to the internet there's never
been more opportunities to be
self-employed and with all these
freelancers and small business owners
