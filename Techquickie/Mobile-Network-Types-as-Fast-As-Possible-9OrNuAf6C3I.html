what the heck a G is yes I suppose it is
that but it also refers to the
generation of cell phone network
technology used by your providers towers
and the radio in your mobile device so
how many G's you have affects the
features speed availability and
reliability of your mobile network so 1g
or first generation was analog yeah it
didn't even support roaming didn't
encode voice calls digitally and had no
support for mobile Internet which I
guess makes sense since that was pretty
much sci-fi when 1g was rolled out
starting in the early 80s at any rate
good riddance to it its successor 2g
rocketed us into the digital Fastlane
allowing voice calls to be transmitted
more efficiently via compression which
you can learn more about here by the way
and cell phones become smaller thanks to
the reduced radio power requirements
awesome what we also got with 2g was
confusion roaming to different
territories was much improved but only
if the mobile network you were roaming
on used the same type of
second-generation network the main two
of which being CDMA and GSM and while
initial true 2g offerings were too slow
for a mobile internet experience beyond
text-based emails interim standards like
GPRS and edge colloquially referred to
as like two and a half G or 2.75 G could
deliver data rates as high as well much
higher than the minimum 200 kilobits per
second transfer speed required to call
something free G which is why the line
is so blurry because carriers had to try
and balance backwards compatibility and
future-proof Ness
with performance and coverage today not
an easy thing to do when you're trying
to save all that money and third
generation or 3G networks didn't
simplify matters at all with
technologies like edge being technically
allowed to be marketed as 3G thanks to
fulfilling the speed requirements even
though almost no one did that since it's
an upgrade dead end
at all competitive with standards like
WCDMA who's later upgrades like HSPA and
HSPA+ could achieve pretty kick-ass
mobile broadband speeds in excess of a
hundred megabit per second ok so deep
breath did 4G fourth-generation make
things simpler the answer is yes and no
the term 4G is used pretty fast and
loose by cell phone providers for one
thing if you are trying to convince you
that they have the fastest stuff but it
also has a few different real meetings
so some companies use 4G to refer to a
standard called HSPA+ which if you
remember from like 20 seconds ago is
actually technically turbocharged 3g
which is why many carriers now are
differentiating their long term
evolution or LTE networks by
specifically calling them out as 4G LTE
LTE offers enhanced voice quality with
HD voice which you can learn more about
here and dramatically better downstream
data rates for watching YouTube videos
and streaming for music services like
Spotify we're talking up to 300 megabit
per second and on top of that you can
see dramatically better upstream
performance - which is critical for
video calls and even mobile gaming in
some cases but then is 4G LTE the end of
the huge alphabet soup of different
wireless names the answer is no I mean
there's a newer version of LTE called
LTE advanced that is being marketed as
true 4G since
LTE wasn't technically 4G then they kind
of changed the rules so they could call
it that for marketing purposes that so
that's on the horizon offering even
greater reliability due to its use of
several different LTE frequency bands at
once which is very important when you're
traveling around or in a densely
populated city also there's one company
in South Korea that has already rolled
out what it calls Giga LTE which is
today capable of speeds of over one
gigabit per second on compatible phones
from Samsung and LG absolutely
incredible as long as there's a nearby
tower so speaking of nearby towers will
this kind of performance ever be
available in the
technologically backward west well
perhaps not but at least those of us
stuck under the oppressive heels of our
local carriers can take comfort knowing
that the next generation of South
Koreans will be enjoying the latest
freemium games in glorious 4k
speaking of latest freemium games Avira
thought yourself gee if only I had some
like graphic design skills and some
business savvy and some coding skills I
could make a freemium game and like swim
in my buckets of money all day
well lynda.com is there for you I mean
fortunately they have actually lots of
different things you can learn word you
can do those things I said before you
can learn video editing and it's all
about watching and learning from top
experts who are passionate about
teaching the skills that you want
whether you're trying to make a freemium
game we're just trying to advance your
