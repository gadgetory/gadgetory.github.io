sound equipment out there that promises
a super-realistic experience but let's
face it it is pretty darn hard to fool
your ears into thinking that you're
listening to something live as opposed
to a recording or a stream even if you
did blow your life savings on some
amazing headphones or speakers but
believe it or not there's actually a
relatively old and fairly
straightforward technology that can
surpass even the most ridiculous
surround sound speaker setups in terms
of spatial realism I'm talking of course
about Bernardo recording but what is
that and how does it fool our brains
into thinking we are right in the middle
of the scene well it helps to keep in
mind exactly how your ears work when you
hear any kind of sound let's say it's
your pet doing its best you and cat
impression from down the hall the sound
waves are going to arrive at your ears
at slightly different times and they'll
also be slightly louder in one ear than
the other your brain takes these my mute
differences and processes them to figure
out exactly where the noise is coming
from Bernardo audio takes advantage of
this fact by recording an audio track in
the first place in a way that mimics our
natural hearing the idea itself is
actually very simple to create a
Bernardo recording to high fidelity
microphones are placed about roughly the
same distance apart as your ears from
each other some recording studios even
embed the mics inside of a dummy human
head complete with realistic ears to get
an even more accurate sound imaging and
bippity Boppity the result is an
amazingly accurate reproduction of
ambient sound that fools your brain into
thinking the noises are really happening
around you and since the concept behind
binaural recording is so simple it was
thought of long before the advent of
modern digital audio in fact it was
first introduced for telephones all the
way back in the 1880s but didn't become
more common until fairly recently thanks
to the falling prices of both recording
equipment and headphones yes
headphones
only you cannot use this on your
freestanding speakers because of the way
the recordings are made remember the
microphones are placed right where your
ears would be the effect is nearly
impossible to duplicate on regular
speakers but the good news is that you
at least don't need super high-end
headphones powered by some exotic tube
amplifier to enjoy the effect a cheap
pair of earbuds will actually do the
trick just nicely let's all find well
Linus then but so where can I hear this
banal stuff I mean I don't really see a
whole lot of it on Spotify although it
is still pretty hard to find in music
and movies various producers and
musicians have been experimenting with
it and a large community has popped up
on YouTube around banal recordings
featuring everything from music to
walking tours of New York City to
virtual barbershops that are actually
kind of creepy it's a very weird
experience but if you're not into random
novelty YouTube videos I totally get
that and if you're waiting for Bernardo
audio being part of your everyday
listening experience if you're a gamer
you'll be pleased to know that the
future looks very bright because virtual
reality game developers are seriously
pursuing the use of Bernardo sound in
headsets such as the oculus rift and
Sony's project Morpheus except instead
of just using two microphones VR
developers are experimenting with rings
of microphones on dummy heads to create
a true 360 degree Bernardo sound
experience that is preserved no matter
which way you turn wearing your head
mounted display and as virtual reality
technology continues to mature game
publishers will seek more and more
interesting ways to achieve full
immersion in 3d sound and our ears may
be in for just as much of a treat as our
eyes you know what's a word for things
you can hear all this talking about
listening audible so head over to
audible.com slash tech quick and you
guys can check out their vast selection
of audiobooks it is all about joining
the club so you get one audiobook per
month that you can listen to on your
phone or your mp3 player if you still
have one of those in your car
or wherever it is that you've got a
little bit of time to sit and listen to
a book but not necessarily the time to
sit and stare at one and it entitles you
to all kinds of other cool stuff like
discounts on further audiobooks you can
check out all kinds of cool stuff I
usually pick something from the
bestsellers like the Martian by Andy
weir and narrated by RC ray it's a sory
of lekha astronaut a man who assumes
he'll be the first die on Mars after he
is stranded by a dust storm that forces
crew to evacuate very cool stuff anyway
guys that's audible.com slash tech
quickie to join the club now those of
you who have are still watching this
show and have managed to not sign up for
audible yet oh yeah and did I mention
the first month and therefore your first
audiobook is absolutely free yes it is
free so I think that's pretty much it

it sucked leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future videos and as
always don't forget to subscribe and
follow in all of that noise and I know
