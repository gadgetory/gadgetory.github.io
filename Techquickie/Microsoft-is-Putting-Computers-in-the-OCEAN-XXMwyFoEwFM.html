computer with liquid cooling you'll know
how effective it can be to put your CPU
under water I mean not literally but
under a water block that has liquid
circulating through it but could
actually submerging computers in the
world's largest reservoir the freaking
ocean be the way of the future
well Microsoft seems to think so and
they're already operating underwater
server farms with other large cloud
providers likely to follow suit but why
are they bothering with something that
sounds like it's straight out of
Futurama how does that even work well it
might be fairly easy and cheap to cool
your home PC adequately a $20 air cooler
and a couple of case fans it's probably
gonna get the job done just fine but
when we're talking about cooling off a
massive data center housing thousands of
servers we're talking millions of watts
cooling costs start to add up very
quickly in fact it's estimated that data
firms spend around a billion and a half
dollars every year in electricity costs
just to keep their server farms cool so
at these scales efficiency really starts
to matter and yeah you could always
strap thousands of water coolers to
these servers and call it a day
but you would still have to get rid of
the hot air coming off the radiators so
it turns out it's more efficient to just
take the entire data center and drop it
in the sea you see water has a high heat
capacity meaning it can store lots of
heat energy without changing its own
temperature very much
think about how a puddle next to the
swimming pool can stay relatively cool
compared to the scorching hot concrete
right next to it so an underwater data
center housed in a watertight pod only
needs a relatively simple heat exchanger
to dump its waste heat into the
surrounding seawater this saves an
enormous amount of energy compared to
forcing hot air out of data centers on
land especially when you consider just
how much ocean water there is to absorb
the heat also helping matters is the
fact that the ocean is quite cold once
you go deep enough so you'd only have to
submerge a server pod in one or two
hundred meters of sea water to get
excellent cooling even in warm tropical
regions and better cooling isn't even
the only benefit to ocean based server
farms land-based data centers often have
to be located in sparsely populated
areas due to their physical size and
lower costs for the land and the energy
although this can save money it also
means that the data has to travel
further to get to you meaning more
latency and lower speeds underwater
server pods by contrast can be placed
close to coastal areas where far more
people live in fact 40% of the global
population resides within a hundred
kilometers of a coastline meaning that a
coastal server pod could make your
internet experience feel a bit snappier
and speaking of snappier it should
actually be faster to build a bunch of
server pods and then dunk them in the
ocean compared to building new
land-based data centers every time a
company needs to increase capacity I
mean sure it comes with some engineering
challenges for sure but not only does
constructing a big server warehouse
require a lot of land you also have to
consider local conditions such as
topography the workforce and government
restrictions anywhere you want to build
one underwater server farms though could
be built an assembly-line fashion almost
identically and then quickly shipped to
any place that needs them and they could
even be moved around if necessary they
would just need to be connected to data
lines and a power source so one
Microsoft pod that's currently off the
Scottish coast draws power from a nearby
wind farm on the Orkney Islands in fact
offshore wind installations may prove to
be a popular solution for powering these
pods in the not so distant future
now of course sticking a bunch of
servers underwater presents some real
challenges you can't exactly just send a
team of divers out every time a hard
drive fails so the pods need to be
designed with redundancies and better
remote access to allow land lubber
technicians to handle problems more
effectively and I mean here's another
fun one
Engineers have even had to work on
devising special coatings for the
outside of these pods to repel barnacles
so it turns out that barnacles can
interfere with heat transfer though I
mean I guess they could just do what
old-school seafarers did and send an
intern down to scrape them off right
probably not but you know what is right
private Internet access VPN not only
does P ia work on up to five devices at
once hiding your true IP address and
allowing you to bypass geo restrictions
and censorship making it appear as
though you're connected from somewhere
else it also blocks unwanted connections
to help prevent attacks Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects and it
even includes mace P I is built-in
malware blocker P ia supports multiple
VPN protocols and encryption levels they
have apps for Windows Mac Android iOS
Linux and a Chrome extension with
support for more platforms coming soon
and they have over 3000 servers in 28
countries also they don't log user
activity with all those benefits what
are you waiting for check them out today
at the link below so thanks for watching
guys like dislike check out our other
videos and don't forget to leave a
comment if you have a suggestion for a
future fast as possible if that's down
there and also subscribe that's down
there too so you got to go like looking
for it it's like god
it's like submersion searching for a
subscription buttons it's underwater but
it's not my finest work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
