answer to today's question is actually
pretty simple Google is yet another
greedy corporation trying to pull the
wool over our eyes and hide the truth
that the earth is actually a flat
surface surrounded on all sides by walls
of ice Oh gotcha just kidding we aren't
flat earthers here at Tech wiki but
other than making Google Maps look a
little cooler when you zoom all the way
out what exactly was the point of
switching away from the flat map that
we're all familiar with from grade
school well as it turns out making any
kind of map look flat is a relatively in
exact science for example imagine if you
painted the outside of a grapefruit to
look like a globe then you let the paint
dry peeled it and laid the peel flat to
make a 2 dimensional map well you'd
quickly realize that not only do the
shapes of landforms and bodies of water
get a little distorted when you flatten
them but you can forget about trying to
make the map a perfectly neat rectangle
in fact part of the reason that this map
projection that you've probably seen in
old school world atlases look so funny
is because it's attempting to show
shapes and sizes more accurately than
would be possible if you were trying to
stretch the map to fit it inside a
rectangular space and this was
especially noticeable on the projection
used for a long time by Google called
the Mercator even though this map
projection actually goes back over 400
years Google favored it for their Maps
application over others because it's
quite good at preserving angles which is
important because so many people use
Google Maps for navigation in fact the
Mercator became popular long ago
precisely because it's accurate angles
help sailors navigate the high seas with
confidence but Mercator also has a very
obvious flaw you see the projection
works by showing you what you'd get if
you have stuck the earth inside a
cylinder that was just big enough to
hold it kind of like putting a tennis
ball in a can so the middle of
the earth the equator will touch the
sides of the can but areas closer to the
North and South Poles have to be
stretched out in order to touch the
cylinder which you would then unroll to
get a Mercator map in the world this
stretching means that the sizes of land
masses are inaccurate and this is
especially true the further you get from
the equator
for example Greenland looks much bigger
than Australia on a Mercator map even
though it's actually the other way
around in real life which was mostly
fine since odds are that you aren't
doing much traveling Antarctica or the
very northern reaches of Canada but
Google made the change anyway since even
though a globe is three dimensional
which means your computer's graphics
processor has to do extra work in order
to render it smoothly on your monitor
the processing power available in the
typical desktop or laptop has come a
long way since the service was first
launched in 2005 with that said if you
go to Google Maps right now you may
actually hear your laptop get a little
louder as the fan speed increases that's
your GPU firing up or at least it should
as long as you have hardware
acceleration enabled in your browser
interestingly the answer to this
question also probably addresses why
this feature isn't available on the maps
app for smartphones just yet it would
really suck to see your phone battery
drained just because you lost your
fidget spinner and decided to keep
flicking that virtual globe around to
satisfy your social media addled
attentions bad speaking of you know
making your whatever juggling multiple
computers is difficult you end up with
various sets of mice and keyboards on
your desk which not only looks messy but
it can get super confusing which one
goes for which KVM switches can
partially solved this problem but we
found that they aren't very seamless and
can be cumbersome well with synergy you
can move a single mouse and keyboard
between your computers seamlessly to
make them feel like just one system you
