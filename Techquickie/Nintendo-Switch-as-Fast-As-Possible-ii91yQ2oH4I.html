we've been looking for more and more
ways to take our games with us from the
primitive handhelds of the 1970s that
could only play one game each to the 3ds
which brought portable stereo 3d to the
masses to the Nvidia shield that can
stream full quality games wirelessly
from a PC so as it becomes increasingly
easy to cram high-end equipment into a
small package mean just think what's
possible these days with a smartphone or
a small form-factor computer it might
not be surprising that the next big
thing in console gaming might be
Nintendo's new switch a livingroom
console that's also being pitched as a
fully portable console we would ok so
it's like this the switch took one of
the main selling points of its
commercially unsuccessful predecessor
the Wii U and made it a lot more robust
the Wii U featured a screen on the main
controller that enabled the gamer to
play without a TV maybe while they were
in the bathroom or something but the
caveat was that you had to stay within a
certain range of the actual console
which combined with a distinct lack of
killer apps meant that this wasn't
enough to lure people away from
competition like Sony and Microsoft but
not to be dissuaded by poor sales
figures Nintendo making what some
consider to be its last stand in the
living-room console arena is doubling
down on this concept by making the
switches 720p screen part of the console
itself which has a tablet desk form
factor and weighs slightly less than 400
grams with the controllers attached to
the side a little lighter than an iPad
air 2 when you're using the switch in
standard livingroom mode or TV mode as
Nintendo calls it the console connects
and charges over USB type-c to an
included dock that features an HDMI port
and
three spare USB type a ports although
the switch comes with a somewhat meager
32 gigabytes of internal storage this is
expandable through a microSD card slot
good on you Nintendo so the switch will
play games at either 1080p or 900 P at
up to 60 frames per second while
connected to a TV and this is cool in 60
FPS titles it can even maintain this
frame rate when you take it on the road
but if this wasn't enough of a paradigm
shift for you where things get really
interesting is when we start to look at
the controller setup the switch actually
comes with a pair of controllers so yes
you get local multiplayer out of the box
they're called joi cons and they bear a
passing resemblance to Wii remotes but
are quite a bit more versatile in
addition to being smaller the console
comes with a joi con grip that holds the
joi cons together to allow them to
behave like a single controller with
more traditional ergonomics but if you
want to remove the switch from the dock
and take it with you the joy cons can
also act as independent controllers for
portable local multiplayer or they can
slide directly on to the console itself
making it look kind of like the Wii U
controller except with the ability to
play on toilets everywhere instead of
just the ones in your home and Nintendo
is pushing the multiplayer aspect very
hard here not only emphasizing how folks
can play with separate controllers on
the same screen wherever they go but
also that up to eight separate switch
consoles can be linked together on a
local network some games will even run
on multiple switches in this manner with
just one cartridge similar to Diablo
spawn or download play on the 3ds joy
clones also support motion sensing but a
bit differently than you might have
experienced it on the Wii or the Wii U
one of your to joy cons has an IR sensor
that can detect not only motion but
distances and shapes and both joy Kahn's
support what Nintendo is calling HD
Gumble which is an advanced haptic
engine that can simulate lots of
different sensations Nintendo demoed
this by showing how it could simulate
the feeling of an ice cube rattling
around a glass with the player being
able to distinguish between one and
multiple cubes and between solid ice and
liquid water pretty cool if big if game
dad's actually implement any of these
features on the subject of the games
themselves this is an area Nintendo is
definitely looking to improve on over 50
games are in development and there's
going to be extra emphasis on first
party titles like Mario and Zelda to
give players and optimally Nintendo Wii
experience but even though the switch is
obviously newer than the ps4 or Xbox one
don't expect it to push the limits of
console performance the nvidia tegra GPU
also is it going to come close to
competing with a high-end pc graphics
card but it wasn't designed to as
nintendo experiences tend to be less
about cutting-edge graphics and more
about delivering something unique that
isn't easy to replicate on a pc or other
gaming box and of course tempering the
graphics horsepower means better battery
life the console itself is expected to
work for three to six hours while the
joy cons can get up to 20 hours each one
thing that's decidedly not that cool is
that unlike in the past Nintendo is
going to start charging an annual fee
for online multiplayer though thankfully
they are widely expected to undercut
Sony and Microsoft so you probably won't
be paying nearly as much as you would
for a PSN or xbox live subscription so
will it be successful at $300 the launch
price puts it on par with the ps4 and
Xbox so whether you make the switch will
ultimately come down to Nintendo being
more successful selling this hybrid
paradigm than Nvidia was
