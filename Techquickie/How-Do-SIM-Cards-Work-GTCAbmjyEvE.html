physical wires linking one end to
another this was regardless of whether
or not you were making a call across the
continent or just using a couple tin
cans attached to a string whenever
you've dialed a number your phone
company could wrote your call exactly
where it needed to go using said cables
but in this brave new world of not only
phone calls but vines and snapchats and
other stuff that the kids are doing
being blasted out from cell towers
everywhere these signals have to know
where they're going every time this is
where SIM cards come in and despite the
name SIM cards isn't a new casino
building game from Maxis although that
would actually be pretty sweet sim
stands for subscriber identity module
which gives a pretty big hint as to what
it does it identifies what mobile phone
subscriber is using a particular iPhone
galaxy or Windows Phone if that's your
thing for whatever reason and although
SIM cards are quite low capacity with
many of them holding well under a
megabyte of data the small amount of
information that they do hold is
extremely important if you want your
phone to be of any use when you don't
have a Wi-Fi signal SIM cards store a
64-bit number that serves as a unique
identifier and although that only takes
up 8 bytes of storage there are over 9
quintillion unique numbers that can be
stored in this way on a SIM card so this
method should work no matter how many
people sign up for Verizon when you turn
on your phone and first connect to the
cell network your phone will pass your
sim cards ID number along with an
authentication key also found on the SIM
card to your cell phone provider your
provider then generates a random number
and uses the key to spit out a response
number at the same time that random
number is sent back to your phone and
the same calculation is done with the
authentication key to generate another
response number if the two numbers match
your provider will recognize this and
connect your phone to the network both
ensuring that it's actually you that's
connected to keep your data safe and to
see who you are so your provider
and block access if you haven't been
paying your bills because you've been
blowing all of your money on freemium
games but other than just identifying
information SIM cards can also store
phonebook information and although that
might seem like a dated concept in an
age where phones can store almost
anything you can think of on separate
internal memory or expansion cards this
was important when things like flip
phones were more popular so you wouldn't
lose all of your contact info when you
upgrade it or if you're not storing your
phonebook with a Google or Apple cloud
service if you are moving cards between
phones just make sure that they're the
same size as there are different sim
form factors and that your new phone
even has a SIM card slot at all some
phones especially in the US have their
authentication information on built-in
internal memory instead of course while
SIM cards are quite useful when you want
to switch phones this isn't always
possible because of something called sim
locking you see phones you get from a
major carrier with a service contract
are often locked meaning they'll only
work on that carriers network service
providers do this so they can subsidize
the cost of the phone allowing you to
get higher-end equipment for a much
lower price because they know they'll be
getting money from you for a certain
time because of your subscription
contract but the good news is that some
carriers nowadays have stopped sim
locking while many others will give you
an unlock code once your contract ends
so that you can put your phone on
another network in fact the u.s. passed
a law in 2014 making it legal to unlock
your own phone since before that it was
technically considered circumventing a
copyright safeguard hmm Squarespace the

fun things click up here to check out
channel super fun if you like the video
like it if you just like to dislike it

helpful because then you see all the
stuff although if you go to the Linus
tech tips YouTube page and click videos
I think actually like the first thing
you see is a tech quickie videos but I
don't know I could be wrong you could
also check that to verify if I'm wrong
or not by going to Linus tech tips
channel maybe watching video 2 while
you're there anyways
SIM card joke what oh that was funny
anyways I don't know if you heard it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
