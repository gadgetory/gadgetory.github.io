push the boundaries of what can be done
and bring the world something that it's
never seen before but sometimes some of
the most useful stuff can just be a
rehash of something that's actually very
old sometimes thousands of years old
as is the case with electronic ink
although we've had paper and ink for a
millennia and can read just about
anything we want on smartphones or
tablets e-readers that use electronic
ink or ink instead of fully fledged LCD
screens are a very popular choice but
Luke why do people even buy these things
I mean your Android or iOS device can
display ebooks just fine so what's the
point well to understand the advantages
ink devices have it helps to know a
little bit about how they work a
standard black and white ink display is
made up of millions of very small
spheres called micro capsules and are
filled with black and white particles of
pigment suspended in a fluid white
particles carry a positive electrical
charge while black ones carry a negative
charge when you want to display
something like that copy of Fifty Shades
that you only read after everyone's gone
to bed your e-reader applies different
electrical fields to each micro capsule
which in turn makes either the white or
black particles rise to the top creating
text or an image
eReader z' can also apply different
charges to different sides of a single
micro capsule giving capsules a half
white half black or grey appearance
which can be very useful in increasing
resolution by giving the edges two
letters and other objects a smoother
look the nice thing about this ink
suspended in goop system is that once
the ink is pushed to the top it stays
there without needing any kind of power
input the display only draws power when
you have to change something on the
screen such as going to the next page
because simply leaving a page on the
screen while you're reading it uses no
power unlike an LCD display battery life
for readers is often measured in like
days or even weeks instead of hours the
downside to this of course is just like
with real paper you'll need some sort of
external light so you can actually
you to us on the page summary readers
like the popular Amazon Kindle
paperwhite have included built-in LED
lights for reading after dark which
works with a light guide to direct light
evenly across the screen so that it's
easy for your eyes and convenient but
also harder on your battery even so the
need for a light source is a worthwhile
trade-off for people who want easy
portability less eye strain than a
typical LCD screen and the same awesome
viewing angles you'd get from a
gas-station paperback and if you want to
do more than just read in black and
white there's even color II ink
technology that uses other color pigment
particles and additional electrodes or
color filters on top of the display
though it hasn't achieved widespread
adoption in the consumer market yet
thanks to its ability to hold images for
a long time without using electricity
electronic ink is starting to find its
application in other things other than
just ear eaters even flash drives with
external displays that are able to
display how much capacity is still left
inside
eing smart watches that don't need to be
charged nearly as often as an Apple
watch or say galaxy gear there are lots
of cool concepts that may become a
reality as well such as Ian's credit
cards that show your balance on the card
in real time and even large scale
displays that can even change the
appearance of walls or furniture pretty
cool maybe one day you'll have an
electronic ink couch that can display
scenes from your favorite comics but
quickly switch off when it's time to
bring a date over speaking of switching
quickly tunnel bear is a VPN that lets
you tunnel to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the Internet and
use online services as if you're in a
different country they have easy-to-use
apps for iOS Android PC and Mac and also
have a Chrome extension just choose the
country in the app turn tunnel bear on
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
when you turn tunnel bar on 2 things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
can show up as if you're in a different
country tunnel bear lets you bypass all
the annoying
sales that typically come by using a VPN
for personal use does no need to mess
around with port configurations DNS or
any of the other annoying setting tunnel

that for you like a tunnel bear wood and
