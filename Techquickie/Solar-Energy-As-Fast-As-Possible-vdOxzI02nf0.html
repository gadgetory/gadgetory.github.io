like love some super awesome computer
and powered it on for the first time
with that satisfying no no the other
noise that's better and thought to
yourself why is it that we are using
electricity produced by you know power
plants that are burning coal or nuclear
fission reactors what about the most
abundant source of energy on the planet
sunlight well me too and that's what
this video is about sunlight is
literally everywhere and keeps
everything on earth alive in one way or
another so it raises the question so why
has so little of our energy production
been from solar technology until
recently and what are the advancements
that are making solar useful for so much
more than calculators and those
funny-looking cars well first it helps
to know a little something about how we
actually convert sunlight into
electricity one way is with those big
solar panels made of lots of individual
photovoltaic cells which contain
semiconducting materials such as silicon
not silicon and when sunlight hits a
solar cell it knocks some of the
electrons in the silicon free which
causes an electrical current to flow big
solar power plants or farms take this
electricity and store it for later usage
not very efficient or send it directly
to the grid more efficient but still not
very efficient one that later
the other major solar technology is
called CSP or
concentrated solar power which is really
just a much bigger version of using a
magnifying glass to fry ants or whatever
other twisted stuff you did as a kid I
don't even want to know these power
plants work by using large mirrors or
lenses to focus sunlight really it is
just like that onto a series of tubes
not the internet other tubes actual
pipes that contain a special fluid that
can use the sun's heat energy to produce
steam that drives a turbine both
photovoltaics and CSP were very minor
players in the energy market around the
turn of the 21st century but since then
energy capacity from solar power has
I rocketed in 2013 the world produced
ten times as much energy from sunlight
as it did just five years prior and that
number should continue to grow in fact
the International Energy Agency has
projected that over 1/4 of the world's
electricity supply will be solar by 2050
but what's behind this huge solar
Renaissance well some of it has to do
with government policies and the state
of the energy market but there's also
been a lot of innovation in the actual
technology that's propelled solar to the
forefront one of the biggest challenges
since the advent of solar power has been
efficiency see I said I would talk about
this later
a solar plant can't just convert all the
light that hits it into useful
electricity some of it is reflected back
or lost as waste heat which has made
solar energy expensive I mean not to
mention the land it has to sit on and in
efficient for a long time so what we
need are cheaper more efficient
materials such as thin film cells which
are not only cheaper than traditional
silicon but are hundreds of times
thinner and now power some of the
largest solar farms in the world due to
their low cost there are also some other
more experimental materials in the works
that promise to push efficiency to
unprecedented heights in the year 2000
the most efficient solar cell in the
laboratory was rated at just above 30%
but in 2015 that number has risen to 46%
so while there's a long way to go before
we can run the entire world like one
gigantic calculator speaking of
calculators there are some amazing
private projects going on that allow you
to determine if your area is optimal for
solar panel installations on your roof
which can actually help you lower your
personal electricity bills even if it
you know doesn't do much for powering an
entire city the day might be coming
pretty soon when your gadgets can run
cleaner and cheaper even if you opted
for the you know deluxe Oh clothes dryer
that blacks out the whole neighborhood
every time you set it to a drying cycle
speaking of setting up drying cycles you
know what
Wow this Segway isn't gonna work okay
clearly that Segway wasn't gonna work so
