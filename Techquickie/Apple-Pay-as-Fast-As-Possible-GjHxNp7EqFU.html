place your finger on your phone and then
like wave it at payment terminals to buy
stuff it's basically magic just like
everything that they do but for folks
who want more than the
bippity-boppity-boo Harry Potter
explanation you might be asking
questions about exactly how all this
works and especially whether Apple's
claims with respect to transaction
security can be believed but let's start
with a brief rundown of how a regular
credit card transaction works whether
you swipe chip or wave financial
institutions apply to join a card
network like Visa or MasterCard putting
them in the business of issuing cards to
individuals and businesses and/or the
business of acquiring merchants or
stores to accept payments through the
network from the aforementioned
individuals and businesses when you use
your credit card your issuing Bank
receives the merchant ID card
information and transaction amount to
check for fraud then approve or decline
the transaction if it's approved the
money you just spent flows from your
account through a payment processor that
the ducks what is known as an
interchange fee usually in the
neighborhood of two percent for
card-present transactions and
significantly more when the card can't
be presented like online that is divvied
up between your bank or whoever your
credit card issuer is to cover the costs
associated with acquiring customers
fraud expenses and profit and then a
much smaller portion to the network like
MasterCard or Visa now let's look at how
Apple pay differs the NFC short-range
wireless communication technology is the
same as you'll find in millions of
plastic cards and Android phones already
worldwide but the back end is where
Apple has actually innovated here
instead of handing your card and ID to a
stranger in a random store effectively
giving personal information to the
cashier and financial information to the
merchant Apple authenticates your
personal information with your credit
card network once when you take a
picture of the card to get it for Apple
pay then they get a token called a
device account number that is tied to
your particular phone or watch and a key
generator that creates the single-use
security codes that are generated at the
time of each transaction to be sent back
to your issuer to decrypt and author
as your payment Apple sends this token
to the users phone that stores it in a
special secure memory and execution
environment called the secure element
and according to them once this is done
even they cannot retrieve the payment
details so that's how it works Apple
hasn't become a bank or anything and
they actually never even touch your
money or payment details during your
day-to-day transactions so what's in it
for them you might ask well unlike the
also NFC based Google Wallet which is
more of an open yeah you can join if you
want to whatever initiative from Google
Apple pay is the product of closed room
deals with the financial institutions
that reportedly entitles Apple to a
small cut of the interchange fee because
they again reportedly argued that easier
transactions will drive customers to pay
electronically rather than with cash
increasing the total interchange fee
bucket for everyone involved and they
also argue that fingerprint
authentication although it's far from
perfect will reduce fraud where
customers are using NFC enabled iPhones
or Apple watches paired to supported
devices to make payments meaning that
less of that interchange fee will be
used to reimburse well the victims of
fraud so this as fast as possible not
thorough as possible and while I did
mention Google Wallet in this video and
I did mention that it's also NFC based
there are some very significant
differences between it so let me know if
you guys would be interested in seeing a
standalone follow-up video that also
includes some information about the pros
and cons of Apple pay and Google Wallet
and then the upcoming currency so just a
general one about digital wallets love
to see your comments guys and speaking
of loving to see your comments so that
was an awkward segue I mean I've got a
haircut it's a completely different day
I'd probably look entirely different and
all that stuff but not nearly as awkward
as the thing that you're about to see
today sponsor is fractal design and they
have cooked up a humiliating thing for
me to do once again this is a banana
and I think you guys know what those are
for you're wrong yes what person
fertilizing doing firms to fulfill their
engine design no I guess that's it
laughter mmm wrong duct tape ruin this
alright guys thanks for watching like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you just like to leave a comment letting
me know if you have suggestions for
future episodes the fastest possible
just like this one and as always don't
forget to subscribe and Josh man really
