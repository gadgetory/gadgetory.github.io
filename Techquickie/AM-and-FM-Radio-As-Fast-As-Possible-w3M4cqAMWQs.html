though Spotify podcasts and other forms
of audio streaming seem to rule the day
there's just something comforting about
the simplicity of turning a knob on the
radio and listening to what's happening
on the airwaves even in the digital age
radio has maintained a fair amount of
popularity since the first public
broadcasts in the early 20th century but
since radio has been around since long
before we had things like digital
decoders that turn electrical impulses
into music how the heck do simple cheap
radios know how to convert an
electromagnetic radio signal into let's
say a basketball game or a weather
report or uh you know Justin Bieber's
greatest who put that crap in my script
anyway AM radio broadcast showed up the
four FM so we'll start with those an AM
station will broadcast a signal at a
constant frequency but will add the
sound wave representing the actual audio
to that base signal it's also called a
carrier wave resulting in the height or
amplitude of the wave changing
accordingly this is where the term AM
comes from as it stands for amplitude
modulation you can get your radio to
playback this signal as actual music or
dialogue by tuning it to whatever
frequency of the station that you're
looking for broadcasts at this makes
your antennae resonate at the frequency
and ignore everything else in the air so
very simple radio tuners are actually
little more than coils of wire how many
turns of the wire will determine what
frequency you're picking up cool right
the antenna actually creates an
electrical current that corresponds to
the radio signal this current is sent to
other parts of your radio that filter
out the irrelevant parts of the signal
and send it to your speakers or your
headphones as changes in voltage which
drive those speakers and produce sound
it's actually pretty remarkable that
this is all done without any
digital decoding by something like a a
CPU it's a completely analog process
that made it possible for news music and
entertainment to stream into homes
decades before the internet or even TV
FM broadcasting works somewhat similarly
though with FM it's the frequency of the
signal that gets changed
hence the F in FM FM radios have a
special transformer inside them that
basically sits idle as long as exactly
whatever frequency your tunes to hits
your antenna but once it detects a small
change in that frequency it outputs a
voltage that makes your speaker's emit a
certain sound so let's say you're tuned
to 99.5 fm on your dial
since FM works by using very small
changes in frequency to carry a signal
you are actually tuned to signals just
above and below 99.5 megahertz which
makes that transformer send the voltage
to your speakers now although this
process makes FM more complicated to
engineer than a.m. you often get a much
clearer higher-quality signal FN is less
susceptible to interference as well
because interference often manifests as
amplitude spikes and AM radio would see
these spikes as actual sounds to produce
and it would end up coming out of your
speakers while FM cares about variations
in frequency rather than amplitude so
when FM radio can just ignore that type
of interference and the death-metal
you're listening to will come out
sounding just as clear and angry as ever
FM also has the advantage of having much
higher bandwidth in a.m. due to the
mathematical properties of frequency
modulation this allows for lots of
wiggle room in the signal to create more
sounds more accurately making FM the
clear choice for music while AM is often
just fine for stuff where high fidelity
isn't a big deal such as talk radio but
if FM is so superior then why do AM
stations seem to have so much
better range well it's because a.m.
wavelengths are much longer meaning that
they can move more effectively following
even the curvature of the earth and deal
with obstacles like buildings whereas
you can quickly lose high frequency FM
signals if you start putting stuff in
the way a.m. frequencies also allow
signals to cause free electrons in the
ionosphere to oscillate at the same
frequency as the radio wave that hits
them meaning that AM signals can
actually reflect off the upper
atmosphere at night there are more free
electrons hanging out in the sky which
is why you can sometimes hear en
stations from hundreds of miles away
after the Sun Goes Down as opposed to FM
which tends to go right through the
atmosphere of course this may not seem
impressive when the Internet allows you
to listen to high-quality digital
broadcasts from the other side of a
world no problem but good old analog
radio still has the distinct advantage
of only requiring a ten-dollar receiver
with no subscription fees and very high
ease of use especially for people who
might not be terribly tech-savvy and of
course your radio will keep working even
if you're finicky internet connection
goes out sometimes simpler is indeed
better speaking of keeping things simple
fresh books fresh books is the
cloud-based accounting solution that
helps you you small business owner you
keep organized get more work done and
ultimately well make more money because
what fresh books does is it lets you
track your expenses by taking pictures
of your receipts track your hours on
particular jobs through the cloud
interface send bills to your customers
through the app itself and even take
payments from your customers via credit
card directly through fresh books with
all that stuff in one place whether
you're a plumber or a small-time
computer repair operator or you do I
don't know TV installations whatever it
is you're doing it allows you to spend
your time doing that instead of staring
at complicated accounting software at
the end of every day when your brain is
tired because you were working on other
stuff and you
just don't feel up to it the best part
is you can try fresh books for free for
