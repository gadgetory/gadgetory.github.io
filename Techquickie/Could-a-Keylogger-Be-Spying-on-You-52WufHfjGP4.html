the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos alright so
you're a privacy conscious individual
you've got to factor on all your
accounts you use a reputable VPN service
and you even watched our earlier episode
on what your ISP knows about you but
what if there was something lurking on
your computer itself that could spill
all of your secrets in spite of your
precautions I'm talking of course about
a keystroke logger or key logger a
nefarious type of program that does
exactly what it sounds like it logs
every button you press on your keyboard
and while sometimes these can be used
for legitimate purposes like parental
monitoring or language research they
also make it child's play to steal
passwords and search history or even spy
on emails to your significant other
yikes and because a key loggers
principle of operation is so simple
they're easy to code easy to deploy in a
wide variety of situations and easy to
hide once you get infected often by
clicking on a compromised link software
key loggers can live just about anywhere
operating inside a script on the webpage
itself
injecting themselves into the memory
space used by your programs to make them
hard to detect or even getting into the
code of your operating system itself as
a rootkit or by posing as a keyboard
driver by the way root kits are in
nefarious little bastards you can learn
more about those up here making matters
worse unless you can see the key logger
in the background or in your
notification tray or you're like
noticing obvious delays in the
keystrokes that aren't explained by
anything else it is really difficult to
know if you have one installed defeating
them can sometimes even require
specialized anti-malware software that
is designed to protect against logging
software so you might want to consider
that if you're really concerned that
someone might be spying on you and while
you're at it you might want to check the
back of your PC too fortunately these
are you
usually pretty easy to spot but hardware
keyloggers also exists often as a dongle
that sits between your keyboard cable
and the USB port on your computer
these can be especially troublesome in
settings where people might not be able
to see the back of the PC like in a
library or an office and depending on
how valuable your work is even that
might not be enough
there have been cases of hardware
keyloggers being embedded inside a
keyboard by a determined snoop and then
either retrieved wirelessly using a
transmitter or physically by going back
and digging it back out later it's also
even possible for key loggers to sniff
the sometimes unencrypted connection
between a wireless keyboard and the PC
to snatch keystrokes out of the air and
if we're not done yet
now this is some real James Bond level
stuff right here it's also possible to
record the sounds that you make as you
press each key and use the fact that
each key will sound slightly different
based on its position to reconstruct
what you typed then if that's not crazy
enough security researchers have found
that keyboards give off different
frequencies of radio waves when
different keys are pressed and can even
trigger smartphone accelerometers
strongly enough to discern different
keystrokes if it's sitting close enough
to your keyboard so I think all of this
is enough to make pretty much anyone
paranoid but I do have some good news
unless some spy agency is after you your
best bet is to just take a quick glance
at your cable every now and then if
you're using a PC in a shared
environment run good anti-malware
software and as always stay away from
shady links p.i a VPN supports multiple
protocols and encryption levels which
allows you to dial in the exact level of
protection that you need you can run it
on up to five devices at once and
they've got apps for Windows Mac Android
iOS
and even a Chrome extension with support
for more platforms coming soon they've
got lots of great features so in
addition to being able to bypass geo
restrictions and censorship by making
you appear as though you're connecting
from somewhere else you can also block
unwanted connections to prevent attacks
Auto block all traffic if the VPN
disconnects and it even includes Mase P
is built-in malware blocker so what are
you waiting for
check out P ia at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
like dislike check out our other
channels leave a comment and don't
forget to subscribe so you don't miss
any of our videos not one of them you
should watch every single one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
