to find out what speed your CPU or
graphics card runs that there's a bunch
of seemingly conflicting information
well the way processors work has changed
in amazing ways over the last couple of
decades but one of the most remarkable
things about modern micro processors
whatever we're talking about the ones
that go in your phone your PC or even in
a massive server is their ability to
dynamically deliver only the performance
that's needed at a given moment I'll
explain why they do this but first a bit
of history it didn't always work this
way when I was growing up a 486 TX 33
megahertz processor ran it
33 megahertz flash during it and if 33
megahertz was good enough for when it
was working hard then it was good enough
rone it was sitting around doing nothing
- and that was fine well a couple of
things were still true first is that
processors ran so cool that they just
needed tiny small thin heat sinks on the
more at worst a very small fan and
second is that the laptop mobile PC
revolution hadn't started yet and a
little extra power consumption is a
relatively small deal if you're not
trying to power something off of a
battery well that changed fast Intel and
AMD were locked in an arms race to see
who could create that fastest desktop
CPUs voltages and power were pumped up
and existing design architectures were
pushed to their limits all without
worrying too much about efficiency in
pursuit of the almighty gigahertz
barrier and beyond
to hell with cool and quiet I mean to
put this in perspective from 1996 to
2000 alone stop cooling went from
looking like this to looking like this
but that all came at a cost your power
bill aside more power consumption
produces waste heat and when a processor
runs hot all the time its lifespan is
reduced something had to be done but
what if you could run at benchmark
crushing high performance frequencies
when needed and turned down the juice
the rest of the time well that's exactly
what happened
intel speedstep was born all right light
it so that's a lot of preamble but why
does my cpu or graphics card have these
ambiguous specifications well because
while all this was happening a mobile
revolution was occurring and when you're
going to be running off of
battery power consumption sits in the
front seat and raw performance sits in
the back so the philosophies of the
processor makers changed and we stopped
getting massive leaps in single core
performance but computing demands also
didn't stand still so they needed a
different solution back to this graph a
lower clock processor core actually
consumes so much less power that you can
put more than one of them on a CPU
instead of a single high-performance
core for better overall performance and
optimized workloads multi-core
processors were born but some
applications don't benefit from these
additional cores and we still need to
crush single-threaded performance from
time to time and that's what a cpu with
Intel turbo boost does unlike speed
steps outright performance reduction it
actually redirects power from course
that aren't needed and sacrifices some
efficiency in the remaining core or
course to boost up the clock speeds to a
predetermined limit and that is what we
see when we look at CPU specifications a
nominal frequency that all course can
reach at the same time and an amped-up
boosted frequency that a single core can
reach as long as thermal and power
limits allow it when you need the extra
juice this type of dynamic power
on-demand design isn't unique to intel
either nvidia GPU boost boosts the
entire processor rather than redirecting
power from one part to another but
similarly looks for sufficiently low
power consumption and temperatures and
increase of performance on demand pretty
cool stuff eh speaking of pretty cool
my CPU when it's idle yeah sorry no
awkward segue today since our sales team
didn't manage to sell an add integration
on this video so that's all that's left
is for me to thank you guys for watching
pathetically beg you to like and share
the video or dislike it if you hate it I
think that's fine too and remind you to
subscribe if you haven't already see you
