tinkerer you can probably rattle off a
few different connectors and headers on
your motherboard in your freaking sleep
especially if you dream about RGB heat
sinks like I do but what about all those
other little tiny components for
instance the capacitors and resistors
that fill up all the extra space what
exactly do they do well a big part of
the reason you have so many electronic
components on your motherboards PCB is
that your computer parts like CPU
graphics card memory etc typically can't
use electricity directly from your power
supply for example most of those 650
watts or whatever your power supply
promises are delivered on the 12 volt
rail but imagine what would happen if
you put 12 volts through a modern CPU
which only needs like 1/10 of that to
run you'd fry it faster than an egg on a
hot radio a sidewalk so because
everything in your PC needs a very
specific amount of power your board has
lots of capacitors on it those are the
cylindrical looking things that poke out
of your motherboard like little tiny
water towers in a little miniature city
they even serve a somewhat similar
function to the affer mentioned water
towers they store energy then release it
in a controlled fashion you see the
power that comes into them doesn't flow
completely smoothly and has small
variances in voltage that could make it
useless or even damage your components
so these small capacitors clean up the
power and deliver the silky-smooth
constant voltage that your internal
electronics need and if you open up a
decent power supply make sure it's
unplugged first you'll probably find
some much larger capacitors that serve a
similar function keeping a constant DC
voltage for your computer and filtering
out noisy AC interference also called
ripple but although capacitors help to
clean up the power resistors do much of
the heavy lifting when it comes to
controlling what voltages your
components actually
as you can probably guess a resistor
resists the flow of current ensuring
that your components won't get so much
power that they'll be damaged although
many hobbyists who have worked with
simple circuits might be familiar with
resistors that look like this with
colored bands that indicate strength
measured in ohms most resistors on
modern motherboards are more understated
in appearance looking like little black
and silver rectangles okay then but what
about all those blocky things near my
CPU they don't look like capacitors or
resistors and okay well you'd be right
these are called chokes which and okay
don't get too excited there are a type
of inductor similar to how a capacitor
will smooth out voltage an inductor will
smooth out current important considering
how much power a typical desktop CPU can
draw you can learn more about CPU power
delivery right up here and speaking of
power delivery we would be remiss if we
didn't mention our old friend the
transistor you might know that there are
millions or even billions of tiny
transistors in your CPU and chipset that
act as logic switches that allow your
computer to function but there are
larger ones on your motherboard close to
the chokes that I mentioned earlier
called MOSFETs since transistors can
both change voltages and have logic
gates your MOSFETs and CPU actually talk
with each other to figure out the
correct amount of voltage to deliver to
the CPU at any given time then the
MOSFETs take the electricity from your
power supply adjust the voltage and pass
it through the chokes and on to your
processor so obviously the engineering
that goes into making all of these parts
work together properly is quite complex
but hopefully now you have a better idea
of why all those random bits on your
motherboard are even there and if not
you could always just buy one of those
newfangled boards with the nice-looking
shroud and RGB lights and forget
everything that I just said it's not
like you'll hurt John's feelings or and
you will a lot actually but it's okay
