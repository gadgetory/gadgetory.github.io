that program that for some reason even
retail copies of half-life 2 had to have
installed alongside but it has since
grown into the primary way that people
purchase games for their PCs with steam
sales now accounting for roughly 50 to
75 percent of the total PC gaming market
such a huge chunk that some have argued
that steams virtual monopoly on game
distribution could stifle competitive
innovation but no matter how you feel
about it there is no denying that Valve
has refined steam into a powerful
platform with a lot to offer Gabe Newell
and valve created steam more or less out
of necessity when they noticed that they
would be inundated with problems every
time they needed to update one or more
of their online games by creating a
platform with the ability to
automatically update games Valve
minimized the downtime that the gamers
would experience so that they could keep
playing without having to worry about
navigating to the developers website
download the latest patch to boo-boo-boo
hopefully it's up this time however
despite being the norm today valve
certainly made at least a few gamers
steaming mad by imposing online
authentication and DRM requirements to
play games especially since steam was
still pretty buggy around the time that
half-life 2 was released in 2004 often
buckling under the stress of heavy
traffic and crashing games as a result
but much like John Stamos steam just got
better with age and after they smoothed
out their client-server networking
architecture Valve's started making
agreements with third-party publishers
to diversify steams game catalog beyond
its own titles and as more and more
publishers began adopting the digital
distribution model the success and
profitability of Steam grew prompting
valve to roll out a host of new features
for the platform like cloud storage for
you to save your online profile
achievement lists to reward your
aiming instant messaging so you could
easily keep in contact with your gaming
friends and perhaps most notably the
addition of community based networking
groups I mean they turned it into a
freaking social network recognizing the
importance of its community Valve
launched steam greenlight in 2012 as a
way for users to help choose which games
were added to the service with
greenlight developers are able to submit
information about their projects
including early demos so users could
pledge their support for the games that
they want to see made available on Steam
sort of like your 6th grade science fair
only the winners get their projects
published on Steam instead of some
crappy school newsletter however for the
sets that greenlight seemed to be making
in the right direction there were
certainly some steps backwards and some
developers became notorious for
pandering to the community by offering
free copies of the game upon release in
exchange for thumbs up effectively
gaming the system valve has committed to
replace greenlight with something else
it's entirely user driven but given that
they've never been particularly speedy
about releases it still feels like we
could be waiting for that for some time
so then what else is in store for the
future of steam well thanks to a
partnership with HTC valve plans on
getting into VR in a big way recently
the HTC vive the first steam VR headset
was shown off with a handful of demos
including a level based on portals
Aperture Science lab there's also a huge
number of steam games that already have
the necessary code to work with the
other VR headsets like the oculus rift
and valve has said they'll be releasing
an open source API so that developers
can make their games and other
applications compatible with steam VR
and given that valve tends to couple new
technology releases with flagship game
releases maybe we can hope that the vive
will herald the coming of the
long-awaited but never confirmed not
even confirmed they were even really
working on it half-life 3 probably not
but you can go ahead and get your hopes
up anyway speaking of hope if you were
