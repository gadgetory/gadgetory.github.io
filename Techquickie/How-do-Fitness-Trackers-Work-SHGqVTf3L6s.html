and exercise plan is keeping track of
your daily activities in calorie burn
who am i kidding the hardest part is
obviously staying away from those
industrial sized boxes of donuts at
Krispy Kreme or Tim Hortons for our
Canadian viewers but even so keeping an
eye on your workout goals and nutrition
can be quite challenging which is why
companies have tried to capitalize on
the growing wearable market by selling
fitness trackers that you can take
anywhere and wear on your wrist these
are very versatile multi-purpose devices
that do everything from keep track of
what you're doing cardio telling you how
much fat you've burned off compared to
the last night's Big Mac and even warned
you to get the heck out of the Sun if
you're exercising outside for too long
so you don't end up looking like a
lobster so how does something that size
do this much stuff well inside your
average fitness tracker you'll find tons
of components some of which are standard
fare in smartphones such as
accelerometers that allow the tracker to
tell how many steps you're taking and a
GPS to track distances but unlike your
smartphone some fitness trackers
especially nicer ones have more advanced
motion sensors that are not only more
accurate but can use positional data to
determine exactly what exercise you're
doing that way it can remember exactly
which one you've done and track your
workouts automatically but what about
heart rate tracking this is important to
different people that want to get their
heart beating at a certain rate for
conditioning or weight loss some
trackers use light to figure out how
hard your heart is working they shine
light at your skin that's powerful
enough to light up your capillaries
those are the little blood vessels close
to the skin's surface and figure out how
much blood is flowing based on how much
light is reflected back higher-end
models even measure your skin's
electrical impedance which fluctuates
based on how fast your heart beats this
is the same tech used in those heart
rate monitors on gym treadmills as well
as those electronic fat percentage
meters that tell you how bad you should
feel about yourself additional sensors
measure everything from perspiration
levels to wrist movements in order to
track sleep patterns and give
recommendations as to how you can
improve your sleep habits so you have
enough energy to actually drag
self to the gym the next day as well as
special ultraviolet sensors that only
track UV light so your tracker won't
scream a sunburn warning at you just
because you've been sitting inside a
bright room but as cool as all this
sounds one key feature of many current
fitness trackers still has some room for
improvement calorie tracking real
calorimeters that can give you a precise
measurement of how many calories you've
burned are extremely expensive so
wearable trackers use user input data
like age weight sex along with the data
from motion and temperature sensors to
spit out an estimate although these
estimates can still give you a good idea
of your actual calorie burn they along
with many other fitness tracker metrics
that we have discussed especially stuff
like step counting should be taken with
a grain of salt especially as they can
vary quite a bit between different
models the good news though is that in a
recent study it was suggested that
fitness trackers tend to underestimate
how many calories you've burned so if
you're trying to burn as much as
possible maybe don't feel too bad about
that extra McDouble you ate in the
parking lot when you thought no one was
looking
