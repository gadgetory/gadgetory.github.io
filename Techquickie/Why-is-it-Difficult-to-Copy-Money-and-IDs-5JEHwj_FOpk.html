try a cigarette or a beer but we're a
few months or even years south of proper
it often wasn't all that hard to get
your friends cool older brother to make
you a fake driver's license that looked
close enough to the real thing to fool a
clerk and allow you to walk out of the
store contraband in hand in modern times
though governments and other
organizations have used technology to
finally start to seriously combat the
ancient practices of forgery and
counterfeiting not just to make sure
you're really of legal age but to
prevent serious crimes like human
trafficking and keep your money safe so
what are some of the things that make
documents like passports driver's
licenses credit cards and cash so hard
to forge these days let's start with
something that's usually pretty easy to
see the hologram because a hologram is
really a precise record of how light
diffracts off of an object at different
angles it's harder to produce than a
regular photograph you need lasers
lenses and special film making these a
popular security feature on ID cards
credit cards and passports but of course
Holograms can still be copied given the
right tools so these days you might also
see very fine engraving in the hologram
if you look closely enough which is even
more difficult to copy if you don't have
the same equipment that was originally
used to make it but what about the stuff
then that's a little less obvious and no
I'm not talking about the ignorant and
culturally offensive rumor that Canada
made it's hundred dollar bills that
smell like maple syrup no wait a minute
but rather the special inks that are
used for printing money or other
documents oftentimes governments can
defeat people that try to modify
passports illegally by printing them
with
thermally sensitive ink when the forger
tries to tamper with the passport a
process that often requires heat the ink
will change color letting officials know
that passport is no longer kosher
there are also inks that can be printed
in two-and-a-half dimensions so you can
actually feel a bump with your finger
ones that shift color depending on the
viewing angle this is a pretty neat
feature of the latest u.s. currency and
even ones that shine under a blacklight
you can learn more about that in this
video here but there's more to it than
just technology and owning the right
equipment sometimes the best defense can
be simply attention to detail have you
ever bought a Louis Vuitton purse that
has the LV logos cut off by a seam or an
iPhone with typos on the packaging well
the agencies that print money and ID's
can even outsmart counterfeiters through
similar means here's an example certain
fonts that they might use look simple or
unremarkable at first glance but might
have subtleties that make them very hard
to reproduce exactly
and many times they aren't fonts that
you can get from a Google search but
proprietary typefaces only used by a
certain country's government some of
which contain intentional imperfections
to throw counterfeiters off the more you
know of course many of us are using bank
or credit cards a heck of a lot more
than cash these days so stay tuned for a
follow-up episode on those newfangled
chip cards and how and why they're
harder to copy then those Meg stripes
that we're all used to swiping or if by
this point in the video your tinfoil hat
sense is tingling let me know in the
comments if you want to see a video
about exchanging things we know are
valuable like gold coins magic beans and
cows or maybe you can save me the
trouble by creating your own website

system with eggs chickens and cows as
currency and putting it up online with

of more mainstream stuff for your online
store then that'll work there cover
pages feed cover phages their cover

simple beautiful one-page online
