of doing stuff without actually having
to touch anything and while this sadly
doesn't work in all public bathrooms
it's become commonplace to do all sorts
of stuff like unlocking hotel rooms
traveling on subways entering our cars
and buying overpriced merchants theme
parks just by tapping something or being
near it but this is not Harry Potter
style magic folks it is all thanks to a
technology called RFID little chips that
somehow make everything smart at least
according to someone's marketing
department somewhere but how does RFID
even work I mean it's just a tiny chip
thing embedded inside a card right
where's the battery
well most RFID chips called tags not
that kind of tags actually don't need a
battery mind-blown right because they
draw power from whatever happens to be
reading them run-of-the-mill RFID tags
and credit cards and wristbands are
classified as passive and only consist
of a tiny antenna and embedded CPU to
process radio waves and a small amount
of data storage they're small and
low-power enough to just grab energy
from a powered chip reader making them
convenient enough to use just about
anywhere wait a second Linus anywhere
are we going to start seeing terabyte
sized RFID tags that can replace my
trusty mechanical hard drive well no to
keep power consumption low enough that
they can be powered by radio waves and
to keep costs down so we can put them
everywhere RFID tags hold only a few
kilo bytes of data which is fine because
in today's connected world you don't
need more than a few kilobytes of
storage for the RFID chip to be an
incredibly useful tool no but really
though along with the useful things that
can be done with a few kilobytes
paperless ticketing for events and Apple
pay which use NFC a two-way short-range
form of RFID come to mind thanks to many
RFID readers like your cell phone for
example having their own network
connections RFID
sar often simply used as pointers to
more information or more complex
functionality somewhere else
cool right entertainment venues offer
RFID kiosks to Auto check-in on Facebook
or Auto tweet that you're too lazy to
take your phone out of your pocket
cars have RFID tags that can help you
recover them if someone decides to jack
your ride casinos have RFID chips in
their chips to help people from pulling
in Ocean's eleven and you can even have
a tag attached to your dog to find him
if he decides to run away because you
spent all night playing counter-strike
and forgot to feed the poor soul and
because RFID is such a customizable
technology many uses for it have most
likely not even been fully realized yet
I mean imagine RFID tags replacing
barcodes on everything you purchase you
can just walk out of the store with all
your new stuff and an RFID scanner will
read your tags and credit card to
automatically bill you know checkout
lines required mind-blown again right I
mean there's even a number of projects
around smart dust RFID transmitters
about a cubic millimeter in size that
could do everything from analyze traffic
patterns after being mixed into asphalt
to keeping tabs on your stuff whenever
it's taken out of your home so you know
if it's been stolen to flowing through
your bloodstream to monitor the state of
your health I mean whoa hold on a second
there Linus let's just back this up what
if I don't want to eat RFID pixie dust
or have every single thing I buy track
that sounds like some kind of 1984
nightmare and yeah I hear that guys we
actually have some tough questions to
answer as a society about how much
privacy we want to trade for automation
and convenience which is the downside of
RFID technology and where it's heading
right now unless of course you're into
being watched speaking of watching watch
this here's a sponsorship spot with a
lynda.com membership you can watch
videos and learn from top experts who
are passionate about teaching what can
