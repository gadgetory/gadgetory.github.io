let you know when they are about to go
bad
like the vegetables in the back of your
fridge or that relationship that you
feel a little uneasy about well
fortunately most modern hard drives and
SSDs are smart enough to tell you if
they're at risk of dying with a tool
called self-monitoring analysis and
reporting technology or smart pun
intended you can think of smart a little
bit like those newfangled information
systems in modern cars just as they'll
let you know if your tire pressure is
low or if your engine is overheating
smart monitors a number of different
potential problem areas that could
indicate that your drive is about to
fail but why just disk drives why isn't
there smart like features for graphics
cards motherboards and even memory well
when these components fail you can
usually just replace them then chug
along as usual but when a disk drive
fails a common consequence is data loss
so if you don't have a backup all those
family photos and saved games might be
gone for good so how does smart know
when your drive might be on its last
legs well smart can keep track of over
80 different attributes that tie into
drive reliability everything from how
long it takes your drive to spin up
that's zero to 7200 rpm to readwrite
errors vibration levels temperature data
throughput how many bad sectors have
been relocated to elsewhere on the disk
uncorrectable errors we're leveling and
right cycles if you have an SSD and lots
more well that sounds great Luke but how
do I even know if smart is saying
anything about my drive the packaging
didn't even say anything about smart at
all and I can't find anything anywhere
in Windows well windows actually does
have rudimentary smart support baked in
to check it out open up a command prompt
window and type these commands if it
says status
okay then Smart hasn't detected any
problems but if there are any issues
you'll get a different message there
also plenty of both free and paid
third-party disk utilities with smart
support that are not only more user
friendly but can give you a lot more
detail as well as real time warnings as
soon as smart thinks something is amiss
but for all the things that smart can
keep track of it still isn't perfect a
recent study from the cloud storage
concern Backblaze found that failed
drives showed a smart error in one of
five crucial attributes only 77% of the
time and while that isn't a low number
by any means it does show that there's a
significant possibility that smart might
not alert you if your drive is in fact
dying that doesn't mean that smart is
useless but it does mean that you should
pay attention and be alert to your drive
behaving in any weird ways whether you
suddenly start getting disk errors or
the drive starts making disconcerning
noises so basically you should be using
smart in addition to your own vigilance
but if smart does find something you'll
probably want to make sure that you have
some kind of backup right away as 23% of
the failed drives that did indicate
errors in back Blaze's study only
reported one error before they went
kaput so have a contingency plan in
place it's the smart thing to do
