plot means that you are the son or
daughter of some rich person and the
only way to get out of it is by paying
tons of money or waiting for
Arnold Schwarzenegger Kurt Russell to
come and rescue at least that's what TV
would have us believe these days being
held for ransom can actually happen
quite differently with your computer of
all things I'm talking of course about
ransomware a particularly diabolical
type of malware that is to say bad
software that's been making headlines
recently so here's how it works
once ransomware gets on your computer
usually through an infected email
attachment or the all-too-common Trojan
horse attack it will lock your computer
or your data in some way and demand
payment in exchange for giving control
of your system back to you some of the
simpler forms of ransomware will simply
try to fool you into thinking there's
something wrong with your computer and
get you to pay money to fix it a common
tactic that we see in those banner ads
that tell you that you've been
inexplicably infected by something now
oftentimes with those you've probably
got at least rudimentary control over
your system still so the only real issue
is that you have to deal with these
constant popups until you find a way to
get rid of the malware a much more
irritating kind of ransomware will lock
your computer entirely and keep you from
logging into your operating system
unless you cough up the money
many of these varieties of ransomware
will display a threatening message
purporting to be from the FBI or some
other super hardcore police agency
saying that your computer was used for
something highly illegal but you can get
your computer back and avoid doing hard
time just by paying a few hundred
dollars sounds absurd right but people
have fallen victim to this and even if
you recognize the scan immediately those
ones can be a real pain to remove worst
of all is the ransomware that not only
locks your system but also encrypts your
files and won't provide you with the
keys to decrypt them unless you pay up
the most notable of these being
cryptolocker although many other
erienne's have popped up since that one
first made the news back in 2013
some other issues with these
unsurprisingly cyber criminals aren't
exactly the most trustworthy folks and
many people have reported not getting
their files back even after paying the
ransom and on top of that there are some
kinds of ransomware that don't even ask
permission they just hit your Bitcoin
wallet and take the money without even
giving you a chance to say well hold on
let me think about whether this data is
actually worth paying for
so then how can you rescue your computer
and protect your cash if you get
infected many of the non encrypting
types of ransomware can be removed by
booting into safe mode and running an
up-to-date anti-malware tool or if that
fails downloading a bootable removal
tool to a flash drive and running that
however if you've been hit by an
encrypting variety of ransomware you're
not going to want to hear this but
you're probably out of luck as most of
these use a very strong encryption
algorithms in fact the FBI is the real
one has advised people to just pay these
ransoms in the past so if you don't like
the idea of your money going to online
criminals backup your data
somewhere preferably offline and
remember please to explain to your
grandparents what a banner ad is if they
call you in a panic over having 50
viruses on their all-in-one PC speaking
