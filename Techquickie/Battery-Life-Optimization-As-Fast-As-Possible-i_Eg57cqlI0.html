through your day only to find that your
precious connection to the outside world
is dwindling away you're down to a
frightening 10 percent battery the
batteries that power our phones tablets
computers and other electronics are
bound to lose their edge as time takes
its toll but before you pull out your
lifeline of power cords that you keep
stashed away let's take a look at what
we can do to assist our lithium ion
cloud soldiers in their daily struggle
just like a car your device can become
weighed down by excessive tasks the more
you have running the faster you'll run
out of battery similar to how a car
hauling around tons of junk will run out
of gas more quickly however if you can't
afford to dump the body hiding in your
trunk there might be weight elsewhere
that you could lose let's take a look at
some of the key contributors beyond
obvious things like screen brightness
background data flow that constantly
pushes updates to your phone for apps
like Facebook Twitter and your favorite
email client are notorious for taking a
toll on your battery even worse can be
if your phone is searching for cellular
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals as your phone
is chewing through battery trying to
find a network to latch on to and if you
use a mobile device as a navigational
aid good luck trying to keep it from
draining faster than a pool at the end
of the freaking summer as GPS requires
your phone to constantly refresh its
location which you can learn about more
in this video so how can you keep your
battery afloat without avoiding doing
the stuff that actually makes your
device useful well one of the most
easiest things to do is to close
programs that you don't need running use
a process tab and task manager on a
Windows PC or the running apps tab under
settings and apps on most Android phones
to see what processes are using the most
resources and don't forget about double
tap to force quit on iOS often devices
are loaded down with bloatware installed
by the manufacturer whose usefulness is
questionable at best and often do
nothing except for suck power and be
annoying so try and stop it from running
or better yet uninstall the bloatware
completely if you can't also be sure to
turn off your Wi-Fi if you're in an area
without fast hotspots and you can just
use your cellular connection and disable
location tracking on GPS enabled devices
if you won't be using them
but on the flipside if Wi-Fi is an
option to stay connected wherever you
are I suggest using that over your cell
network as Wi-Fi is actually usually
easier on your battery and some carriers
even feature Wi-Fi calling which can be
especially useful if your cell signal
isn't great also the constant needing to
remember to turn your Wi-Fi back on
which can be problematic but Luke you
say this sounds incredibly tedious there
must be an easier way of course well it
would be difficult to get a second gas
tank for your cards becoming easier and
cheaper to get an external battery bank
which can charge your devices as they
drain themselves this way you can make
it out to the desert to bury your cargo
that we're talking about earlier but
never mind that without stopping for gas
or battery in this case and don't forget
that there are ways to maintain the
long-term life of your battery so be
sure to check out our separate video on
rechargeable battery care up here
speaking of that thing in your trunk
mass drop is another one of their pretty
killer deals going on today the cloud
twos from our friends over at HyperX are
available for the low price of $69.99
USD we've highlighted these headphones a
few times on our coverage of events like
packs but the bottom line is that they
deliver a solid sound they're very
comfortable for most listeners and
they're affordable of course this
product is available only through mass
drop at this significantly discounted
price thanks to their group by model
essentially the more people that buy the
more the price goes down to a set
minimum you can check out this drop and
many others like it in the link in the
description DRO PS / tech quickie so
head over there if you're interested and
that link doesn't actually give us a
kickback or anything but it does does
let them know that we sent you alright

like or dislike the video depending on
whether or not you liked it don't forget
