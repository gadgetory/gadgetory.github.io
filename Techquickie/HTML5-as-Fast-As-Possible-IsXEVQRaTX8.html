language that web pages are written in
so just as a computer program executes
code written in C++ or some other
programming language a web browser will
take HTML and translate it so you end up
with a nice shiny web page on your
monitor or tablet
the last major revision of HTML version
4 came out in 1997 but since then annual
internet traffic has increased by many
thousands of times so we've been long
overdue for an update to the language
that is the backbone of nearly
everything you do online when HTML 4
made its debut most web pages had much
simpler layouts and consisted mainly of
static images gifs and text interactive
elements required plugins such as
shockwave or Java and high quality
streaming video or audio was unheard of
as such HTML 4 didn't have or need
native support for a lot of the things
that we now take for granted and then
for a long time nothing changed well
after sites like YouTube went mainstream
and watching TV or listening to music
online became the norm rather than the
domain of a few computer enthusiasts in
their basement somewhere most web
browsers still relied on plugins and
other resource hogging elements to
properly handle this new content and
this was never more evident than when
the Apple iPhone showed up dominated the
smartphone market then thanks to its
browsers complete lack of support for
flash it couldn't even access many of
the fancy-looking interactive web sites
of the time the issue was that flash is
a closed standard owned by Adobe and
required extra processing power on a
mobile device like an iPhone
resource-intensive standards like flash
can seriously cut into battery life
Apple openly criticized flash and other
developers agreed that they needed an
open-source standard that they could
build modern websites around enter html5
the first draft was published back in
2008 with the final version having been
released only a few months ago in
October 2014 html5 was devised with two
things in mind one the prevalence of
streaming and interactive elements on
modern web and to the fact that so many
people rely on mobile devices these days
instead of the more traditional desktops
and laptops possibly the biggest change
is dedicated video and audio tags these
tags allow html5 supporting browsers to
play common video formats natively this
makes things easier on both web
developers who don't have to rely on
third-party programming interfaces
nearly as much to build web pages as
well as on users who will be able to
stream music and video with less of a
performance hit and less battery drain
html5 offers more than just streaming
enhancements though browsers that
support html5 will have better support
for vector graphics which are commonly
used for images other than photographs
vector graphics can be resized without
losing any quality making their use
increasingly popular in modern websites
that are designed to be displayed
correctly on everything from your phone
all the way to your TV html5 will also
offer better support for things like
drag-and-drop an online document or even
video editing which is increasingly
important as we continue to do more and
more things through a web browser like
photo sharing an online file storage so
as you're traveling around the web and
trying to find ways to earn cheap karma
on reddit or whatever else it is you're
doing pay attention to subtle changes in
your browser and see if you can notice
whether you can do more with less
hardware of course you might just not do
that and spend more time actually
enjoying your stupid gifs or whatever
else it is on the web and noticing less
and less on the technical side which is
of course what html5 was actually
designed for you to do speaking of
noticing things online you might have
