actually no pun intended in the last 200
years we've gone from horse-drawn
carriages to trains to cars to
commercial flight saying you halfway
around the world in less than a day's
time but we've always dreamed of faster
ways to get around and one such mode of
transportation is in the works thanks to
Hyperloop the Hyperloop could even
outstrip Jets without requiring you to
leave the freakin ground which is
awesome you see the Hyperloop
superficially resembles a train or a
monorail but can actually go much faster
thanks to the elimination of most
sources of friction the same force that
slows your car down when you apply the
brakes if you didn't know that some high
speed trains like the Shanghai maglev in
China that can reach nearly 270 miles
per hour reduce friction by using
magnets to make them levitate above the
rail so it's not actually touching
anything the Hyperloop however goes one
step further by placing capsules inside
of a tube which is a partial vacuum so
there's much less air to push against
the vehicle on top of this the capsules
are suspended in midair by air Castor's
similar to how pucks on an air hockey
table are able to float around
although the Hyperloop does use linear
induction motors which are magnetic to
accelerate and decelerate the vehicle
the air Castor's are a much cheaper
simpler and longer-lasting way to keep
it floating in mid-air and finally the
Hyperloop vehicle itself contains an air
compressor near the front to intake
excess air in the tube and exhaust it
out the back because the excess air
would otherwise cause air resistance or
drag that would slow the vehicle down
the compressor is necessary to remove
this air and make sure the Hyperloop can
attain its top speed and speaking of top
speed when you put all of this together
you have a system that is theoretically
capable of going 760 miles per hour just
below the speed of sound that's fast
enough to get you from Los Angeles to
San Francisco in just 35 minutes which
is twice as fast as the typical
commercial flight between those cities
and obviously way faster than sitting on
the 101 during rush
our okay sounds amazing where can i buy
my ticket so that I don't have to give
any more money away to the airlines that
won't even give me a free freaking bag
of peanuts anymore well unfortunately
the Hyperloop is still just a concept
but the good news is that since it was
first proposed in 2012 by Elon Musk
there has been some real traction okay
that was a pun with trying to get the
Hyperloop system built one of Musk's
many successful companies has made the
technology behind the Hyperloop
open-source so that other companies and
institutions are welcome to develop and
improve upon the Hyperloop idea a test
facility with a short run of Hyperloop
track is planned in Nevada and Slovakia
is currently exploring building a
Hyperloop in its capital Bratislava
but as with any new extremely exciting
technology there are challenges to be
worked out such as the stresses it might
put on the human body quick changes in
velocity such as when the Hyperloop
speeds up slows down or has to go over
hills might put forces on passengers
that might make things a little
uncomfortable especially if they have to
get up to use to the bathroom yeah plus
since most proposals have the Hyperloop
sitting on pillars above the ground
engineers would need to make sure it
could stay safe in the event of
something like an earthquake because a
bump going at 700 and something miles an
hour is gonna feel pretty rough still
though the technology is being heavily
explored by multiple governments
companies and universities worldwide so
a future where we're all being shot
through tubes that nearly Mach one might
be closer than you think
no word yet though on whether they'll
let you order overpriced steak and wine
on board so you can feel like a VIP like
those excessively expensive business
class tickets oh my god
freshbooks is on a mission to make
freelancers less stressed and more
organized through their easy-to-use tool
for crafting and sending professional
invoices in seconds fresh books also
helps you track your hours so when it
comes time to create set invoice you
know exactly what you did
when you did it who you did it for all
that kind of stuff you can even accept
deposits through their platform so your
work is paid for on your schedule they
also have a tool to manage your expense
reports their mobile app lets you take a
picture of your receipts and just you
know pretty much does the rest of it
which is great getting started on fresh
books is extremely simple even if you're
not a numbers person they even say
especially if you're not a numbers
person you can try fresh books free for
30 days by going to fresh books calm
forward slash tech quickie and entering
tech wiki and how did you hear about a
section Thank You Dennis for making that
very loud noise I will accept a deposit
from Dennis for his disturbance of this
tech okie episode if you liked Dennis's
very loud noise like the video if you
disliked Dennis's very loud noise feel
free to dislike the video if you want to
see a channel super fun which probably
also has Dennis making very loud noises
click I don't know where Dennis will
figure that out
I'm not redoing this man I'm still going
subscribe if you want to see more of
Dennis making loud noises and thank you
for listening to Dennis make loud noises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
