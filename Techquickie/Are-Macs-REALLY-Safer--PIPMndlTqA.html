perception that machs are indeed safer
than windows-based pcs with Apple even
going as far as to create ads saying max
don't get PC viruses implying that
you're putting your data at much greater
risk if you aren't on the Mac platform
but how much truth is there to this
claim well around the 2012-2013
timeframe it was estimated that about
one third of the world's computers were
infected with some sort of malware and
when you look at only Macs
that number was less than 3% well since
numbers don't lie
Mac's must be safer end a video all done
now right well it depends on what
exactly you mean by safer you see while
it's true that there are fewer threats
out there designed to attack Mac's
compared to Windows PCs the reason for
that might not be what you think
worldwide just over three-quarters of
desktop computers run some variant of
Microsoft Windows with Mac OS 10 a very
distant second at just over 12 percent
market share that means that the simple
truth is that blackhat hackers and cyber
criminals see more value in targeting
Windows it's kind of like how you're
more likely to see a pickpocket
operating in the tourist district of a
large city compared to in a small town
in the middle of nowhere and if you go
back to the Apple claim that max don't
get PC viruses it's not hard to figure
out that while it is technically true it
was clearly designed to mislead while
Windows and Mac OS are very different
operating systems in terms of their
underlying code with modern versions of
Windows based on the Windows NT kernel
and Mac OS instead based on UNIX there
actually isn't anything about Mac OS
that makes it inherently more secure
instead the differences between Windows
and Mac OS mean that while malware often
has to be coded separately for each
platform a Mac isn't necessarily more
difficult to attack or
less vulnerable than a Windows PC so
saying that max don't get PC viruses is
about as useful as getting a message on
a dating app from someone telling you
that they simply can't catch diseases
that only affect cows which should
somehow make them more appealing but at
the end of the day does it matter why
fewer viruses that can infect you exist
I mean maybe you should switch to a Mac
and reduce your odds of getting a
malware infection simply by playing the
numbers well there's actually a
legitimate argument to be made there but
here's the thing
using a safer platform is no excuse to
drop your guard while it is true that
there are fewer exploits out there for
Mac it's actually much more common these
days for the bad guys to steal your data
by employing social engineering anyway
social engineering includes tactics like
phishing attacks that are designed to
trick you into giving up your
information through compromised websites
such strategies are independent of what
platform you're using so simply by
paying attention and not clicking on
suspect links or downloading
questionable files you're likely to
avoid the worst of the malware out there
regardless of whether you're a PC or a
Mac it also helps that both Microsoft
and Apple have developed pretty
comprehensive ways of securing users
systems and while neither of them is by
any means perfect both companies invest
plenty of resources into finding and
patching vulnerabilities usually in a
pretty timely manner so the bottom line
is that if those are your two options
exercising some caution with how you use
your machine and ensuring that you have
a good anti-malware solution installed
is far more likely to be helpful than
simply choosing a Mac just because there
isn't as much Mac specific malware out
in the wild and of course if you're
really paranoid you can always just
migrate to a system that doesn't allow
you to download any programs that aren't
part of a vetted app store like a
Chromebook it's just that if you do you
might have to give up pirating your
favorite games you renegade you speaking
of giving up
