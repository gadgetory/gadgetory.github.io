got him great kid I feel the force it
came from behind but seriously guys this
episodes about microphones for your
computer's so number one is the mics
that are included with headsets first
we've got inline mics these set pretty
far away from your mouth and can't be
easily repositioned so you only really
use them in a pinch next up we've got
removable microphones so these are
headsets where the mic can be attached
to it or simply by popping it off you
don't have to have a microphone if you
don't want to next up we've got boom
mics and it's all about lowering the
boom when you want to be heard they're
often adjustable in terms of where they
sit but length can't usually be adjusted
on boom microphones and last but not
least where I feel is the best
compromise is the retractable make this
is great because the optimal position
for a mic is right at the corner of your
mouth and not everyone's head is shaped
the same so with a retractable mic you
can pull it out further pull it out less
or tuck it away completely if you don't
want to use it now bear in mind guys
when you're shopping for a headset with
a mic find one that's noise cancelling
and find the one that is high quality
generally speaking gaming headsets will
come with better microphones than
general communication headsets unless
they're very high-end ones desktop
microphones are another great option
cheap desktop microphones and not so
much they don't tend to have noise
cancellation and because they have to be
positioned further away from the gamer
often they have trouble picking up your
voice very clearly with that said high
quality options like the blue snowball
or even premium recording grade
microphones hooked up through
sophisticated equipment into your
computer can offer some of the best
available voice quality without the
inconvenience of having to buy a headset
or having to have something mounted that
you have to move around and fuss with
all the time attached microphones are
another option these offer the
flexibility of being able to use
whatever headphones you want not having
to worry about whether it has an
integrated mic and not having to have
yet another thing on your desks so many
people use that zalman clip-on mic
however that has the same disadvantages
as an inline mic but there's a new game
in
town the mod Mike uses a magnet to mount
directly to the side of whatever
headphones you have there's a little
mounting piece that sticks on with
double-sided tape and it's a high
quality microphone option with noise
cancellation for folks who want to use a
high quality headphone as opposed to a
gaming headset for their music and
movies and want to get the best of both
worlds thank you for checking out this
tech quickie fast as possible on
microphones for your computer as always
