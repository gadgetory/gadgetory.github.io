and rearranging multiple clips or
segments of video to create a new and
presumably improved video and for folks
in the advanced class it can also
involve the adding of titles animations
sound effects music and more but how did
it all begin well it sort of started
when a photographer named Eadweard
Muybridge may bridge we bridge
apparently they didn't have normal
spelling back in 1872 anyway he took a
series of still photographs that proved
once and for all that horses take all
four feet off the ground while galloping
finally settling one of the great
debates of the time we bridge went on to
take more than 100,000 photographs of
people and animals in motion which he
displayed in books and lectures and he
even invented a device to display them
called a Zoopraxiscope that projected
these images rapidly in sequence onto a
screen making the Zoopraxiscope
effectively the very first animated gifs
projector from there the methods of
capturing these so-called moving
pictures and replaying them only
continue to improve in the late 1800s
the film camera was invented which used
a long strip of photographic negatives
called film stock and rapidly exposed
one image at a time in sequence these
images could then be played back rapidly
to create the illusion of motion through
the use of a projector which was
basically just a film camera in Reverse
early films or movies as they came to be
called were very similar to stage plays
the film camera was kept in a wide
stationary shot and all the action took
place over just one continuous shot and
just like in a live stage production the
audience was free to look at any part of
the scene that they wanted to later
artists like Georges méliès began to
realize that there was no need to replay
the film at the exact same time and
speed and in the same sequence
that it was recorded he began to
experiment with jumping forward in time
to make objects appear and disappear
soon it was discovered that putting two
shots next to each other in sequence
would create a logical connection
between those shots in the viewers mind
which is called juxtaposition and so
instead of recording an entire movie in
strict chronological order it was
discovered that scenes could be filmed
at different times and in different
locations and then combined together
later in the process that became known
as editing this was initially done by
physically cutting apart the celluloid
film stock and then splicing it together
with another piece of film stock that is
until the invention and eventual
widespread adoption of television and
video in 1948 now to be clear the terms
film and video are often used
interchangeably nowadays but make no
mistake they are not the same thing
unlike film video is an electronic
signal a video camera will convert the
image that it sees into a fancy
modulating electronic signal this signal
can then be interpreted back into an
image by a CRT television set I mean
back in the days and even amplified and
broadcast as a television signal to be
read by TVs across the country fun fact
by the way because there was no way to
record these signals for later playback
until the invention of videotape in 1951
early television broadcasts had to be
watched at the time they were being
broadcast now the exact method of
accomplishing this recording is very
science and technical but that's a
subject for another day the important
thing to know is that videotape can be
erased and reused to record an entirely
new video and film stock cannot once
it's exposed it's done what you probably
don't know is that it was possible to
cut and splice videotape in the same way
that film stock could be cut and spliced
however these cuts had to be done using
a microscope because they needed to be
extremely
so they wouldn't ruin the video signal
this was a huge pain in the neck
figuratively and probably literally and
so not much video editing was really
done this way later advancements in
videotape technology allowed for
machines that could pause play and
record from one videotape to another
without the need to physically cut the
tape this allowed for fully electronic
editing which was easier faster and less
error-prone and that's actually how
video was done for decades until well
into the computer age now some work was
done going back to the 70s on digital
video storage and editing using
mainframe computers and hard drives
packs the size of washing machines but
it wasn't until 1989 when the avid one
fully digital NLE that is a
computer-based nonlinear editing system
was released that it finally became for
real and while the avid one had some
initial limitations resolution frame
rate and content length being among them
it improved rapidly and ushered in the
modern age of completely digital video
editing with binary strings of zeros and
ones stored on hard drives or today even
SSDs at full quality for real-time
editing and output so today in 2015
avid is still around and better than
ever but there are plenty of other
nonlinear video editing software tools
as well at minus media group we use
premier and it's fine mostly and these
digital NLEs allow for video to be
edited faster and less expensively than
ever before without compromising quality
speaking of doing things without
compromising quality video blocks excuse
me
video blocks provides affordable premium
stock video and they've been doing it
since 2011 they operate on a
subscription-based unlimited library
service model and they add new footage
to the library twice per month it
includes over 10 million dollars worth
of footage After Effects templates and
motion background
and everything in videoblocks is
unlimited library is 100% royalty-free
and yours to use for both personal and
commercial projects and they recently
launched new Members Only video
marketplace this is actually pretty cool
clips from contributors around the world
are available only to videoblocks
subscribers so contributors on that
marketplace actually keep a hundred
percent of all sales as commission and
video plucks takes no cut
since the marketplace is members only
and they're already taking the
subscription revenue from everyone so
everybody's everybody's happy there's
already 1,500 plus artists with more
than 200,000 new clips in the few months
since the marketplace launched so if all
that sounds pretty darn good you're
seeing they're gone well gee Linus that
sounds great except it probably cost
like $10,000 a year
no there's good news for you access to
the marketplace the library comes at
only $99 per year and if you use our
link which you can find in the
description box below and if you sign up
during the month of December so do it
quickly
you'll get one year video blocks for
only $49 a savings of 50 bucks so to put
that into context one clip of stock
footage similar to those found on video
blocks is worth like 50 bucks so if you
use the service once you paid for itself
or get paid for itself you paid for it
well you did pay for it anyway you get
my point
all right so thanks for watching guys if
you like this video hit the like button
if you disliked it I'll hit the dislike
button I guess um what else do we have
right leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future fast as possible
and don't forget to get subscribed so
you don't miss any of our future videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
