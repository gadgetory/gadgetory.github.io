supports peer-to-peer file sharing to
distribute large amounts of data around
the world it was developed by Bram Cohen
a computer science graduate student at
the University of Buffalo essentially
BitTorrent takes the stress of
transferring large data files from one
massive server to every user over an
extremely robust network connection and
splits it up to multiple normal pcs and
multiple smaller network connections
cool hey I mean it's not magic though
the first time a file is shared
there is a single seed or user who is
uploading the file to the first
downloader so a torrent will always be
relatively slow when it's just been
created however once that original
upload slash download process completes
the user or users who downloaded the
file also known as peers from the
original seed also turn into seeds and
then the more popular file is the more
seeds are created and the faster the
speed will be for newcomers that is the
beauty of peer-to-peer file sharing it
allows the cost and burden of uploading
data to be easily distributed amongst
hundreds or even thousands of
individuals a great example of torrent
technology use in the real world is game
patch file distribution for World of
Tanks are free to play online game when
users opt to use a torrent for the
update wargaming.net and their players
are happy because they save money on
bandwidth so they can spend more on
improving the game and adding new
content and ISPs are happy because the
load caused by uploading a patch to
thousands of users all at once is split
across many regions reducing the chance
of network congestion
okay Linus so then why haven't direct
downloads been made obsolete by p2p
actually there are some good reasons for
that first is that they're slower for
small files and less convenient for
inexperienced users a torrent download
takes a while to ramp up to full speed
and requires a third-party manager
software like micro torrent in order to
function
second is that with entirely
community-driven p2p the file creator
doesn't have direct control over the
network download speeds depend on the
number of other peers who are already
downloading the number of seeds
uploading and the aggregated upload
speed of all the seeds and while you can
make an
educated guess about the health of a
torrent based on how many seeds and
peers are present at a given moment if
every seed for a file is running on
dial-up or you want an obscure file that
doesn't have any seeds at all you could
wait weeks or even months if it ever
completes third up is leechers however
healthy a torte might appear to be you
have to watch out for leechers in theory
every peer can begin sharing partial
files with other peers as soon as their
download begins
so even folks who don't have the full
file yet are strengthening the network
but leechers the scumbags of p2p sharing
will intentionally throttle their upload
speeds then stick around as a peer just
long enough to fully download the file
and then close off their torrent so they
don't have to use their upload cap to
help out other peers now if a creator is
willing to pay for dedicated seeds these
issues go away but in that case they
might as well offer their users the
convenience of a one-click direct
download anyway ok so it's not perfect
but it is still really cool so then why
does the word torrent carry such
negativity well just like big data our
video about what you can watch here
torrents get their bad name from
companies and users who use them
unethically in this case usually by
sharing copyrighted material like music
and movies so that's it there's nothing
inherently bad about BitTorrent and
other p2p file-sharing services it's a
great technology that continues to
mature and develop C BitTorrent sync a
cool replacement for cloud-based backups
like Dropbox for example and it's only
got a bad name because of some folks who
have misused it for personal gain
speaking of personal gain you can gain a
lot of personal knowledge from today's
episode sponsor lynda.com may have
thousands of video courses that teach
you about photography programming
business you name it you can take a page
from turns book one of our employees
here and even jumpstart your career with
lynda.com he got his start in Adobe
through them and now he has an awesome
job at least I think it's awesome
working here at Linus Media Group you
can take each course at your own pace so
you can fit lynda.com into your schedule
no matter how busy you are plans start
at a very reasonable twenty-five dollars
a month which is an absolute steal for
the amount of information you can get
but if you want to try out Lynda
for free before just buying into what I
said about how great it is they're
offering a 7-day trial to all tech
quickie viewers head over to lynda.com
slash tech quickie to check that out
guys like this video if you liked it
just like it if you just liked it leave
a comment if you have suggestions for a
future class apocalypse Allah thank you
for watching and as always don't forget
