promo com are you still using an old
membrane keyboard do you want a more
satisfying typing and gaming experience
look into a mechanical keyboard we're
going to walk you through as fast as
possible the various types of key switch
types that are available on common
mechanical keyboards not all mechanical
switches have that distinct clicking
noise to them this is a cherry MX red
switch which has a linear press and non
tactile feel so you can't actually feel
the actuation point and it is a very
light button press so you don't have to
press hard on the keyboard Cherry MX
black switches are like a heavier
version of Reds so you can't quite feel
the actuation point but they do get
slightly heavier as you press down and
reach the bottom of the keystroke
speaking of bottoming out that's part of
what makes typing on a membrane keyboard
fatiguing you have to go all the way
down to activate it and have the letter
you're typing appear on the screen
browns are the first which we're showing
you they're a little bit lighter than
blues where there is an activation bump
you can feel it so all MX switches go
for millimeters all the way down and two
millimeters to the actuation point but
on a brown you can really feel that spot
so that's where you get that tactile
feedback in your fingers so you know
that you've activated the button and you
don't actually have to press it all the
way down Cherry MX blue switches are the
ones that most people will think of when
they think of mechanical keyboards
because they have that distinctive
clicky sound they're a little bit
heavier to press than Browns and you can
really feel the actuation point as well
as hearing that satisfying mechanical
