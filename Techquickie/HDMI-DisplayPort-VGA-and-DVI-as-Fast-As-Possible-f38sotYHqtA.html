from a DVD player computer game console
or other video source to a display such
as a TV or monitor that we need to
connect them in some way but the pros
and cons of the various cable standards
can be extremely confusing even for
techies let's start with good
old-fashioned VGA or d-sub it's usually
got a blue plug on the cable and stays
in place with screws on either side of
the housing around the contact pins the
advantage of VGA today is that older
equipment you encounter like a
presentation projector is pretty much
guaranteed to work with it but that's
about it because it's an analogue
standard the signal degrades from cable
length wire gauge the conversion to
digital for compatibility with your flat
panel display and from your friend
leaking into your house to steal all the
red M&amp;amp;Ms yeah
it's maximum clean resolution might not
seem that bad at a little over 3
megapixels at 85 Hertz but on any modern
display it just won't look very clear
and sharp use anything else if you can
our next standard DVR superior to VGA
but actually on the verge of
obsolescence just like it the connector
locks with screws just like VGA but is
physically larger and the biggest
advantage of DVI is its versatility on
the video source side DVI exists in a
number of varieties DVID has only pins
for an HDMI compatible digital video
signal and DVI I add signal pins free
VGA compatible analog signal meaning
with inexpensive passive adapters it can
drive DVI HDMI or VGA displays on top of
that while a single link DVI connection
is limited to 1920 by 1200 60 Hertz with
a dual link connection it is capable of
officially carrying 2560 by 1600 60
Hertz pretty darn good especially for
the time DVI is drawbacks are several
though the connector is bulky and unlike
newer standards it doesn't support the
same variety of color spaces and nor
does it carry audio or data along with
video speaking of newer standards HDMI
1.4 HDMI is biggest race today is its
ubiquity you can find it or an inter
compatible standard on pretty much any
computer modern piece of AV equipment or
display it supports multi-channel audio
and
data superior color depth with
compatible content equipment and it has
a wide wide video format support
including 4k and up to 30 Hertz and a
variety of stereoscopic 3d formats it
does have some drawbacks though the
connectors standard doesn't include a
locking mechanism for one thing and its
resolution is limited to 4k at only 30
Hertz and it also doesn't include
official support for wide 21 by 9 aspect
ratios or multiple concurrent video
streams HDMI 2.0 addresses everything
that I just said except the locking
connector making it almost as good as my
personal favorite DisplayPort but we
just haven't seen much of it yet
DisplayPort though is almost the
complete package
unlike HDMI it has a locking connector
it can be converted to every other
standard I've mentioned including VGA
with an inexpensive adapter and it
doesn't require a royalty to actually
physically implement on a product like
HDMI 2.0 DisplayPort 1.2 supports 4k at
60 Hertz multiple video streams over a
single cable audio network and other
data signals stereoscopic 3d 21 by 9
aspect ratios and pretty much anything
else you could want with the only things
missing being some home theater remote
control features and stuff like that and
things are only going to get better with
DisplayPort 1.3 adding support for 8k
displays 4k 3d and adaptive sync to
eliminate leg and screen tearing in
games rock on DisplayPort now you've
probably noticed by now that other than
differentiating analog and digital video
signals I've been focused on features
rather than image quality
that's because unless you're a
professional user with specific needs in
terms of color spaces you need to work
inside digital is digital and they will
all look the same at a given resolution
as long as the image isn't completely
garbled and corrupted by a defective
cable or something the other thing I
haven't mentioned yet is that there are
many and micro versions that exist for
some of these connectors this is simple
- basically other than needing a
physical adapter or cable these don't
make any difference whatsoever except
when a mini DisplayPort looking
connection has a little bolt next to it
Thunderbolt connectors carry a
DisplayPort compatible video signal but
can also
necked in series with Thunderbolt
devices like external hard drives of
whatnot
speaking of Thunderbolts the sky is
pretty much the limit guys fractal
design is decided by a couple of more
tech quickie ad spots for the express
purpose of allowing you guys to pick
what they do to humiliate me last time I
got pied in the face but if you felt
like that wasn't creative enough all you
need to do is head over to their
Facebook page linked in the video
description and give fractal design your
ideas for what they should have me do
next and I mean while you're at it I
guess you could check out their high
quality computer cases power supplies
and cooling products
just a thought thanks for watching this
fast as possible guys liked it if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
and leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future fast as possible
or if you just want to you know tell me
about how tired I look right now because
I just got back from climbing a mountain
and I'm just bad it's a miracle I'm even
alive right now as always don't forget
to subscribe for more fast as possible
