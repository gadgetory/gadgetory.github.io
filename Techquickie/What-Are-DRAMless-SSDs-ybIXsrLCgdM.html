it makes sense to skimp a little bit on
a purchase to save a few bucks
whopper without cheese a keyboard
without RGB or a hotel room without the
love tub and there's a breed of SSDs
that's been hitting the market that uses
a similar philosophy I'm talking about
SSDs without DRAM that are sold at a
lower price point than most other models
well I mean hold on a second Linus SSDs
without onboard memory that sounds fine
why would an SSD need its own ran well
here's the thing whenever your operating
system wants to fetch something from
your SSD like a game you want to play or
a business plan that you need to work on
it needs to know where that data is
physically located on the drive in order
to know this your SSD keep saying map of
sorts that actively tracks where
everything is I mean most people don't
know this but your SSD has to move your
data around quite a bit so that you
don't end up with a situation where some
of its flash memory cells wear out
faster than the others it's a protective
strategy called wear leveling on most
SSDs this data map is kept on a DRAM
chip because D ran is much faster than
the NAND flash that your SSD uses for
data storage in fact you can experience
this for yourself if you ever use your
main system DRAM as a ram disk something
you can learn more about here keeping
the map on DRAM also results in better
performance because it's faster speed
means that the OS won't have to wait as
long for the SSD to locate the desired
data however it is obviously possible to
eliminate DRAM entirely and keep this
mapping data either on the main flash
memory itself or just copy it over to
your system memory after you turn your
computer on and as we alluded to earlier
an SSD without DRAM tends to be cheaper
than the one that has it but she
does not necessarily equate to good
value though if all you're looking for
is better than a hard drive performance
for the least possible amount of money
could that gas station sushi SST be good
enough well as it turns out moving the
data map off the DRAM cache creates some
issues that are hard to ignore because
it takes so long for the SSD to locate
data performance on DRAM 'less SSDs is
usually noticeably slower than it is on
mainstream SSDs especially for random
reads and writes the small data
operations that access different parts
of the drive that incidentally make up
the bulk of the average users experience
if they have their OS installed on the
SSD and with drives that use the NAND
flash to store the data map this has the
added drawback of putting more wear on
the drive than it would otherwise have
so it'll be slower and then adding
insult to injury it may actually die
sooner you might have noticed that the
warranty for a dear analyst SSD is often
shorter than for other drives so if
you're trying to save money on your next
essay purchase use caution if you start
looking at DRAM less SSDs find as many
reviews as you can about the particular
model you're looking at and you know
what now forget it I'm actually not
going to recommend any of them it's
better to find an inexpensive SSD with a
dram cache in most cases you don't end
up saving that much money anyway and so
the moral of the story here is sometimes
trying to cheap out just isn't worth it
though with that said I've heard that
stocking up on store brand aluminium
foil is a pretty good idea and if you're
the kind of person who stocks up on not
just aluminum foil but also computers
you might want to try out synergy
synergy solves once and for all the
problem of having too many keyboards and
mice on your desk it's a software tool
that lets you just share one keyboard or
Mouse across multiple systems be they PC
Mack or even linux-based you just
configure where all the different
screens are and the mouse cursor moves
seamlessly between them no more messing
around and it's even got great features
like clipboard sharing dragging and
dropping between the computers custom
hotkeys and more it's available in basic
and pro versions with the latter
including SSL encryption to secure the
data sent between the computers synergy
is offering a 50% discount to tech
tricky viewers so just click the link in
