finally built the gaming PC of your
dreams and spent the last two months
locked in your room playing all the
latest triple-a titles but nostalgia is
a hell of a drug and you reach for one
of your favorite games of years gone by
thinking ball surely with such a
powerful machine MechWarrior four will
run better than ever right wrong
after you dig out an external optical
drive to install that Christmas gift
from 18 years ago you discover to your
horror then it won't load you use
windows compatibility mode but nothing
happened so what gives well it turns out
that how much computing power your PC
has is only part of the story I mean if
you think about it the Nintendo 64 has
more than enough power to run the
original Super Mario Brothers but that
doesn't mean that you can just plug an S
cartridge into it so here's the deal one
common reason older games won't play
nicely with modern hardware is that many
of them were written for 32-bit systems
you can learn more about the differences
between these and more modern 64-bit
systems up here but for this episode the
main thing that you need to know is that
most modern pcs use 64-bit CPUs and
operating systems giving them support
for more than 4 gigs of memory and the
ability to process more information at
once but programs need to be coded to
work with either a 32-bit or 64-bit
system meaning that if you're running a
modern 64-bit version of Windows your PC
will actually emulate 32-bit mode for
any programs written for a 32-bit
computer this includes older games
sometimes this emulation works without a
hitch but other times games just won't
cooperate for a number of reasons
sometimes older games will try to load
additional
in compatible code often in the form of
dll files used by older 32-bit versions
of Windows a Windows Update might break
a dependency that a game relies on or
they might not be able to properly
interface with a 64-bit device driver
other games might refuse to launch at
all because maybe some of their code is
written for even older 16-bit systems
which 64-bit Windows editions can't
emulate at all or do too draconian DRM
protections like safe discs that are
completely incompatible with modern
versions of Windows and as if that
weren't enough you can also run into
issues with the hardware itself
particularly your fancy new quad-core
multi-threaded CPU modern operating
systems will usually try to split a
given programs workload over multiple
cores as nearly every consumer grade PC
out there I mean not to mention even
phones has at least two cores in it now
this results in tangible efficiency
improvements in modern games that are
written with multi-core CPUs in mind but
it can wreak havoc on games whose code
just wasn't meant to be split up that
way think of it kind of like taking
apart a lego house versus one made of
glued together popsicle sticks but Linus
is there any way to get my old games
running or am i up KB lake without a
paddle well there isn't a foolproof way
to play every older title on a modern
system but there are certainly some
workarounds 32-bit versions of modern
editions of Windows are still widely
available for some reason and it is
certainly possible to dual boot your
computer with both a 32 and a 64-bit OS
you can also use a virtual machine if
you need to run a really old version of
Windows or fire up dosbox if you've got
something that's battled now if your
issues are performance rather than
compatibility related due to the
multi-core CPU issues we mentioned
before you can try adjusting the
CPU affinity in windows task manager or
a third party piece of software this
will force your game to run on only one
core and failing that you can actually
try switching off all but one core in
your BIOS or UEFI so that Windows will
actually treat your CPU as a single core
model furthermore it is amazing how
resourceful the gaming community is by
the way especially when it comes to
their beloved retro titles depending on
exactly which game you're trying to run
some resourceful folks out there have
created guides for dealing with
antiquated DRM schemes through registry
hacks and even created fixer utilities
that you can use to launch your older
games with special instructions that
will make them run more smoothly finally
as a last resort actually I recommend
you try this in the first place since it
can save a lot of hassle there's a
reasonable chance that you'll find a
compatible version of that game that you
loved on a reputable digital distributor
like Steam or more likely good old games
and they usually cost just a few bucks
so there you have it you may yet be able
to enjoy your favorite games from
yesteryear if you don't mind getting a
little creative
just don't get too creative and migrate
your entire digital life to an
old-school beige box running Windows ME
and speaking of your digital life are
you looking for a way to keep prying
eyes away from your online activity then
check out private Internet access VPN
not only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once by hiding your true IP
address and allowing you to bypass to
your restrictions and censorship making
you appear as though you're connecting
from somewhere else it also blocks
unwanted connections to help prevent
attacks it auto blocks all traffic if
the VPN disconnects it keeps your data
out of the hands of advertisers and
other snoops who are tracking your
activity it prevents DNS leaks and even
includes mace P is built-in malware
blocker P ia supports multiple VPN
protocols and encryption levels allowing
you to dial in the exact level of
protection you need and they've got apps
for Windows Mac
Android iOS Linux and they've even got a
Chrome extension with support for more
platforms coming soon they've got over
3,000 servers in 28 countries so what
are you waiting for
