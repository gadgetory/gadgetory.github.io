cool products they engage in lots of
community stuff and I mean heck they're
even a major sponsor of my other channel
but man when it comes to confusing
product naming schemes
I think core i3 Core i5 core i7 takes
the cake I mean great question what is a
core i7 4790k what the heck does all of
this even mean we'll get to that but
first a bit of background about why we
need product names for processors
wouldn't it be simpler to just label
them with how many gigahertz they run
that and call it a day
simpler sort of but at times actually
even more confusing for example when the
Pentium 4 launched an equivalently
clocked Pentium 3 was actually faster
because it could do more work with each
cycle as a customer I would expect the
product with the higher number to be the
better one and therein lies the problem
not all megahertz and gigahertz are
created equal and rating products that
way is about like reading the
performance of a car based on what RPM
the engine runs at it's not actually a
real indication of how fast the
processor is but it happened
now one of AMD's attempts to move away
from this started in the early 2000s
with their PR or performance rating
naming scheme where their processors
were given a four-digit model number
that enthusiasts believe was based on
the performance and he felt that they
delivered compared to an Intel CPU of
that clock speed but this fixed nothing
they were still indirectly naming
according to clock speed and it wasn't
until Intel introduced the core series a
line of CPUs that dramatically
outperformed their predecessors at much
lower clocks that the megahertz war
ended because Intel needed to shift
their marketing away from frequency so
here's what we have today
other than the very bare-bones Pentium
SKUs a core i3 will be your most basic
option with two processing cores and
hyper threading more about this feature
here for better multitasking it will
have a smaller cache it'll consume less
power it will generally perform a worse
than a Core i5
but it'll cost less which leads us to
the core i5 I wish I could say it was as
simple as well core i3 s have two cores
and Gorai fives have four cores the
number of cores equals n minus 1 where n
is that I'm
after the little eye but it's not mobile
core i5s have two cores and
hyper-threading while desktop ones
mostly have four cores and no
hyper-threading but what they all have
in common is improved onboard graphics
and turbo boost more about this feature
here for temporary performance
enhancements when your system needs a
little bit more mmm and with oomph in
mind
core i7s number one all core i7s have
hyper threading for heavy workloads at
number two that's the noise your brain
is gonna make as I finish my explanation
here a core i7 can have anywhere from
two processing cores in an ultrabook
all the way up to eight in a workstation
it might support anywhere from two
sticks of memory all the way to eight
and it can have a TDP anywhere from
around 10 watts all the way to a hundred
and thirty watts so there's a ton of
variety here and that's for a reason
core i7 tend to have more cache faster
turbo boost and better onboard graphics
than the lower tier processors and I
guess other than that the best summary I
can give is this a core i7 represents
the best thing Intel could build for a
given use case with the biggest drawback
being the higher price tag so when you
boil it down that's all the i-whatever
numbers represent good better best
within a given segment beyond that on
their own they're pretty much
meaningless the numbers and letters
afterwards sort of means something if
you use the guide from before but the
safest way to shop is to dig around in
arc and look at the features core counts
and clock speeds of the CPUs you're
comparing to figure out how they stack
up with the good news being that as long
as you compare within one brand and
within the same product generation those
metrics will actually mean something
speaking of means fractal design is back
buying up all of my advertising
inventory for the sole purpose of making
me do stupid crap on camera for y'all
instead of talking about the great
quality and clean Scandinavian design of
their PC cases power supplies and
cooling products
ronzo I don't know who to be mad at at
this point because it was you not
properly posted what's they can do the
sponsors brought on hearing them on
their Facebook page I mean thanks a lot
guys I mean genuinely thanks for
watching guys like I just like the video
