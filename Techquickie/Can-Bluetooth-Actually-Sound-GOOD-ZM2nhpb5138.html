you're in the middle of a game a
conference call or you're jamming out to
some embarrassing music when you have to
get up and go answer the phone
forgetting that you're using a wired
pair of headphones the cord drags your
laptop to the ground and making matters
worse you lose your balance trying to
catch it and now you've got both a
broken computer and no idea when that
pizza you ordered is coming so the
advantages of having a wireless audio
solution from someone like our sponsor
for today's video
antlion are pretty obvious but there's
plenty more to choosing the correct one
other than finding something without
wires and calling it a day and if you're
looking for a Bluetooth device much has
been made of choosing the correct codec
but how much does that matter well you
can learn more about codecs up here but
simply put a codec is the scheme that
your devices will use to encode and
decode a digital signal to produce
actual sound so if you're looking for a
Bluetooth speaker or headset it almost
certainly supports a codec called SBC
this codec is kind of the universal
lowest common denominator that allows a
huge range of playback devices and
speakers to work with each other and it
actually delivers decent enough results
it supports up to 328 kilobit per second
bit rates which is about what you'd get
with a Spotify Premium Subscription and
many people would actually be
hard-pressed to tell the difference
between SBC and fancier codecs however
it's important to remember that this
doesn't necessarily mean that your
tracks that you're paying you're ten
bucks a month for will sound exactly
like you'd expect on an SBC speaker or
headphones the vast majority of the
audio that you listen to over the
Internet is compressed and spc
recompress --is that audio with its own
algorithm to preserve battery life at
the expense of sound quality so some
people will be able to tell the
difference especially with higher-end
gear so SBC isn't a terrible codec but
there are better ones other codecs such
as apdex
and AAC support higher bandwidth and
therefore
quality audio and the very premium
optics HD and LD AC even boast that they
support 24-bit audio streams with that
said audio that high res has long been
the subject of controversy with many
enthusiasts claiming that virtually no
one can tell the difference between
24-bit audio and the standard 16-bit
stream that you'd hear on something like
a CD but could there be more to codecs
than just sound quality yes a more
important difference that better codecs
can make is in the latency that is the
delay caused by the time it takes for
your devices to receive and process a
signal have you ever noticed an
unacceptably long audio delay when
watching a video or playing a game using
Bluetooth where the audio simply doesn't
sync up with what's happening on-screen
well if that's the case you might want
to look into devices that support the
Attucks ll codec with ll standing for
low latency this codec can cut down on
that pesky audio delay several times
over so give it a shot if you game or
watch lots of movies over Bluetooth just
remember that whichever codec you're
interested in has to be supported by
both your source device and the speaker
or headphones so some research is
required before buying especially
because it's difficult to check what
codec you're currently using in Windows
unfortunately it might be difficult to
find this information on some gadgets
such as laptops a little patience though
will be worth it if you're tired of
everything you watch looking like a
badly dubbed kung fu movie speaking of
patience bear with me for a moment while
I tell you about our sponsor for today's
episode antlion audios mod mic wireless
microphone allows you to attach a mic to
your favorite headphones you simply
stick it to pretty much any headphones
you'd like with its magnetic mounting
system and then using aptX technology
which of course we talked about today
they're able to achieve ultra-low
latency that's up to five times faster
than the standard Bluetooth it's got
dual mic modes to allow for Omni or
uni-directional that pick up with the
switch on the mic and it features twelve
hours of battery life and you can even
charge it while
in use its cross-platform compatible so
it'll work with PC Windows Mac and ps4
and you can check it out at LM GGG slash
Wireless mod Mike we're gonna have that
