cables and fragile connectors that
modern electronic devices use for
battery recharging but we're just stuck
with cable clutter right ah what the
heck seriously guys like next time just
find something on Shutterstock to
represent lots of cables huh all right
yeah that would have been fine anyway
thanks to modern technology and by
modern I mean demonstrated about a
century ago by Nikola Tesla but now
finally becoming a commercial product
wireless power is here and we are very
close to saying goodbye to cables
forever but how does it work
I could just say magnets and leave you
to infer the rest but the actual science
is much more interesting than that
electricity and magnetism are actually
much more closely related than many
people realize a current-carrying wire
coil around an iron core is called an
electromagnet because it uses
alternating current electricity to
generate a fluctuating magnetic field
reversing the situation and applying a
magnetic field whose polarity is
constantly reversing to our wire coil
will generate AC electricity this is
called electromagnetic induction and is
the basis of the wireless power
solutions that we find in consumer grade
devices like phones and electric
toothbrushes and what's great about it
is that unlike microwave based wireless
power it is safe to have next to your
head while you sleep or you know in your
mouth and stuff all right so let's
summarize the pros and cons and then
it's number one is a big one and it's
convenience put your device down on its
pad when you go to bed in a compatible
doc in your car or even on the table in
your favorite coffee shop and boom it's
charging sign me up
advantage number two is no more worn out
connectors microUSB can be as fragile
and generally terrible as it wants if I
only have to use it once in a while to
load a new ROM on my phone love it but
nothing is perfect
so drawback number one is that it's
still not ubiquitous it's still too
expensive for many manufacturers to
include with their devices and most
charging pads I mean however cool this
might be aren't built into anything yet
and still need to sit there and be
plugged into the wall the good news is
that aftermarket solutions aren't too
bad a rear cover for a Galaxy s5
thirty bucks and a compatible pad on
ebay is less than twenty bucks
number two is in efficiency compared to
wired charging your device will charge
slower and heat up more for me
personally this isn't a big deal when
I've got time like when I'm sleeping I
can charge wirelessly and when I'm in a
hurry I can plug in number three is that
range is very limited right now you
pretty much put the two surfaces right
next to each other and orientation is
picky with most devices but solutions
like using grooved surfaces or
additional magnets to help with
alignment have been used successfully to
help with this and next-gen solutions
should help alleviate both of these
issues a fair bit now the last point
here is something that I wasn't really
sure how to classify in my list of pros
and cons and that's the speed at which
this technology is developing it's
advantageous because it means amazing
new solutions are coming but it also
ties into the biggest disadvantage yet
which is compatibility folks who
remember beta versus VHS and HD DVD
versus blu-ray you all know what I'm
talking about there are two main
competing standards today and while they
both rely on a power transmission pad
and a compatible receiver either inside
or attached to your device they don't
work with each other
Qi backed by the wireless power
consortium is by far the most popular
amongst consumers right now but PMA the
standard backed by the power matters
Alliance is likely to continue to gain
support with corporate organizations and
governments with their cloud-based
controller software feature that allows
these entities to better manage their
wireless charging network the Alliance
for wireless power is yet another group
and their residents branded resonant
magnetic coupling wireless charging
standard looks as super exciting and
promises to enable more convenient
solutions by offering dramatically
better range and multi-device charging
while maintaining reasonable efficiency
they recently closed a standard
consolidation deal PMA though so my
point isn't which one you should invest
in now in terms of buying a bunch of
gear but just that the standards war is
just warming up with new developments
coming hard and
fast at the end of the day though
whether you're a time child a human or
an otter hopefully the thing we can all
agree on is that wireless charging rocks
and the future is going to be freakin
awesome with like wireless charging that
can basically be in the same room as you
and provide power all your devices
space-age stuff men speaking of
space-age stuff Shutterstock isn't it's
actually really simple you head over to
shutterstock.com where you can use their
super-powerful image search to browse
their entire 35 plus million image
library for free pick the ones you want
and pay a reasonable price to download
them and use them with no royalties
they're a la carte service is great for
individuals and they have reasonably
priced subscriptions for small
organizations like mine
and they've even got enterprise plans
that include more flexible usage rights
an unlimited number of users and even
research assistants so whoever you are
and whatever the scope of your project
whether it's a PowerPoint presentation
for school or a professional newscast
that you need like stock photos and
footage for if you want high quality
media and the peace of mind of knowing
that you've got the correct usage rights
for the content you're using
Shutterstock is an option that we 100%
recommend oh yeah and you can also save
25% off your new account by using offer
code texture day and editing time and
I'm sure you'll be as happy with it as
we are guys
