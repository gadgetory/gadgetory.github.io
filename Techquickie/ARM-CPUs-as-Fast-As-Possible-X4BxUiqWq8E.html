think of a micro processor from Intel or
AMD that sits in your desktop or laptop
computer but in the connected age there
are a lot of devices from smartphones
and tablets to fancy Android game
consoles to even things like anti-lock
brakes and web-connected door locks that
also need processors with many of them
powered by specialized CPUs based on
technology from a company called arm so
what exactly is an arm CPU and why don't
you have one in your PC as well
well the PC processor scene has long
been dominated by chips using an
instruction set called x86 originally
developed by Intel and only fully
licensed out to a couple of other
manufacturers including AMD arm doesn't
have the correct licenses to design x86
processors and it's unlikely that Intel
will be allowing anyone else to do so in
the near future given they even amended
their cross-licensing agreement with AMD
to prevent it from transferring to a
third party if AMD gets acquired which
is a bummer because x86 is super awesome
for some workloads with high-end core i7
chips able to handle complex
instructions that tell the processing
cores to do a lot of things at once an
arm CPU by contrast is optimized for
simpler instructions that are closer to
the metal than x86 so the processor
doesn't have to do as much sorting and
arranging to get to the actual meet of
the work think of it like trying to help
your buddy move apartments if he dumps a
huge pile of dirty dishes and
disassembled IKEA furniture in front of
you and tells you all at once so what to
do with it that's a lot of frigging work
to remember what he said and then
actually do it well that's what x86 can
do but if he's a reasonable person and
has all his stuff laid out neatly for
you once you get there and tells you as
you go where he wants everything stored
you'll probably have a much easier time
of it just like you'll expend less
energy in the second scenario an arm CPU
also uses much less energy than a
typical x86 processor
which is monumentally important for
preserving battery life in mobile
devices these energy savings can be seen
in an arm CPUs drastically reduced heat
output as well about 15 times less than
your average core i7 which you could
probably fry an egg on if you weren't
using a heatsink
so while x86 is superior for heavy
workloads not to mention that its
continued use enables backwards
compatibility with games and apps that
were written decades ago for devices
that perform only simpler tasks and
whose app development was mostly done in
the last half a dozen years like
smartphones arm is perfect ok line is
cool but while you've mentioned arm and
cell phones together a lot most cell
phones use Apple a series or Qualcomm
Snapdragon processors ah well arm
doesn't actually make their own chips at
all instead other companies buy designs
from arms engineers and integrate them
into their own products sometimes even
modifying them sometimes significantly
for specific purposes as Apple has been
known to do giving them the flexibility
to build the CPU around their devices
design rather than the other way around
a paradigm shifting change but what does
the future hold for arms technology
Microsoft's surface RT series tablets
demonstrated that it's unlikely to
replace x86 and Windows PCs any time
soon but as it continues to improve
power sipping devices will get closer
and closer to the functionality of your
desktop
not to mention that app compatibility
will improve and we're even starting to
see arm appear in servers so Google
doesn't have to work quite so hard to
cool off their server farms speaking of
cool your website could be cool if only
you were using Squarespace they're
simple powerful beautiful well that's
just three words that Squarespace uses
to describe themselves so why don't I
break it down a little bit they offer
24/7 support via live chat and email
that's part of the simple not to mention
the interface is so easy that even I can
make changes to our Squarespace site the
powerful comes from well it's you know
a super powerful tool to make your site
also the back end is extremely powerful
your Squarespace site pretty much can't
go down even if you have a podcast that
you know has like 6000 people watching
it every week and you're like hey go to
the Squarespace site boom it'll stay up
and the beautiful part is that
Squarespace looks great thanks to
responsive design on any computer
whether it's a TV computer or even a
smartphone they've got all kinds of
different templates you can have a store
you can have a blog you can have a you
know whatever you could have like a
gallery of pictures of your dog wearing
hats it doesn't matter the point is you
can start a trial with no credit card
required and start building your website
today and plans start at only 8 bucks a
month so when you decide to sign up for
Squarespace use offer code Lynas to get
10% off your purchase Squarespace build
it beautiful why is that in my notes
that is a slogan usually I like to just
stick with like you know riffing on the
notes but whatever thanks for watching
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked also
check out the dildo racing video on
Channel super-fun hopefully that'll be
up by the time you guys are seeing this
and you can go check that out Channel
super-fun it's kind of a lot of fun it's
writen the name super fun comment on
this video suggestions for future fast
as possible and I think that's pretty
much it I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
