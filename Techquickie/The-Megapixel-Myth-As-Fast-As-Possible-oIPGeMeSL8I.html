probably have to deal with a lot of
marketing buzzwords whenever you make an
electronics purchase these days I'm
surprised honestly that they haven't
tried to sell us free-range motherboards
and yet perhaps the most evident area
for this is digital cameras where if
you're looking at a standalone model or
even a camera is built into a smartphone
the first thing your average big-box
retailer is going to try to get you to
notice is how many megapixels it has but
is this really the best way to evaluate
the quality of the photo you'll end up
getting to answer it would help to know
what a megapixel actually is it's a
measure of resolution that tells you how
many solid colored dots or pixels make
up the image one megapixel equals a
million pixels which may sound like a
lot but remember that a standard 1080p
computer monitor can display a little
over two megapixels and many computer
grade digital cameras take pictures
containing eight ten or even more
megapixels
the biggest advantage to picking up a
camera that can capture more megapixels
is scaling if you're trying to create
large prints of your photos or just
trying to zoom in on them in your
favorite image editing program for
post-processing
a higher pixel density means that your
image will retain more sharpness while
increasing magnification or blowing it
up to stick it on a poster because of
this the megapixel count mattered a lot
in the early days of photography when
cameras having around a single megapixel
were common and models that could
capture high resolution images were
tremendously helpful if you wanted to
print anything larger than a 4x6
nowadays though with cameras supporting
many times more megapixels being the
norm the biggest concern for novice
photographers isn't whether or not the
picture will scale well rather it's
things like noise inaccurate color and
poor low-light performance that are
still things to watch out for even on
cameras that advertise more megapixels
than the Hubble freaking telescope as
the number of pixels in an image has
nothing to do with those important
aspects of picture quality okay we get
it more megapixels is the modern-day
equivalent to blast processing but what
should we pay attention to when we're
buying a new camera for starters try and
find out what kind of image sensor the
camera has this is the thing that turns
the light that passes through the lens
into an actual photo
generally speaking larger sensors are
better
as the pixels on them will be larger
than the smaller sensor of the same
resolution meaning more light can reach
each pixel often resulting in a crispy
image the largest sensors are typically
35 millimetres you know the like the
film ones and old school cameras and
they go down in both size and price from
there also pay attention to the cameras
dynamic range which is a measure of how
well the camera can capture light and
dark portions of an image pictures taken
on a camera with poor dynamic range will
cause bright areas to look washed out
and dim areas to look like black
splotches dynamic range is commonly
expressed in terms of stops with more
stops translating to your camera being
more versatile in different lighting
conditions specs like these might be
hard to find at a general consumer
electronics store so this is where a
little bit of online research can go a
long way and of course other factors
like optical zoom image stabilization
and even the speed of your camera's CPUs
are important to consider as well but
just remember that not even the most
expensive DSLR out there will make your
horrible mirror selfies look any better
