both amateur and professional teams
vying for a championship title in
various electronic video game
competitions aka a bunch of nerds holed
up somewhere in a dank basement crowning
a king of their van or whatever at least
that seems to be the stereotype that
detractors of competitive gaming and
gamers default to arguing that eSports
aren't physical enough to bridge the gap
from hobby or game to sport despite the
fact that if we replace electronic video
games in my eSports definition with ball
kicking activities we could use
virtually the same definition for
traditional sports many of the defenders
of eSports embrace the similarities to
sports and will point out that both
require training coaching strategizing
lightning-fast decision-making skills
teamwork and extremely practiced
muscular reflexes in order for
competitors to achieve victory and I
mean besides if curling ice dance and
synchronized swimming are gonna get a
free pass then why are we even talking
about this
well I could just say because they jelly
drop the mic and walk offstage but
without several degrees in sports
psychology I wouldn't be qualified to
speculate on any of that so I'll stick
to what we know empirically makes them
so different or so similar one
difference is the type of physical
activity involved there aren't many
eSports where a higher you know jumping
height gives you a clear advantage but
while I personally favor sports for
myself and as a parent for the many
health benefits of regular physical
exertion we can't really say Froot Loops
aren't cereal because they're not
healthy or something but Raisin Bran is
when they really are more similar than
they are different for starters in the
early days of sports broadcasting
ESPN's founders had difficulty
convincing established cable
companies and the press that they're all
Sports Network would succeed all of this
in spite of the popularity of sports for
both participants and observers at all
levels from kids goofing around at home
with their friends to professionals
competing in tournaments for cash prizes
sound familiar so the main difference
here is that while it took a hundred
years for the NHL to go from having one
of their entire teams the appropriately
named 228 battalion literally call the
way to fight in World War one to now
their teams and athletes making millions
and enjoying Rockstar status
eSports has completed this progression
in a mere twenty or so years we have TV
deals either in place or coming around
the world
massive live exhibitions and revenues
estimated at two hundred and fifty to
six hundred plus million dollars for
this year with MOBAs hoarding the lion's
share of that first person shooters
taking silver and 2d fighting games in
third but if we're going to talk then
about similarities to sports we have to
acknowledge the good and the bad because
eSports is not immune to the apparent
requirement that wherever money is
involved there will be corruption with a
recent ESL that's an electronic sporting
league scandal that had a prominent
athlete basically saying yeah I was
doping who cares everyone does it a
plethora of online gambling and
match-fixing scandals and a recent
crackdown on high-level players using
software hacks to cheat such as aimbots
that simply identify other players in
the game and pretty much shoot them for
you right the last one is particularly
interesting for our sports vs. eSports
comparison because digital cheating
methods have often been used by
naysayers as an example of why
competitive gaming shouldn't be
considered a sport but does it matter
how someone cheats really I mean if
using a digital camcorder or a bicycle
pump or whatever to get a leg up on your
competition made whatever you were doing
not a sport then it would be pretty hard
to call football a sport the New England
Patriots a team or Tom Brady an athlete
but you know what should be a
