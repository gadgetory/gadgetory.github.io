road trip you've probably wished at some
point that you could just kick back and
let the car drive itself
unfortunately autonomous vehicles are
still a ways away from becoming
mass-market items and so the closest
thing we have right now is cruise
control which is convenient but won't
exactly drive the car for you as a few
people in those urban legends who
thought they could set the cruise
control in the RV and then go in the
back and make a sandwich found out but
even so cruise control is becoming a
much more useful tool with the advent of
adaptive cruise control which has found
its way into many modern vehicles unlike
old school cruise control which allowed
your car to maintain one constant speed
newer adaptive cruise control systems
have the ability to adjust your car
speed on-the-fly
and therefore increase safety but how
does that work
adaptive cruise control is often
implemented on cars using radar although
some use lasers radar is more common
since it works better in adverse weather
conditions usually the radar is mounted
on the front of the car near the bumper
or behind the grille so when you turn
the cruise control on your car will fire
a radar beam which travels until it hits
another vehicle in front of you the
return signal is processed by a computer
to determine how far behind the second
car you are the cruise control uses this
information to keep your car a set
number of seconds behind by dynamically
changing your speed this gives you the
advantage of not having to brake and
readjust your cruise control if you get
stuck behind a car that's moving slowly
or frequently alters its speed and also
helps mitigate the effect of normal
cruise control lowing you into a false
sense of security potentially slowing
your reaction time in the event that
there is a sudden change in speed
required
now many adaptive cruise control systems
also feature collision avoidance where
the car can automatically brake more
aggressively if it senses that you're
getting way too close to another vehicle
or object you'll also often get an audio
or a visual warning that you're about to
hit something much like professional
pilots have in their planes to let them
know they're getting too close to other
air traffic
our play for example a volcano some
adaptive cruise control systems can even
work with other technologies to give you
even more features for example a system
that's designed to work with GPS could
automatically slow down if you're in a
construction zone that the GPS knows
about or help to control your speed more
effectively on Hills since the system
will know what the terrain ahead looks
like improving not only safety but gas
mileage as well and of course when we do
start buying autonomous cars on mass
adaptive cruise control like systems
will be very important for actually
keeping the car where you want it on the
road so you don't end up in the back of
a semi-truck like those cops in the
Blues Brothers for now though it's not
surprising that adaptive cruise control
like many optional features they try to
sell you down at the old car dealership
don't come cheap as it's usually an
add-on that will set you back a couple
thousand dollars but it might just be
worth it for you if you're an
inattentive driver with some money to
burn or maybe you'll even get one of
those super slick salesman who will
sweeten the deal with some of the those
free floor mats and under coatings that
I've heard so much about speaking of
things I've heard about fresh books in
the spirit of the format here a tech
quickie I'm going to tell you all the
great things about fresh books as
quickly as I can
fresh books is for small business owners
who want to save time and get organized
and basically spend the time that they
have either with their families or doing
the actual work they want to do rather
than fussing about with complicated
accounting software it lets you send out
invoices it lets you track your expenses
it lets you murder Brandon unfortunately
it doesn't let us murder Brandon that's
why he's still alive it lets you take
deposits and it lets you see if your
client has actually received your
invoice and then even allows them to pay
through fresh books it's all cloud
tracked you can like take pictures of
receipts it's freaking cool and you can
try it for nothing for 30 days by going
over to fresh books calm forward slash
