real you'll never want to leave your
room there are plenty of ways that
stores will try to sell you a monitor
but there's one key spec that you might
not hear much about which is response
time which can make a difference when
there's some kind of fast action
happening on the screen
oh so you're talking about that thing
where there's a delay between pressing a
key and clicking a mouse or whatever and
then having it display on the screen
right actually no that's called input
lag which is also important since too
much input lag can leave you frustrated
at best or lying in a pool of virtual
blood at worst because you couldn't
react quickly enough to an opponent
response time however is less about how
your monitor will eventually display
inputs from your peripherals after a
delay and more about the individual
pixels themselves it's a measure of how
quickly a pixel can display a change
from black to white or from one shade of
gray to another different shades of gray
represent how intense any given color
will appear on your monitor through a
filter the darker the gray the less
light will pass through said color
filter and hit your eyes which is why
you don't hear people talking about red
to blue response times or anything like
that response times are usually given in
milliseconds since one frame on a
standard 60 Hertz monitor stays on your
screen for just under 17 milliseconds
the pixels themselves need to transition
more quickly than that so they can
display the next frame on time but just
because a monitor has a response time
under 17 milliseconds doesn't mean that
it's just as good as anything else
the longer response times often result
in ghosting which means you can see the
remains of trails from a moving object
on the screen because pixels took too
long to switch between shades of grey
this might not be a huge deal if you
just use your computer as a Facebook
machine but if you're a gamer or like to
watch movies with fast action poor
response times can cause really
distracting visual artifacts so how do
you know what's actually good when
looking to buy monitor checking out
their specs and what not people have
different opinions on what the maximum
response time should be if you're gaming
while some people claim that they can't
notice any ghosting on anything below 8
milliseconds there's other people like
competitive gamers who swear by super
quick screens with response times of
only 1 or 2 milliseconds typically TN
panels can be engineered to be quick
when their ips counterparts so you'll
often see higher-end TN displays
marketed as being for gamers but
remember that you'll also lose color
accuracy and viewing angles but hold on
take whatever the manufacturer puts on
the spec scene with a huge grain of salt
there isn't a standardized way for these
companies to measure response times so
you might be seeing a cherry-picked
measurement for how long it takes for a
pixel to switch between two similar
shades of gray and end up disappointed
with the actual performance once you
hook it up fortunately this is a
situation where a little research can go
a long way there are websites that have
independently conducted measurements of
response times as well as input lag
times so you can have more apples to
apples comparison when you're shopping
and remember to check reviews from a
trusted source as well even if the
monitor says that it has lightning quick
response time of 1 to 2 milliseconds
many people complaining about ghosting
could be a clue that what's on the spec
sheet isn't all that accurate so pay
attention the next time you've been
marketed for a new display even the
biggest highest resolution screen you
can get your paws on will be very
disappointing if it makes everything
look like a giant ice cream smear no it
isn't disappointing Linda comm with
Linda comm membership you can watch and
learn from top experts who are
passionate about teaching and they
stream thousands of video courses on
demand you can learn whatever the heck
you want on your own schedule at your
own pace which is awesome you can browse
courses transcript so say you're
watching a video kind of like this one
but I said something and you had to try
to find it again and it was frustrating
on lynda.com you could see the script
for the whole video and then just jump
to that exact part of the video which is
kinda great you can take notes as you go
and refer to them later on you can
download tutorials to watch them while
ago so you're going on to train or
something where you lose Wi-Fi
connection or whatever you can access
them on your iOS or Android devices you
great and save playlists or courses that
you can watch and check out at any time
you can even compare learning paths to
go along with your friends and
colleagues so yeah it's great your link
on membership will give you unlimited
access to training on ton
of courses with all a flat rate of $25
per month so whether you're looking to
become an industry expert you're
passionate about a hobby or you just
want to learn something new
I go to lynda.com slash tech cookie and
sign up for a free 10-day trial if you
like the video like it did you dislike
the video dislike it both are fine just
you know what do what's in your heart I
believe it would be the right thing
whatever it happens to be also another
right thing to do check out tech quickie
I mean general super fun which is
probably on my face now this was tech
work II go to the other one
that one's cool that was a little bit
more fun and entertaining then tech
rookie is kind of like not quite as fun
but more educational and I think they
like contrast quite well so watching one
after the other then coming back here
might be a good idea if you just bounce
back and forth between the two there you
go viewing options anyways don't forget
