the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos oh hey
what's that thing well I guess if you're
watching this on an iPhone 10 you're
used to a by now but for the rest of you
this is probably pretty annoying so what
exactly is the point of the knotch which
is either suddenly in vogue or a huge
source of complaints depending on your
opinion it's Apple just trying to tell
us all yeah or Apple and we can do
whatever you want with our gadgets just
like we do with the headphone jack well
not exactly
in fact the lesser-known essential phone
was actually the first bonner smartphone
to feature a notch for its front-facing
camera though it's quite a bit smaller
than the one you'd find on the iPhone 10
release just two months before the
iPhone 10 the essential phone was our
first look at how a phone designer might
try to fill as much of the front of the
devices as possible
with actual screen instead of bezels and
although they figured out how to bury a
fingerprint sensor under the display
which you can learn more about up here
the industry hasn't yet figured out how
to do it with a front-facing camera
which is now a critical feature in all
modern smartphones due to its
utilization by popular apps and of
course are narcissistic need for
on-demand selfies of course many
filmmakers simply hide the camera and
other phone components inside of a bezel
but the essential went with a notch
approach because Android OS fills the
top notification bar from the left and
right so the idea was that the camera in
the middle wouldn't block anything super
important and they even built in an
option that allowing the user to choose
whether or not to hide the notch in
landscape mode by turning the knotch
side of the screen into a black bar that
won't block anything of course Apple
stock is significantly larger leaving
only two small loaves of screen space at
the phone's corners a big part of the
rationale for this is that the iPhone
tends face ID recognition system needs
additional equipment such as an IR
camera and a dot projector that can't
also yet be buried under the screen so
to be fair the iPhone tend to sporting a
pretty cool piece of tech that the
central phone and other Android devices
don't yet have and iOS also doesn't
display notification icons across
top of the screen like Android does
making the notches a little easier to
get away with and Apple does designate
safe areas in app development to prevent
content from being obscured by the
knotch now of course this doesn't mean
that the not should be immune from
criticism with many users noting that it
seems like a ham-fisted attempt at a
bezel was phone before the technology
has completely caught up especially as
we're now seeing phones that are bezel
is on three sides a more appealing
alternative to the awkward not at least
for some because awkwardness is in the
eye of the beholder right and there's
been speculation that Apple was
intentionally using the bezel as a
signature look just like the scroll
wheel of the iPod and anytime Apple does
that other companies including one plus
and a soos follow suit and both have
already confirmed they'll be using
notches in their upcoming phones with
one a sous exec even going so far as to
say it's what the people want so whether
you love or hate Apple for starting this
trend there's a good chance we'll see
nauseous become more common until
solutions for hiding phone components
beneath the display become widespread in
fact Android P has features specifically
for developers who want to incorporate
notches into app design so if you are
hoping that the phone industry will
relent and suddenly decide notches are a
bad idea you might want to dial your
host back a notch
not only this P ia works on up to five
devices at once by hiding your IP
address and allowing you to bypass geo
restrictions of censorship by making you
appear that you're connecting from
somewhere else it also blocks unwanted
connections to help prevent attacks
although blocks all traffic through the
VPN disconnects keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and other
snoops who are tracking your activity
prevents DNS leaks and even includes
Mase P is built-in malware blocker PIAA
supports multiple VPN protocols and
encryption levels allowing you to dial
in the exact level of protection that
you need they have apps for Windows Mac
Android iOS Linux and a Chrome extension
with support for even more platforms
coming soon and the PIAA has over 3,000
servers in 28 different countries and
does not lock user activity so what are
you waiting for check them out today at
the link below ok guys thanks for
watching Tech Book II like this
if you liked it dislike it if you didn't
like four more notches embedded in the
video like four more bad puns about
notches leave a comment the video
