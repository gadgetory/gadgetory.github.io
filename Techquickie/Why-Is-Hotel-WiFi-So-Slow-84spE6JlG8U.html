you know that it can be a real treat
plush bedding those fancy little soaps
in the bathroom and the seven dollar
sodas in the minibar well anyway all
those things can go a long way towards
making you feel like a real VIP until
that is you connect to the guest Wi-Fi
and it's so slow that it makes your
fancy laptop if you like something right
out of 1995 but why is hotel Wi-Fi often
barely functional even at high-end
resorts let's start with the obvious
volume unlike at home where you might
only have a few people connected to your
network at once
hotels have to handle hundreds or even
thousands of connected devices but come
on John it's not like these hotels don't
plan to fill all the rooms with guests
so surely they can account for this
right well you're right they could but
part of the problem is do see business
model of hotels which try to draw people
in with visually appealing rooms common
areas hot tubs continental breakfasts
you name it this means if optimized
network infrastructure doesn't look
flashy in the brochure it can often get
pushed to the bottom other list of
priorities so because of this their
sense can end up seriously flawed in a
number of ways for starters when's the
last time you saw any routers or access
points just hanging around the resort
hotels off the cram their equipment into
closets maintenance areas and even
ceilings so things don't look too messy
but trying to hide it behind a bunch of
obstacles can reduce signal strength and
therefore range and speed and many
hotels also use older equipment that
there are in no hurry to replace for
example hotels often signed contracts
with outside companies to provide
equipment and services for a certain
length of time sometimes years so if the
hotel has a bunch of routers and access
points deployed that only support older
standards replacing them to be very
costly depending on what the contract
says and it isn't like new equipment is
cheap to begin with and if your hotel is
using older equipment
chances are it's only offering a
connection of the congested 2.4
gigahertz band which is compatible with
almost all Wi-Fi devices but it's more
successful to interfere us there's a new
were five gigahertz bands when lots of
devices are in close proximity which
would happen in the hotel the hotel's
network might also be using 802 point 11
and routers that don't have as much
throughput as newer standards like
wireless AC so when you combine all this
with the fact that the hotel's
high-speed internet connection is being
split across hundreds or even thousands
of guests it can result in serious
bottlenecks but hold on a minute
wouldn't it make more sense for the
hotels to just spend money on better
hardware and attract visitors with fast
Wi-Fi well some hotels are indeed doing
this but many others are still for some
reason holding on to the idea that
shoddy Wi-Fi will get customers to give
up watching movies and other stuff on
their laptops or tablets and instead of
spring for hotel provided pay-per-view
and although it's pretty easy to see
that hotels will probably have to give
up on this at some point what can you do
with the meantime if you're stuck in a
place with slow Wi-Fi well a good
investment to make if you're a frequent
traveler is a small wireless router that
you can take with you you see many hotel
rooms also offered wired internet access
often over that Ethernet port that you
find hiding next to the lamp plug a
router into it in AP mode and bam you
have your very own Wi-Fi network and
since you likely won't need a signal
outside of your room and inexpensive
short range solution will probably do
especially if you use the less crowded
five gigahertz band that we were talking
about before and if you're really
pressed for space and your tiny travel
bag
there are even travel sized routers that
are a little more than just a single
Ethernet port plus an antenna another
option is to simply avoid staying at
hotels with poor Wi-Fi in the first
place there are websites that pop those
specifically the crowdsource estimated
speeds of hotels in many different
cities so if you're going to need a
reliable internet connection on your
next trip keep these listings in mind
just make sure you also look at the rest
of the reviews you don't want to rush to
book a hotel with fast Wi-Fi for Netflix
only to feel something unexpected biting
at your legs when you try to chill and
Stingo tried to chill are you finding
