and our graphics cards and digital
cameras pumping out crisper more
lifelike images than ever before it
isn't surprising that we're wondering
how long it will be until we get
something that could match or exceed our
eyes natural resolution or refresh rates
but what exactly are the specs of our
eyes does the question even make sense
since we see things not with a camera
lens and GPU but with a squishy eyeball
and a hunk of meat inside our brain now
we here at Tec wiki are not the first to
answer this question in terms of
discrete numbers but even so tons of
people out there are still perpetuating
the same myths like the famous assertion
that the human eye can't see more than
24 frames per second which Garner's eye
roles from enthusiasts everywhere so
we're going to take a stab at explaining
the truth obviously our eyes don't work
exactly the same way as digital cameras
but they do operate with a few concepts
in common just like an image sensor in a
camera can capture a certain number of
pixels our eyes have a finite number of
rod and cone cells in them plus our eyes
need different visual elements of
whatever we're looking at to be small
enough so they don't appear pixelated so
in this way our eyes are sort of kind of
digital but our brains render images we
can understand by examining how the view
from our eyes is continuously changing
which sounds a lot closer to how analog
technology works something you can learn
more about up here so this means that
the commonly cited answer of 576
megapixels which was decided upon with
some rather complicated math which we've
linked to in the video description needs
to be taken with some caveats don't get
me wrong
our eyes are indeed incredible tools for
seeing the world in detail
I mean 576 megapixels is equal to having
a 30 mm by 18,000 pixel monitor this
would be like having an array of over
275 1080p monitors this makes it sound
like you need 576 million pixels to have
a photo that fit exactly within your
field of view to completely fool you
into thinking that the picture is
actually real-life but remember that
since you only see things sharply that
are right in front of you with your
peripheral vision being a lot blurrier
the actual number is only somewhere
around 8 or 9 megapixels and again since
your brains don't work in a digital
manner the real number can vary quite a
bit depending on factors like ambient
lighting but let's say you're less
worried about buying a camera that can
match the capabilities of human eye and
more about buying a graphics card and
high refresh rate monitor that can crank
out so many FPS that your favorite game
couldn't possibly appear any smoother is
that even possible well possibly in
theory a human brain could process a
thousand frames per second according to
scientific research into how quickly our
neurons can fire signals but just like
the theoretical max speeds of things
like SATA drives this number doesn't
mean a whole lot in practical terms
different people have different maximum
refresh rates and the real-life upper
limit seems to be around 250 Hertz
depending on what study you look at but
remember again that our brains and eyes
aren't exactly digital and don't render
discrete frames the way a graphics card
would so there isn't an actual number of
frames your eyes can push to your brain
rather that 250 number is the point at
which motion becomes realistic looking
for people with good eyesight and of
course there are diminishing returns as
you approach this number for example
it's easy for most people to tell the
difference between 20 and 60 FPS but 220
and 260 will be indistinguishable to a
lot of folks so while it is possible to
attach meaningful numbers to the spec
sheets of our eyes and brains individual
differences along with the not-quite
analog or digital nature of our bodies
means that you should take them with a
grain of salt and that the most
important thing is to buy stuff that
will give you an experience that you
think looks good unless of course you're
cool with waiting around for the world's
first 18,000 P monitor to hit the market
whoa I'm on tech wiki anyways tunnel
bear VPN you can
up to 20 different countries and browse
the Internet as if you are in that
country they have easy-to-use apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
have a Chrome extension just choose the
country that you want in the app turn
tunnel bear on and watch as your bear
tunnel is your internet connection to a
new location similar to how I just came
here from LTT when you turn tunnel bear
on two things happen your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and your public IP address
gets switched so you show up to other
people as if you're in that country that
you picked earlier they also have a top
rated privacy policy and do not log user
activity you can try tunnel Bayer VPN
with five hundred megabits of free data
and with no credit card required and if
you decide to get the unlimited data
plan you can save 10% by going to tunnel
bear comm slash Linus thanks for
watching everybody give the video a like
or a dislike get subscribed if you
haven't already and check out our other
channel channel super fun where we do
super fun things I'm not sure what's up
there but it's something fun go watch
that I'm going to leave bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
