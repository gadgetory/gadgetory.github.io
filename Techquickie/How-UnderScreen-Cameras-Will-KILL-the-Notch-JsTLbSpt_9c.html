smartphones that need to feel glued to
them constantly paying for screen
repairs over and over finding someone
promising on tinder and then getting
ghosted well if you ask me one of the
most annoying things about them is the
knotch trend that has proliferated ever
since the launch of the iPhone 10 but as
we explained in this video the notch
wasn't just a design decision meant to
be intentionally infuriating the point
of it is to house components that can't
be embedded inside the screen most
notably the front-facing camera but the
good news is that we may be getting rid
of the knotch for good very soon thanks
in large part to the advent of under
screen cameras manufacturers like Xiaomi
and Oppo are already getting the ball
rolling on all screen phones without
gimmicks like sliding or motorized
selfie cameras and that means that other
phone makers probably aren't too far
behind so how exactly did they pull this
off
I mean hidden cameras are nothing new
but it's not often that you see them
behind an actual working screen so
here's how it works
your phone's display assuming that
you've got a mid-range to high-end model
is made up of a layer of OLED pixels
that can generate their own light
sandwiched between two layers the
cathode and the anode that act as
electrical terminals that provide a
voltage that allows the screen to you
know work now it's entirely possible to
make the cathode and anode out of
transparent materials meaning that you
are essentially creating a see-through
screen so in a phone with an under
screen camera only a small part of the
display is actually made to be
transparent the area that's hiding the
lens so during normal operation that
area will function just like the rest of
your screen but when you activate that
selfie cam the OLED pixels turn off
allowing light to go straight through
the display and into the camera lens
additionally the screen above the camera
is made with a special kind of glass
that isn't as reflective as what
normally covers the display to cut down
on glare and Distortion
pretty cool right well although this
technology definitely has the potential
to make all of our phones look a lot
sleeker it's still rather new meaning
that there are some kinks to be worked
out so at this time it's still possible
to faintly see the camera behind the
screen and the transparent layers and
the low reflectivity glass mean that the
display also won't look quite as good
above the camera when you're not trying
to take a photo furthermore there's the
small matter of the actual image quality
of the pictures that you snap I mean
it's certainly a remarkable party trick
to be able to bury the camera behind the
screen but early reports indicate that
the photos don't look as nice as they do
on traditional selfie cams that aren't
covered up by anything and this makes
sense given that the last time I got a
good look at a transparent OLED display
it clearly pardon the pun didn't allow
all of the light through with that said
if you're sick of having a notch on your
phone
the trade-off might be well worth it for
you especially if you don't actually
take a ton of selfies now at the time of
making this video
there was no definitive timetable for
when phones with under screen cameras
would be on the market but all signs
point to them coming in the near future
as opposed to years down the line so be
on the lookout for the long-awaited
no compromises all screen phone and then
hopefully the tech industry can move on
to tackle yet another global crisis like
still having to rent cable boxes for
some reason speaking of crises if your
small business is in crisis get fresh
books it's the small business accounting
software that's custom-built for how you
want to work and it's a simple way to be
more productive more organized and get
