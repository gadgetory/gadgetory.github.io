stealing things from the airwaves just
meant recording radio broadcasts of
songs about Barbie girls and wanting it
that way onto bootleg cassette tapes but
now with details of our personal lives
and billions of dollars worth of
transactions constantly being beamed
around over Wi-Fi securing all of this
stuff has become a huge priority for
more than just Nick Carter
well yeah Linus that's what those
passwords that clever people put in
place over their wireless networks to
keep unwanted intruders from accessing
computers and files on the network or
for if you got one of those
you're safe smart guy actually you're
partly right password protection on your
Wi-Fi hotspot is a must these days with
some places even holding the internet
connection owner liable for cyber crimes
committed through their unsecured access
point but that's also a gross
oversimplification not all passwords are
created equal
back in the early 2000s nearly all
router shipped with a default security
scheme called WEP or wired equivalency
privacy and although it was incredibly
widespread thanks to US laws restricting
the export of cryptographic technology
and some short-sighted exploits that
allowed brute-force attacks to defeat it
quite easily as computing power
increased it was also incredibly weak if
you're still using WEP it's better than
nothing but know that it can be broken
in minutes using free software so this
led to the development of WPA which
introduced much longer encryption keys
and TK IP or temporal key integrity
protocol which protected against altered
or forged packets and used constantly
changing keys to dramatically improve
the security of the web standard but it
was merely a temporary solution since
the convenience and cost savings of
being able to implement it with a
firmware update on existing Hardware
came at a cost it reused some parts of
WEP making it highly vulnerable to
breach by today's standard
and not only that but device inter
compatibility such a big way which leads
us to modern wireless encryption the one
you should be using unless you have some
older devices that only support WPA
although given that wpa2 support has
been mandatory on any device with the
Wi-Fi logo since 2006 there's really not
much excuse for not swapping out that
Pocket PC for an iPad or something at
this point but what does wpa2 bring to
the table most importantly the mandatory
use of the AES or advanced encryption
standard an encryption algorithm so
strong that it would take a modern
computer hundreds or even thousands of
years to break a 12 character password
by brute forcing it which doesn't mean
it's bulletproof though you know that
one-button Wi-Fi setup thing WPS it's
convenient for home use but turn that
crank off for your business Network
because someone who has previously had
access to the network let's say for
example a disgruntled employee could
break your wpa2 security in a couple of
hours and on top of that if you're
concerned about your personal data being
stolen security comes with you not just
when you're setting up your access point
because even the strongest encryption in
the world between you and an Access
Point can't protect you if that access
point is being operated by someone who
wants to get into your base and kill
your dudes or at least steal your
banking information
beware of public Wi-Fi networks and
ensure that whatever you're connecting
to belongs to an individual or a
business that you trust speaking of
trust in being connected on the go
freshbooks
it's designed for freelance workers or
small businesses it's an online tool
that's why I said connected and
on-the-go and it makes invoicing getting
paid and tracking expenses easier so you
just go into it on your mobile device
and you're like yeah I worked these
hours I expense these things blip Adeeb
lapa T send an email with an invoice to
your customer and get this you can tell
when they've read it and then they can
pay you by credit cards so that you are
spending your time doing your business
instead of playing around with numbers
which let's face it are you that great
with numbers anyway
I I didn't think so I'm sure not so if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff that makes you feel like a boss
and freshbooks is the easy way to do all
your online billing so you have more
time to do the work you actually want to
be doing head over to FreshBooks comm
