as possible' episode for the better part
of a year so I guess it's time to
deliver for starters if you don't know
what anti-aliasing is at all yet or you
need a quick refresher please check out
our overview video here or if you've
disabled annotations then use the link
in the video description
moving along all methods of
anti-aliasing fall into one of two
groups the first increases the sample
rate which means it renders the scene at
what is effectively a higher resolution
then down samples to the display
resolution effectively smoothing lines
and the second blurs edges or other
contrasts do shading and textures and is
known as post AAA or post-processing
since the blurring occurs directly after
the render process NSAA and SSA a both
fall under the first category super
sampling anti-aliasing also known as
full scene anti-aliasing or FSA a was
the first type of AAA available with
early video cards it is best used on
photorealistic images as it makes them
appear softer and more lifelike but for
line art or diagrams it actually
decreases the quality and makes them
appear fuzzy especially for horizontal
and vertical lines SSA has a huge
computational cost so most real time
applications like games have moved away
from this method typically FSA goes up
to 4x but if you have horsepower to
spare there's a modified version for SLI
users which can crank up the sample rate
up to 16x or even 128 X if you are
running cuadros in US a lot just in case
your neck gets tired and you want to put
them in your computer or something NSAA
or multi sampling anti-aliasing is
similar to FSA a but it only super
samples the edges of polygons and
calculates textures at once per pixel
which significantly cuts down on the
required processing power the main
downside however is that it doesn't
prevent aliasing that appears with thin
rendered polygons caused by blending
textures or pixel shaders after a few
more advances in super sampling
techniques CSA a or coverage sample
anti-aliasing was released along with
the GeForce 8 series graphics cards from
Nvidia it produced images that rivaled
the quality of 16x MSAA
while only causing a slightly higher
performance hindrance than
Rex NSAA it accomplished this by simply
detecting whether or not a polygon is
present and then using that information
to judge where it needs to use super
sampling so let's move over to the
second type of anti-aliasing post a a or
post processing a great example of this
is FX a a or fast approximate
anti-aliasing this technique was
developed by Timothy Lots under Nvidia
it gets rid of jaggies or jagged edges
by smoothing the edges on each pixel on
the screen directly after each pixel is
rendered including those in blended
textures and pixel shaders the smoothing
directly after pixels are rendered part
is huge as most anti-aliasing techniques
have to analyze a 3d model as a whole to
smooth the edges rather than smoothing
each pixel individually fxaa judges
wearing edges by comparing the depth
between two pixels and smooth their
edges according to their relative depth
unfortunately this technique does make
some textures appear soft and must be
applied before heads up display elements
are rendered so that they remain sharp
and clear FXAA was such an improvement
over previous techniques that Kotaku
actually claimed that FXAA made all
previous forms of anti-aliasing obsolete
with its speed and accuracy NVIDIA has
also since added TxAA or temporal
anti-aliasing which is a film style
anti-aliasing technique designed to
reduce temporal aliasing crawling and
flickering seen in motion when playing
games and this is a very complex form of
AAA which combines down sampling and
blurring it uses a lot more performance
than fxaa its implementation differs
from game to game and it's only
available on GPUs from the kepler family
or higher
well line this you might be saying this
is all well and good but what if I'm a
member of team red or what if my
graphics card doesn't natively support
some of the AAA methods you've mentioned
in this video well that's a great
question
not every graphics card has native
support for each method of anti-aliasing
but you can usually add one in yourself
it won't always work as easily or as
well as a developer implemented solution
but you can actually download plenty of
drivers that will add in anti aliasing
techniques some of which are more
advanced than what the developer may
have added one such solution is SM AAA
or sub-pixel morphological anti-aliasing
this combines morphological
anti-aliasing a post processing
technique that identifies aliasing based
on patterns and blends colors around
to diminish that aliasing with super
sampling like NSAA or SSA a to sharpen
the entire scene it is natively
supported in some games and many users
have seen market improvements in visual
quality when adding SMA a to games like
Skyrim many of them claim that it
provides the smoothness of FXAA without
the performance hit but of course your
mileage may vary so there you have it as
usual it comes down to personal
preference and you'll want to do some
experimentation to see what works best
for your eyes on your rig in your games
happy fragging speaking of friggin
lynda.com well I guess lynda.com can't
really help you with fragging but they
can help you with a wide variety of
