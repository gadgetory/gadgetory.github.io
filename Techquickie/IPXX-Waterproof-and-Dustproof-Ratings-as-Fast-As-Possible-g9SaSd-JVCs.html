of knocked to his fancy new industrial
cooling fans with IP 52 and IP 67
ratings I got a lot of questions from
people about those ratings or more
specifically I got the same question a
lot of times
- I see those ratings all the time and I
know that they have to do with
environmental protection but what the
heck do all the individual letters and
numbers actually mean let's start with
the letters IP stands for ingress
protection which basically means
something that blocks entry or access to
something else but of course depending
on the application while sometimes it's
important to keep water and tiny dust
particles out of something in other
cases larger objects are the main
concern and that's where the numbers
come in usually the IP rating of a
device or enclosure has two numbers one
to indicate the size of the physical
objects that's protected against with a
second one to indicate the level of
water protection that it provides so for
solid objects the lower ratings are
designed as more of an indication of how
safe personnel working around a piece of
equipment will be a first digit of one
or two indicates that a worker won't
accidentally be able to put an elbow or
a finger somewhere that they could be
harmed moving up to a three or four
means protection against tools falling
or even screws or random wires causing
problems in the equipment and a first
digit of five or six means that even
dust cannot enter the enclosure in any
way that would interfere with the
operation of the device pretty fancy
but while dust can cause a slow painful
death for electronics it's relatively
easy to clean or otherwise deal with so
for us gadget geeks the trend towards
water resistant electronics is pretty
exciting but just like dust the scale
ranges from one to two meaning it's
being protected from water dripping from
above or at a slight angle with four and
five promising to keep out water
splashed or sprayed from any direction
seven and eight indicating that your
gear is protected from full submersion
at various depths and durations
depending on the manufacturers rating
and special ratings with K's on the end
that indicate high pressure water spray
resistance and even close range high
pressure high temperature waterproofness
but for most consumer grade gear you
probably won't see those last two and
that's most of the variations on older
products you might see a third digit for
impact resistance
but that has been separated into a
separate I care a ting now and sometimes
you'll see an ex subbed in for the solid
object with only a second digit which
just means the first test wasn't
performed or was deemed irrelevant for
some reason use your common sense it
doesn't mean that the enclosure will
allow an elbow to enter but can keep out
high pressure water although if I could
invent such a thing sorry I got
distracted there anyway let's just wrap
this up by pointing out that while
ingress protection is an industry
standard rating system it's not the only
way of testing a product and just
because there's no IP rating doesn't
mean that the manufacturer hasn't
validated the product GoPros waterproof
housing for their cameras for example a
fairly well regarded waterproof
enclosure has no IP rating it just means
they might have used a different
methodology speaking of methodologies
I'm not sure if I understand the
rationale behind fractal designs latest
marketing campaign with us instead of
getting me to talk about how great their
PC fans computer case is power supplies
and sexy marketing executives are they
insist on punishing me on camera so when
they heard about today's topic they kind
of went wow great topic Linus let's find
out what your IP rating is turns out I'm
not that great what a mess
anyway oh they want your feedback on
this new advertising concept so check
out the link in the video description to
fill out a very short survey and let
them know if they should keep sponsoring
tech quickie in this manner thanks for
watching guys like or dislike according
to how you felt about the video leave a
comment with suggestions for future
episodes and don't forget to subscribe 7
already you guys use pepper I asked for
salt or Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
