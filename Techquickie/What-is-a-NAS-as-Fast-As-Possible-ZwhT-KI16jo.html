graphics cards or CPUs and upgrading it
might not wet your panty thumbs but I'm
willing to bet that if there was ever
some kind of a problem with it you'd be
a lot more upset than if your game
crashed I'm talking of course about
storage now this isn't a hard drive
lesson specifically but a little bit of
background will help very funny
put it back a modern consumer grade hard
drive spins it anywhere from about 5400
to 7200 revolutions per minute
it's read and write head hovers mere
nanometers above a phenomenally
sophisticated magnetic platter that
generates just about hurricane-force
winds as it spins around inside your PC
it's basically a miracle so with the
mind-blowing complexity of something you
can literally buy for about 50 bucks in
mind the non miracle here is that
sometimes they break raid can help with
that we've covered raid before and you
can check out those videos here and here
but in a nutshell raid uses multiple
drives to act as fail safes in case one
of them dies but the issue is that each
raid array requires multiple drives and
while that may work fine in a desktop PC
many homes have more than one desktop PC
so setting up raids in each of them
would be prohibitively expensive and it
doesn't help at all to protect the data
of devices like notebooks most of which
can't hold multiple drives that's where
an ass or network attached storage
device comes in these handy-dandy little
boxes hold anywhere from a single hard
drive to a large raid array and act as a
safe central storage hub for all of your
data and because they're attached via a
network rather than a single PC they are
always available and they can be
accessed by multiple people at the same
time they also have their own operating
systems that give you the ability to do
great stuff like consolidate what would
be duplicated files on multiple pcs in
one place
perform nightly image based backups of
your pcs some even support Linux by the
way manage your running water downloads
access your data from anywhere using a
browser or even a mobile app easily
share files with others and much much
more now hearing that you might say all
right some of that sounds kind of cool
but if I just wanted to access my data
on the go for example why
wouldn't I just use Dropbox or something
well prepare yourself for some like
next-level thinking here because one of
the coolest things about an ass or as
many vendors are branding it personal
cloud is that you can scale your storage
capacity on your own terms without
paying extra monthly fees there are no
data limits other than the ones imposed
by your ISP and finally there's no mega
corporation overseeing your personal
stuff
it's all being kept on your own server
that actually belongs to you
sign me up right well hold on there
turbo well basic functionality can be
achieved by just about anyone but my mom
if the goal is truly worryfree data
safety you need to consider the
following using an S does not
necessarily mean you are doing your due
diligence and backing up your data raid
is just redundancy which only protects
against a hard drive failure backup
means two separate copies in ideally
different physical locations and can
protect you against viruses accidental
deletion and many other things that a
raid simply cannot an as can be used for
backup but that means storing all of the
data you want to keep safe on each of
the individual computers that you're
managing not actually the most elegant
solution and one that doesn't really
help you consolidate your data unless
you're very very organized in an ideal
world I'd recommend getting two Nasus
one on site and another one doing an
off-site replication of your existing
knives so all of your data is both easy
to manage and safe of course it would be
silly of me to suggest that you need to
run out and set up the most complicated
thing in the world right off the bat
many nas solutions allow you to add hard
drives and even additional nas units so
your storage can continue to grow as
your needs evolve feel free to start
small I'm just advising you to pick
something that can scale so you're able
to continue repurposing Hardware rather
than checking it and replacing it when
you need more so that's an as it's kind
of like insurance for your data and like
any kind of insurance it's going to be
expensive up front and you may never
even end up needing some of the benefits
but man if you ever do you're going to
be happy you have it speaking of happy
you guys because I don't have a sponsor
for this episode so maybe I'll just take
this opportunity to mention
five for clothing Dollar Shave Club
audible shutterstock and Squarespace as
much as you guys might not always be
happy to hear these integrations with
the number of hours that go into
producing this show we would never be
able to support it on Google's payout
alone and it's only with the help of
amazing companies like the ones I just
mentioned before that we can continue
making this content so just bear that in
mind next time you hear us talking about
them a thanks for watching guys like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment with your
suggestions for future fast as possible
as well as any comments you have on this
topic of course and as always tell
everyone you know about tech quickie so
we can smash that 200,000 subscriber
barrier and keep on growing thank you
for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
