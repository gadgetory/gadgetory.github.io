promised lower prices by cutting out the
middleman although this might make
things easier in the real world by not
having to deal with that cheesy
storefront and high-pressure salesman
who's desperate for a commission the
middleman or lady is actually very
important in computer land you see the
software that you use can be thought of
as a club sandwich like stack of
different programs some of which sit
between whatever program you're
interacting with directly and the
hardware itself because without these
layers programmers and developers would
have to code differently for every
single hardware configuration on the
planet which would be impossible other
layers sit between two different pieces
of other software and help them talk to
each other without needing to have tons
of code in common these software layers
help standardize the coding process so
that programs can interface with lots of
different stuff easily and while you
might be most familiar with a layer
called a device driver which we've
actually discussed before and that
translates program instructions and
talks directly to your hardware another
layer called an application programming
interface or API can be just as
important but if a driver is already
there then to serve as the link between
your hardware and programs then what
does the API actually do we'll think of
it like this Windows Mac OS and Linux
all provide a graphical interface your
buttons checkboxes menus etc that are
easy to click on without that you'd be
left tediously typing commands for
everything you want to do like back in
the days when doss ruled the world or if
you're a bash fan than yesterday
similarly an API provides a simpler way
for developers to interact with other
kinds of software a really good example
of this is social media plugins that you
see on certain websites such as a news
article that embeds tweets or a page
that for better or for worse let people
leave Facebook comments under
it both Twitter and Facebook have their
own ap is that they make available to
web developers making it easy for them
to bake Twitter and Facebook features
into their own pages without these ap is
these social media giants would have to
share code directly with owners of other
sites which would be tedious difficult
and possibly give away certain trade
secrets but if you're a PC gamer you
might be even more familiar with
graphics api's such as DirectX OpenGL
and Vulcan which sit between the engine
of whatever game you're playing and your
graphics card driver these api's make it
easier for game developers to code cool
effects that bring your favorite
characters and stories to life and have
them work regardless of whether you have
an AMD or an NVIDIA GPU since the API
can talk to any mainstream graphics card
and as GPU technology advances you'll
see new revisions of graphics API is
being rolled out that can take advantage
of more powerful graphics chips you can
actually learn more about DirectX 12
and vulcan as well as how game engines
work in these episodes but even if you
don't game or argue with random trolls
and facebook comments you're still
taking advantage of api's all the time
if you're a Windows user Windows has its
own API unand the windows api commonly
referred to as win 32 or win 64
depending on whether you're running a 32
or a 64-bit application windows api
makes it easier for programs to do
things like talk to your device's modify
your registry use screen elements like
buttons and status bars and much more
without making the developer code these
things directly and also helping users
by providing a more reliable and
consistent experience I mean can you
imagine if every single program on your
computer had a different looking close
button in the corner
so while api's might not be the usual
star of the show when you're doing
whatever it is you do on your pc or
phone they make it possible for all of
our disparate devices and software to
work
well with each other and enable the
massive amounts of quick communication
and high-end gaming that we've gotten
used to I mean really haven't you always
been a little curious as to how the
sausage is made but if when it comes to
payments for your website or your mobile
app you do not care how the sausage is
made then you might want to check out
Braintree Braintree makes mobile
payments so fast easy and seamless it's
almost magical add it to your app with
just a few lines of code and you are
instantly ready to accept Apple pay
Android pay PayPal Venlo credit cards
even Bitcoin and if some other way comes
along Braintree will support that too
they are fast payouts and continuous
support means you'll always be ready
whether you're earning your first dollar
or your billionth you can see fewer
abandoned carts and more sales with
brain trees best-in-class mobile
checkout experience and you can learn
more at Braintree payments comm slash
tech quickie which we're going to have
linked below so thanks for watching guys
you liked the video like it if you
dislike it just like if you want to
check out our channels boom if you want
to leave a comment with video
suggestions boom if you want to
subscribe and follow then cool beans
does anyone say cool beans anymore I
picked it up from for better or for
worse which was like already kind of a
well-established comic by the time I was
old enough to be reading comics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
