the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos we've all
been there you're watching tech quickie
checking out your favorite twitch stream
or on a Skype date with that Rando that
you met on tinder when suddenly and it's
just so frustrating this is commonly
caused by a slow connection whenever you
stream something from the internet that
stream attempts to read ahead filling up
a local buffer on your device which
serves to ensure smooth playback if your
connection is too slow
this buffer won't feel quickly enough
causing those dreaded freezes which your
stream may or may not be smart enough to
recover from on its own so you give up
on streaming video for a bit and plop
down in front of your good old TV that's
connected to a cable box that you're
paying an outrageous sum of money each
month to use as you flip through an
array of HD channels you have a sudden
thought cable TV these days is digital
just like video over the Internet
it's a stream of ones and zeros that hit
a cable box but does some decoding and
then spits out the popular reality show
due to were for you to enjoy
but for some reason cable TV never seems
to buffer like internet streams do even
though many of the channels are in
bandwidth hungry high-definition so what
gives well it turns out that although
that compressed digital video that
reaches both your TV and your computer
screen is the need similar in terms of
the speed in megabits per second that it
requires the way it's delivered to
either your cable TV box versus your
cable modem is quite different even
though they're both entering your house
on literally the exact same coaxial
cable you see the signals that pass
through your cable connection are
divided up into different frequencies
with clear separation between
frequencies that carry cable TV and ones
that carry Internet data
would you come in more about up here and
it turns out that each channel on your
cable TV Guide actually corresponds to
its own completely separate frequency
inside your coaxial cable and each
frequency is dedicated to one who don't
leave on channel
additionally whatever channel that
you're tuned in to is showing the same
thing at all times to everyone receiving
the signal meaning that unlike streaming
there's no server sitting out there
somewhere waiting for a user to request
something instead your TV provider just
blasts the same signals down the pipes
meaning that live content is waiting for
you as soon as you tune in to a specific
channel this also means that the route
that your TV signal takes to your home
is much simpler
it goes from a distribution center
through a few nodes and into your house
on a dedicated frequency without having
to compete with a bunch of other traffic
or respond to anything that the user
does but when you try to stream
something your video has to fight with
tons of other internet traffic it might
be coming from a far away server that
isn't well maintained it might be routed
through a bunch of hops that add
additional lag time and there might just
be tons of people hogging bandwidth in
your neighborhood because EA just
dropped another triple-a title that
everyone wants to try out and
subsequently complain about on the
internet using up even more of your
bandwidth standard digital cable TV can
still definitely run into signal issues
though if there's a problem at your
cable providers facilities or with a
satellite hanging out up in orbit but
all of this does still add up to a more
direct pathway to your screen with
minimal congestion or latency it's
almost enough for you to keep spending a
hundred bucks a month so you can watch
happy days reruns at 3:00 a.m. almost
checkout private Internet access VPN not
only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once hiding your true IP
address it allows you to bypass to your
restrictions and say
ship by making you appear as though you
are connecting from somewhere else and
it's got all kinds of other great
functionality to it blocks unwanted
connections to help prevent attacks it
Auto blocks all traffic if the VPN
disconnects it keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and other
snoops who are tracking your activity it
prevents DNS leaks and even includes
mace P is built-in malware blocker it
supports multiple VPN protocols and
they've got apps for Windows Mac Android
iOS Linux and even a Chrome extension
with support for more platforms coming
soon P ia has over three thousand
servers in 28 countries and doesn't log
user activity so what are you waiting
for check them out today at the link
below
speaking of almost I almost had an
integration to give to you guys right

the hook so thanks for watching guys you
