you've probably experienced all the
typical trappings of being a corporate
wage slave sitting for eight hours at a
cubicle uncomfortable lunches with
irritating co-workers and useless
meetings which of course feature a
PowerPoint presentation indeed research
has shown that most workplace meetings
do very little to increase productivity
and just see in the first slide of a
poorly executed PowerPoint intensifies
this particularly mundane form of dread
but despite the fact that most
nine-to-five workers agree that
powerpoints kind of suck as a tool to
convey information we just keep right on
using them
what gives what's the deal well it helps
to know what the point of PowerPoint
originally was before we're all looking
at bullet points on digital projectors
workplaces had to use old fashioned
contraptions such as vacation photo
style slides projectors which you
probably remember from high school or
chalkboards but despite the fact that
making presentations for these devices
was time consuming hundreds of millions
of presentation slides are being created
every year and even though software and
equipment that could show PowerPoint
like presentations were around before
the 1980s they were very expensive
however once the personal computers
started becoming widespread software
developers quickly figured out that
using them to show visual aids in the
workplace made both giving and creating
presentations much quicker and easier
and since people were already used to
the slides presentation paradigm
programmers already had an idea for what
presentation program should look like so
lots of presentation programs came out
for the PC in the 1980s with PowerPoint
hitting the scene in 1987 and while this
did make it much easier for workers at
all levels to share thoughts with
colleagues the problem was that no one
really knew how to use it I mean think
about the options most people are
familiar with when creating a PowerPoint
you can choose a fancy-looking
background embed animations to your
heart's content or even throw in some
word art but while all this stuff can be
flashy it often doesn't do a great job
conveying information yet presentation
programs tend to emphasize these bells
and whistles not what's going to get the
point across most effectively and even
if you skip these options there are user
errors too like cramming way too much
information onto one slide I know we've
all done it well you've probably seen
this any given
or meaning or college lecture this exact
problem was actually implicated in the
space shuttle Columbia disaster back in
2003 you see a presentation for NASA
actually contain information about the
defect that caused the shuttle to
ultimately explode but it was buried far
down on a slide which was mostly a wall
of text that actually started out on a
positive note meaning no one paid much
attention to it but this example
highlights not only that PowerPoint
slides often contain too much or too
little information to be helpful but
that has also been roundly criticized
for making people too passive with how
they learn or absorb new concepts I mean
it's almost as if a linear presentation
where slides come out one after the
other is too straightforward instead of
getting viewers to engage with the
material the software is fundamental
paradigm seems to reward passive
learning as a result of the audience
being too distracted by a shoddily made
slideshow while missing more important
information coming from the speaker some
critics have even gone as far to say
that it makes people less curious and if
you've ever sat through a confusing
PowerPoint and you're 8 a.m. lecture
that your professor put basically no
thought into you might tend to agree
but is there a brighter future ahead for
the program we all love to hate
while both PowerPoint and its rivals are
incorporating features that attempt to
make presentations less linear such as
zoom features that allow the presenter
to access different pieces of
information and make the experience less
predictable and torpor inducing without
breaking flow important in this age of
Instagram adult attention spans
regardless it might be worthwhile for us
all to just learn how to use PowerPoint
correctly a good presentation should be
a useful learning aid even after you've
wrapped things up and have snuck out to
an expense account lunch so make your
slides informative without cramming so
much stuff on to them that no one can
read them use interesting visuals that
help your audience understand
instead of pointless clipart and stock
photos of business people and don't just
read off the slides for venom in my day
we used to call that given a speech and
speaking of powerpoints in business
