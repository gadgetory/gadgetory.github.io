graphics solutions out there today and
that promise Mac sword performance with
a price tag to match there's an old
classic problem that has been around for
years that still plagues gamers even
those who own top-end equipment screen
tearing tearing is what occurs when your
screen gets fed more than one frame
during the time it's refreshing the on
screen image usually torn images only
stick around on your screen for a
fraction of a second but it's still
enough to notice in a large number of
popular gaming titles the reason tearing
occurs is because PC video cards
especially high-performance ones can
often render games at much higher frame
rates than the ones that monitors run at
most LCD monitors today have refresh
rates of 60 Hertz which would translate
to 60 frames per second so if your
graphics card is pumping out 80 or 90
frames per second you're very likely to
see screen tearing since the monitor is
getting more than one image per second
in the case of games with very high
frame rates is actually even possible to
have more than two partial frames drawn
at a time now the most common solution
to the tearing problem is vertical sync
commonly shortened to vsync it's an
option you can find in your graphics
control panel or even in the graphical
settings of many games vsync forces your
graphics card to slowed solve dome and
deliver frames at a maximum rate equal
to your monitors refresh rate again
usually 60 fps but sometimes higher but
as we all know games have become much
more graphically demanding over the
years and consistently getting 60 FPS
out of your GP
can be a challenge this is where vsync
falls short
if you turn vsync on and are playing
through part of the game where your GPU
can't pump out 60 frames per second your
monitor will have to wait for your
graphics card before displaying a new
frame which causes stuttering and leg
problems that can be even more
frustrating than screen tearing because
of their inherent tendency to happen
during the most intense gaming moments
with lots of objects and effects flying
around on the screen enter free sync
free sync is a standard from AMD that
promises to eliminate screen tearing
without the stuttering associated with B
sing free sync works through a feature
included in a recent update to the
DisplayPort standard called adaptive
sync adaptive sync takes variable
refresh rate technology something that's
already existed mostly as a power saving
measure and allows a monitor and
graphics adapter to communicate with
each other to synchronize how many
frames per second the graphics card is
spitting out and the monitors refresh
rate so there's always one and exactly
one complete frame on screen at a time
adaptive sync works between 30 and 144
Hertz so while you're stuck with a
display port connection and if you want
to use variable refresh rate although
the other connections will work in the
case of free sync you should see a
noticeable improvement in both
graphically intense and less graphically
intense portions of your games no
tearing visible so how do you get it you
might ask well to use free sync you need
a compatible monitor and graphics card
compatible monitors have a DisplayPort
revision 1.2 8 input with optional
adaptive sync support in the firmware
then on the GPU side you can consult the
FAQ on AMD's website for the latest
information
but Linus you might be saying what about
Nvidia's g-sync
hadn't they beaten AMD to the punch
isn't free sync just kind of the same
thing
although g-sync and free sync do
accomplish the same objective there are
some important differences free sync
while a proprietary AMD implementation
uses the open adaptive sync standard
that can be found on third-party scalars
a necessary component of any monitor
while G sync works only through an
nvidia built scaler module that they
sell to monitor manufacturers
so in these theory is that thanks to its
low
or cost free sync will see much more
widespread adoption but NVIDIA seems
pretty confident about G Singh's chances
in spite of the higher cost personally I
wish we'd all just get along because the
main thing for gamers who are shopping
to know is that for now if you want to
want a variable a refresh rate tech
which you should because it's awesome a
free sync monitor will not do it with an
Nvidia graphics card and a G sync
monitor will not do it with an AMD
graphics card even though they'll both
work normally with tearing with each
other speaking of things gamers
something where is that keyboard I found
it
mass drop is today's sponsor they're
currently running a drop for this set of
galaxy key caps from key puller calm
with a pretty significant discount this
is a full set so that's a hundred and
forty pieces of pvt caps with sublimated
lettering and a cool colorful
space-themed design so why are they
doing this well because mass drop uses
group bys and community feedback to get
great deals on tech products tools
clothes tea and even board games they
work directly with manufacturers and
distributors to find a starting price a
lowest price and everything in between
and the more people commit to buy the
lower the cost goes for everyone so
there's a referral link in the video
description that leads to the drop for
this key cat set it doesn't give us a
commission or anything but it does let
them know that we sent you so please use
that link if you're interested in this
drop or any of the other awesome drops
that mass drop offers on a daily basis
guys thank you for watching this episode
of there it goes fast as possible like
the video if you liked it just like it
if you thought it sucked leave a comment
if you have suggestions for future fast
as possible just like this one and as
always don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
