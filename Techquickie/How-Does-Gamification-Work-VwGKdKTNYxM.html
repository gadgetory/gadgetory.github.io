just one big game where other people are
NPCs exercising is a way to max out a
skill tree and the developers or
whatever deities you happen to believe
in well that's kind of an extreme way to
look at things but with the rise of
gamification the border between real
life and gaming is getting a little more
blurry and no I'm not talking about
augmented reality games or sticking your
head inside of an HTC vive gamification
is when someone whether it's a software
developer or business or even government
tries to make real-life actions
game-like in some way you may have
already seen examples of this in your
daily life through apps like Fatah cracy
which gives experience points for
completing workouts or alternatively
reputation scores and custom titles on
your favorite forums the point of
gamification is to appeal to or exploit
our natural affinity for achievement
competition and showing off games are
fun because they incorporate these
things that our brains really like so
maybe it's not too surprising that
people have figured out how to make
things that seem more mundane feel more
like games of course like anything that
taps into some of our more basic
instincts gamification can and has been
used for things that are considered both
helpful and shady things that have been
cited as examples of good gamification
are apps like habit RPG which is
essentially a to-do list that lets you
level up when you complete important
tasks special badges on online
communities like TripAdvisor given out
for helping other users or even titles
on LinkedIn that encourage users to make
their profile pages more appealing to
potential employers but perhaps
unsurprisingly gamification --zz use in
marketing has attracted criticism that
isn't to say that it's all bad for
example a well-designed customer loyalty
program that gives free rewards or apps
like Foursquare which drive traffic to
local businesses by giving titles and
badges to users that go to lots of
different places have been generally
well-received but the marketing industry
is replete with plenty of examples of
bad games vocation from those awful
banner ads from the 2000s that made you
shoot snowballs at
to win something - loyalty schemes that
take forever to win some useless
knick-knack - the infamous Pepsi
commercial
that advertised how you could trade in
labels for a hairier fighter jet if you
drank enough freakin soda which actually
resulted in a lawsuit in fact that
gamification can hurt a marketers bottom
line by either drawing attention away
from the thing they're actually trying
to sell or to alienate customers due to
bad experiences that gamification also
exists outside of marketing there are
those arcades that gamify games
themselves encouraging you to play like
500 rounds of skee-ball so you can trade
in your tickets for a novelty penciler
something else rather lame as well as
the downright weird such as the weird
workplace productivity programs like the
one Linus forces us all to participate
in like I 150 Linus coins this morning
for putting thermal paste back in the
correct drawer but all I can get with
that is lunch with Dennis but on a
serious note workplace gamification has
been tried by various companies and
we're even seeing larger organizations
get involved with this trend like the
Chinese government which is working on a
credit system to gamify and reward
behavior that the government deems
desirable and although this is a creepy
and a little bit extreme example our own
susceptibility to want to achieve and
win things means that I don't expect the
gamification trend to slow down with
things a lot more mundane than
government spying but if gaining virtual
XP points will help you lose weight or
save you money on your next trip maybe
taking part in this brave new gamified
world might not be so bad
