the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so you've
bought yourself a fancy new TV you've
plugged in the power cord and an HDMI
cable for your cable box and bam you're
ready to go but hold on a minute what's
this festival of multicolored connectors
on the back
what are those even used for I mean
doesn't basically everything use HDMI
these days well while HDMI has
superseded a lot of older standards
those other Jack's can still be quite
useful so today we're going to demystify
the little ports you might find on the
back of your TV or your AV receiver
starting out with a venerable RCA
connector this thing is named for the
old Radio Corporation of America who
originally designed it as a simple
analog connection for audio devices and
actually goes all the way back to the
1940s but because of its versatility and
simplicity is still surprisingly common
on modern electronics on the TV or
receiver you're likely to find at least
a pair of them one white and one red
which correspond to left and right
analog stereo audio channels
respectively RCA audio is so quite
popular as it makes simple tasks like
connecting a pair of speakers to your TV
once you get sick of the tinny built-in
audio rather straightforward but you may
also see them grouped with a yellow jack
which carries composite video this
supports a standard definition analog
video signal and can be found on tons of
VCRs DVD players and game consoles prior
to the late 2000s so while composite
video has fallen off in popularity due
to its limited resolution and the fact
it's more susceptible to interference
than modern standards it's still useful
if you want to dust off the old n64 and
enjoy some ocarina of time on your
flatscreen which isn't to say it's the
best way to enjoy your retro games if
your TV happens to have one of these
doodads Congrats you've got support for
s-video the idea behind it was that
instead of a single conductor it had two
using one for brightness information and
another for color now this cut down on
interference and improved picture
quality it was once popular on DVD
players and even on some game consoles
but it enjoyed only a very short time in
the Sun eventually getting mostly phased
out in favor of what
see a again yeah so if you spot a green
blue and red set of RCA jacks next to
each other your device supports
component video the idea here is similar
to s-video except that the green cable
carries brightness information while the
blue and red cables both carry color
signals blue and red respectively which
makes a lot of sense right separating
the singles out improves image quality
even further and even enables high
definition output component video was
calming on game consoles like the Xbox
360 and PlayStation 3 4 HD output to TVs
before HDMI became super widespread and
that brings us at last to the final
thing you'll commonly see RCA connectors
used for digital audio like Dolby 5.1
usually it'll have a label that says
coaxial on it but it should not be
confused with the coaxial connector for
cable TV service or an FM antenna
because that's a totally different kind
of cable the audio coaxial cable is
built to a different internal spec than
run-of-the-mill RCA audio cables but in
practice you can probably get away with
using a garden-variety
RCA cable as long as it isn't too long
or you could just use this thing call it
a Toslink connector for digital audio
Toslink is actually an optical standard
so it uses light to transfer data over a
specialized cable his theories and
Toslink connectors often glow on the
back of your TV or receiver another
audio-only standard is the familiar 3.5
millimeter jack for connecting
headphones and speakers which you'll
find on computers audio players and
older smartphones some equipment uses
the larger quarter-inch stereo connector
which has the same functionality moving
away from audio you may also find this
d-sub VGA connector which was very
common on older computer monitors but
since it's an analog standard it's more
prone to interference so modern pcs have
largely ditched it in favor of digital
standards we felt like we needed to
mention it anyway though
because it's still included on some TVs
and many projectors in case you need to
connect something like an aging laptop
now of course you might bypass using all
of these and just go with this thing the
HDMI connector which supports both
hi-def video and audio along with
networking on the same cable and
although digital coaxial and Toslink can
only
traditional surround sound like Dolby
visual and DTS only HDMI supports
lossless formats like Dolby true HD and
DTS master audio the newest revision
support high resolutions and refresh
rate outputs as well as HDR for more
realistic images a feature also found on
HDMI specie focus competitor DisplayPort
now on the subject of surround sound
these are at calling on TVs themselves
but if you have an AV receiver it's
likely you'll find a bank of old
fashioned two conductors speaker wire
outputs for your speaker's this tab
style is normally found on the lower end
and can also be used for AM radio
antennas but if you go more fancy
they'll probably look a little bit more
like this now there are a couple of ways
to connect to these guys either by
stripping the wire and screwing it into
place or by picking up some of what are
called banana plugs and simply plugging
them in as for the point one of your
however many point one audio setup
standalone subwoofers usually still use
RCA yeah when I said we were done with
RCA I I lied
sorry now the funny thing here is that
RCA isn't even the only shockingly old
connector you'll find on the back of a
receiver this rs-232 serial port can be
used both for firmware updates and
hardwire remote control for folks who
find infrared just not reliable enough
for some reason and finally and this is
true of both receivers and TVs you'll
usually find some USB and Ethernet ports
on modern AV equipment they can both be
used for firmware updates and USB is
great for everything from streaming
media content to charging your game
console controllers while Ethernet is
for well I mean I don't think I really
have to explain this but I'll do it
anyway for the sake of completeness you
can use it to connect to the internet so
you can stream content from online apps
integrate with visual assistance and
browse the Internet if you're just a
sucker for punishment
and speaking of punishment do you
constantly find yourself racing against
the clock as a freelancer it's
challenging but with the growth of the
Internet there has never been more
