be pretty tough to pull off and that's
especially true when it comes to
computer components where builders have
to deal with the eternal balancing act
between price and performance in
particular storage prevents us with two
diametrically opposed
do I want the speed of an SSD for a
higher price or the capacity of a hard
drive with the caveat that it comes with
slower performance although most desktop
cases can easily fit one of each which
is indeed a popular compromise what if
you have a laptop with only one drive
slot or you just really care about
having your OS and a few important
applications launch quickly and you
don't mind waiting a few extra seconds
to load your steam library or all that
unfinished fan art you've been working
on in that case a solid-state hybrid
drive or an sshd might be the right
choice for you
they aren't called that because they
just run off a mix of gasoline and
electricity just think of the fumes that
would build up inside your case but
because they contain both spinning disk
platters like you'd find in a
traditional hard drive and the same NAND
flash and a controller that you would
find in an SSD outwardly hybrid drives
might seem very similar to regular hard
drives they use the same two and a half
or three and a half inch form factor and
plug into a single SATA port but inside
a special controller manages both the
NAND flash and the magnetic platters so
the hybrid Drive appears as just one
drive to your operating system rather
than as a separate hard drive and SSD
the firmware is also in charge of
determining what data will be stored in
the flash sells for quicker access and
what will instead be placed onto the
slower spinning platters over time the
drive will actually learn what files are
accessed most frequently and will
automatically place those files in flash
memory for you know input from the user
required of course the all-in-one
convenience of a hybrid Drive does come
with some limitations the flash memory
capacity is
usually quite small typically no more
than 32 gigabytes so if you need quick
access to lots of programs and data a
full fat SSD paired with the
conventional hard drive may be a better
setup for you
hybrid drives also won't give you the
performance boost from the flash storage
right off the bat since they have to
take time to learn what data should be
put in the nand cells for quick access
they start out being not much if at all
faster than a regular mechanical drive
and you unfortunately cannot manually
tell a typical sshd to place specific
things onto the flash portion still
though you get the advantages of paying
much less than you would for a
standalone solid-state drive as well as
ease of use for novice builders or
tinkerers who want a performance boost
without having to deal with multiple
drives or deciding what needs to go
where on their own so if you need a lot
of relatively cheap storage with a
little extra pep for your next upgrade
don't overlook hybrid drives after all
they're not just for Prius drivers
speaking of your next upgrade let's say
for example you're building a mobile app
and you're looking for a payment
solution so you can monetize your mobile
app check out Braintree at the link in
the video description there V dot zero
SDK is one amazingly simple integration
that gives you but more accurately the
people who use your app every way to pay
and developers around the world have
embraced the V dot zero SDK is the
easiest way to add secure mobile
payments to their apps and websites
Braintree accepts Apple pay Android pay
PayPal then no credit cards even Bitcoin
and if something new pops up going to
support that too and they're used by
uber Airbnb and github which means yeah
my friends it is scalable and
integrating it into your app is as easy
as inserting a few lines of code try out
the sandbox learn more about Braintree
and get this get your first fifty
thousand dollars in transactions fee
free at Braintree payments comm slash
