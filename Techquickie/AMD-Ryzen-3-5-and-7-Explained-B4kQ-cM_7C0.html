notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos one of the
things I just love about the computer
industry is the naming conventions
you can put your ek predator cooler
inside your Acer predator desktop one of
the best GPUs on the market shares a
name with the world's most mundane
display resolution and the industry as a
whole has more references to the force
than the entire expanded universe so
then it was a huge surprise to no one
when AMD continued this proud tradition
of uncreate of naming by designating
their lineup of new rise in CPUs as rise
in 3 5 &amp;amp; 7 the same numbers that team
blue started using all those years ago
but to AMD's credit they've gone a
different direction with what those
numbers actually mean starting at the
bottom we've got risin 3 though I would
hardly call this bottom low-end every
rise and 3 chip comes with 4 cores and 4
threads similar to an Intel Core i5 a 65
watt TDP means that the small included
wraith stealth heatsink that looks
somewhat similar to an Intel stock
solution should do you nicely if you're
not interested in overclocking horizon 3
will run you between 109 and a hundred
and $29 depending on exactly which model
you choose stepping up we've got rise in
5 which has both 4 core 8 thread and 6
core 12 thread models positioning them
actually against mainstream grade core
i7s except at the very high end so that
one is simple enough but the cooler
situation here is a little confusing the
lowest end 1,400 gets the same stealth
cooler as before then the other chips
get the beefier Wraith spire except for
the top-end 6 core 1600 X which has no
bundled cooler at all and a higher 95
watt TDP ah so risin 5 will run you
between a hundred and sixty nine and 189
for four cores or
219 to 249 if you want something with
six at the top of the mainstream stack
is the risin 7 line up all of which are
8 core 16 thread affairs again here
you'll see T DPS between 65 and 95 watts
and only the lowest end non X risin 7
1700 includes aspire LED cooler though
with that said I'd expect many of the
folks buying the top tier ones to want
high performance aftermarket cooling
anyway if you pull the trigger on a
risin 7 expect to pay between three
hundred and twenty-nine and four hundred
and ninety nine dollars but wait there's
more that's not the end of it for the
first time in a decade AMD is finally
competing on the super high end as well
with a product called risin thread
Ripper this dramatically named processor
is based on their server lineup and
comes in 8 12 and 16 core variants all
with simultaneous multi-threading and 64
PCI Express Lanes these puppies produce
copious amounts of heat you will need to
provide your own excellent cooler the
CPUs are physically massive with over
4,000 LG a style contacts and with
pricing from 549 to 999 they are
expensive though it's still cheaper than
Intel's closest equivalents so then
which one should you choose if you're
interested well believe it or not if you
won't be doing anything more demanding
than gaming Rison 3 is probably an
excellent bet as there are hardly any
games out there today that can
substantially take advantage of more
than 4 cores but with that said the
extra threads and cores of arisin 5
might make sense for you if you're a
light content creator or a game streamer
if you're a content creator who's doing
more heavy lifting such as video editing
a higher end rise in v or horizon 7 is a
great bet for you as for the Super
Deluxe thread Ripper
well that one makes sense if you need
high-speed quad channel memory
tons of course for virtualization and
PCI Express Lanes out the wazoo for GPU
computer high-end networking or like
crazy storage setups regardless of what
chip you pick though there are a few
things to know well - one every risin
SKU is unlocked and overclockable out of
the box so you won't be paying an intel
style premium just to tweak the
multiplier in your BIOS and to Rison
isn't quite as strong in applications
like games that skew more heavily
towards single core performance due to
its lower per clock performance compared
to Intel however many tests have shown
that Rison is a suitable performer in
many of those applications and actually
a better value for multi-threaded
applications so if you're spending a lot
of time in Adobe Premiere or streaming
in HD you might be pleasantly surprised
so let us know in the comments then have
you taken the rise and plunge yet what
are your thoughts so far and if you have
