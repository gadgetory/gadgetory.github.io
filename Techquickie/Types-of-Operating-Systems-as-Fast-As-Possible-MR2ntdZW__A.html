multitasking operating systems or OSS
that manage our computers these complex
pieces of software are designed for
powerful hardware and easily capable of
running many programs at once since
their OS can prioritize Hardware tasks
requests known as system calls and
allocate them processing time or memory
space as needed and chances are you've
already chosen a favorite one but what
makes things like pocket-sized devices
take any power what about the unique
electronic systems like the ones found
in cars or even the hive minded robots
that will eventually defeat humanity
don't these things need some sort of
operating system - yes they do and they
actually differ from PCOS in a few key
ways we'll start with the ones designed
for battery powered devices like phones
and tablets these might seem like they
should be very different from a desktop
OS but thanks to the incredible
performance of modern mobile processors
top mobile OSS including iOS and Android
are multitasking operating systems
capable of balancing multiple background
tasks and user input with grace and
poise usually but it hasn't always been
this way in the early days of mobile
computing battery life and performance
were much less plentiful than they are
today
so the embedded operating systems were
King examples in which being Windows CE
II and Palm OS they had limited
functionality and could only handle one
task at a time so by today's standards
they'd be considered pretty useless on a
phone but my grandpappy tells me they
were essential for these strange devices
called PDAs
but seriously even though the days of
pocket PCs are behind us embedded OSS
are still essential for many other low
powered limited functionality devices
like media player's video cameras GPS
units fancy dishwashers or even the
networking router which is currently
allowing you to enjoy this video at
certain times though such as when
dealing with heavy machinery a systems
need to process requests quick
and reliably we'll trumpets need to be
flexible and easy to program for in
these instances programmers turn to
real-time operating systems a special
variety of embedded OS which like their
name suggests use specially written
scheduling algorithms to ensure that
vital information is processed in
designated orders and within specified
time windows instead of dynamically
switching between processes based on
resource availability they're very
similar to other embedded OSS and that
they are often developed in tandem with
a dedicated piece of hardware intended
to run them and they can be found on
shipping stations robotic assembly lines
and medical equipment in our vehicles
and they're very useful for ensuring
that our automatic emergency brake
doesn't get stuck behind our seat-warmer
activation in an OS processing queue as
we Corrine directly towards a brick wall
switching gears entirely there's another
car thing for you there are operating
systems that try to avoid normal
hardware constraints by utilizing
network connections to run virtual OSS
like servers which can operate several
systems simultaneously or systems that
pool resources between even many more
machines at a time the first style
templated systems use hypervisors to
create several virtual machine images on
one extremely high-powered systems which
users can then access via and network
these machines appear from the outside
to be their own dedicated pieces of
hardware but they're not and a second
style distributed systems combine and
then allocate the resources of many
physical machines even over the internet
to solve problems like calculating
protein folding to help fight diseases
shameless plug for the Linus tech tips
folding team by the way speaking of
shameless plugs lynda.com lynda.com
allows you to watch and learn from top
experts who are passionate about
teaching they have thousands of video
courses that you
can stream on-demand and learn on your
own schedule and you can browse each
course transcript to follow along or
search for an answer and skip to that
point in the video you can take notes as
you go you can download tutorials and
watch them on the go including access on
your iOS and Android device and you can
create and save playlists of courses you
want to watch to customize your learning
path or share with friends colleagues
and team members so what could you learn
well I don't know it's not in my notes
for today but it's okay I've done enough
of these lynda spots to have a pretty
good idea things like digital
photography video editing business key
applications that you're going to need
if you want to like get a new job in the
digital age like Microsoft Word office
and well weirdest part of office
whatever this is what happens when I
don't have notes your lynda.com
membership gives you unlimited access to
all of these topics all for a flat rate
starting at just $25 per month so
whether you're looking to become an
expert you know brush up on a hobby or
whatever if you just liked learning then

kwikki to get a 10 day free trial so
thank you guys for watching like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought its suck to leave a comment if
you have suggestions for future fast as
possible and as always don't forget to
