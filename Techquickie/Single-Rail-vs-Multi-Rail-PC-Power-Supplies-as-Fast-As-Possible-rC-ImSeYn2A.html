supplies in truth it's actually pretty
simple don't worry about it it doesn't
matter if that explanation is good
enough for you click here to watch
videos of my cats instead if you'd like
to know why it doesn't matter then you
can keep watching this video at the most
basic level a power supply converts AC
current from the wall to DC current that
your CPU and other components can use
and then that octopus of wires carries
12 volt 5 volt and 3.3 volt current to
your graphics card motherboard and etc
cool Linus but how do rails enter into
it good question a rail is just a fancy
name for a PCB trace inside your power
supply that the octopus wires are
soldered to a single rail power supply
has all of those external connectors
essentially coming off of the same
output while a multi rail power supply
has some let's say a couple of your PCI
Express connectors running off of one
and some others let's say your EPS CPU
connector or your SATA connectors
running off of other ones okay so why
would having everything plugged into one
spot be considered good great question
again basically multi rail power
supplies have the misfortune of showing
up at a time when Nvidia and ATI we're
both having like a you know junk waving
competition to see who could build the
fastest graphics card without much
regard for power consumption and these
early multi rail units were sometimes
designed with an underpowered rail for
the graphics cards or not enough PCI
Express connectors which forced the user
to use molex adapters that were sharing
with a bunch of other stuff either of
which meant that the power supply would
overload a rail and simply shut off in
the middle of an intense gaming session
- that sounds terrible I want a single
rail power supply well don't get too
amped up there Wiz get good power
supplies are all about going fast
lasting a long time improving efficiency
and looking good while doing it right
well sure but none of that stuff would
matter one lick if they weren't first
and foremost about safety any power
supply that you should be using in a
computer includes a variety of safety
cut-offs that will detect dangerous
operating conditions and force a
shutdown to protect the PSU the rest of
your pee
see and even your house the main ones
we're concerned with here are
short-circuit protection and overcurrent
protection the issue is that if a power
supply fails in some way that your
short-circuit protection doesn't catch
over current protection is what will
trigger your power supply to turn off a
high capacity power supply designed to
deliver all of its power over a single
rail could melt away the insulation on
its wires and cause off fire
yeah that's tasteless but deal with it
before it's over current protection was
triggered
but don't go throwing away your single
rail power supply just yet the chances
of all of that happening are really very
small and funny story but especially
nowadays many power supplies marketed as
single rail are Multi rail internally
anyway so it all comes back to what I
said before don't shop based on how many
rails a power supply has because it
doesn't really matter these days the way
you should shop for a power supply is by
reading a credible review site like
Johnny guru comm and finding a unit that
meets your needs and performs well with
the features that you want the number of
rails doesn't make your PC run cooler it
doesn't make it faster and even if it
did do any of those things many
manufacturers are just making this all
up as they go along anyway speaking of
making it up as I go along I've been
doing sponsor spots for audible.com for
a long time now they're the
longest-running sponsor of tech wiki and
for that I'm extremely grateful but
aside from the bullet points that I have
to hit for dem sponsorship bucks I want
to address the most common complaint I
hear about audiobooks I'd rather just
read it I can do it faster that way
that's a very valid point but audible
has some experiences that simply aren't
the same in book form Billy Crystal's
own reading of his still fool in a
memoir about his career and aging just
isn't the same as lifeless text on pages
now that I'm 65 I think in the year 2038
I'll be mostly dead
or as miracle max and a princess bribe
would say slightly alive and its content
like that that makes audible great you
don't have to choose reading or
listening there are certain things that
work better on one versus the other and
you can enjoy both but I guess I better
do the bullet points anyway audible.com
is the place to go for audiobooks
they've got over 150,000 to choose from
with their monthly membership you can
have something to listen to on your
commute every month or wherever else you
listen to audiobooks not to mention the
other member benefits like discounts on
more audiobooks if you try it out today
you can get your first one for free so
