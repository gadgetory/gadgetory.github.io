death who shot Tupac what really
happened to Amelia Earhardt is Elvis
still alive somewhere in Mississippi but
in the tech world it seems to be whether
the desktop PC is dead as a platform
that we can't seem to stop talking about
with myriad digital column inches
dedicated to the topic you see about 15
years ago it seems like the desktop
computer was an absolute necessity for
most technological interaction that
didn't involve living room experiences
like console gaming or watching
television viewing simple websites was
with few exceptions something you did
sitting at a desk even laptops of the
era were clunky underpowered and far
more common in business settings than
they were at home of course these days
thanks to fast processors that are much
less power-hungry smaller portable
devices have been able to step in and
fill roles that were once almost
exclusively the domain of desktops and
because so much of our computing these
days is aided by cloud processing and
cloud storage having a desktop PC to
install applications and store your
stuff has become less and less important
I mean think about how Wikipedia has
become the go-to font of knowledge
instead of Encarta on compact discs or
how Facebook probably stores far more of
your precious photos than your hard
drive does so because a decent
smartphone tablet or a laptop can bring
up webpages and social media just as
capably as a desktop and because a
staggering number of people only use
their computers as internet machines
anyway people started to trade in their
bulky desktop PCs a few years back and
desktop sales have been declining ever
since
in fact after desktops hit their peak in
worldwide shipments in 2010 about a
hundred 57mm
in units that number dropped
precipitously to only two-thirds of that
by the end of last year
so given this decline is there really
reason to believe that we're going to be
computing exclusively on portable
devices in the near future to answer
let's take a deeper look at those
numbers although the figures might sound
a little alarming if you're a PC
enthusiast concerned about how much
longer your hobby will be around it's
important to know that much of the slump
in sales has been at the lower end of
the market you're relatively cheap
machines from companies like Dell and
Gateway that non enthusiasts were mostly
using for basic tasks and given that
modern laptops and smartphones do these
things quite well the lackluster sales
of Cheaper off-the-shelf pcs makes sense
businesses have been migrating to
laptops as well in addition to keeping
their PCs around for longer before
replacing them due to a lack of game
changing new features that would justify
a more rapid upgrade cycle I mean do you
really think the average receptionist
would be able to tell much of a
difference between a Sandy Bridge CPU
from 2011 and a current gen KD Lake
processor does his or her calendar
benefit from USB 3.1 so where does that
leave enthusiast computing and PC gaming
well if this is your thing you'll be
pleased to know that the market for
gaming desktops and components is still
quite strong and is expected to continue
to grow into the future in fact the
total gaming hardware market hit the 60
billion dollar mark in 2016 and is
expected to grow by 6 percent annually
through 2019 not bad considering how
poorly the low-end is doing but why is
gaming hardware so different well a big
part of it is that unlike the general
can
sumer market people who are serious
about PC gaming often won't settle for
good enough considering how quickly
demanding new games are released
according to Intel PC gamers upgrade
about every other year which is
significantly more often than the
general public and the rise of digital
distribution platforms such as Steam and
the plethora of custom options like
multi monitor the ability to use almost
any controller you want and enough RGB
to choke a horse
not to mention the immersion of VR has
helped to make the gaming PC seen a
compelling one and although game
downloads and VR headsets are also
available on console systems like the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
they still can't come close to the
levels of performance that are available
on the PC so what's our conclusion then
while the general feeling around the
desktop PC market is doom and gloom it
seems the real story is that the PC is
simply becoming more of a product for
gamers high-end professionals and
enthusiasts who are less price sensitive
than normies and I know that those folks
aren't going away anytime soon but

enthusiasts cuddle bear VPN is an
