person can just walk into a room wave
their hand say enhance and they get like
this super detailed close-up of the drug
kingpins nose hair or whatever well for
most of us the experience of trying to
enlarge a photo more often results in a
blur that looks like a smear of melted
rainbow ice cream now we've tried to
solve this problem in recent years with
digital cameras that capture images with
ever higher pixel counts as well as more
powerful computers that can process
these images more easily but what if
that's not good enough and you want
something that will still look good when
it's blown up to the size of Kim
Kardashian's caboose well this is where
vector graphics can be extremely helpful
since they can be re scaled to be as big
or as small as you'd like without any
loss of quality but how is that even
possible well you see the reason that
traditional raster images tend to blur
and distort when you resize them is
because the image file itself is like a
JPEG or a PNG is really just a
collection of instructions that tell the
computer how many pixels there are what
color they should be and where they go
so if you take a lower resolution JPEG
and try to stretch it out beyond how
many pixels are actually defined in the
file the computer has to just guess at
what the other pixels in the enlarged
image would be a very imperfect science
that might be okay for something like
blowing up a four by six to five by
seven for the wall but can result in
horrible looking enlargements and the
bigger you go the worse it gets
vector graphics on the other hand work
in a fundamentally different way instead
of telling a computer what pixel goes
where vector files define images using
lines and shapes and their positions
relative to each other for example the
file might tell the computer I want a
line here a triangle here and a curve
that then zigzag
actly like this in some other place the
computer can then render these
instructions into a nice-looking smooth
lined image each time you enlarge or
shrink it a little like a graphics card
can render a frame of a video game in
any resolution you choose providing your
video card can handle it from a set of
instructions specifying where things
like polygons should go and because
these instructions remain exactly the
same no matter how large or small the
image ends up being vector files have
the significant advantage of taking up
the same amount of space on your
computer's drive so you can end up with
an image large enough to look crisp on a
highway billboard while still taking up
less than a megabyte well gee Linus that
sounds fantastic with better quality and
smaller file sizes why aren't all images
vector great question because vector
graphics are defined by lines and
polygons they don't have as much
granularity as raster images which
define graphics pixel by pixel meaning
that vector graphics at least currently
aren't usually a great choice for photos
and other images that are designed to
look photorealistic and while there are
tools that can vectorize traditional
raster images they tend to lose detail
during this process because the computer
has to guess at how to convert the
patterns of pixels into lines and shapes
and it's very easy to see the problems
with this if you've ever tried to
convert something like a photo of a
person to vector and because modern
screens are raster displays since
they're just large arrays of individual
pixels vector images need to be
rasterized before they can be displayed
properly anyway with lots of modern
software only having partial support for
rasterizing vector graphics think about
how you can't resize SVG's in google
chrome for example so they're a good
option for graphic designers and visual
artists trying to design cool-looking
logos or somesuch
but if you were hoping to upscale all
your porn to 8k using vectors then
you've got another thing coming
shoutout to Pearl Auto for supporting
our channel pearl auto makes a set of
rearview cameras that fit around your
license plate and synch with your
smartphone they're quick and easy to
install you only need a screw driver to
mount a camera frame on your license
plate then you just plug in the adapter
to your onboard diagnostic port and
mount your phone to your dash you can
actually operate it with an app that's
already available for iOS and Android
the camera frame has two HD cameras
which give audio and visual alerts to
warn you of obstacles in yourway
allowing you to switch between normal
and wide-angle lenses and even see
around corners in day or night it works
on any car has a solar powered panel so
it stays charged on its own it uses
bluetooth technology to connect to your
camera without wires and the Pearl app
will automatically update to add
additional features soon rear view
cameras will be mandatory on all new
cars in the US not because it's like a
fancy-pants feature but because it
legitimately improves the safety of the
vehicles operation and Pearl Auto has a
special offer just for our viewers head
over to pro-law TOCOM slash tech quickie
to get free two-day shipping if all that
sounds pretty darn sweet we've got that
