favorite web site or watching your
favorite online video stream only to
have your access suddenly slowed to a
crawl or cut off
and I'm not talking about a frustrated
parent spouse child or pet yanking the
cord and then you realize that every
other site is working fine well your
initial response might be those ding
wads need to upgrade their network
connection and servers which if they're
experiencing higher than usual web
traffic may actually be the case but
another likely scenario is that the site
is being hit by a distributed denial of
service or DDoS attack these nuisances
come in many forms amplification attacks
nooks tear drops of Smurfs etc but most
operate in pretty much the same manner
by utilizing a large network of remote
pcs called a botnet when grouped
together like this to overwhelm another
systems connection or processor causing
it to deny service to the legitimate
traffic it's receiving the first type of
attack could be considered your standard
blitzkrieg type because it attempts to
directly overwhelm a system often by
plugging all of its ports with garbage
streams like incessant pings are endless
fragmented packets without rebuilding
instructions it's about the equivalent
of a kid in the backseat asking are we
there yet are we there yet are we there
yet leaving absolutely no dead air to
actually respond to say for the last
time no we're not there yet
next up is your crank calls attacks that
cause further bandwidth and processing
congestion by forcing the server to
actually respond to their nonsense this
can be done in a number of ways by
forcing a website to handshake endlessly
with new systems or attempt to validate
spam port connection requests before
eventually giving out an ICMP
destination error or in the case of get
requests attacks triggering the sort of
large-scale file transfers that only
happened naturally when Taylor Swift
releases a new single on iTunes our
third type of attack the most deadly
move in the das2 arsenal is the DNS
server amplification attack or as I call
it the Deathstar this technique uses an
individual pcs ability to act as its own
domain name server to request
the same sort of junk from the other
techniques then forward it to a target
amplifying the severity of the attack as
much as 70 fold this technique is
apparently what allowed narrow drew
Wells to launch an attack on the scale
of 400 gigabit per second recently 50
times the largest recorded attack 10
years ago at eight gigabit per second
alright Linus so I guess I get it some
junk runs in the background of my PC
turning it into a zombie for this
so-called botnet but why would anyone
want to do this good question and
there's a wide range of motivations from
hacktivist groups trying to block access
to terrorist recruitment websites to
gamers targeting opponents to increase
their ping times for a competitive edge
to folks who apparently just want to
watch the world burn but the good news
is protection against these sorts of
attacks is getting easier and more
affordable than ever with techniques
like running data through a high
capacity server or using scrubbing
filters that prevent huge amounts of
fake traffic from causing more than just
a momentary slowdown not that these
techniques help with the last kind of
distributed denial of service attack the
kind we're about to unleash on lynda.com
where we use a SiC 10 day free trial
offer to cause copious numbers of real
users to flood to a site to experience
the kind of learning that only Linda can
provide lynda.com is courses are taught
by real industry experts on subjects as
diverse as programming Photoshop or even
business and since you can learn at your
own pace wherever you are and whenever
you've got some free time meaning you
actually don't all have to go to the
site at the same time so that's good
it's a great way to improve your
enjoyment of your hobby or even kick
start a new career so head over to
lynda.com slash tech wiki and sign up
for your free trial today so I guess
that's pretty much it guys thanks for
watching like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked

more complicated than that or you have
suggestions for future fast as possible
