comes with a new CPU you probably
envision a sad little hunk of metal that
doesn't manage to keep your processor
that cool in spite of its fan that
sounds like a freaking jet engine and
overclocking but forget about it
fortunately AMD has heard the cries of
its users who have been plagued in the
past by high temperatures and loud fans
and ruled out a new line of stock
coolers for Reisen called race not only
has testing indicated that these coolers
deliver pretty solid performance as long
as you're not doing any extreme
overclocking but that they also stay
relatively quiet under load so then now
that we have a line of three stock
coolers that looks like it's actually
better than the 15 pieces of flair bare
minimum let's have a closer look at each
of them and show you how to install them
the smallest of the three is the race
stealth
which comes with Rison three chips as
well as the Rison five 1400 it's
designed for 65 watt TDP processors and
looks strikingly similar to an Intel
stock cooler with its low profile and
round body now if you step up to any
rise in five chip that does include a
cooler or a rise in 7 you will instead
get a race spire which looks like a
taller stealth this one is rated to
handle up to a 95 watt TDP processor and
is even useful for modest overclocks
if you go for the rise in 7 your spire
will actually come with an RGB ring that
is customizable with AMD software the
really heavy hitter of the bunch is the
race max which boasts 240 watts of heat
dissipation and a heat pipe design
something we haven't seen much of in the
past it also comes with a programmable
RGB ring pretty sexy unfortunately these
aren't actually sold with any
tail box CPUs and the only official way
to get your hands on one is to buy a
pre-built system so then there are
actually two entirely separate mounting
methods here both of which require a
thermal compound for your CPU unless the
pre-applied stuff is still on there if
you're installing a raised max or an
aftermarket cooler that still uses the
classic clips that have been with us
since the socket 754 days you can go
back and watch this really old tech
quickie or you can just not bother
position the clip around the mount and
just push the lever around and down for
a nice secure fit if you're using the
spire or the Stealth you'll need to
unscrew the clip mounts leaving behind a
backplate which comes standard on all a
m4 motherboards then you just screw in
the four built-in screws on the self or
spire making sure to use a crisscross
pattern to avoid putting too much
pressure on one side of the CPU both of
them then require plugging your fan into
the CPU header on the motherboard then
if applicable you connect the included
RGB cable to either a USB 2.0 header or
an RGB header on your motherboard so you
can sync with the rest of your system
and that's it so have you guys use a
stock raised cooler with your rising CPU
let us know down in the comments below
how your experience has been so far and
let us know if you'd like to see some
more rise in centric videos tunnel Bayer
VPN lets you tunnel through one of 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
services as though you are in a
different country they have easy-to-use
apps for iOS Android PC no I don't
actually have one of those and Mac and
they've also got a Chrome extension just
choose a country in the app turn tunnel
there on in boom your connection gets
