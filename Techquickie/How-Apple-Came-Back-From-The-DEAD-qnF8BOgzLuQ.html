ever your mind probably zeroes in on a
sports team rallying for a big win or
how people once again think it's okay to
wear cutoff shorts or the sudden hype
around Disney remakes but one of the
biggest comebacks in tech might just
belong to a little company in Cupertino
called Apple and even though Apple seems
to be everywhere these days pushing on
more and more expensive I stuff that
people happily line up to buy the
company was actually on the verge of
bankruptcy less than 25 years ago if you
remember back to that original Macintosh
ad in 1984 it looked like Apple was
primed to take the computing world by
storm and while the Mac was indeed a big
deal for a while the PC had caught up by
the mid-1990s as by that time they were
not only just as powerful as Apple's
offerings but often cheaper you see
Microsoft's strategy for Windows was to
get it on as many cheap commodity
computers as possible
leading to market domination and Apple
was trying to compete by making slightly
better versions of the same thing which
was a losing strategy at one point Apple
had around a dozen different Mac bottles
that weren't all that different from
each other which really confused both
consumers and retailers alike and as if
that weren't bad enough Apple's other
divisions were losing money as well for
example the Newton a PDA that inspired
later gadgets like the Palm Pilot became
a huge albatross around the company's
neck as it manufactured tons of units
but sold very few in large part because
its handwriting recognition feature was
pretty darn bad so in 1997 Steve Jobs
the one-and-only who had essentially
been forced out of Apple over a decade
prior returned and started making
wholesale cuts to the company's bloated
product lines he whittled the Mac lineup
down to just two desktops and two
laptops while laying off tons of
employees and eliminating failures like
the Newton that simply weren't making
money jobs also knew that trying to go
toe-to-toe with Microsoft which by this
point effectively controlled the
personal computing space was a terrible
idea so instead he convinced his rival
Bill Gates
to make a 150 million dollar investment
in Apple in return Apple made Internet
Explorer such as it was the default
browser for Mac and Microsoft also
developed office and other popular
software for Apple platforms to make
them more marketable the next year Apple
released the first product that helped
jumpstart its turnaround the iMac which
you might remember from how it became a
fixture in schools across the United
States instead of focusing on making a
marginally better boring beige box Apple
instead rolled out a computer with clear
plastics and bright colors something
that hadn't been seen much in the
industry beforehand the iMac marked a
clear transition to Apple's new
perspective on design and sex appeal a
philosophy that still guides Apple to
this day Apple introduced the iBook a
laptop with a similar aesthetic in 1999
but a much bigger deal was the 2001
release of the original iPod while the
device had mass appeal by addressing an
average consumer need listening to music
it was also simple to use and design
intuitively with its signature click
wheel but what really helped Apple
become a dominant force in digital music
was iTunes which offered a low-cost but
legal way to own music iTunes was very
attractive to big record labels who were
eager to find a way to fend off piracy
on services like Napster and suddenly
Apple found itself with a huge library
of popular music it could easily sell it
was also around this time that Apple
launched the Apple Store a solution to
its poor presence in physical retail
having their own store gave potential
customers a chance to try out Apple
products without being exposed to any
other competitors all this propelled
Apple to become a mainstay in digital
music but they were still far behind
when it came to desktop and laptop
computers so in 2005 Apple transitioned
away from reduced instruction set
PowerPC processors to use more powerful
Intel CPUs giving them more mainstream
appeal and as a result Apple passed
Dells market cap the very next year by
2007 Apple was once again in a powerful
position in the marketplace the perfect
time to release the original iPhone
although it wasn't the first smartphone
Apple market of the iPhone as a true do
device which competitors like the
blackberry simply weren't designed to be
after the App Store's rollout the next
year which gave the iPhone and later the
iPad tons of flexibility for the average
user Apple became one of the world's
strongest brands once Tim Cook took over
as CEO he solidified Apple's position as
a luxury brand in the minds of the
public hiring the CEOs of both Burberry
and Yves saint-laurent moves that really
speak to just how far Apple has come
since its turn around becoming the
world's first trillion-dollar company in
2018 but I will say that I don't think
I'd want to spend half my paycheck on an
iPhone in Burberry plaid Paul's way is a
