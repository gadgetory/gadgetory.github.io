gratification
whether it's ordering at a drive-through
looking up incredibly important
information on the connected computer in
your pocket or gaming with someone on
the other side of the planet we expect
lots of things to happen instantaneously
but as much as our technology has
advanced we're still fighting the
dreaded problem of latency and no I'm
not talking about your repressed
Freudian desires what I mean by latency
is the gap in time between some kind of
input like a key presser turning your
head in a VR headset and the system
spitting out the appropriate response
and this latency affects the way that
you use tons of things in the real world
but why don't elect Rissa tea and radio
waves travel super fast well yes they do
in fact radio waves travel at the speed
of a light while electricity traveling
through wires can go up to nearly the
speed of light but the issue isn't with
how quickly a signal goes from A to B
instead latency is caused by processing
times and since any kind of input to a
computer has to be processed everything
has at least some amount of latency this
can be very noticeable in situations
where a slow hard drive causes doing
something simple like finding a picture
on your computer to be agonizingly slow
or when a webpage is designed poorly and
you can't click on anything for a few
seconds while it finishes rendering
you've also probably noticed latency if
well if you've ever watched an interview
via satellite on a news channel where
the subject takes a few seconds to start
responding to the reporters questions
often these kinds of latency won't
completely screw up what you're trying
to do I mean waiting an extra 15 seconds
to look at that TPS report probably
won't ruin your day but latency can be
an absolute killer in other situations
if you enjoy playing
games online I network latency is caused
by processing at each point in the
network can cause weird laggy behavior
that can result in catastrophic in-game
mishaps or even getting kicked off the
game server completely you can learn
more about latency and games up here and
believe it or not the consequence of
high latency can be even worse than
getting fragged in csgo with car
manufacturers increasingly installing
backup cameras and some cars even
completely ditching mirrors in favour of
cameras such as this BMW i8 we were
checking out last year and I'm wearing a
lavalier microphone on me that'll give
you guys an exact idea of how much delay
there is between something happening and
what's on the screen low latency is a
must so that drivers can react to
hazards in time even half a second delay
could lead to a tragic accident so how
do you cut down on latency other than
just having a faster computer well in
computing context a common tactic is to
use wires where possible instead of
going wireless a good example of this is
how current VR headsets like the oculus
rift and the HTC vive rely on wired
connections to a PC although these wires
are cumbersome wireless tech typically
has greater latency due to more
complicated processing which could mean
disorienting or nauseating display lag
when you're in a virtual world this is
sometimes called motion to photon
latency and if you're gaming online and
you have a choice of servers pick the
one geographically closest to you
although electrical signals travel
insanely quickly latency of a few
hundred milliseconds can still be an
issue when you're connecting to a far
away server and that's enough to wreck
your gaming experience in most cases
there's also software and even special
network adapters that push through data
packets from your game before others so
they won't be stuck waiting
around for other applications on your
system some routers can even be
configured to push packets to your
system first to reduce latency if a few
people on your network are rudely
deciding that now is the time that they
have to watch that episode on Netflix
now of course you're never going to get
rid of latency completely I mean there's
even I - brain latency since your brain
needs time to make sense of whatever the
heck you're looking at the goal is to
get it down to an acceptable level that
won't leave you frustrated or with a
lawsuit on your hands because your
backup camera didn't show you that
little old lady in time we've teamed up
with audible they're offering everyone
watching this video a chance to try them
out for free for 30 days audible has an
unmatched selection of audiobooks which
are great to listen to when you're stuck
in traffic on the train running errands
playing games that you don't need to
listen to the audio - or whatever else
you happen to be doing I've personally
been listening to the princess diarist
by Carrie Fisher a behind-the-scenes
recollection of her experiences filming
Star Wars episodes 4 from Princess Leia
herself and audible is offering a free
audiobook with your trial to you so you
can listen to it - just go to
audible.com slash tech quickie sign up
download a free title maybe that one and
start listening that easy
alright guys like if you liked it
dislike you could just like to check out
our other channel channel super fun or
even Linus tech tips we do some we do
some funny gags and gasps and memes over
there if you want to get subscribed that
would be awesome if you want to go down
below and give us a suggestion for a
different tech quickie that we could
make maybe something on the history of
something you're interested in leave
that down below I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
