behind a camera like this sorry sorry I
couldn't hear you I had some clothes
headphones on let me just switch to my
open ones what's that thank you post
headphones have a speaker mounted
against a solid cup the main advantage
of this is noise isolation and it goes
both ways
if you're in a crowded area with a lot
of ambient noise around you and you
don't want to hear that crap you want to
listen to your music or your movie or
whatever else you happen to be doing
closed headphones are awesome for that
it also goes the other way if you're in
a library listening to your death metal
and the person sitting next to you
doesn't want to also enjoy the
experienced a closed headphone will
assist with that as well
they're great for monitoring for example
my camera guy right over there is using
closed headphones so the sound of my
voice doesn't interfere with him
listening to me through the camera and
they're also great for things like
gaming because the sound from the
speakers won't get picked up by the
microphone and interfere with what
you're trying to say to your fellow
players open headphones by contrast have
perforated ear cups allowing air to
freely pass in and out air I guess is
also another way of saying noise passes
freely in and out this gives them a more
well open natural or airy sound it
doesn't sound like the sound is coming
from inside your head it's more like
that noise could be coming from anywhere
around you and you wouldn't know the
difference now the disadvantage is that
everyone around you can hear the sound
pretty much as well as you can and it
doesn't isolate any of the noises that
are being made by say for example people
operating your camera I personally
prefer open headphones I like the more
natural sound but not everyone does if
you're looking for maximum isolation
from your environment for your optimal
listening enjoyment clothes might be the
option or even clothes headphones with
active noise cancellation active noise
cancellation technologies include
introducing things like static or white
noise that makes it so that it's harder
to hear the things around you or even
more advanced systems that have
microphones on the outside and listen
for sounds to actively try to block them
as you're enjoying your music movies or
whatever else it happens to be don't
