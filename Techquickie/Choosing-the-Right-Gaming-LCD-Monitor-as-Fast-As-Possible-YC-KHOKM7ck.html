well for one thing it needs to plug into
a device that runs video games whether
it's a PC a console or a kitchen
appliance so let's kick things off with
inputs most gaming monitors these days
will have DVI DisplayPort and HDMI or
some combination of the three if you're
gaming on a PC and you want to keep
things simple pick either the first two
with confidence and go about your
business
although HDMI will work fine too as long
as you don't need to run at a resolution
over 1080p or a refresh rate over 60
Hertz HDMI 2.0 is coming soon to address
these shortcomings but in the meantime
don't worry because those HDMI
connections might still come in handy
you can use them for a secondary gaming
device like a console and switch between
your gaming devices with the push of a
button convenient a so that's tip number
one look for a monitor that has the
inputs you need speaking of inputs size
matters but not for the reason that many
people think it does a larger monitor
just puts a bigger image in front of
your face and isn't any more difficult
for your graphics card to power so pick
a monitor that will be a comfortable
size for the distance you want to sit
from it the spec that determines how
hard it is to drive is actually the
resolution a 24-inch 4k monitor will be
about four times more difficult to drive
than even an 80 inch 1080p full HD TV
because of all them pixels higher
resolution displays adieu deliver better
more retina light clarity so this isn't
a problem per se it's just something
that you need to factor into your
overall upgrade budget but with the
basics out of the way it's time to get
into the more advanced stuff what makes
a monitor great for gaming compared to
another one personally I like to see
great color reproduction and I'm willing
to trade some of these things I'm about
to talk about for that but that won't be
true for everyone and color accuracy
doesn't give you a competitive edge this
stuff does first up is the response time
pixels or dots on LCD monitors don't
work the same way
as a little tube style CRT monitors and
when the image updates they actually
gradually shift from one color to
another the slower the pixels of your
monitor the more motion blur or ugly
streaking that you'll see behind moving
objects on screen this
is undesirable look for a monitor with
great a great response times under 8 to
16 milliseconds for casual reuse or
around 1 to 2 milliseconds for
competitive use next the refresh rate of
a panel expressed in hertz refers to the
number of times an image is sent to the
display every second BenQ has a great
graphic that illustrates the benefit of
this but I think it should be pretty
self-explanatory
if your eyes are getting more updates
per second you're getting information
slightly faster than your competitor if
a definite advantage and very fast
monitors today can run it up to 144
Hertz at 1080p that means you stand to
get every frame up to 10 milliseconds
sooner than a fellow combatant using a
60 Hertz display next up is a spec that
manufacturers don't report but that's
easily as important as the others input
leg or display leg your PC outputs a
signal sure but there are electronics
inside your monitor that need to
translate that signal into something
that the panel can understand this
processing introduces a delay that means
you can be seeing an individual frame
anywhere from a few milliseconds later
than it was output by your video card
all the way up to 50 milliseconds later
or more for competitive use look for a
display with input lag under 10
milliseconds but don't take the
manufacturers word for input lag specs
or any of this stuff LCD makers are
notorious for just inventing completely
meaningless specifications that suit
their marketing purposes and nothing
else so be sure to check out sites like
blur Busters to get the skinny on the
latest gaming displays and that's just
still kind of the basics other features
like 3d vision for stereoscopic gaming
wider more cinematic aspect ratios low
persistence modes with backlight
strobing and finally g-sync or
ActiveSync modes to let your graphics
card tell the display when to update can
all have a dramatic impact on your
experience so with that said it's
possible that this guide actually raised
more questions than it answered for you
but don't worry if that's the case and
you still want some help drilling down
on the details about these different
specs or features or if you just want to
be hands-off and pick the things that
are important to you and then get
someone else to help you
pick an exact model head over to Linus
