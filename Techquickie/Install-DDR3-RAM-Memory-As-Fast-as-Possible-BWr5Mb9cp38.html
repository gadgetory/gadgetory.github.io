loves me follow along it's easy you'll
see a critical part of any successful
around installation is picking the right
memory in this case we need third
generation DDR ddr3 we can accept memory
speeds up to 1866 megahertz so we're
going to use 1600 megahertz memory and
voltages key as well this motherboard
calls for anything at one point six five
volts or less so our memory is rated for
1.5 volts so that's just fine if you
want to be a hundred percent sure you
can check the qvl or qualified vendor
list on the motherboard manufacturer
website however a lot of the time those
lists are out of date and you're better
off to just find something that has a
specification that matches what your
motherboard accepts and try it out now
most motherboards have tabs on both
sides of the memory slot this is to
latch the memory into place what you
might notice however is that some
motherboards only have a tab on one side
this is to reduce clearance issues with
large video cards or other cards
installed in the PCI Express slots it
doesn't really affect you the procedure
much you just have to make sure that
you're careful when you're installing in
the side without a tab make sure it
clicks all the way in once you have the
correct memory you need to identify the
slots you're going to install them in
this is a dual channel motherboard you
can tell because there are two of each
color of slots
I recommend populating the slots that
are further away from the CPU socket
itself first because this reduces the
chance of interference with between your
CPU cooler and the memory it's optimal
to fill all of a particular color before
you start filling the others so I'd
install my first two sticks in the blue
slots and my second two sticks in the
black slots some motherboards actually
have the slots labeled in microprinting
on the board itself and this can help
you if for whatever reason you can't
tell from the color coding which one to
use now this is the fun part where we
actually install the memory
pull back either one or two tabs
depending on the type of motherboard you
have position the memory inside the slot
ensuring that the knotch in the bottom
of the module is aligned with the notch
in the memory slot itself
push it down gently now this is where
the procedure differs
if you have a one latch slot then what I
usually do is I push in the non latch
side first to ensure it goes in all the
way then the other side if you have two
latches then I push them both the same
way you can easily check the latch sides
to make sure that they're in all the way
by visually inspecting the latch itself
and for the other one again
visual inspection or give it a quick
push to ensure that the RAM is firmly
seated after that you basically rinse
and repeat until you've installed either
your two sticks or your four sticks in
the case of this motherboard then what
you want to do is boot up the system and
use cpu-z to verify that all of the
memory is detected you can also check in
Windows to verify that all the memory is
even being used for example Windows Home
Premium won't detect more than 16 gigs
of RAM it is normal for the megahertz
detected in CPU Z to be one half of the
advertised DDR speed because DDR 1600
megahertz is double data rate 800
megahertz whoa hey guys thanks for
