the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos if you're
like me one of the first things you do
when you wake up is check your phone and
see if you've missed anything exciting
and ooh what's this
a flashing notification light oh wait
bloody hell it's a missed call from some
number in some far-flung area code or
even another country altogether and they
didn't even leave a voicemail how rude
well assuming it wasn't a wrong number
or another angry call from some debt
collection vulture there's a good chance
that you've been Robo called this is
essentially the telephone equivalent to
email spam which you can learn more
about here but unlike the messages that
inhabit your email accounts junk folder
robo calls and other kinds of phone spam
can be far more intrusive and because
they don't have subject lines it can
also be much more difficult to know
whether a call from a random number is
from a scammer or an annoying political
campaign before you pick up so why is
Robo calling so pervasive and what can
you do about it well although
telemarketing was obviously around way
before the internet era modern voice
over IP or VoIP services like Google
Hangouts or Skype have made it much
easier to call tons of different phone
numbers at once many times
unscrupulous callers that use automatic
dialer x' don't even bother working off
of a database they just call tons of
random combinations hoping that if they
throw enough darts some of them will hit
a target VoIP has also made it extremely
easy for Robo callers and scammers to
use a trick called caller ID spoofing
where a phone call will show up as being
from a different number than it actually
is
and although this isn't a rock-solid way
for callers to mask their true
identities it is very effective at
defeating spam detection systems wait a
minute
spam detection
systems so we have solutions in place
they just don't work well sort of many
modern smartphones can connect to
databases that check incoming calls
against known spam numbers and provide a
visual warning if there's a match
letting you know that you may not want
to answer and there are third-party apps
that provide similar functionality but
as I mentioned before these aren't
perfect solutions due to the caller ID
spoofing and the fact that some of the
data is crowd-sourced
and inherently error-prone data
collection method furthermore if you're
on a more traditional landline these
spam spotting features may be completely
unavailable to you so unsurprisingly
governments have tried to legislate the
problem out of existence with mixed
success who didn't see that one coming
right the United States has had a Do Not
Call Registry for 14 years where you can
sign up to tell telemarketers not to
contact you but this doesn't cover
completely automated calls just ones
with a human on the other end trying to
sell you the world's most powerful
toilet plunger or whatever so the FCC in
the u.s. is currently attempting to work
with major carriers to block spoofed
numbers that aren't assigned to anyone
on record so as to reduce scam robo
calls many of which have actually ripped
people off or stolen their personal data
by pretending to be tax collectors or
other government officials however
robocopy however robocalling is still
allowed under a number of circumstances
for example you may still get calls from
polling firms taking surveys or more
irritatingly from political campaigns
and committees during election season
which makes me wonder if I should start
my own single issue political party
focused on reading the country of phone
spam completely then again we need to
find some way to get the word out hmm
