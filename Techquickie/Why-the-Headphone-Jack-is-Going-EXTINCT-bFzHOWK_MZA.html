2016 the company was widely ridiculed
for describing its decision to omit the
formerly universal headphone jack as
courageous a term that is usually
reserved for people like War veterans
and cancer survivors but marketing
bombast aside Apple started a trend as
they so typically do and these days many
other smartphone manufacturers are
ditching the headphone jack is there
actually a good reason for this
now the cynics quickly crafted their own
theories Apple was trying to be
different just because or maybe they
were trying to push they're conveniently
just released not to mention expensive
wireless air pods which is obviously
going to be easier if the alternative is
a clunky looking dongle or maybe they
just wanted more of that sweet sweet
lightning connector royalty money for
the third-party headphones that would
inevitably show up down the line
featuring that connector but none of
these explained the industry trend that
was about to take place I mean did the
others follow suit just because they
wanted to be cool like Apple well hold
on a minute now maybe there were some
solution Anakin's going on here but the
official explanation that Apple gave
once you get past the nonsense about
courage actually made quite a bit of
sense smartphones are really miniature
computers and the companies that
manufacture them are tasked with taking
the basic functions of a machine that
has traditionally occupied a large chunk
of your desk or at best your backpack
and fit them into something that can
comfortably rest in your pocket and they
also provided the admittedly very
reasonable rationale that fewer points
of ingress made it easier for their
latest device to officially be
water-resistant I mean here's the thing
we kind of take it for granted because
smartphones even waterproof ones are
everywhere but all of that stuff is not
trivial to do and it requires very
efficient use of just about every bit of
available space inside the device so it
shouldn't have surprised anyone that
manufacturers including Apple had been
increasingly viewing the headphone jack
as a
space hog that just doesn't justify how
much real estate it takes up and this is
especially true when you consider that
some people already didn't use it and
they've got so many extra features that
they're trying to cram into these phones
to make them stand out from the
competition from 3d face recognition
sensors to triple camera setups to more
spacious batteries and this is all in
the name of differentiating their phone
from their competitors in a world where
truly tiny differences between models
can make or break sales and according to
the folks calling the shots for these
manufacturers trends like displays that
take up as much of the front of the
phone as possible and thin sleek chassis
are driven directly by consumer demand
this has led to not just headphone jacks
but also bezels and even physical
buttons ending up going the way of the
television channel dial now we aren't
going to defend every reason
some companies claims that they were
ditching the headphone jack because it
delivers poor audio quality compared to
wireless solutions or headphones that
connect digitally via a USB C or a
lightning port but while an analogue
connection can be affected by electrical
interference from other components
inside a phone many users were perfectly
happy with the sound quality they were
getting and the convenience factor of
something that's compatible with all
your old stuff is pretty high but
regardless of the intentions of the
company that made your smart phone the
disappearance of the headphone jack
looks like it's a trend that's going to
be very hard or maybe even impossible to
reverse even though many users have
lamented that Bluetooth USB C and
lightning headphones often don't provide
good enough sound quality or a good
enough user experience to justify their
price tags throw in then the fact that
you often have to buy a separate adapter
just to listen to your headphones and
charge your phone at the same time and
taking out the headphone jack remains a
controversial decision more than two
years after we were all first introduced
to the idea well I for one accept
I think it's gonna be okay as long as
this doesn't become a trend in the
tablet space that wait what really I
mean come on do you have an extra five
minutes per day what a tremendous
problem and I've got the solution using
