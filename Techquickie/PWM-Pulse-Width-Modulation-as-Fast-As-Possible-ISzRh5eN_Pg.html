fantastic light show with all those LEDs
how the lights fade and change colors is
there a legion of pixies with an amazing
array of dimmer switches coordinated
precisely so that your friends are
impressed with your RGB lighting well
the reality is a bit less fantastical
but with the recent unionization of
Pixies we have the much more practical
pulse width modulation so what is pulse
width modulation PWM varies the
perceived power going to an electronic
device by very quickly turning the power
on and off the perceived output is
changed by varying the duty cycle now
the duty cycle isn't the time it takes
your dog to spin around before going
about its business but instead how long
the signal is turned on versus turned
off this means with the duty cycle of
50% the signal is turned on half the
time and off the other half where is a
duty cycle of 100% means the signal is
always on an important part of the duty
cycle is the switching frequency or how
fast the signals turn on and off for
instance turning an LED on for a second
and then off for a second would be a
duty cycle of 50% but the LED won't be
half as bright it will just be annoying
to make the LED appear dimmer the on/off
switching has to be faster than the
flicker fusion rate or how quickly a
light has to turn on and off to be
perceived too by the brain as being
continuously on in humans the flicker
fusion rate is around 18 times per
second typically LEDs controlled by PWM
will be switched on and off over a
hundred times per second or 100 Hertz by
using a duty cycle of 25% at 100 Hertz
it means that the LED would be turned on
and off 100 times per second but the
duration of each on cycle is only a
quarter of the time making the LED
appear 25% as bright and as you probably
know PWM is also useful for quiet and
efficient PC cooling older fans
controlled from the motherboard had very
poor speed control meaning that the fans
would run much faster and louder than
they act
needed to be at that point in time pwm
fans however allow for the motherboard
to easily control the fan speed giving
low quiet fan speeds when just browsing
the web to gale force winds when you're
playing crisis so can we dim alight or
change a fan speed without using PWM
well older systems might use DC voltage
control this works by changing the
resistance in a circuit the more
resistance the less power transmitted to
the fan or light since there is no
switching DC control has the advantage
of smoother power delivery but they
often don't offer the same range of
speeds that a PWM fan does not to
mention that any power that isn't being
used gets wasted as heat which is why
old dimmer switches use the same amount
of power no matter how much light they
made it has been said that PWM monitors
can cause eye strain from the constant
flickering although makers of DC
controlled monitors seem to pretty much
be the only ones that are saying this so
trust them if you want
beyond changing how much power is going
to something PWM can be used to transmit
data between two devices where pulses of
different lengths represent the data
being transferred this is how your TV
remote switches channels and how data is
transmitted from cell towers to your
phone PWM is also used in some audio
amplifiers making them extremely
efficient
the typical efficiency of a non PWM
amplifier is between 25% and 50% while a
PWM amp can reach efficiencies of 99%
the cool operation and high efficiency
makes these amplifiers popular in car
audios you can bump t-swift all day
without you know turning your dash into
a frying-pan tunnel Bayer VPN allows you
to tunnel into twenty different
countries giving you the access to
browse the internet from that country
and they have easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac and I also have a
Chrome extension just choose a country
in the app turn tunnel bear on and watch
as your bear tunnels your internet
connection to your new location when you
do turn tunnel bear on two things happen
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
to one in that new country that you
chose total bear lets you bypass all the
annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal use
there's no need to mess around with port
configurations DNS or any other router
settings tunnel bear handles all that it
is just just simple and they also have a
top rated privacy policy and do not log
user activity you can try out tunnel
Bayer VPN with five hundred megabytes
for free no credit card required and if
you do choose to get a year of unlimited
data you can save 10% by going to tunnel
bear comm slash Linus alright guys if
you like this video like it if you
dislike this video dislike it get
subscribed let us know in the comments
down below if there's other stuff you'd
like us to cover and check out this
video which is Dennis's third favorite
channel super fun not his first not his
second very specifically his third and
there's very good reasons for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
