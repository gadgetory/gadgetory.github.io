the mass-market the general opinion was
that it was a fad that would pass much
like any other with many people clinging
tightly to the analogue buttons on their
phones and claiming that things like
texting could never be the same without
them but fast-forward to today and it's
practically impossible to find any of
those previous skeptics who don't
currently have their faces buried in a
new touchscreen device tapping and
swiping away but how did it all get
started well the first touchscreens were
developed all the way back in the 1960s
using a capacitive design which works by
coding blasts with an electrically
conductive surface now as we all
remember from the first matrix film
human beings are basically just
batteries waiting around to be harvested
by the machine so whenever one of our
conductive little digits comes in
contact with this type of screen the
processor can sense the difference in
charge as an input and although this
technology was developed decades ago the
same basic idea is used in even the
highest end smartphones today cool right
but just like anything else these
wonderful devices don't function well
under certain adverse conditions
condensation from cold damp weather can
get to your screen and get it wet
causing it to register random presses
and surface materials such as dirt or
even the oil from your fingers can also
impede a capacitive touchscreens
functionality I mean not to mention that
they can't normally be used with a
gloved hand so in cases where speed and
sensitivity are not as important as
reliability and functionality resistive
screens can be a better option you'll
often see these on kiosks cash registers
ATMs and other places where durability
really counts so these operate by having
two thin sheets set apart by a small gap
one of which has a current applied to it
while the other is connected to voltage
sensors whenever the screen is touched
it causes the current and sensor layers
to make contact registering an input
because the outer surface of the screen
doesn't contain any sensitive
electronics resistive touchscreen
and up very well to environmental
hazards and careless users and can be
used with styluses gloves and really any
blunt objects though you won't see them
very often in phones or tablets due to
their bulk and lack of precision
now as great as current touchscreen
technology is I mean are we ever going
to see it do more than just allow us to
pick stuff on a display
what if touchscreens could touch you
back well researchers are now trying to
answer that very question with a number
of different approaches for instance the
prototype whew so to display from Japan
is made of optical fibers making it feel
furry and aside from making your dog
jealous because you couldn't stop
petting your new phone it could have
applications in interior design
marketing I mean imagine a football
field made of these fibers that could
change the appearance or or detect
exactly where the receivers feet were
when he fell out of bounds cool stuff
right but it's not for everyone and if
you don't want your screen to feel like
a puppy there are a number of cool
things in the works that can provide all
sorts of tactile feedback a project
called ultra haptics out of England is
launching a system that enables both
touch inputs and feedback in midair
using ultrasonic pulses and Disney
research is working on a similar system
that uses precisely directed blown air
for virtual reality experiences gaming
and warned speaking of Disney research
they're also developing the Tesla touch
system which uses minut changes in
voltage on the touchscreen itself to
actually make the screen mimic different
gestures I mean imagine a picture of
sandpaper feeling rough when you run
your finger across it or a large file
feeling heavier than a small one when
you drag it to a different folder I mean
who knows maybe one day you'll be able
to feel tech quickie videos though I'm
not sure if anyone's going to like that
idea very much but you know what's a
good idea Squarespace head over to
