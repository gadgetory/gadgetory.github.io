the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos we have
gotten use to most everything having
some kind of a speed limit the roads we
drive on the airplanes we fly and even
the photons of light hitting your
eyeballs right now with the latter being
the most probable reason that we haven't
heard from et since he left but what
about the Internet in just two decades
we've gone from 28 K connections to
speeds of a hundred megabits per second
being the norm and with demand for even
faster performance and more connectivity
thanks to a streaming video digital game
distribution and Internet enabled smart
gadgets the question becomes where
exactly is the roof on this thing well
let's start by having a look at the
fastest current internet speeds and I'm
not talking about the handful of people
in like Estonia or North Carolina who
have 10 gigabit connections at home you
gotta think much bigger than that the
Internet backbone that forms the main
highways for the world's data although
there are plenty of routes that boast
speeds of a hundred gigabits per second
or even higher that is actually child's
play compared to the most advanced
infrastructure in the system as of the
time we shot this video the fastest
portion of the Internet backbone is an
undersea cable called Moriah stretching
from Virginia Beach to Bilbao it can
transfer data at an astonishing 160
terabytes per second I mean that is
about like every single person in
Portugal deciding to stream a 4k video
at the same time and get this the cable
isn't much wider than your average
garden hose so how exactly does it move
data so quickly well you can learn more
about what makes fiber-optic cables so
fast in this video but big undersea
cables like Maria use optical amplifiers
at specific intervals to keep the signal
strong as it flows down the pipe so just
like an unamplified light from a cheap
laser pointer won't go on for
ever and hit the moon light can get
attenuated inside an optical fiber as
the materials inside do not reflect
light perfectly scattering and absorbing
it to some degree so by using amplifiers
combined with using several fibers in
one cable and multiple wavelengths per
fiber to represent different data
streams these undersea cables can be
tasked with carrying huge amounts of
information so back to our original
question though can we go even faster
well as technology improves and we
deploy materials that can reflect light
more effectively and find more efficient
ways of using the light spectrum maybe
by cramming more wavelengths into a
single fiber we could actually see
speeds of over a petabyte per second and
even higher on just one fibre and then
you could actually multiply even that by
several times by putting several fibers
into one cable as long as the rest of
the infrastructure can handle processing
and separating all of the different
signals passing through it and keep in
mind that most modern optical networks
use infrared light which is relatively
low frequency and therefore can't carry
as much information as more energetic
high-frequency forms of radiation so in
the future we may even see information
carried via UV light if we can find an
effective way to transmit it using
materials that can stand up to its
higher energies and keep it from being
attenuated too much though we probably
wouldn't want to use it to replace Wi-Fi
unless y'all want a bunch of skin cancer
so the answer then well you can always
build a fatter pipe or use higher
frequencies to go faster meaning that in
theory there isn't really an upper limit
that we can identify quite yet but of
course in the real world concerns about
cost practicality signal strength energy
consumption and safety will provide
concrete challenges and do remember of
course that your home internet
connection
will always be several orders of
slower than whatever Microsoft is
installing on the ocean floor so despite
the talk about petabyte connections you
might want to hold off on those plans to
invite your whole neighborhood over for
a 10,000 strong tech quickie episode in
4k party no matter how appealing that
might sound speaking of appealing check
out world of warships the thinking man's
action game not only is it free to play
but the game allows you to team up with
other players to take control of real
warships from across the globe
I mean not literally of course you're
not actually like controlling a real
worship meanwhile it's like out there
like firing uh stuff no it's not like
that but you can dominate the oceans
with a naval fleet featuring some of
history's most iconic vessels like the
USS Indianapolis and you can unlock new
ships as you play world of warships
features highly detailed models weather
effects and realistic battle mechanics
to make you feel like a real naval
commander plus there's always something
new being added to the game every week
since it launched over 200 ships from 8
different nations have been added with
over 7 million players worldwide so
right now new players can click the link
in the video description and use the
invite code play warships 2018 all caps
to get perks including 250 doubloons a
million credits 3 days of premium access
and a premium ship so go give world of
warships a try today so thanks for
watching guys you can dislike or like
