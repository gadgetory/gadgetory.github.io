3d movies the Nintendo 3ds and oculus
rift are all recent examples but 3d
technology has been around for a while
so how does it work
first you need to understand how the
brain is able to see 3d objects in the
first place because your two eyes have
some distance between them each eye sees
a slightly different view of the world
objects which are closer to you appear
to be in different positions when
compared to things that are further away
this is called parallax and it's the
basis for how all 3d technology works
these two slightly different views are
then combined together in the brains
visual cortex to form a mental 3d image
so 3d technology simply has to trick the
brain into thinking that something is 3d
when it's really not this is
accomplished by presenting two slightly
different images to each of your two
eyes there are several ways to do this
first up stereograms this is how those
old view master 3d toys worked each eye
simply looks directly at a different
image which are so close to your face
that you can't help but focus one eye on
each of them oculus rift also works this
way with each eye seeing a slightly
different image but you don't even need
a special device to make this work you
can just place the two images
side-by-side like this hilarious picture
of beardless terran from 2006 all you
need to do is cross your eyes to match
up the images this is very similar to
how magic eye images work for this
single image stereogram instead of
crossing your eyes you make them more
parallel same concept different eye
placement this one is a shark some
people can't seem to make these kind of
images work though how about just
putting on a pair of glasses these red
and cyan tinted glasses are used for
anaglyph 3d you've probably seen this
before the two different pictures are
converted into red and cyan and then
merge together to create a sort of
bluish reddish image that looks weird
until you put on the glasses with these
glasses the cyan lens can only see the
red image and the red lens can only see
the cyan image this method is really
simple and it doesn't need anything
special to work aside from the cheap
glasses
however because color is used to
distinguish between the two images the
actual perceived colors of the final
image don't
look very good our next 3d method is
called active shutter you wear these
active shutter glasses which block light
to each of your eyes alternatively in
sync with the screen so when the screen
displays an image intended for your
right eye the glasses block the left eye
from seeing anything and vice versa this
is done 120 times per second so that
each eye is able to see 60 frames per
second it's done so rapidly that you're
unable to tell that anything is even
happening in theory anyway
in practice the flickering is noticeable
and many people get headaches from
playing 3d games and watching 3d movies
in this manner also active shutter
glasses are not cheap that's why the
more popular option today is the real de
3d system it uses a very special kind of
polarization to work polarization has to
do with the orientation of a wave of
light light waves traveling through a
linear polarized filter will all
oscillate in the same direction but
using special fancy technology a movie
theater can project light waves that are
circularly polarized with entire images
being either clockwise or
counterclockwise polarized your eyes
don't notice anything but these glasses
only allow for clockwise polarized light
into the right eye and counterclockwise
polarized light into the left eye voila
3d but what if you don't want to have to
wear glasses at all lenticular 3d is a
very clever method that doesn't require
glasses you've probably seen these
before but have no idea how they work a
lenticular lens is placed on top of two
or more interlaced images which will
only show each of these images from
different viewing angles close up it
looks something like this this method is
pretty cool it's used in printed media a
lot and not just for 3d effects it can
also be used for simple animation or to
morph one image into another and last
but not least we have the parallax
barrier this method is used most notably
by the Nintendo 3ds which uses two
overlapping LCD screens for its 3d
effect the primary LCD screen on top
displays two interlaced images while a
secondary LCD screen placed between the
primary screen and the
back light blocks the outgoing light
with thin vertical strips
it's the viewing angle that determines
which of the two images is visible while
there are others these are the most
common 3d methods in use today
speaking of simulating 3d look there's
two of us now maybe if you stare long
enough we'll turn 3d no all right then
hit the road I'll handle this myself
this my friends is the bucket of
complaints about the last ad that we did
for Dollar Shave Club so today's
explanation of how Dollar Shave Club
works will not attempt to be funny and
will instead be 100% clean and
professional just like your butt and
face will be if you use there one wipe
charlie butt wipes and executive razor
Dollar Shave Club saves you time by
delivering high-quality razors to your
door once a month and saves you money by
charging less than brand-name razors
that means instead of choosing between
worn-out razors that do a crummy job and
going to the store to pay way too much
for replacement blades you can get a
great shave with a fresh blade every
week that's all there is to it so ask
yourself this for a moment do I buy
razors do I overspend so that big brands
can buy Super Bowl ads instead of
supporting a business that charges a
fair price for their product and uses
their smaller marketing budget to
support creators like YouTube whose work
I really enjoy if either of those things
sounded bang-on for you then head over
to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus what
do you have to lose other than some
unwanted hair guys like this episode of
fast as possible if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it and you want Taryn
to cry tonight and leave a comment
telling us your favorite has 3d
experience if any was it habit R is it
the 3ds is it when you take the glasses
off and put them in the bin because
you've got such a splitting headache
love to hear from you guys thanks again
