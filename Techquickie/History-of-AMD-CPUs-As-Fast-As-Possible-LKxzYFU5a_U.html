bit of corporate subterfuge that led AMD
to produce its first-ever CPU the am 98
II which was essentially a clone of
Intel's 8080 that AMD reverse engineered
by taking a photo of Intel's processor
die and studying it closely funnily
enough though the two chip makers later
came to an agreement that had AMD
manufacturing Intel designed CPUs as a
second source which was important to
intel's customers at the time as they
wanted to be able to buy their parts
even if something went wrong at intel
itself thus began a sort of strange
symbiotic relationship between Intel and
AMD where they both share technology
with each other but competed in the
marketplace at the same time indeed as
part of the second source arrangement
Intel licensed out the x86 architecture
to AMD in 1976 which is what allows AMD
to design and manufacture IBM compatible
CPUs to this very day
however Intel ended AMD's license to
print money and stopped giving exact
second source processor designs to AMD
starting with its widely popular 386 so
while AMD still had a license for the
x86 instruction set it had to fend for
itself when it came to overall cpu
design
so while AMD was able to clone the 386
and 486 processors for reasons of
complexity and the time-consuming
process of reverse engineering intel's
chips they quickly realized they needed
to design their own cpus in-house and
thusly the k5 designed to compete with
the original pentium with the clock
speed of up to 133 megahertz was born in
1996 the very next year 1997 was when
AMD launched the chip that allowed them
to become a major player in the cpu wars
the k6 with variants called the k6 2 and
k6 three coming shortly thereafter
these chips competed with Intel's
Pentium 2 and Pentium 3 generation CPUs
offering floating-point capability for
better performance in games and
multimedia while retaining some of the
previously enjoyed compatibility with
Intel designed motherboards due to
Andy's aggressive pricing the k-6 series
captured a huge chunk of the mainstream
PC market with the k62 claiming
according to some sources nearly 70% of
the market for PCs under $1000 at one
point in 1998 and the train kept on
rolling with K 7 in 1999 better known as
the Athlon featuring a double data rate
frontside bus to alleviate previous
bottlenecking
as well as a heavily revamped
floating-point unit to pull ahead of the
Pentium 3 and speed in certain
applications
it was also depending on who you ask the
first CPU to run at 1 billion cycles per
second or 1 gigahertz aim D also pulled
some clever marketing out of its hat
with the 2001 release of the Athlon XP
riding on the naming of Windows XP to
imply optimal compatibility and by
shifting the model names of their CPUs
from a number that reflects raw
frequency to the PR rating system using
a term like 1900 plus to describe
performance relative to an earlier
Athlon chip at that clock speed or as
many press and enthusiasts speculated
relative to Intel over the next 2 years
athletics p's revisions offered
incremental improvements but didn't wow
the industry though a neat side note is
the Athlon MP an earlier Intel Skull
trail like dual socket platform for
power users but in 2003 AMD made a
massive contribution to the CPU industry
by rolling out the x86 64 architecture
as a feature of its K a series of Athlon
64 processors beating Intel to the punch
on 64-bit computing for the desktop a
groundbreaking enough move that Intel
ended up licensing AMD's 64-bit
instruction set extension rather than
setting the standard themselves a
position they've never really enjoyed
being in the term AMD 64 is still used
to describe the instruction sets of
current CPUs from both teams
for this reason AMD's other huge
back-to-back innovation was to bring
multi-core processing to the masses with
the Athlon x2 in 2005 in fact the fact
that I had an argument with my writer
John about whether 64-bit processing
with its support for large amounts of
memory or dual core technology enabling
parallelization of heavy workloads was
more important should illustrate just
how huge
AMD's back-to-back industry-changing
contributions were over this short span
however the solid days for AMD ended
soon after due to significant pushback
from Intel and business decisions that
were arguably over-aggressive
AMD's chairman Jerry Sanders the third
famously said that real men have fabs in
1994 but AMD built so many that they
eventually became an albatross around
the company's neck forcing AMD to sell
them just 15 years later currently AMD
doesn't own any of its own fabs and is
somewhat at the mercy of external forces
as a result and although we don't know
exactly why
AMD's response to the turning tide has
been to focus more on core count in
subsequent performance CPUs such as the
Phenom x4 and the FX series which became
popular with home PC builders and on
adding more powerful onboard graphics to
their ap use although many users haven't
seen enough practical benefit to these
features to justify paying the same
amount that Intel is able to charge
reducing aimed ease profitability what
we hope however is that the upcoming Zen
architecture will see a renewed focus on
single threaded performance what's
important to many enthusiasts and take
advantage of the smaller manufacturing
processes that are finally now available
at third-party chip boundaries as AMD
tries to mount another challenge to its
rivals in blue just three miles down the
road in Santa Clara speaking of being
just three miles down the road you know
what's three miles down the road your
local store you know what's too far away
when you need to shave and you don't
want to go out and buy a razor three
miles Dollar Shave Club takes care of
that for you just fine you get razors
and other bathroom supplies shipped
directly to your door for only a few
bucks a month they've got the
aforementioned ray
they've got dr. Carver's shave butter
which goes on clear so you can see what
you're doing they've got their one wipe
Charlies which you shouldn't be afraid
to use two of if you have a particularly
messy crap so those are peppermint
scented butt wipes for men they've got
their post shave moisturizer and they've
got travel sizes as well one wipe
Charlies in particular would recommend
carrying some travel those when you're
traveling in like overseas because man
those toilets are not a thing sometimes
they've got a variety of razors all the
way up to the six blade executive and
there's no need for vibrating handles
another nonsense it's just high-quality
razors and other bathroom supplies
