net neutrality and its importance and
consequences it will have for your
online experience but what if you don't
know exactly what it is I mean is it
some vague idea of the internet being
exactly the same for everyone we all go
to the same web pages does it mean that
we're trying to turn cyberspace into
Switzerland no in its simplest terms net
neutrality means that all traffic on the
Internet is given equal priority data
travels along a series of tubes in
little bundles called packets that's the
Internet when you download something the
data is broken up into packets the
packets take the quickest routes they
can find over the internet then they're
reassembled when they reach your
computer into a coherent video or cat
meme or whatever else the way the
Internet has traditionally been set up
is that all packets are treated equally
by the servers and other equipment that
handled them regardless of who's sending
them
who's receiving them and what they
contain much like cars on a highway the
speed limit isn't affected by who's
driving or what's in the car so the net
neutrality debate has been over whether
ISPs or Internet service providers
should be able to start giving certain
kinds of content priority over others
for example Comcast and Netflix had a
dispute over whether Netflix should pay
Comcast for using so much of their
bandwidth when Netflix initially refused
on the grounds that Comcast customers
were in their eyes already paying for
the bandwidth Comcast throttled the
speed at which Netflix could access
Comcast's network and their users that
is to say the customers of both Comcast
and Netflix started receiving lower
quality videos and it was only after
Netflix Pony dup cash that Comcast
restored full speed access well hold on
a second line this isn't it fair that
Netflix paid Comcast something if their
service uses up so much of the available
bandwidth I mean doesn't someone have to
pay for all the extra burden on the ISP
well that certainly is one of the main
arguments that people who are against
strict net neutrality often use but
there are quite a few arguments in the
other direction that have really caused
this debate to well
rage on and on one of the most important
arguments in favor of net neutrality is
that ISPs
could abuse their ability to charge
content providers I mean suppose Comcast
wants to make it super easy to stream
programming from NBC a network that it
owns but then slows competing video
services to a crawl unless they pay a
hefty fee in the United States the
internet isn't regulated as a public
utility the same way that say phone and
power companies are which means that
Comcast could be free to do this in the
absence of net neutrality regulations I
mean could such a world lead to a cyber
divide between the haves and have-nots I
mean if the owner of some online
start-up wants users to be able to load
her website quickly will she have enough
in her Kickstarter funded coffers to pay
all the major ISPs I mean would the ISPs
abused their power I'm not much for
random fear-mongering but I think that
given their track record there might be
something to the fears of Pro net
neutrality advocates about potential
high tolls that ISPs could charge to
access their tubes and that could
discourage Web Services that can't
afford to pay extra potentially stifling
innovation but this video won't go too
much further into that and is not
intended to cover this topic thoroughly
and in depth it's more of a prompt for
you to do some further reading Ben if
you feel so inclined send a letter to
your elected representative to let them
know how you feel because no matter
where you sit on the network neutrality
debate there's little doubt that will
have profound consequences for everyone
who uses the Internet whether your thing
is trolling be reading poorly written or
well written fanfiction or watching
videos of yours truly talk about best
filters or whatever
speaking of filters why not filter your
knowledge or filter your whatever
