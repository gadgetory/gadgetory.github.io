amazing how much of our lives has moved
online you can work a full time job
trade hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of stocks and even meet your
soulmate
all without getting out of bed but one
of the things we still can't do over the
internet is vote and I'm not talking
about Twitter polls but like real voting
for things like the president or mayor
and coroner but why we have a multi
trillion-dollar digital economy that's
managed online so what's so difficult
about running an election without having
to drag everyone out to a polling
station well unsurprisingly one big
issue is security online voting is
subject to the same vulnerabilities as
shopping over the internet but the
concerns are actually more severe think
about what happens if an attacker steals
your credit card info I'm gonna try to
buy something
it's obviously not ideal but thanks to
fraud protection algorithms and
redundant record-keeping such incidents
can often be resolved and you can get
your money back
but this is more challenging when it
comes to voting not only our records
kept by election authorities usually
quite a bit thinner but in close
elections even a few incidents of an
attacker changing votes could alter the
results of the entire election where the
outcome at least theoretically affects
everyone who voted the stakes simply
aren't that high when someone's credit
card number gets stolen also reliably
tying a ballot to an individual voter
undermines the secret ballot system
which is used by most democracies to
help ensure that neither the government
nor anyone else can intimidate voters or
seek retribution against someone for
voting a certain way
although jurisdictions that allow voting
by mail or absentee voting try to tackle
this issue by using two envelopes to
keep the votes and the voters separate
detecting fraud in an online election
may be more likely to require tying a
ballot back to an actual voter if
irregularities arise in order to verify
who a specific person actually voted for
so if we want to avoid this we'd have to
come up with some new
case two fairly keep track of votes
without compromising privacy too much
but even if we do come up with such a
system simply identifying who's actually
eligible to vote through a browser could
be difficult many places are currently
grappling with just how much
identification a potential voter should
have to show when they register to vote
or cast a ballot and moving elections
online throws another wrinkle into the
system although you could ask each
person for something like a national ID
number before voting there still isn't
much of a way that the authorities can
know that you didn't sell your vote or
just allow a different person to vote in
your place biometrics have been
suggested as a solution but that could
prove to be very costly but okay Linus
can't someone just go into a physical
polling place and give someone else's
name and fraudulently cast a vote anyway
well yes they could but studies have
shown that in-person voter fraud in
developed countries is fairly uncommon
partly because it's difficult to find a
bunch of people that are willing to
participate in such a scheme and get
them to go to the polls to cheat the
system by comparison online it would be
a lot easier for one person running a
botnet to achieve the same results which
I guess leads us perfectly to another
obstacle even if you had a super secure
voting infrastructure and a population
that's dedicated to upholding the
integrity of their elections there's no
guarantee that individual users wouldn't
have vote altering malware on their home
PCs plenty of voters have a very limited
grasp of technology and probably
wouldn't be able to tell if their
computer had been made part of a botnet
or if they'd fallen victim to a phishing
email that would redirect them to a site
that would submit altered votes throw in
the possibility of widespread computer
errors as we've seen with electronic
voting machines and these are ones that
aren't even directly connected to the
internet plus government-run servers
trying to accommodate a massive amount
of traffic on Election Day and it isn't
that surprising that most places haven't
jumped on the online voting hypetrain
such as it is but this isn't to say
though that we will never figure out a
good way
to conduct elections online for example
Estonia is well known for holding its
elections over the internet with its
citizens using special national ID cards
and readers to vote from home their
government also says it keeps a close
eye on proceedings to ensure fairness
but would this system work in a much
larger country a research study also
indicated that estonia system is still
vulnerable to outside attacks so the
jury's kind of still out on this one and
i don't expect it to rapidly catch on in
other places anytime soon if we can
figure it out online voting promises to
not only save time and improve accuracy
but also encourage more people to
participate in civic life until then
though I guess we'll just have to put up
with standing in line on election day to
get our I voted stickers so we can walk
around with a sense of unwarranted
self-importance afterwards today's video
is brought to you by the mass drop
Sennheiser HD 6xx headphones these are
one of mass drops all-time bestsellers
with over 50,000 units sold and I don't
blame a single one of you who bought
them because they sound fantastic they
haven't changed the driver or sound
structure compared to the HD 650 s so
that means a nice balanced mid-range and
natural sounding bass and the 10-foot
cable has been replaced with a
detachable six foot one based on
community feedback it includes one
eighth inch plug that is versatile
enough for everyday use so you can plug
it into pretty much anything and it
comes with a quarter inch adapter and it
also includes Sennheiser's long-term
support so check out the link below to
join the drop and get your own pair of
HD 6xx headphones today we're gonna have
that linked below so thanks for watching
guys like dislike check out our other
videos leave a comment with a video
