your overclocked octa-core CPU and more
memory than a freaking elephant but when
you're playing the latest triple-a games
on your PC or really anything else for
some reason things don't seem quite
right especially when you're looking at
a scene where a lot of things are moving
around at once or the cameras panning
because even with all that horsepower
under the hood motion blur is a problem
on even the most powerful rigs and if
you're gaming on a VR headset like the
oculus rift it can be even more
distracting now to be clear we're not
talking about the kind of motion blur
that is intentionally added to a game in
post-processing what we're talking about
is unintentional motion blur caused by
excessive pixel persistence you see an
electronic display whether it's a
computer monitor or a headset or a phone
is made up of millions of individual
pixels that change their brightness and
color to create an image that you see so
whenever the image on the screen changes
which is merely constantly if you're
playing a game that isn't pong the
pixels cannot respond instantaneously
with a typical LCD monitor there's
actually delay of a few milliseconds
before the pixels can actually change
now while there are fast response
monitors which have a delay or response
time of just one or two milliseconds
which helps to cut down on motion blur
significantly even those don't
completely solve the problem in fact
even if a zero millisecond monitor
existed there's still an issue with how
LCD displays actually show images to us
like other pieces of digital hardware an
LCD display works by sampling image data
it gets from the computer many times a
second and displaying the samples as a
series of still images these still
images are then displayed at a rate
equal to your screens refresh rate
usually 60 Hertz and your brain
interprets this as movement however your
eye is not a piece of computer hardware
unless of course your name is Adam
Jensen human eyes are really good at
perceiving differences in fluid motion
and while high refresh rate displays
that operate at a hundred and forty four
Hertz or even
haier looks great they still can't
completely fool our brains just by
showing us a series of static images and
as if the problem of motion blur weren't
bad enough on computer monitors it's
much worse if you're using an oculus
rift or VR headset like I mentioned
before while motion blur might just be
an annoyance if you're gaming in 2d on a
desktop PC it can actually make you sick
on a 3d display like the oculus rift
because these headsets work by
surrounding your field of vision in
immersive 3d environments motion blur in
these situations can make you feel
physically out of balance with your
surroundings and cause a very similar
nausea to what you'd feel in a car or an
airplane in the same situation so the
solution itself is a pretty simple idea
well let's just cut down on how long
individual pixels are displayed so that
we don't were not out of sync but how
our display manufacturer is going to
accomplish this well one way is through
a technique called backlight strobing
typically modern LCD monitors are
illuminated by a backlight that's always
on however in a display that uses
backlight strobing the backlight instead
switches on and off rapidly reducing the
amount of time that you actually see
each pixel this is very similar to the
way that CRT displays which were you
know for the kids that weren't alive at
the time of the dinosaurs which are
those old tube things that existed
before LCDs came on to the market and is
the reason that CRTs have historically
been better at displaying scenes with
fast motion at least to our eyes there
are a number of monitors on the market
that feature backlight strobing combined
with high refresh rates to reduce motion
blur as much as possible while still
maintaining the picture quality and low
energy consumption not to mention the
space savings of a flat panel LCD of
course it's also possible to ditch the
backlight altogether and go a different
route so the consumer version of the
oculus rift features a display based on
organic LEDs or olitz Ã¶hlins can
generate their own light through the use
of specialized organic compounds but
more importantly for gamers Oh
have a very quick response time much
faster than the pixels in a conventional
LCD and not only does this cut down on
motion blur on its own the low response
times allow all EDS to interpolate
frames easily meaning that your system
KS missing frames in a given second to
match your displays frame rate or if
you're just watching a movie recorded at
the usual 24 fps and you want your
experience to be less cinematic I guess
it could do that too so whether you're
gaming in 3d using a headset or just a
monitor with 3d glasses these
technologies will help you do your thing
without feeling like you're on some kind
of vomit inducing carnival ride
speaking of vomit inducing carnival
rides our sponsor today is fractal
design and boy do we have a treat for
you instead of telling you guys about
their you know Scandinavian design cases
and power supplies and cooling products
we're having Luke Russert stupid look we
had this conversation already I told you
I have to host this because you just
can't do a good enough job of it so I'm
super done I'm sick this is ridiculous
I've been trying to build this company
for like two years we don't have to roll
the camera on this like okay look if you
need to talk about this and you need to
talk to yourself about how you run the
company no air conditioning people are
like overheating all the time I'm
working well I'm sick I've just get my
doctor's appointment cuz I have to tape
you up look I think what even is that
like I've been sick for like two months
I finally get a doctor's point with my
family doctor yeah you don't you make me
not go because of masking tape I think
you're I think look okay but we were
supposed to have you to the spot and you
were supposed to do Josh's thing I get
dragged into the office and I have to
film this
it's not like I wanted to like okay you
know what just I'm done we'll talk later
no I'm just done
you
um so sorry I hope that wasn't too
awkward guys like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible is that I guess
won't be hosted by Luke and as always
don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
