transistors you have on a processor but
more features and performance again and
ever since the 1970s manufacturers have
been finding ways to shove more and more
transistors onto a single chip by making
the transistors smaller in fact the
widely quoted Moore's law that
anticipated that the number of
transistors on a CPU would double
roughly every two years held true for
decades but in recent years Moore's law
has started to look more like Moore's
pipe dream as it's becoming harder and
harder to keep shrinking transistors
down due to the chemical properties of
silicon so how do we solve this problem
and keep making our computers and our
gadgets faster and faster well although
the industry has been looking at making
smaller transistors on materials other
than silicon as we briefly discussed in
this video another idea that seems to be
catching on is using something called
chip le'ts now traditionally the die or
the part of a CPU that contains the
transistors is manufactured as a single
monolithic piece so there are practical
limits to how big you can make them
before the likelihood of a fatal defect
landing on your die becomes too high by
contrast chip 'lets
are modular mini dies that can be
combined into one CPU package to improve
performance but your main hold on a
minute here you guys might say well
what's the point of all this
if the transistors are the same size
anyway aren't you just adding an
assembly step and making it take up more
room well as it turns out oftentimes
chiclet based CPUs are indeed larger
think of AMD's new epic series of server
processors as an example however they're
also hugely advantageous when you
consider yields so if you're not
familiar with the concept of yields
here's what it means CPUs are
manufactured on large silicon wafers
and that manufacturing process isn't
perfect which means that on a given
wafer there will be some number of
defects so if we take our wafer and
divide it into smaller Chiclets it means
less wasted silicon for each defect and
it also makes it easier to take the chip
'lets that are functional but that don't
perform as well and combine those into
lower end products salvaging back some
of the cost on a large scale this leads
to faster manufacturing and lower costs
with significant real world benefits in
fact AMD's epic CPUs only cost about
half as much thanks to chip 'lets versus
using one large die now although
Chiclets are more common in the high-end
desktop and server markets right now the
technology will most likely trickle down
to the consumer space such as with AMD's
rumored upcoming 16 core rise in cpu
that's going to put pressure on Intel to
reduce their prices which might force
them to pursue chip --let based designs
as well another fun benefit is that chip
'lets also allow manufacturers to
separate out parts of the CPU that don't
handle pure number crunching such as
input and output blocks as it's often
harder to shrink those parts of a
processor down so then you can just tack
those bits on separately and attach as
many chip 'lets as you want connecting
them together with a high-speed
interface like AMD's infinity fabric now
of course the obvious drawback of size
still does exist but until we run up
against the limits imposed by signals
moving at the speed of light within a
microprocessor chip let's do seem to be
one of the best paths forward speaking
of best paths forward the best path for
your business might be a fresh books
account fresh books is the small
business accounting software that's
custom-built for how you want to work
and it's a simple way whether you're a
small business owner or a freelancer to
be more productive more organized and to
get paid faster with fresh books you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online
with just a couple of clicks and get
paid up to four days faster you can see
when your client has seen your invoice
and put an end to the guessing games and
you can take the whole experience with
you on the go with their fully featured
apps for iOS and Android so for an
unrestricted 30-day free trial go to
