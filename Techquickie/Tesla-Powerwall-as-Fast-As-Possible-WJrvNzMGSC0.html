our flashlights remotes phones cameras
cars boats and even our adult-oriented
toys but apparently Elon Musk has gone
and shaken things up again by suggesting
that we all go and put batteries in our
homes - we already keep batteries for
all that crap in our homes ow
so tesla powerwall then the premise is
fairly simple lower your electricity
costs by consuming less during peak
hours and more during off-peak hours
when it's cheaper and more ecologically
friendly to generate it or when paired
with solar panels reduce your reliance
on your city's power grid or even sell
some of the power you generate back to
the local utility company but let's open
up with some criticism at $3,000 us for
a 7 kilowatt hour capacity model or 500
more for a 10 kilowatt hour capacity
power walls are expensive but the truth
of the matter is that thanks to its
features the power wall simply isn't
competing with anything right now so for
anyone who would have needed a backup
solution for power outages anyway
the benefits of using Tesla's batteries
for this application conserving fuel and
money during peak hours and reduce
reliance on the grid without being
detached from it seems to outweigh the
cost for many including entities like
Amazon since the powerwall
and its industrial-sized cousin the
power pack ended up selling out nearly
as fast as a PlayStation 2 did but what
about the performance detractors point
out at 2 kilowatt continuous and 3.3
kilowatts max you can easily overpower a
power wall with a handful of microwave
ovens and is seven kilowatt hours or
even 10 kilowatt hours really enough
capacity anyway
the average North American home uses
about 30 kilowatt hours of electricity
per day adding a few extra kilowatt
hours for folks who really love watching
the tumble dryer run which means that it
would take more than one bigger unit for
pretty much any household to have enough
stored energy to get through the evening
with all of their devices calling for
juice at the same time so that's
expensive hey the batteries themselves
plus installation invert
or solar panels depending on your setup
yeah so why not save some serious
scratch and do it yourself well first
off it turns out that it takes about ten
deep cycle lead based batteries to equal
the storage capacity of a single ten
kilowatt hour power wall and at a
conservative cost of a hundred and fifty
dollars per battery that puts you at
about half of the Tesla solution without
having factored in electrical components
connections maintenance costs over time
and the fact that you'd have to have the
world's most understanding wife to let
you all noun to tangled mess of car
batteries and wires in your garage
secondly with homemade units owners are
usually restricted to on-site power
generation and it's at least not as easy
or efficient to switch between grid and
battery power compared to the power wall
but is the concept of this home battery
system even practical anyway
Christopher Hellman from Forbes points
out that at an estimated cost of 30
cents per kilowatt hour within the
reasonable lifespan that is discharges
in charges for your battery pack most
North Americans would actually end up
paying far more for their power overall
than if they just bought it from their
electric company anyway but I guess
that's how all these things start out
anyway and while I won't be lining up to
buy a power wall I'm definitely excited
for a future where energy storage is
affordable and practical speaking of
affordable and practical FreshBooks it's
designed for freelance workers or small
businesses and it's an online accounting
tool that makes invoicing tracking hours
getting paid tracking expenses and
getting paid that's really important
that's why I set it twice actually I
just screwed up my list so getting paid
easier all the little details like you
know history for your invoices and
seeing if your client has actually
looked at the invoice yet and getting
them to pay through the online service
by credit card is all taken care of so
if you're your own boss you should be
using stuff that makes you feel like a
boss and freshbooks allows you to spend
your time working instead of spending
your time figuring out how to get paid
for the work you did
so head over to FreshBooks comm slash
tech quickie and don't forget to enter
tech quickie in the how did you hear
about us section it doesn't actually go
like that it's just how did you hear
about us it's just text it's very
straightforward but don't worry about
that so I think that's pretty much it
