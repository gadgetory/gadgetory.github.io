how to make your gaming experience more
social
but without inviting people into your
house then you get the utterly unique
and one-of-a-kind idea to start
streaming your gameplay you sprang into
action
preparing to show your battle station
off to the world but what kind of setup
do you need to pull this off well hey
guys it shouldn't be surprising but an
upper range gaming PC is often a good
choice for streaming but there are
Hardware considerations for streaming
that are a little bit different
typically gaming setups are built around
the GPU with your graphics card often
being the deciding factor in how nice
your games will look as long as the rest
of your rig meets some kind of minimum
threshold but for streaming your CPU can
determine how your gameplay looks to
your viewers be they on Twitch or
another streaming platform but why is
this I mean we're still talking about
how to get the best graphical quality
right well remember that the work of
rendering the game that is the act of
actually creating the image has already
been done by your graphics card it's
been your CPU that takes that rendered
image and transcodes it into a video
format that can be easily sent over the
internet and displayed by your viewers
web browsers and if you've ever edited
video regularly you'll probably already
know that having a more powerful CPU
typically makes video encoding a much
easier job now since transcoding is
easily split amongst multiple CPU cores
oh by the way don't forget you still
have to run the game - it is to your
advantage to get a CPU with more cores
and more threads especially if you want
to stream at 1080p 60fps instead of 720p
though it should be noted that as with
anything there is a point of diminishing
returns and an 18 core processor might
not be worth the extra price if you want
a specific recommendation a modern six
core Core i7 or more
or AMD risin seven processor or better
in your gaming rig should make it a very
capable streaming machine some streamers
though actually decide to go a step
further and use a second PC to handle
all the streaming tasks using their
first rig strictly for actual gaming
this can especially make sense if you
already have an older tower lying around
because it's a great way to stream CPU
intensive games like Starcraft or total
war without being concerned that your
gameplay or your stream quality will
suffer as a result and one of the
reasons this approach is so popular is
that your streaming PC doesn't have to
be anything super fancy you might not
even need a dedicated graphics card you
will need a good CPU but because it's
going to be handling streaming only you
can probably get away with a more basic
fork or four thread processor just make
sure that you close all your background
programs and have only what you need to
stream up and running if you're running
into trouble the other thing you'll need
for your dedicated streaming PC is a way
to capture the video output from your
gaming machine and deliver it to the
software that will encode and transmit
your stream along with any overlays and
transitions that you desire for PC
gamers this can actually be done over
your local network using the NV NC
Hardware encoding engine behind Nvidia
shadowplay feature to send up to a 60
megabit stream of the game over Ethernet
to your secondary box where CPU encoding
will turn it into a high quality 5.5
megabit Stream compatible with twitch TV
but if your PC hardware doesn't support
this method or if you're streaming from
another device like a game console the
go-to is a capture card a modern USB 3
or PCI Express capture card will help
prevent transmission problems and Legg
compared to a USB 2 capture card but
other than that you'll probably have to
read or watch reviews to determine
exactly which model is best for your
needs whatever you get though make sure
that it supports the resolution and
frame rate that you want to broadcast
this episode was brought to you by
tunnel bear the easy-to-use VPN app when
people are shopping for a VPN one of the
features they look for is called a kill
switch before you connect to your
network your device actually starts to
send information about itself and what
it wants to do and it tries to establish
connections with all sorts of things and
there are other devices trying to
connect to yours kill switches stop all
this from happening before you connect
to your VPN all your traffic is
unencrypted too so in the few seconds it
takes to connect you've probably already
broadcast your IP maybe a few DNS
requests or even a search query Vigilant
bear from tunnel bear stops this from
happening by blocking all outbound and
inbound traffic so nothing leaks out
before you connect this helps keep you
private throughout your entire
connection time and if your connection
goes down for some reason vigilant bear
kicks back in and stops the traffic
again until the connection comes back
