won't miss any future videos wait sorry
what's this video cult what what do you
mean any Jax is not a CD you just yank
it out right well you can do that but in
this case eject doesn't mean this it
means to tell your operating system to
wrap up whatever it's doing with the USB
Drive to prepare it for yanking out so
think of it as partially disconnecting
the drive it still physically plugged in
but your computer can't really talk to
it anymore but hold on a second we
didn't have to do anything fancy when we
physically ejected CD ROMs back in the
prehistoric 1990s so why is there this
general conception that ejecting your
flash drives is a good idea well the
most obvious benefit of ejecting your
device first is that it prevents your
data from being corrupted if your system
is busy writing something to the drive
if you pull your media out before your
computer has finished working with it
you might come back later to find that
the graduate thesis that you wanted to
store on it is now totally unreadable
causing you to flunk out of your
graduate program get dumped by your
girlfriend and ultimately end up living
in a box behind Tim Hortons true story
happened to a friend of mine so yeah it
might seem pretty obvious that you don't
want to rip out a thumb drive during a
file save operation any more than you
would take out a hot pocket for
consumption after only one minute in the
microwave but what if you've safely
closed whatever it is that you're
working on and you just want to grab the
drive and get on with your day
this is where things get a little bit
grey because it partly depends on what
operating system you're using and
whether you've fiddled with a certain
setting you see windows offers a feature
called write caching for removable
devices that's designed to improve speed
with it turned on any data that you try
to transfer to your flash drive is held
in a cache
in your system memory so instead of
forcing a program to wait around for the
data transfer to finish windows will
instead wait for a more opportune time
to do multiple data transfers at once
the downside of this speed boost is that
it leaves your USB drives much more
susceptible to corruption if you be it
accidentally or on purpose pull them out
without ejecting them first as your PC
might show that it's finished copying
the data but it might not actually be
done ejecting the drive will command
your computer to go ahead and flush
anything in the right cache to your
drive immediately and it will prompt you
when you can actually safely remove it
the good news is that right caching
offers a negligible performance boost in
most situations so in the event that
it's not already disabled you can go
ahead and turn it off here on Linux and
Mac OS it is typically enabled by
default though so make sure that you eat
jekt your drives before removing them if
you haven't given your soul to Cortana
so then back to the original question
yeah that one if you're using Windows
and have write caching turned off is it
okay to just remove your thumb drive
without ejecting it assuming obviously
that you're not in the middle of saving
something to it the answer is a definite
probably however there is the
possibility that your OS could still be
writing small amounts of data in the
background depending on exactly how your
programs deal with saved files and I
have personally experienced previously
working drives ending up with corrupted
data on them that I wasn't even using by
doing this so while the average Windows
user probably doesn't have too much to
worry about it is also probably worth
taking the extra two seconds to click
eject if you can't figure out what to do
while you wait just try closing your
eyes and picturing a CD tray sliding out
for a little bit of computing nostalgia
thanks to the Internet there's never
been more opportunities for the
self-employed so to meet the
needs of these enterprising individuals
fresh books created their cloud
accounting solution designed for the way
that you work it's the simplest easiest
way to be more productive more organized

online payments with just a couple of
clicks to get paid up to four days
faster and you can take the whole
freshbooks experience with you whether
you're a Mac or a PC
Mott's well it's not really a Mac it's
an apple that's not really a PC it's an

anyway the point is you can take all the
functionality with you on the go
