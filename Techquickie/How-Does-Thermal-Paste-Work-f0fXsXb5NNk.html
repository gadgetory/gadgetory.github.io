smelling paste on your CPU can't we just
sit our impressive-looking heatsinks on
top of our processors and be done with
it
no not even remotely and here's why
many heat sinks don't sit flat against
your CPU and in some cases with good
reason but that might be for another
video rather they're either concave or
convex so there's a fair amount of space
where your heatsink and processor aren't
making proper contact also even though
the top of your CPU or the bottom of
your heatsink might look perfectly
smooth even shiny in some cases they're
actually rougher at the microscopic
level than you might think and as a
result they don't actually sit
completely flush against each other this
means that without thermal compound air
pockets exist between your CPU and your
heatsink so why is that a problem
well it turns out that even though hot
or cold air makes dramatic difference in
how your body feels as the seasons
change air is actually a very poor
conductor of heat in general if you
don't believe me try holding a stake an
inch above a frying pan instead of
placing it inside and let me know how
that goes for you so thermal paste fills
these would be air gaps so that your
heatsink and CPU are touching more
directly and the good stuff anyways is
also made from special materials that
help conduct heat properly so that it
can go up into your heatsink so while
you can use toothpaste as thermal
compound to save money you probably
really shouldn't for this to work best
the conducting material and thermal
paste is usually some sort of metal with
more expensive varieties containing
things like powdered silver and while
this makes sense since metal conducts
heat quite well it used to cause
problems for novice builders who put on
too much thermal compound because metal
paste can also end up being electrically
conductive oops
fortunately it's less of an issue these
days with higher-quality compounds like
Arctic silver 5 managing to remain non
conductive in spite of using metal
though you still need to keep it away
from metal contacts and traces as it is
mildly
positive which can still be a problem
but if you want to be really safe you
can buy thermal paste that contains no
metal at all these are typically made of
ceramic though more exotic solutions
that contain things like diamonds do
exist although they sadly won't add a
bling factor to your rig they will do a
decent job of keeping your processor
cool however the downside of these is
that you typically won't get quite the
same level of performance as you would
with a more metallic based pace but
high-quality ceramics are not only
cheaper they will also only set you back
by a few degrees in most cases and are
actually the best option for exotic
sub-zero cooling which you can check out
here and of course if you want to avoid
messes entirely you can get thermal pads
usually just made of silicone which just
sits squished between your heatsink and
whatever you're trying to cool you
commonly see these on small graphics
card components since there's no danger
of leakage but since they can't get down
into the micro crevices as well as paste
performance won't be nearly as good so
you don't see them on CPUs or the actual
specific GPU very often
whatever you do though make sure you
aren't accidentally buying thermal
adhesive these glues or epoxies
permanently bond two things together
this stuff used to be somewhat common in
certain PC components but has now been
mostly relegated to smaller electronics
that aren't meant to be taken apart
nonetheless it's still easy to buy so
make sure you're getting the right stuff
if you don't want to end up stuck
without a working CPU I'll show myself
out that was a little brutal if you're
not a member of Dollar Shave Club yet
join today and get your first month of
razors for free they deliver amazing
razors directly to your door membership
means that you can probably afford to
shave with a fresh blade anytime you
want which is fantastic you'll get a
first-class shave when you use the
executive blade without hurting your
wallet and you can also use dr. Carver's
shave butter using it with the executive
blade creates a wonderfully smooth shave
they shipped to the US Canada on
Australia so head over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to give
it a try for free if you guys like the
you like it or dislike it if you don't
like it or whatever if you're like this
topic sucked I have a good idea for
another one let us know down below and
give us a comment and whatever else you
want to do also check our channel
superfund because they are super fun and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
