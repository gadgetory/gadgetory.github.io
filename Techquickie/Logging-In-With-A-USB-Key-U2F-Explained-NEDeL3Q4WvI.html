the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos have you
ever heard oh well sorry my account got
hacked as an excuse for an incredibly
inappropriate post on social media well
for me it's kind of becoming the modern
equivalent to the dog ate my homework
especially because so many major web
services offer two-factor authentication
to keep intruders out of your account a
feature that asks for something else in
addition to your password typically one
of those six digit codes from an
Authenticator app on your phone so you
can learn all about how those work up
here but what if you're tired of
punching in that string of numbers
whenever you log in well then you might
be interested in a physical security key
using the universal two-factor or you to
F standard you see instead of a code
that changes every 30 seconds u2f relies
on a small physical chip on a little
gadget that looks a bit like a USB flash
drive that you can keep on your keychain
or in some kind of safe location
typically all you need to do to set one
up is tell whichever service you're
using that you have a u to F key then
insert it into a free USB port some of
them even support NFC so you can use
them with your Android smartphone and
iOS users very recently got support for
u 2 F devices over NFC with the Yubikey
neo if you're using an iPhone 7 or newer
so after you insert or tap your key a
number of things happen in the
background the key will randomly
generate a public and private key pair
with the private key never leaving the
physical u 2 F key and the public key
will get sent to a server your key will
also send the random number that it
picked to generate these keys originally
called the nonce as well as a checksum
that serves to identify that specific
physical key then when it's time to come
back later and login you enter your
username and password like you normally
would and the server will send you that
same nonce and checksum back to your u2
F key along with a different number
your physical key will then use the
nonce and checksum from the server to
regenerate the private key and since
each physical u2 F key uses a different
secret for key generation only the
original key you used to register will
work your u2 F key then signs the number
that was sent to it with the private key
and the result is sent to the server
which then unlocks it with your public
key from your u2 F key to allow you to
access it it sounds complicated but all
of this happens without any intervention
from the user other than simply plugging
in a USB stick and the benefits are
definitely worthwhile because it also
protects against phishing attacks
numeric authentication codes are
definitely way better than having no
two-factor protection at all but they
can still be stolen if you accidentally
enter them on an imposter website u2f
helps to stop this by using the original
domain of the site as part of the secret
sauce it uses to generate the private
key for that account so if you use your
physical key to login to an attackers
website the response it will send to
that hostel server will be completely
useless and the bad guys won't be able
to use it to get into your account and
the companies that make you to F keys
have added their own additional security
features on top of this base public key
encryption strategy the ever-popular
Yubikey for example requires you to
touch a sensor on the USB stick before
it authenticates ensuring that there's
an actual human trying to gain access
and not some kind of malware bot with
all that said as great as this kind of
physical security can be you still need
to make sure you don't do anything dumb
like drop your keychain in a shady part
of town which
racing against the clock is a freelancer
well it's challenging but thanks to the
growth of the internet there's never
been more opportunities for the
self-employed and to meet this need
