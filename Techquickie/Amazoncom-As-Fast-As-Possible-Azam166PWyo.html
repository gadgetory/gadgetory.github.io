cellphones books adult things you can
buy pretty much anything these days on
Amazon but how did this internet
superstore get to be as huge as it is
today in 1994 a guy named Jeff Bezos
wanted to take advantage of the big
ecommerce boom he left his job as the
vice president of a Wall Street firm to
sell CD's computer hardware and software
videos and books out of his garage it's
a familiar story quite a risk but within
two months Amazon sales were up to
twenty thousand dollars a week and while
the largest bookstores and catalogs
might be able to offer two hundred
thousand titles an online bookstore
could order in and carry several times
more since it has an almost infinite
virtual warehouse wisdom that we take
for granted these days but was pretty
revolutionary at the time as Amazon grew
however the virtual warehouse was almost
completely replaced with the fulfillment
center model we're talking massive like
really massive brick and mortar
facilities with some of their
fulfillment centers being as large as
1.2 million square feet but wait a
second why wouldn't they just keep using
the almost infinite virtual warehouses
you see while the fulfillment center may
have its drawbacks
it suits Amazon's needs better now the
two main reasons being that they have
space to store large bulk orders meaning
they can get products for cheaper and
having items in the building means they
can be shipped out faster with this
space however systems needed to be put
in place to reduce travel time
throughout the warehouse here's an
example imagine you're in the grocery
store and you need to get items from
each corner of the store wouldn't it be
much faster if there was a couple of
every item in the same aisle of course
it would and this is how Amazon dealt
with all that space by evenly dispersing
popular items throughout the warehouse
rather than having just one place for it
making it easier to find something
without travelling long distances
employees are also equipped with special
scanners to track items
moving throughout the facility so
between this system and a series of
strategically placed conveyor belts
items can be checked for damage and
ready to ship within one to two hours
but in the modern age shipping an item
out quickly isn't enough to make you
choose a retailer so what are some of
the other interesting things that
they've done to shape their customer
behavior one of them introduced about 10
years ago was Ana's on prime the yearly
fee that allows buyers to get two-day
shipping at no extra cost on qualifying
items this had the risk for Amazon of
reducing profit margins because if
someone ordered a lot of items very
frequently but with very small orders
they could end up losing money on the
subscription service but had the benefit
of getting their customers in the habit
of coming back and at least checking for
an item before shopping somewhere else
and they've done a couple other clever
sneaky things as well so number one is
anytime you are shopping on Amazon
whether you look at a specific item or a
category it captures that data along
with data about things that other people
looked at and that other people bought
and starts bombarding you with targeted
ads encouraging you to come back and
look at those items again sometimes even
going as far as to offer a small
discount on them and while this was I
think more critical in the early days
when many people didn't have confidence
in online shopping in general their
online review system is in my experience
pretty much second to none and almost
essential for their site these days
because trying to narrow down to the
right product by category is pretty
difficult on amazon.com so being able to
just go okay I want the ones with four
and a half stars or more and shopping
from that can be easier a serious
concern though is that a seller through
Amazon might add fake reviews to their
products to boost their ratings and
while Amazon tries to find and filter
these fake reviews a lot of them get
through the cracks with manufacturers
paying people to write more convincing
fake reviews the good news is that
there's at least the verified purchase
tag so you can check out those ones if
you want to make sure that person
actually bought the item another thing
that they've done
is an incredible job of affiliate
marketing you've probably heard me on
our other line is tech tips channel
talking about using our Amazon affiliate
code but basically this is a super smart
way of advertising that doesn't require
Amazon to do any upfront payment
basically they just have creators like
us or influencers sign up for the
affiliate program mention Amazon all the
time and then they provide a small
kickback whenever that code is used at
no extra cost to the consumer basically
a finder's fee
I know this was a bit of an unusual
video today but leave your comments
below let us know what you thought
because honestly it was inspired by me
buying something on Amazon the other day
you know an industrial-sized pack of
marshmallow peeps or whatever and
realizing after I'd ordered it but I
didn't even shop anywhere else and
wondering what exactly black magic it is
that they had done to make me do that
speaking of making someone do something
you guys should definitely check out the
link in the video description to fresh
books it's designed for freelance
workers or small businesses and it's
basically an online tool that makes
invoicing getting paid and tracking your
expenses easier all the little details
about cash flow are in one place so you
know where you stand it shows a full
history of each invoice and allows you
to check if your client has viewed the
invoice and paid directly through fresh
books by credit card and this is cool
they actually just launched their
deposits feature so if you're a house
painter or a plumber or
any kind of work where you might do you
know a deposit and then half the work
and then you know some more work and
then they pay the rest at the end or
whatever else those more complicated
payment schemes are now supported pretty
cool stuff so all you got to do to try
out fresh books for free
is head over to freshbooks dot-com slash
