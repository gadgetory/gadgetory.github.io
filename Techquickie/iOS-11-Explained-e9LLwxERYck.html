getting with Apple announcements - of
groundbreaking here a pinch of vaguely
trashcans shaped thing there and maybe a
sprinkling of new software to tie the
whole thing together and that's exactly
what we got at the June 2017 Apple event
with our first look at i/o s11 and
although Apple didn't announce a new
iPhone to go along with it
there is a bevy of new features in iOS
11 that might make your existing device
feel like it's on the bleeding edge yet
again first off iOS is navigation
features will get a huge facelift Apple
Maps has been expanded with detailed
floor plans for large facilities like
airports and shopping malls and if
you're a driver you'll see speed limits
and even get a do not disturb while
driving feature that will disable all
notifications when the iPhone thinks
you're behind the wheel useful for
avoiding getting a ticket and giving
even more money to the local government
while we're on the subject of bad ideas
while driving you can now enter special
characters with a flick instead of
entirely changing keyboards while
texting and on the iPhone Apple took
note of one of their competitors key
phablet features you can now enable a
special one-handed keyboard that will
push the buttons to one side if your
other hand is occupied but while that
will undoubtedly be useful a feature
that's already proven to be a little
more divisive is the overhauled control
center instead of being a smaller menu
with fixed items the control center now
takes up the entire screen and is
totally customizable meaning that you
can re widget to your heart's content
though some people have commented the
design seems a bit more cumbersome of
course modern-day customizability
doesn't come without a fair amount of
data collection the
learning will now help your device
automagically characterize what's
happening in a particular photo to sort
them into albums and Siri will begin to
suggest custom searches and even play
songs based on past habits which you
might consider either super convenient
or super unnerving
either way Siri is also getting her
voice overhauled so maybe that'll
distract you from the big new warehouse
Apple is building to store all of the
dirt they have on you and your iDevice
won't just be keeping track of your
searches there's also an option that
will automatically delete apps you
haven't used in a while in order to free
up space which could come in handy since
there's still no expandable storage
option for iPhone or iPad do note though
it'll hold on to the app data in case
you change your mind and reinstall later
speaking of regrets iOS 11 also offers
you some exciting new ways to part with
your money with Apple pay integration
with iMessage so you can make payments
via text and a redesigned App Store with
a greater emphasis on screen filling
images and easily accessible video
previews of the apps on offer then once
you're done installing apps and it's
time to consume some music or video
you'll be glad to know that not only can
the new airplay to control speakers in
different rooms individually but the
volume display won't hog the freaking
middle of the screen anymore
yes anyway if you're on an iPad there
are also enhanced multitasking options
such as the ability to drag an app from
the dock at the bottom of the screen to
open it in split view as well as to drag
data between split-screen apps if you've
dropped even more dollar bills on an
Apple pencil you can now markup PDFs and
even take notes directly from the lock
screen if you find yourself in a hurry
to scribble something important down or
if your jackass friend with a better
iPad than you left it lying around and
you're feeling particularly bitter in
that mode
i OS will be coming to iPhone 5s and
newer iPhone 5c users are out of luck
iPad Mini 2 and newer this fall and you
can even get it if you're using a sixth
generation iPod Touch do iPod still
exist really Wow neat racing against the
clock as a freelancer or small-business
owner it's challenging this is true but
with the growth of the Internet there's
never been more opportunities for the
self-employed and to meet this need
fresh books created their cloud
accounting software which is designed

simplest and easiest way to be more
productive more organized and most
importantly get paid faster create and
