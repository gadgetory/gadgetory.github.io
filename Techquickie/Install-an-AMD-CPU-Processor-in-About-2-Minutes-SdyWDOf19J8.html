today's episode of one minute or less
we're going to show you how to install
your AMD CPU step one is to lift the
retaining arm step to align the little
golden triangle on the corner of the CPU
with the little triangle-shaped marker
on the motherboard itself set the CPU
down on the socket giving it a little
wiggle until it falls into place then
you can lower the arm the box for your
processor contains a CPU heatsink that
has thermal compound pre applied to the
bottom of it and an easy to use mounting
mechanism that doesn't require any
special tools make sure that you remove
the plastic cover before proceeding with
step three which is to place the CPU
heatsink down on top of the CPU ensuring
that the fan cable coming out of the fan
is as close to the fan header on the
motherboard labelled CPU as possible if
the wires coming out of the fan ever get
caught in the blades it can cause the
fan to stop spinning which can make your
CPU overheat so to make cable management
a little bit easier I usually tie a knot
in the wires before plugging the wires
into the CPU fan header now that
everything's in place the tool free
latch mechanism can be engaged first on
one side pushing it under the hook and
then on the other side this last step is
very important moving the mounting arm
down into its locked position puts the
appropriate amount of pressure on top of
the CPU to aid with thermal transfer one
other trick to get slightly better
temperatures is to give the heatsink a
little wiggle to settle the thermal
compound into place thanks for checking
