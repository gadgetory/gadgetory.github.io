more commonly referred to our display
units which allow the user to monitor
important information on a display
without the distraction of well putting
his or her head down okay so admittedly
the name wasn't inspired by any
particularly out-of-the-box thinking but
while the name may suck HUDs themselves
are a revolutionary idea and although
many of you will quickly recognize
heads-up displays as the interface
showing you know how much health and
ammo Gordon Freeman has left after
clubbing four hundred baby head crabs or
whatever
really that's just fantasy and in the
same way that truth is often cooler than
fiction the origin of hud technology is
actually derived from jet fighters even
better now to be clear they weren't as
advanced as what you'll find on your
collector's edition Master Chief helmet
that was totally worth the hundred and
thirty dollars you spent on it but
rather they were based roughly off an
old Airman's machine gun reflector sight
which illuminated a target in the sight
when properly aligned this technique was
eventually adapted by Her Majesty's
Royal Air Force in the early 40s and
adopted to use cathode ray tubes and
phosphorus coated TV screens you know
like the one your grandma still has to
allow night pilots to monitor targets
directly via HUD radar and then well
from there on the SEALs never really
stood a chance did they second gen units
instead use solid lights such as from
LEDs to project images onto a pilot's
windscreen from an LCD display and are
commonly found on commercial aircraft
but due to their cost at the time were
unlikely to be found in consumer goods
like cars third gen HUDs on the other
hand don't require projection at all
anymore but instead utilize a specially
coated viewing surface and a doodad
called an optical waveguide which
manipulates visual light spectrum waves
whatever the pants that means allowing
folks like automakers to display
readouts like speed GPS navigation music
controls or even like
web content directly onto their
proprietary HUD systems on the
windshield which finally brings us to
fourth gen systems which use lasers to
display high-definition images directly
on to clear surfaces like that sweet
interface and Minority Report
potentially making them very compact
portable and versatile but heads-up
displays aren't just useful when
operating a vehicle or solving future
crime in fact there's an ever-growing
list of programs which in essence
transform a person's smartphone camera
into a miniature HUD and you know while
yes technically any display that sits
right in front of your face so you don't
put your head down is technically a HUD
most of them are better implemented than
that and that allows people to see
information about local hotspots museum
exhibits or even the plentyoffish
profiles of passers-by as they walk down
the street and as this technology
continues to develop be that in the form
of laser displays transparent OLED
displays holographic displays or even
head mounted displays that have a screen
to show you the virtual stuff with
cameras mounted to the front for the
view of real life more and more people
will be able to enjoy the benefit of
access to information without the use of
their hand and assuming all goes
according to plan this will even be
possible without having to wear
something that makes you look and feel
like a total early-adopter glass hole
but what if we lived in a world where
you didn't have to go out in public at
all to get your razors and other
bathroom supplies shipped directly to
your door for only a few bucks a month
well that world is now and here if
you're in Canada the United States
Australia or New Zealand with Dollar
