the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos when it
comes to video files there are a lot of
file formats out there if you're a video
editor or a media enthusiast you've
probably encountered a veritable
alphabet soup of different ones so just
like in our episodes on audio and image
formats which you can check out up here
we're going to demystify some of the
common formats that you can choose for
your newfangled moving picture movies
first up to avoid confusion it's
important to keep in mind that the
extension you see at the end of a file
name such as mp4 or MKV or MOV actually
specifies what kind of container the
files in but there's more to formats
than just the container so all those
video clips and trailers that you got
could be using any number of different
codecs
as well but what's a codec glad you're
asked most digital video is compressed
in some way since otherwise it had taken
up tons of space on your hard drive a
codec is simply a particular scheme
that's used to compress or decompress a
file there are lots of codecs out there
but one of the most prevalent ones today
is h.264 which is popular because it
retains decent image quality while
shrinking the file sizes significantly
the way it works is by instead of saving
each frame of the video pixel by pixel
h.264 splits frames into blocks of 256
pixels each and tries to predict what
each subsequent block will look like
based on either the rest of the frame or
from previous frames the algorithm then
compares the predicted block to the
actual block creating a difference
called a residual next the Kodak
compares the residual to 16 checkerboard
like standard patterns and how much of
each pattern contributes to the residual
is stored as a number with higher
frequency patterns you see to the lower
right often discarded as these take up
the most space this is really similar to
how JPEG works for still images and like
JPEG you can choose how much compression
you want with higher compression
discarding
our patterns and yielding smaller file
sizes but also lower quality however
h.264 is actually pretty good at making
predictions and even includes a filter
to reduce some of the compression
blockiness
you sometimes see on low-quality video
making it a standard go-to codec for
sites like YouTube as well as for
blu-ray discs at similar visual quality
h.264 only takes up about half as much
space as mpeg-2 which is still in use
today for DVD video and broadcast TV but
a new code act the imaginatively named
h.265 better known as h-e-b C is even
more efficient than h.264 it can use
blocks of up to 4096 pixels and has more
advanced prediction algorithms which is
critical for keeping file sizes
manageable as internet streaming
continues on its inevitable march
towards 8k of course one downside to
both h.264 and 265 is that they're
protected by patents so companies that
want to use these codecs have to pay
royalties that seems to be the
motivation behind the development of vp8
and vp9 a pair of open-source standards
being pushed by Google that are
technologically quite similar to HEV see
there are image quality differences but
there's no real consensus as to which
one is better
so some service providers like Netflix
just use whichever codec will work best
on the device the users watching from
there are other codecs floating around
there like the venerable AVI but at this
point we've covered the major modern
ones so let's get back to container
files starting with the familiar mp4 mp4
enjoys wide compatibility and can hold
either an MPEG or an h.264 encoded video
along with an AAC or mp3 audio stream
pro tip if you ever see m4v at the end
of the video it's basically just a
version of mp4 with DRM enabled so if
one of these files refuses to play try
simply changing the extension to mp4 and
give it another go but although mp4 is
still really popular especially among
youtubers the Matroska or MKV container
is one of the fastest-growing it can
support just about
any combination of audio and video
codecs including newer ones like h.265
and has more flexible support for menus
and chapters as well as the ability to
play back a corrupted file so you won't
necessarily lose all of that super
important drone footage of your boring
neighborhood and for a creative types
there are many other formats that you
might encounter each with their own
advantages and drawbacks for example the
MOV format which was developed by Apple
for a quicktime supports multiple codecs
and is easier to edit on the fly without
having to rewrite the entire file when
you're done a cool feature that makes
exporting a finished video from Final
Cut much faster than competing video
editors that have to encode the entire
project from scratch finally we can't
wrap this video up without talking about
FLV and f4v
these indicate of course that the clip
is meant to be played in adobe flash
which is being phased out now you know
I'd love to tell you all about that but
we are out of time so go and watch the
video that we already made about it and
be sure to yell at us down in the
comments if we'd neglected the file
video format of your choice
juggling multiple computers is difficult
you end up with various sets of mice and
keyboards on your desk which not only
looks messy but gets super confusing KVM
switches can partially solve this
problem but we found that they aren't
very seamless and are sometimes
cumbersome but with synergy you can move
the mouse seamlessly between your
computers which makes them feel like one
computer check out the full details at
the link below so thanks for watching
guys be sure to LIKE the video dislike
it if you have to leave a comment for
what we should do in future videos like
subscribe all that good stuff
I said subscribe already so thanks for
watching guys make sure to LIKE the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
didn't like it leave a comment for ideas
of what we should do in future videos
subscribe follow see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
