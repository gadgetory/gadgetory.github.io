this it's a lazy Friday night at home
because for the 24th week in a row you
don't have a date and you're enjoying
another fine episode of tech quickie
while idly browsing the web in a
separate window and then suddenly you
get an alarming looking set of error
messages and pop-ups telling you that
your PC machine of thought was cleaner
than a Singapore sidewalk is hopelessly
infected with dozens of viruses and you
need to call Microsoft at this
convenient number right now to fix it
whoa whoa whoa stop right there there's
nothing wrong with your computer it's a
tech support scam and not the one where
you pay a hundred bucks for someone to
come over to plug in the SSD you bought
from Amazon that may be overpriced but
at least it's legitimate tech support
scams usually start from inside a
browser window or they can come in the
form of a phone call now over the phone
basically someone cold calls you saying
that they're with a major corporation
like Microsoft in the windows support
department or something to that effect
and that they have somehow detected
serious issues with your PC may be
through a non-existent ISP report then
there's browser based scams these have
been rapidly increasing in popularity
especially on unlicensed streaming sites
for movies and sporting events the way
these ones work is that many of them
tried to visually emulate real error
messages like the windows blue screen of
death and they will often throw in a
bunch of logos from companies like
Google and Apple to make them look more
legit but while either of these forms of
attack can be disposed of simply by
hanging up the phone or closing your
browser they may try to convince you
that doing this you know waiting until
the morning to get a second opinion from
Geek Squad or powering off your system
could result in irreparable damage and
that you have to instead allow one of
their technicians to fix the issue for
you in either case once one of these
shady characters feels like they've got
your attention
they'll usually have you bring up
windows features that are novice
computer user might be unfamiliar with
for example having them type something
simple into command prompt and then
using whatever comes up as evidence of a
malware infection or telling them to
open Event Viewer which keeps a log of
every system message that pops up now
the thing is that even a PC that's
functioning normally will often have a
good number of errors in the Event
Viewer things as small as a game crash
for a slight issue with your network
connection but the scammer will tell the
victim that these error records are
super dangerous and they will totally
wreck their data then they'll present
their solution downloading remote access
software so that they can take control
of your system to fix the problem at
some point during this process the
scammer will also demand payment often
by credit card either to renew a
software license or fix these fake
problems the ones who are mostly just
interested in stealing your credit card
details might just kind of putz around
for a minute or two and clear the Event
Viewer log to make it appear that they
did something but the more nefarious
ones can also use their remote access to
install actual malware or steal your
personal files there have even been
cases of scammers deleting the data and
system files if the victim refuses to
pay and even though a common stereotype
is that it's older folks that fall for
these scams more frequently the truth is
that younger people in their 20s and 30s
have also been hit hard by this sort of
cybercrime due to spending more time
online so to avoid becoming a victim
keep this in mind companies like
Microsoft Apple and Google will never
cold call you or email you out of the
blue to tell you that there's a problem
with your PC or your iPhone or whatever
and if you get a scam error message
while you're using a browser remember
that real errors will almost never
contain any useful information and they
will certainly never prompt you to call
a specific
and while we're at it real blue screens
of death take up the entire screen not
just your browser window another way to
tell if you're being scammed is to go
back in time to third grade and pay
close attention to spelling class many
of these fake warnings are littered with
spelling and grammatical errors as well
as super bombastic use of all caps and
many exclamation points not exactly the
type of thing you'd expect to see from a
serious multi-billion dollar software
company if you want to see some
real-world examples of what to watch out
for we've actually linked to page from
Microsoft down in the video description
which has lots of useful hints and even
screenshots of these sorts of scam pages
so if you see one the best thing to do
is just close your browser unless you
want to be like Linus media group
alumnus Nick van Berkel
and you enjoy spending your spare time
