clicked on this video you might have
noticed that in the title we didn't ask
if Apple was slowing down their phones
we asked why because it turns out that
the conspiracy theories are real sort of
even though it's pretty common knowledge
that older devices don't perform as well
due to the higher demands of newer
software many people have noticed this
in a more profound way after a system
update issued by Apple in 2016 this
fueled speculation for well over a year
about whether Apple was slowing down
their phones on purpose until the
company finally admitted that this was
indeed the case in December 2017 now the
explanation that Apple gave revolved
around the way that phones with older
batteries perform you see even though
smartphones use rechargeable batteries
these have a limited lifespan you can
learn more about it up here but the main
thing to keep in mind for now is that
these batteries recharge by reversing
the chemical reaction that normally
generates power for your phone now since
this reaction isn't perfectly reversible
your battery won't be able to hold a
charge as well over time as you
discharge it and recharge it over and
over again and if your battery is really
old your gadget can end up shutting off
due to a dead battery way before you
might expect it to so this is what Apple
claimed it was trying to prevent but
wait a second how does slowing down a
phone help with a sudden shutdown well
if you're putting a load on your phone's
processor like streaming HD video or
playing a game it draws more power from
your battery draining it more quickly so
Apple says that some workloads are so
hungry that they can ask for more power
than an aging battery can provide in a
given moment so similar to how a laptop
CPU might down clock itself to preserve
battery life newer versions of iOS will
make the CPU spread tasks out to take
longer to prevent those power spikes
that can overload older batteries which
has caused the frustrating performance
issues and the leg that we mentioned
earlier now this does make sense
probably more sense than a conspiracy
theory about Apple crippling its own
products to force consumers to buy the
latest model which would carry
significant legal consequences if they
were caught by the way you definitely
don't want a battery that you think has
an adequate charge suddenly dropping
dead in the middle of something
important but that doesn't mean we're
ready to let Apple off the hook one
issue is that Apple waited well over a
year before disclosing this fix leaving
their customers wondering why the heck
their iPhones were performing so poorly
this has driven speculation that Apple
is effectively overclocking their phones
knowingly delivering performance out of
the box that isn't typical of what you'd
expect in the longer term and they've
also faced criticism for not giving
their users a choice they could have an
option in the settings menu that allows
you to choose between the safety valve
that prevents shutdowns and more
performance at the risk of your battery
dying suddenly when it's low now Apple
has offered cheap battery upgrades for a
year but unless they extend that offer
indefinitely you could argue that that's
more of a PR move than a long-term
solution so what can be done in the long
term well it is possible to grab a
battery online for cheap and swap it at
home to alleviate the lag issue I fix it
excuse me sorry but it requires specific
tools risks damaging your device and
also avoids any warranty that you might
have remaining so unless the smartphone
market as a whole moves back towards
bulkier phones with user replaceable
batteries and away from slim sleek and
emoji machines that need to be replaced
every couple of years
not much I fix it loves to take stuff
apart and teach people how to repair
their electronics and they're also
leading the charge in the electronics
repair tools industry with their iconic
black and blue Pro tech toolkit and it's
now only fifty nine ninety five it
