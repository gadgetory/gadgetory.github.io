back in 2004 it allowed users to run two
graphics cards simultaneously to
theoretically double 3d gaming
performance versus what could be
achieved with a single card here we are
ten years later the technology has
changed a lot now we have
professional-grade sli for 3d rendering
multi way sli with support for three or
even four graphics processors
concurrently and a plethora of different
operational modes but the misconceptions
about it have stayed pretty much the
same so first up sli only works with
cards based on the same graphics
processor and with the same amount of
onboard memory you can run these two
cards in sli mode because they are
identical these ones will still work
because they are both GTX 780 s that's
the GPU or graphics processor with three
gigabytes of RAM that's the memory even
though they are from different
manufacturers you only start running
into trouble when you want to pair up
two gig cards with four gig cards or two
gig cards with different GPUs or mix
Nvidia cards with AMD cards etc so guys
it's not going to work so please stop
trying beyond choosing the right cards
setting up SLI is pretty easy you'll
need an SLI ready operating system and
sli certified motherboard with two PCI
Express 16x slots and sli bridge and a
power supply that can provide enough
power for as many cards as you're
running nvidia has guidelines for all
this stuff linked in the video
description or better yet you can get
personalized advice by posting in the
Linus tech tips comm forum alright so
what are the benefits number one as I
mentioned before is better performance
especially at higher resolutions like
2560 by 1440 and 4k number two is better
graphical fidelity instead of running at
130 FPS when your monitor only displays
60 images per second you can crank up
the settings for better image quality
while maintaining an acceptable frame
rate number three is it looks awesome
for lots of folks the improved
performance while very important is not
the only reason they do it it's shallow
but I know I'm not the only one who
thinks this way well gosh that sounds
perfect right sign me up we'll hold on a
second it's not all rosy the law of
diminishing returns comes down pretty
hard on SLI configuration
two cards obviously costs twice as much
as one but it's rare for that to
actually completely double your
performance in a real-world scenario and
even less common to see triple the
performance with three cards you'll also
see increased power consumption and heat
output so you want to make sure your
power supply is adequate your PC case
ventilation is adequate and in some
extreme cases your room ventilation is
adequate game compatibility is much
better than it used to be but there are
still games that don't have any kind of
SLI support especially right at release
so that second card might be sitting
there doing nothing sometimes especially
if you're one of those people who lines
up at midnight to buy the latest games
finally there's the issue of micro
stuttering or frame time variants which
some people are more or less susceptible
to but NVIDIA has that mostly taken care
of compared to the competition
while that last bit probably sounded
like I was pretty down on SLI I'm not
multi card configurations are the only
way to get truly next-generation
performance today and for gamers who
want to play at very high resolutions
with very high detail settings and
always get butter smooth frame rates
those trade-offs we talked about before
are going to sound like no big deal
hence the continued success of SLI today
almost 10 years after its introduction
