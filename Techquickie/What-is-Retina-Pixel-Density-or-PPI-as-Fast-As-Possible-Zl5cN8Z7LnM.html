when referring to the fineness of a
digital image but there's actually much
more to it than that a 5-inch 1280 by
720 image will look sharp and crisp on
your phone but if you projected a 720p
image in a movie theater it would look
horrible so that my friends is where
pixel density comes in a measure of the
resolution that also accounts for the
size of the screen PPI has become the
most common way to denote pixel density
although pixels per centimeter or PPC
can also be used to calculate PPI simply
measure one inch diagonally on the
screen then draw a line diagonally
through them and find out how many
pixels it intersects with so I heard
higher pixel density is always better is
that right well sort of the geek in me
wants to say yes
bring it on more but in reality it
requires advanced display technology and
more processing power so it's not always
practical from a cost and manufacturing
perspective to keep driving up pixel
density with older devices there was
tons of room for improvement diagonal
lines looked like this and circles even
had an ugly staircase effect but this is
improved in recent years and we've even
begun to see displays where the eye
cannot even pick out the individual
pixels on the display once that point is
reached there's not much benefit to
continuing to add cost and complexity to
manufacturing because most people won't
notice anyway Apple's branding for this
good enough density concept is Retina
but to determine if a display is retina
there's one last thing to consider how
far away are you going to be from the
display is this retina com has a handy
little tool for this and according to
their calculator a 55 inch 1080p TV will
have the same perceived pixel density
from 7 feet away as this 4.7 inch 1080p
phone does from 7 inches away but
there's more to a great display than how
many pixels it has of course contrast
color accuracy and pixel response times
impact the viewing experience
tremendously and different display types
can even affect other things like the
battery life of your
vais improving power efficiency panel
technologies also play a large role for
example while both the Samsung Galaxy s4
and the HTC One have 1080p displays the
s4 uses a pentile matrix a moe LED
display that has fewer dots on it
overall while the one uses a more
standard LCD display with RGB sub pixels

released in 2010 could have been
co-authored by Jane Austen to which I
would reply duh Zombies anyway guys
