Internet service providers that are
offering fiber internet directly to the
home but let's face it most of us don't
live in an area where we can get a
hundred percent fiber and waiting around
for Google to show up and save the day
with an army of construction workers
might take a really long time so the
majority of us are still using either
cable or DSL to get online but is one
better than the other and how exactly
can internet data travel over a cable TV
wire or a phone line that only carried
56k dial-up not so long ago well
although people laughed at ted stevens
for calling the internet a series of
tubes it's actually pretty darn helpful
to picture the phone or a cable line
running to your house as a pipe the
phone conversation or Adam Sandler movie
that you're enjoying only takes up part
of that pipes space the space in the
pipe yes for continuing this analogy
that would otherwise be empty can be
filled with creamy delicious Internet
data packets which are kept separate
from phone calls or cable TV by simply
using a different frequency band similar
to how different frequencies on your FM
radio corresponds to entirely different
stations so in the case of DSL which
runs over a regular phone line phone
calls only take up a very tiny part of
the available bandwidth which explains
why DSL is so much faster than a dial-up
connection since old-school 56k internet
could only use the frequencies that were
dedicated to phone traffic to further
increase speeds for the average user
ISPs typically assign much more of the
available bandwidth to downstream
traffic rather than upstream as most
people download far more things than
they do upload which is why a DSL is a
common term that you'll see
in advertising with the a standing for
asymmetric as your upload and download
speeds will be usually very different of
course if you need lots of upstream
bandwidth such as if you're a video
production company you can actually get
symmetric DSM or s DSL okay Linus I get
it they both work by sending stuff down
an empty part of a pipe or copper wire
but how then are these two different
well one of the biggest distinctions is
one that you'll hear quite a bit from
companies that are trying to sell you
DSL and that is that your connection to
the ISP is your own bandwidth on an
incoming cable connection compared to
DSL is often shared by many other people
in your neighborhood
so if tons of people are streaming in 4k
on Netflix or downloading games off
steam at once your speed will often
suffer so that's great DSL is a
dedicated connection just for you but it
suffers from its own bottleneck the
farther you are physically located from
your internet service provider or one of
their stations the slower your DSL
connection will be since DSL isn't
compatible with the boosting equipment
that phone companies use to make sure
that you have a clear conversation from
3,000 miles away this is part of the
reason that cable connections are often
faster though DSL is often a cheaper
choice especially since contrary to a
popular misconception you don't
necessarily need phone service to get
DSL as many ISPs offer DSL over
something called a dry loop even if you
don't pay to make calls on a landline so
shop around a bit and keep those things
in mind in your quest to find the most
reliable ISP so your connection won't
suddenly drop out in the middle of a
twitch stream a crucial field goal kick
or counter-strike and chill and speaking
of actually I can't find a way to make
