wrapper will damage to your system no
more tech money no more over lush no
more all my apology horses odds are
pretty good that you've seen a message
like that if you've ever tried to delete
a file that windows wants to cling to
like you cling to that picture of your
ex especially if said file is inside the
system32 folder but what exactly about
it is so gosh darn important that makes
windows as cagey and nervous as an
initech employee during a performance
review and why do internet trolls advise
deleting it let's start with the first
bit many of the files inside system 32
take the form of dynamic link libraries
or dll's these files contain code and
data that can be accessed and shared by
many programs including windows itself
the DLL is inside the system32 folder
enable functionality from control panel
options to error checking system updates
streaming media support encryption
services audio and video playback
DirectX rendering and even the Windows
interface itself I mean it wouldn't be
very easy to use Windows if you couldn't
even freakin see what you were doing
system32 also includes most of your
drivers which you can learn more about
up here as well as elements of the
Windows kernel the fundamental code that
interfaces Windows with your hardware
allowing it to well work what that means
is that many of these files simply can't
be deleted after you boot into Windows
since they've already been loaded into
memory
but even deleting other system32 files
will probably end up breaking a number
of obvious things on your system and
result in your computer refusing to boot
the next time you try to turn it on
meaning you'll end up having to run some
system recovery of some sort to have any
chance of getting it back up and running
without a full reformat so this all
sounds like stuff you obviously wouldn't
want to get rid of so why is anyone
trying to do it well not surprisingly
many non computer savvy folks have no
idea what the system 32 folder is at all
leading to some enterprising trolls
spreading a meme that deleting system 32
will make your
you to run twice as fast this particular
piece of memory has been making its
rounds on the internet since at least
the early 2000s but the way it's usually
presented still fools many computer
novices typically there will be a bit of
copypasta describing system32 as a
folder that Microsoft uses to
intentionally hobble your computer's
performance as part of some conspiracy
to get you to go by PC tune-up software
or something or even claiming the
system32 is just straight-up malware
then using step-by-step instructions
that are designed to look like more
credible system tuning tips directing
users to enter one or two lines on a
command prompt to delete the folder to
be clear there are many people on the
web that offer honest advice about how
to speed up a slow computer but in this
particular case it's a giant hoax so the
moral the story is don't delete system32
and don't take computer maintenance
advice from people that list master of
mammalogy on their resumes cut out their
VPN lets you tunnel to up to 20
different countries and make it seem
like your connection is coming from that
country they've easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac and they also have a
Chrome extension just choose the country
in the app turn tile bear on and watch
as your bear tunnels your internet
connection to your new location when you
turn total bear on two main things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
can show up as if you're in that
different country tunnel very lets you
bypass all the annoying details that
typically come with using a VPN for
personal use there's no need to mess
around with port configurations or DNS
or any other router settings if you're
not comfortable with that
tonal Bayer handles all of that in the
background they have a top rated
security privacy and do not log any user
activity you can try out some of our VPN
with 500 megabytes of free data and with
no credit card required today and if you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear
comm slash Linus alright guys thanks for
watching if you liked it like if you
disliked it dislike it and don't forget
don't go around deleting a whole bunch
of random stuff this can happen it's
kind of weird having like a torso and
shins so if you want to avoid that just
don't delete a whole bunch of different
stuffs and that will that will help you
out on the journey of not having that
happen if you guys want to see other
silly things go to channel super fun
other than that I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
