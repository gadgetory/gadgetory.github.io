company hacked user data exposed
hospital held ransom celebrity tweet
something offensive claims hackers did
it Internet superstar linus hacked will
it never end well no after all for as
long as there have been locked
there have been locked pics to break
into them and unfortunately to the
chagrin of major corporations and
individual users alike computers are no
different so who are these digital lock
pickers and what makes them tick you
might think of 90s retro teens with
glasses staring at screens flooded with
code but the reality is actually far
less dramatic at the beginning of the
digital age hackers were enthusiasts
probing to see what was possible with
emerging technologies phone freaker's
are an early example from the late 1950s
through the early 70s among whom was the
legendary Steve Wozniak who would go on
to co-found Apple Computer anyway the
idea behind freaking was to generate
tones that early automated phone systems
used in order to gain control for
themselves woz and Steve Jobs even
impersonated Henry Kissinger to prank
call the Vatican sadly that era of
playful innocence ended soon after
computers and networks became more
commonplace and today we classify
individual hackers by the hats that they
wear which we assign based on their
intentions the colors are white gray or
black no relation to red hat which is an
Enterprise Linux distribution white hats
are mainly security researchers and
penetration testers people whose job it
is to counter the other guys their
actions are often sanctioned by the
companies who pay them for their
services some white hats have discover
a massive security holes that could have
affected a lot of people if they weren't
found such as Dan Kaminsky who
discovered a flaw in the DNS that could
have crippled huge parts of the Internet
as well as rootkits that Sony was
intentionally putting on to its music
CDs which you can learn more about here
gray hats as the name suggests muddy the
waters since they generally don't have
malicious intentions but they act
without permission from their targets
and the way in which they use any data
they access comes down to their personal
moral code gray hat incidents can take
many forms from the hacker who sold an
iphone cracked to the FBI to help them
access the San Bernardino shooters data
to the Russian software company that
developed ebook software that bypass DRM
restrictions although that was legal in
Russia it wasn't in the u.s. leading to
a run with the law when one of their
employees visited the state's black cats
meanwhile are usually the ones making
splashy headlines as they have no
problem floating the law to profit at
someone else's expense or even to just
cause damage to a website service
business or even an individual when
passwords or credit cards are stolen and
put up for sale online
that's a blackhat handiwork and although
it's easy to label hackers that steal
money from target customers as black
hats there's debate as to whether other
kinds of hackers fall into this category
think so-called activists whose actions
inspire impassioned arguments or
government spy agencies like the NSA and
some black hats have even had their
talents recognized by major IT and
cybersecurity firms
who have ended up offering them jobs as
long as the hacker trades in his or her
black hat for a white one but these days
it should be noted there are much better
ways to
break into the world of security
consulting than by committing crimes and
on the subject of the internet tunnel
there is the VPN that lets you tunnel
through 20 different countries allowing
you to browse the Internet and use
online services as though you are from
that other country it's crazy easy to
use they've got apps for iOS Android PC
and Mac and they also have a Chrome
extension all you got to do is visit the
tunnel ver link in the video description
it'll start downloading automatically
then once it's installed you just click
one button choose the country that you
want and boom a couple of things happen
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so you show up as
though you're in a different country
tunnel where also lets you bypass all of
the annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal users so
port forwarding dns settings none of
that nonsense and they don't log user
activity so Charla tunnel bear for free
at the link in the video description
tunnel bear comm / - and when you sign
up you can save 10% again by using our
link so thanks for watching guys like
this like subscribe or check out our
other videos also you can leave a
comment suggesting future topics for
fast as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
