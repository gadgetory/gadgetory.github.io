pretty easy to find a foreign film
sporting event or breaking news story
that you're interested in from abroad
but then when you go to tune in or watch
that blu-ray you ordered from Hong Kong
BAM you're hit with an error saying you
can't watch hard-boiled with chow
yun-fat in your region well what gives
with that region locking has been a fact
of life for a while but has become
especially frustrating since DVDs rose
to popularity in the late 1990s and the
way it's worked since then is pretty
much like this when you go to buy a
movie or a TV show you might see a
little globe on the back with a number
from 1 through 7 for DVDs or a letter
from A through C for blu-ray discs these
refer to the region of the world the
disc is intended to be used in but why
would that matter well you see DVD and
blu-ray players sold in a specific
region are locked on a firmware level to
whichever region they are sold in which
like the disc you can usually see by
checking on the back of the player so if
you're in the US with a region one
player and you order a DVD from hongkong
like our example before which is in
region 3 assuming that you didn't buy a
region free disc on the black market you
are going to be out of luck though fun
fact some computer optical drives allow
you to change the region but after
you've done it a few times these drives
also become region locked in the
firmware but come on Linus
that's Stone Age technology I stream
everything online well even so you've
probably encountered region locking
anyway especially if you're trying to do
something like watch European soccer in
North America or access the u.s. Netflix
library from Canada in cases like these
the website you're trying to access will
determine your location by looking at
your IP address and block it if you're
in an IP range that they know belongs to
a different country and although many
enterprising movie lovers and sports
fans have gotten around this using VPN
services that route data traffic through
a different location which you can learn
more about here this
isn't a foolproof solution since some
content providers block IP ranges that
they suspect belong to commercial VPN
services as well okay then Linus why do
the powers that be bother with all of
this if I pay for something why can't I
just watch it don't they want my money
well it used to be that technological
compatibility was a big part of the
rationale for region locking when DVDs
started becoming widespread many TVs
were still predominantly using analog
inputs and different parts of the world
used incompatible standards for analog
TV with NTSC popular in the Americas
Korea and Japan and pal and SECAM
dominant in most of the rest of the
world this is actually why cartridges
for older game systems like thus ness
and Sega Genesis wouldn't work with
versions of the console purchased from
different countries although there were
workarounds but back to the bit about
creators in the modern day wanting your
money well someone definitely does but
who has the right to collect it you see
creators want to be able to control how
their content is distributed so they can
make royalties off of it and since there
isn't a worldwide emperor of copyright
Lord of distribution it often falls to
smaller third-party distributors in
individual countries who are contracted
to take a cut for handling marketing and
localization for the content and to pass
along some pre-negotiated royalties to
the original creator so with modern
digital standards allowing quick
distribution of nearly anything to the
entire world I still expect region
locking to be around for quite a while
as copyright holders try to keep their
content from floating about freely in
every corner of cyberspace and I wish
them luck with that speaking of luck if
you were wondering to yourself gee if
only there was an online platform where
I could get the best audiobooks for a
reasonable price and I could download
them and listen to them on my mobile
device if I'm you know bored at work
can I have a monotonous job or if I'm
driving or if I'm trying to fall asleep
at night then you're in luck because
audible.com exists yes my friends it
does to save you the person who wants to
read but doesn't have the time to sit
down and stare at a book from not
knowing what happens in really John how
to make friends and influence people by
Dale Carnegie because I'm lonely and my
employees never listen to me that's what
John puts in there well audible.com has
how to win friends and influence people
by Dale Carnegie but they also have lots
of other stuff too like fiction and
periodicals and Wow now I feel now I
feel really sad what a mean thing to say
