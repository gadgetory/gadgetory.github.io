going to show you how to install your
Intel CPU using LGA 1156 or 1155 as fast
as possible
the first step is to find the little
golden triangle on your CPU and align
that with either the little plastic
triangle on the cover or once you've
removed the cover the metal triangle
that is on the CPU socket itself in the
next step
push the retention arm lever down pull
away from the socket and then it will
loosen itself you can then pull it up
and move the hold down bracket out of
the way after that remembering where the
gold triangle of points place
don't press place the CPU into the
socket giving it a slight wiggle just to
ensure that it is seated correctly lower
the hold down plate making sure that it
actually sits under this screw right
here then lower the retention arm until
you feel some resistance brace yourself
because this does take a little bit of
force push it down all the way pull out
and then make sure that it's pinned by
the hook on the retention plate the
heatsink included with your CPU comes
with a quality thermal compound
pre-applied however there is a trick
with these push pin style heat sinks and
that is if you're reusing it you not
only need to reapply new thermal
compound but watch out for these arrows
right here you can see that they do
rotate 90 degrees so I'm going to turn
it in the direction of the arrow turning
it the direction the arrows pointed
optimizes it for removal turning it away
from that direction optimizes it for
installation so we want to make sure
they'll they're all turned clockwise
before we install it when positioning
the heatsink over the socket make sure
that the plastic pins stick through all
four holes in the motherboard the
easiest way to check this is to rotate
the heatsink a little bit and see if all
of the pins move just like this if they
do then they should all be through the
holes you also want to make sure that
you have enough slack on the CPU fan
wire to reach the CPU fan header on your
motherboard the safest way to tighten
the heatsink on is to apply force on
opposite corners at the same time there
are two ways to tell that the
installation was successful number one
is to listen for the distinctive click
the other way is to flip the board over
and make sure that the black plastic
sticks out as far as the white plastic
if it doesn't it's possible that you'll
have to tighten it a little bit there we
go now we heard the click these in cell
heatsinks often come with the fan wires
wrapped in such a way that the fan
blades can't move unless you loosen them
so take them out what I often do is
twist them up tuck them away somewhere
safe and then plug them into the labeled
CPU fan header on the motherboard thanks
for checking out this episode of fast as
possible make sure you subscribe to tech
quickie and also like the video it helps
us out a lot share this video with
anyone who you think would benefit from
it including embedding it on your
website
consider this my go ahead to well go
ahead also if you can think of any other
fast as possible episodes that you'd
like to see click the link in the
description to post in the forum thread
we will monitor that and we will make
sure that we check it out again thanks
for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
