a cyberpunk novel that's featured
characters with super awesome Bionic
body parts at some point Jax from Mortal
Kombat Adam Jensen from Deus Ex or
Barrett Wallace from Final Fantasy just
to name a few and the idea of powered
artificial limbs that work just as well
as real ones or even better has long
been a mainstay in fiction but could we
be getting close to making this a
reality for people who have been unlucky
enough to lose an arm or a leg
if so it'll have been a long time coming
false limbs and digits made from
materials such as wood iron and leather
have been in use for millennia
everywhere from ancient Egypt to the
Roman Republic to the high seas of the
16th century where peg legs were
famously used by pirates
but even though prosthetics have been
around a long time for the vast majority
of their history they didn't provide
much functionality other than aesthetics
except for artificial legs that would at
least allow a person to stand and while
various people over the centuries have
created designs to make prosthetics more
functional such as rudimentary joints at
the knees the biggest advancements have
been made in the past few decades modern
manufacturing processes have allowed the
production of artificial limbs that
often look like the real deal
and also seriously improve the quality
of life for the people who use them and
computer-aided design has enabled
precise measurement and modeling of
prosthetic body parts customized for
each patient as well as the manufacturer
of high quality joints and moving parts
modeled closely after their natural
counterparts additionally materials like
silicon and polyvinyl carbonate have
been used for artificial skin and hair
so that prosthetics don't have to look
like and for feel like cold hunks of
metal or plastic but how do patients
actually control these things many
prosthetics work with mechanical systems
powered by the user's own body for
example artificial hands that can open
and shut
thanks to a cable system that can be
operated with simple gestures such as
moving a shoulder other prosthetics use
mile electrics the electrical impulses
that contract your muscles so you'll
have electrodes that are at
hatched to the same place as the
prosthetic that can pick up these
impulses and send them to the artificial
limb which then moves according to what
the patient wants it to do but the real
excitement in the fields surrounds
prosthetics that are controlled
completely by thought the same way you'd
control an original body part in recent
years scientists have developed sensors
that can be directly implanted beneath
the skin and that interface with the
nerves so that when the brain sends an
impulse to your arm that says hey pick
up that canna soda the sensor can send
that impulse to a processor which will
direct the limb to follow your brains
orders cool right we're even seeing this
technology take a step further with
sensors embedded in prosthetic hands to
send signals to the brain and restore a
patient's sense of touch just like Luke
Skywalker in the Empire Strikes Back and
this new generation of smart prosthetics
doesn't stop at artificial limbs people
who suffer from impaired vision may have
more options in the future as AI
implants that project images directly
onto the retina could help patients that
have suffered physical trauma and
implants that make contact with the
brain hooked up to a small camera could
bypass the eye entirely and provide your
brain's Vision Center with images from
the outside world just don't expect
anything that will let you see through
walls anytime soon unless of course
you're the NSA speaking of walls let's
break down some barriers here with fresh
books and when I talk barriers that
fresh books can break down I'm not
talking walls I'm talking business
barriers fresh books is on a mission to
make freelancers and small business
owners less stressed and more organized
with their easy-to-use tools for
crafting and sending professional
invoices in seconds it also helps you
track your hours so you know exactly
what to put on that invoice when the
time comes what you did when you did it
and who you did it for you can even
accept deposits through their platform
so your work is paid for on your
schedule speaking of getting paid for
your customers can pay through the app
with their credit card and you can get a
confirmation when you know that they've
received it making the billing process
that much simpler getting started on
fresh books is extreme
simple even if you're not a numbers
person actually especially if you're not
a numbers person and you can try
