in your favorite electronics to up wall
sockets is a piece of cake
that is assuming you can find one and
you're not at a crowded Starbucks where
it seems like the entire town is hogging
every outlet but if you've ever built a
PC you know that plugging in components
requires a little more attention than
just ordering an overpriced latte and
finding a comfy chair there are
different connectors for everything
inside a PC and CPU sockets are no
exception and unlike something like PCI
Express which uses the same type of
connector for lots of different adding
components nearly every new CPU lineup
uses its own socket or if it does there
are software or firmware
interoperability x' anyway and this can
be quite confusing so let's break it
down for you starting with Intel sockets
a while back Intel used CPUs with pins
on the bottom that slot it into these
little pin grid things on the
motherboard and actually before that
some even used cartridges like the old
Pentium 2
kind of like a Nintendo game on the
bottom these days though Intel desktop
processors use a mounting system called
land grid array
better known as LGA all this means is
that the bottom of the CPU has electric
contact pads while the pins themselves
are in the socket on the motherboard
I guess LGA was a better acronym than
calling it pins on socket or POS now if
you're buying an Intel CPU you'll see
that the socket identifier will be
something along the lines of LGA 1151 or
LGA 2011 these numbers just indicate how
many pins are on the bottom of the
socket and pads on the bottom of the CPU
and if you're wondering why they need so
many by the way a big part of the reason
is power delivery CPUs especially some
of them can consume a lot of power and
dividing it between many different pins
actually helps to stabilize it so the
processor
doesn't become overloaded now if you're
more of a fan of the red team and you
want to buy an AMD CPU AMD also ditched
the cartridge system a long time ago but
stuck with the pins on the bottom of the
CPU at least on their consumer desktop
processors so they're using a system
called pin grid array or PGA here the
socket itself still has the little holes
for inserting the pins of the CPU now
AMD doesn't use the same naming scheme
as Intel so don't expect to see things
like PGA 9:42 when you buy instead
you'll see names like FM 2 or am3+ 4
there a series AP use and their FX CPUs
respectively or a.m. 4 for their
upcoming Zen architecture chips but
regardless of which side you're on in
the CPU war remember that both Intel and
AMD chips do not require any direct
pressure on the chip in order to be
properly inserted if you're pushing down
on them you're probably doing it wrong
instead modern CPUs are held in with
retention arms this is because the pins
on the socket or the CPU are very
fragile and pushing down on the
processor can easily damage your
processor the motherboard or both
especially if they're misaligned instead
gently place your CPU into the socket
and make sure it is properly aligned
before putting down the retention arm we
actually have guides on how to do this
in some of the earliest videos on tech
quickie which you check out here and
here of course you'll need a CPU cooler
as well and although many popular
coolers these days support most modern
sockets it's a good idea to confirm that
your socket will work with the heatsink
you bought unless of course you're
interested in trying to turn your
processor into the world's smallest
frying pan speaking of sockets if you're
looking for something to plug into your
headphone jack master op has another one
of their killer deals going on today the
mass drop AKG K 7 xx red Edition
headphones are currently available over
there at the exclusive price of just
$1.99 which is a whopping four hundred
and fifty dollar savings over MSRP
they're individually tested and numbered
they're open-back headphones they sound
absolutely great
reviewed the non-red version of them a
little while ago on my other channel and
they only exist because of mass drops
close collaboration with AKG to bring
this products to life so over on mass
drop linked in the video description you
can find these kinds of collaborative
products as well as just any product
where mass drop went to the manufacturer
said hey can we get a deal when to the
consumers as it hey can a bunch of you
commit to buy and put those two things
together so a head on over there again
that's linked in the video description
it's draw dots slash tech quickie so go
check it out so thanks for watching guys
if you like this video like it if you
disliked it dislike it if you want to
check out our other channels boo-boom
channel super funds right over there and
