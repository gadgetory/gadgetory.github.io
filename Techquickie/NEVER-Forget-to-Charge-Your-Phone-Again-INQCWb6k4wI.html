down after a hard day of work and
realize Oh hamburgers I forgot to plug
in my phone if only I could just
magically charge it somewhere near my
charger well that's actually a thing but
how in the world do you get electricity
to travel over distances further than
while you get with current wireless
charging pads that your phone has to
physically sit on well to start off it
helps to understand why something like
Qi charging or even electric toothbrush
charger has to have a gadget basically
touching it in order to transfer power
these types of chargers work using a
principle called an electromagnetic
induction you see when you plug in a
wireless charger it creates a current in
a loop of wire inside the charging pad
this current in turn generates a
magnetic field that can actually cause
current to flow inside another nearby
coil such as the one inside the charging
spot on your phone or that electric
toothbrush and although this isn't too
difficult to implement the issue is that
it only works over very short distances
in fact the distances between the
charger and the device has to be much
shorter than the diameter of the coil in
order for it to work properly we're
talking like millimeters maybe even less
here so one form of distance charging
takes the induction mechanism and
improves it by creating a resonance
coupling you see currents connected to a
capacitor like inside a wireless charger
naturally have their current change
direction due to the charge flowing from
one end to the other
going through the coil and then
accumulating in the other end making the
current then reverse itself this is
called oscillation and the circuits have
a natural frequency at which they lost
late so due to some pretty complicated
physics that's like way beyond the scope
of this video if you have two coils that
oscillate at the same frequency they
will resonate and that energy will
actually travel more directly between
them rather than just kind of going all
over the place like with a regular
inductive coil this means instead of
having to place a gadget right on top of
the charger the charger would instead
work over a distance of several
centimeters even up to tens of
centimeters with larger coils working
over longer distances
let's go prove useful not only for
charging phones and laptops by putting
them into a charging basket or something
like that so even if there's
like a nearby charger and it's on your
desk it still charges perfectly fine but
also for keeping low power objects such
as wireless mice smart home devices all
of that could just be perpetually
powered with no wires at all and because
of their improved efficiency resonant
coupling can also be used to charge
gadgets more quickly if you don't mind
setting them atop a charging pad Dell
actually has a resonant charging pad
that can put out 30 watts of power to
charge one of its laptops making it
almost as fast as just having a plugged
into the wall resonant induction is also
being incorporated into a Mercedes sedan
where the car can just basically Park
over a coil in the ground and start
charging without any need for those
messy wires but if you want distance
charging that works efficiently across
say an entire room RF charging or
infrared charging might be a better bet
you know how you can put power in your
home using light waves from the Sun or
how you can use microwaves to heat up
last night's leftovers except for pizzas
that's better cold well they both work
using similar principles except without
the risk of sunburn or being boiled
alive RF uses lower frequency radio
waves like your existing Wi-Fi router
and can transmit just a few milli watts
of power
one company energies is hoping that
their own RF charger will catch on and
is marketing to be able to charge at
distances of up to 15 feet but just like
the light from a flashlight RF charging
attenuates that is to say it gets weaker
over a distance so placing a gadget near
the edge of an RF chargers range means
that you probably won't be getting
enough power to charge your phone
although a smaller device like a
keyboard or a SmartWatch might be fair
game as for infrared charging we
actually collaborated with a company who
is working on this tech we charged in a
recent video where they showed us that
even though IR can be used to transmit
more power even several watts
making it suitable for distance
smartphone charging their handshake
protocol stops transmission outright
when it detects an obstacle like a human
hand or your eyeballs which help to get
approved for organizations it's like ul
and FDA there's still a lot of progress
that can be made at this time there are
many devices that have the necessary
receivers built-in for either RF or IR
but if the technology matures we may be
headed to a much more Wire free
world in the not-so-distant future
hopefully Apple will build in support
for one or both of these standards
giving others the courage to adopt them
and we'll start seeing compatible
products on the market over the next few
years but until then take a second to
plug in your phone before bed there's no
telling what you might miss on if you
don't well you could be missing out on
is ting ting is the mobile carrier that
is focused on customer service and
customer satisfaction first you don't
speak to a robot and get put directly
through to a person with ting you only
pay for what you use with the average
ting bill being twenty three dollars a
month per device and if you're stuck in
a contract and switch to tang to cover
25% of your cancellation fee up to $75
they're lowering their mobile data rates
data is now just $10 per gigabyte beyond
the second gigabyte and every single
tank customer will be able to reap the
benefits of this new change so head over
to tech quickie Tang comm and try out
their savings calculator when you sign
up at our link you'll also get $25 and
service credit or $25 towards a new
device so thanks for watching like

you just trying to sabotage LTT comment
