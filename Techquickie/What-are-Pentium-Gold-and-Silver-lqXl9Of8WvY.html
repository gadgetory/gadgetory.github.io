the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos if you're a
longtime tech quickie viewer you know
that we've had reservations about CPU
naming schemes for a long time
Intel named a CPU lineup core - even
though some of those tips had four cores
then they gave us core 3 Core i5 and
core i7 despite the fact that they don't
make any processors in any of those
lines with an odd number of course and
then this scheme was subsequently copied
by AMD for its new Rison series and
between you and me I've always thought
that Celeron sounds more like a villain
from a b-movie though even vegetables
now and tell us throwing precious metals
into the mix now to be fair they are
actually used in processor manufacturing
but that doesn't help us understand what
exactly it is we're buying so let's
demystify the recently released Pentium
gold and Pentium silver chips from Intel
for starters Pentium Gold doesn't mean
that intel has souped up a lower tier
chip to be one of the most powerful
products ever I mean think about how
easy it is to get a gold credit card
these days Pentium gold is basically a
rebranding strategy for their standard
desktop grade Pentium CPUs starting with
the KB Lake generation and since these
gold chips are just rebranded the good
news is that you won't need any kind of
special new socket or motherboard to use
them one cool thing is that Pentium gold
cpus do feature hyper threading making
them more like what core i3 s were not
too long ago where things start to get a
little less clear is when we get into
the Pentium silver lineup the name
suggests that it's kind of like a less
nice version of gold but it's actually a
really different product silver chips
aren't available in boxes from your
favorite online stores rather they are
lower power chips primarily
designed for the mobile segment where
battery life is far more important than
peak performance and although some
Pentium Silver's will be desktop
variants with slightly higher TDPS
they all use BGA sockets meaning that
they get soldered onto the motherboard
rather than being removable by the user
they also use very different
microarchitectures while Pentium Gold
will continue to use normal desktop
architectures like KB Lake silver cpus
are built around low-power designs
similar to what you'd see in Intel Atom
processors in compact and mobile gadgets
however one thing that is interesting
about Pentium silver is that it will
support HEV C and vp9 video at 4k these
are compression standards that can
deliver high quality video with less
data and with Netflix using vp9 a
Pentium silver could be helpful if
you're fighting battery life or
bandwidth limits on mobile if you aren't
silver also supports a hundred and sixty
megahertz wide Wi-Fi channels and while
channels this wide can actually
sometimes cause or be susceptible to
interference they can enable faster
speeds if your router is up to scratch
though this is also true of the slightly
lower end Celeron chips that are
essentially the same but have lower
clock speeds or fewer cores so yeah I
mean the features are kind of cool but
I'm not sure that Intel really clarified
anything for us consumers by naming
their wares after metals especially
considering they recently did the same
thing with the server grade Xeon chips
and that just ended up confusing
everyone to hopefully though this clears
things up enough for now and Intel won't
decide to throw iridium titanium and
plutonium into the mix anytime soon
which yeah I should just probably stop
giving them ideas Squarespace makes it
easy to build a simple powerful and
beautiful website like seriously with
their 24/7 support via live chat and
email pretty much anyone can do it you
just pick one of the gorgeous templates
all of which feature responsive design
so your website will scale to look great

you start adding text
before you know it BAM you've got a
beautiful functional website
all of them have commerce built in so
you can set up your own online store
their cover pages feature allows you to
set up a beautiful one-page online
presence in minutes and this is new
