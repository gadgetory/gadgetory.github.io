landing the first generation of video
games appeared on large computers a man
named Ralph H Baer conceived of the idea
of a home video game and created a
design for a series of consoles which
ultimately appeared in 1972 as the
Magnavox Odyssey the very first console
which would be hooked up to a TV but
obviously it wasn't quite like a modern
console the Odyssey actually came with
translucent overlays that you would put
on your TV screen to imitate graphics as
well as board game style accessories
like dice and play money The Odyssey
actually sold pretty well but it wasn't
until the arcade game pong that the
public began to really notice the video
gaming industry which sparked a
revolution in gaming the second
generation of consoles introduced the
ColecoVision notable for being powerful
enough to run popular arcade games the
Microvision the first handheld console
with interchangeable cartridges and of
course the famous atari 2600 which
helped make the concept of game
cartridges the dominant model of game
distribution for quite some time
unfortunately these consoles suffered
from the infamous video game crash of
1983 a huge downturn in the gaming
market as many new companies tried to
jump into the industry and capitalize on
it leading to the production of many
poor quality games and consoles as well
as growing competition from the emerging
PC market as a result only the
well-established companies survived by
the third generation video games were
kind of seen as a fad that had passed
but Nintendo revived the gaming industry
by releasing the NES or Nintendo
Entertainment System and the Game Boy
handheld by the way Nintendo's focus on
strict quality control and for the time
advanced graphical capabilities made the
NES its highest selling console in North
America and bringing the console raised
back to life which led us into the
fourth generation that featured the
turbo graphics the first 16-bit console
and more famously
the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo
or SNES cartridges were still dominant
but it was during this time that optical
media CDs to be precise started to look
pretty attractive the higher capacity of
CD ROMs compared to cartridges led them
to be used in next-generation consoles
like the Sega Saturn and the original
Sony Playstation at the start of the
fifth generation these consoles were
among the first to bring real 3d
graphics into the living room
CDs also had the advantage of being
cheaper making it easier to produce
copies of games in bulk leading both
console manufacturers and game
developers to prefer them over
cartridges thanks to their higher
margins
however the Nintendo 64 and did manage
to enjoy success as a cartridge based
system with nintendo touting quick
loading times as a big advantage over
discs but by the sixth generation
well that was where the beginning of the
move towards a more PC like architecture
to make consoles more useful as
general-purpose devices that could do
more than just play games really
happened and we also saw a shift away
from cartridges entirely and towards
DVDs from CDs which could hold
significantly more data making it
possible to develop games with better
visuals and more content like full
voiceovers this generation also saw some
of the first experimentation with online
play as well as both flash and hard
drive based storage so you wouldn't have
to fiddle about with memory cards a
feature found on both the PlayStation 2
and the original Xbox it wasn't until
the 7th generation of consoles hit the
market in 2005 with systems like the
PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii
that we finally got now standard
features like HD resolutions that is as
long as we're not talking about Nintendo
online play and motion controls this
generation also included support for new
disc formats like Blu ray and the long
since forgotten HD DVD as well as large
hard drives that enabled companies to
make the internet a very popular way for
gamers to download more content the
current generation of consoles the 8th
gender
raishin including the Xbox one
PlayStation 4 and Wii U has brought us
significant performance improvements
those were long overdue as well as
innovations like the Nintendo 3ds which
allows the user to see a stereoscopic 3d
image without glasses most of the
changes in the eighth generation however
revolve around further integration with
other media such as web browsing
streaming visual media social media
sharing and even streaming what you're
doing on your console to other devices
for playing on the go with Sony's PS
Vita or at a computer with Microsoft's
Xbox app but I mean come on Linus why
would you buy a console at all of any
generation when you could enjoy your PC
and all its glory well honestly consoles
aren't as powerful as pcs we know this
but they're made for gamers who may not
care as much about the absolute highest
frame rates or resolutions and want to
kick back on the couch and play but with
that said as the technology improves
maybe one day they will merge together
and the glorious pecan Soul master race
will be born I wouldn't hold your breath
though speaking of holding your breath
have you ever tried this walk into the
local convenience store or supermarket
take a deep breath and see if you can
hold it for the amount of time that it
takes to walk way the crap into the back
find someone to unlock the barricaded
razor blade lock for you get it walk
back to the till buy it and drive back
to your house I actually don't recommend
doing that because you would probably
pass out on the floor Dollar Shave Club
though makes it so you never have to do
that because they'll deliver your razor
blades you're dr. Carver's shave butter
that goes on clear your one wipe
Charlies peppermint scented butt wipes
for men and your post shave moisturizer

there's no need for you to leave the
house in order to look like you leave
the house and it's just simple
high-quality stuff there's no vibrating
handles or other nonsense that's a lot
more fun for other people than it is for
you like who wants to a vibrating handle
in your hand in other places they'd be
