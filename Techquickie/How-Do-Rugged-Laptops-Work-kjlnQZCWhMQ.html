the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos we've all
been there you're up late working on a
report playing some overwatch or just
catching up on those Netflix shows
you're too embarrassed to tell anyone
you watch you reach for your drink
without looking and bam a torrent of
mountain dew spills into your laptop and
try as you might you never get it
working quite right again the solution
well I could say it's to be more careful
next time but you guys know what you
clicked on let's talk about the
ruggedized devices out there that can
survive way more than a bottle of soda
companies like GTECH Panasonic and Dell
offer laptops that look less like what
you're using to watch tech quickie and
class right now and more like something
the president might use to order a
military strike but just how tough are
they and what specifically allows them
to survive in extreme conditions to
start let's talk about how they resist
two of the most common environmental
hazards water and dust since water
droplets and dust particles are very
tiny fully ruggedized laptops employ
strategies that go beyond screwing on an
enclosure to keep them out the
electronics inside can be sealed via
techniques like injection molding which
can not only protect against rain or
water splashes but also allow prolonged
use in very humid environments think
about our soldier deployed in a tropical
setting and sometimes engineers even
fill enclosures with non conductive
silicone to ensure that nothing can
touch your sensitive components a
technique called potting potting is also
an effective way to protect the
electronics inside from our next hazards
falls and vibrations you can think of it
like wrapping a fragile item in bubble
wrap before you ship it some ruggedized
laptops don't fully pot their
electronics though instead
coating them in a thin layer of
waterproof material and installing
aluminum stiffeners which can also help
to absorb a shock before it reaches a
PCB or other sensitive component but
what about heat doesn't all this sealing
and reinforcing prevent heat from
exiting the chassis great point it turns
out that not only are some of these
sealants chosen for their thermally
conductive properties so the sealant
itself can carry heat to a cooling
surface but manufacturers can also place
cooling fans strategically so that water
can't hit the motherboard through
outside vents usually this means placing
a fan outside of the sealed inner
electronics chamber or running heat
pipes through the chamber wall and
sealing up the cracks of course the
simple fact that modern mobile
processors run much cooler than they did
a decade or two ago helps to our next
hazard is less obvious he is bad for
electronics but what about cold device
is working in extremely frigid
conditions can end up with water
condensing on their sensitive components
causing them to short out for that
reason some ultra rugged laptops even
integrate small heaters so that let's
say researchers studying Penguins in the
Antarctic won't have their computer
freeze at an inopportune moment okay so
then penguin scientists sure but who
else needs this kind of stuff well part
of the reason that ruggedized computers
exist at all is that they're designed to
a military spec for use by armed forces
and defense contractors some are even
tested in acidic environments and
against gun fire vibrations to ensure
that they can withstand the harsh
conditions of a battlefield the hardiest
laptops are even built to an IP spec of
69 K which you can learn more about up
here meaning that not only are they
fully dust proof they can also survive
high temperatures and Eve
high-pressure spray downs if they need
to be washed so pick some combination of
these protections plus a toughened glass
display which you can actually learn
more about here or a touch screen that
can be used with gloves on add powerful
back lights and a high contrast panel
technology so you can see what's
happening on the screen even in bright
sunlight and you got yourself a laptop
that can go pretty much anywhere you can
sounds great
rugged laptops for all okay hold on a
second
ruggedized laptops do have some common
issues a big Achilles heel is IO
although ports can be protected with
tight ceiling covers or plugs they are
still a potential point of ingress for
outside contaminants especially when you
open them up to use them and while some
manufacturers have somewhat mitigated
this problem by keeping the i/o
electronics in a separate chamber from
the main housing kind of like our fan
example earlier this still means that
your ports can be damaged in harsh
conditions even if the rest of the
system stays usable and unsurprisingly
all this ruggedness can come at quite a
cost especially for fully rugged
military-grade models which can go for
over $10,000 each and that's without the
latest core i7 and sli graphics cards
but with all of that said if you're
finding yourself constantly playing
League of Legends around your messy
roommates who don't seem to care about
what they spill or where it goes can you
really afford not to get one tunnel
there VPN it's super easy to use they've
got apps for iOS Android PC and Mac
they've even got a Chrome extension and
all you got to do is pick a country turn
tunnel bear on and boom your internet
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched to some anonymous
one so you know whether it's an
advertiser looking to profit from your
data or your isp wondering what exactly
it is that your browse
and downloading that all that stuff gets
anonymized and tunnel bear gets past all
the annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal use no
port configurations DNS router settings
nothing like that it does it all in the
background they've got a top-rated
privacy policy they don't log user
activity and you can try it out for free
with five hundred Meg's of free data no
credit card required if you like it all
you got to do to get a year of unlimited
data and save 10% on it while you're at
it let's go over to tunnel Vericom slash
