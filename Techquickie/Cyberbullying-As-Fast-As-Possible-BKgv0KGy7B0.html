parties where a larger subject in a
stake embroidered gene or leather
jackets elicits money from a smaller
weaker subject against his or her will
or at least that was how it worked in
the 1980s when david hasselhoff and his
Firebird still ruled the streets but as
the tired old trend of interpersonal
interaction rapidly declined in favor of
digital communication it seemed we
couldn't drop the nasty trend of being
nasty to each other in fact the
proliferation of harassment via
information technology networks such as
hate based websites email slander
campaigns and threatening phone calls
had become frequent enough by 2004 that
it led to a term to describe the
experience of repeated and targeted
digital abuse cyberbullying and as it
turned out this was just in the nick of
time for the next great evolution of
bullying social networking social media
changed the bullying landscape by giving
people unprecedented access to the
personal lives of well everybody 74
percent of teenagers according to the
Pew Research Center and once the
networking services became ubiquitous
with cell phones it meant that bullies
could access their victims at anytime in
place from school to work to even home
in fact approximately one in three
teenagers report having experienced some
form of cyberbullying this is also
according to Pew including everything
from having private messages shared
without permission false rumors spread
and even physical threats so then a
common reaction from many who first
encounter cyber harassment is to say
well ok love I'll just unplug everything
this is easy
however the emotional distress and
stigma from bullying can follow a person
far beyond their plugged in experience
with victims exhibiting higher incident
rates of psychological problems
depression and substance abuse issues
according to research by the
cyberbullying Research Center and
because cyberbullying disproportionately
affects teenagers and this is according
to statistics Netherlands there has been
concerned from organizations such as the
US Department of Health and Human
Services about the effects of this type
of bullying on
still development and the possibility
that it could cause emotional and
behavioral issues later on in life
thankfully social media providers seem
to agree that there's a problem and
things like page visibility only upon
author approval and blocking for
individual users have become near
Universal some services such as
YouTube's take it a step further letting
users define what type of unwanted
material they're reporting from
unsolicited to explicit or even violent
and harassing speech or there's twitch
which allows broadcasters to temporarily
timeout people instead of banning them
outright giving a chance for the
perpetrators behavior to be modified via
social reinforcement which is not to say
at all that these features are foolproof
as it is not uncommon for miscreants to
gain them by setting up dummy accounts
or even abuse them by reporting people
who have done nothing wrong and efforts
to legislate against cyberbullying
haven't gone swimmingly either with
reports of online bullying continuing to
rise according to the Boston based
Education Development Center on the
bright side campaigns like stomp out
bullying in the US and delete
cyberbullying in the EU have led to a
growing awareness and a drive for people
to be proactive about this issue because
while this hasn't been a very funny
episode of tech quickie it's kind of a
serious issue and if you or anyone that
you know has experienced anything more
than you know the mildly irritating
levels of online abuse that we all just
seem to kind of accept to the point
where you feel like it's really having
an impact on you it's important to reach
out to nearby support because no one
deserves that kind of mistreatment and
last but not least take care not to be a
griefer yourself speaking of support you
know who will support you through the
whole process of integrating easy online
payments into your app yeah that was a
pretty beleaguered Segway Braintree
