excuse me venerable Internet Explorer
was a lot like the cheeseburger on the
menu at your local Chinese joint it was
always just kind of there even though
nearly everyone opted for Chrome Firefox
or kung pao chicken instead and could
you really blame them most popular
alternatives to ie offered faster
performance better compatibility and
security and more useful features that
left Internet Explorer in the dust so
after seeing II's usage share drop-off
for 12 straight years Microsoft decided
it was time to abandon ship and build an
entirely different browser called edge
and even though the edge logo is
suspiciously similar to that infamous e
Microsoft has promised a faster browsing
experience behind the scenes that plays
nicely with modern websites but talk is
cheap how is Microsoft going to deliver
on its assurances of a better browser
well similarly to how a game uses a
rendering engine to make pretty pictures
appear on your screen browsers use their
own rendering engines to show you
coherent web pages instead of a wall of
garbled junk and Microsoft has developed
an all-new engine called edge HTML which
was originally developed from II's
trident engine but has the old IE code
removed which microsoft says will make
modern web pages load faster and more
accurately and speaking of making things
faster edge also no longer supports
ActiveX or browser helper objects those
old internet explorer plugins that were
notorious for being super susceptible to
malware that could slow down your PC
direct you to malicious websites or
worse but on all the improvements are
just behind the scenes stuff edge also
has a new user interface that promises
to be less clunky than IE for starters
Microsoft has finally decided it's not a
good idea to crowd together browser tabs
and the address bar on the same line and
has reserved the entire top of the
screen for tabs like other modern
browsers edge has also moved to a single
menu scheme for changing options instead
of the messy internet options box that
has been with
since freakin Windows 95 and I guess
while that's all finding dandy Lynas
hold on a second it sounds like edges
purely playing catch-up with the other
browsers here does it actually offer
anything that I won't get with Chrome or
Firefox as a matter of fact yes edge is
trying to set itself apart from its
competitors by offering additional
functionality without the need for
third-party browser extensions something
that let's face it most non power users
are not really using so namely you can
annotate and markup web pages just by
clicking a button at the top of the
screen then you can share them or save
them to OneNote
pretty cool stuff and additionally edge
features integration with Cortana the
new Windows 10 personal assistant making
it easy to quickly look up information
about any topic you see on a web page
use voice controls or even get things
like driving directions or dinner
reservations but despite all these
improvements edge really ready for
primetime although the new rendering
engine should certainly deliver better
performance our tests have shown it
still legs behind Chrome and Firefox in
a number of benchmarks and it still
isn't as compliant with newer web
standards like html5 as the competition
and although a simpler UI will be a
welcome change for many power users may
find themselves frustrated at the rather
lean options in the settings menu I mean
even something as simple as the default
download directory cannot be changed
without a registry tweak so let us know
in the comments can you live without
right-click paste and go and give edge a
chance as long as it means ie is finally
going the way of Clippy or are you just
going to stick with the other
third-party browsers that you already
know and love speaking of sticking with
things we know and love we certainly
