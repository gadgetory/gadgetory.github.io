almost 25 years ago its model of free
and open source software knocked down
all of the walls that had previously
been put in place by proprietary
software giants like Microsoft in order
to maintain control over the development
and distribution of computer programs
and as was said in a world without walls
who needs windows and gates when using
Windows its high degree of compatibility
makes it fine for everyday use for many
people especially gamers but since
Windows is a proprietary operating
system developers and users more or less
have to work within a relatively closed
software environment that places certain
restrictions on what you can do anyone
who is dealt with Windows Update or
Microsoft DRM features knows what I mean
Linux on the other hand has a completely
open-source kernel the central part of
the operating system that links your
Hardware with applications meaning that
it can be used freely for a purpose of
whatever you want for tons of different
use case scenarios etc these different
versions of Linux are commonly called
distributions or distros which provide
different stacks of software tools and
desktop environments all of which are
tied to the Linux kernel that combine to
form a complete operating system these
distros can range from anything like
Ubuntu or mint which are popular desktop
distributions often use as alternatives
to Windows to something like Android on
your smartphone two versions of Linux
found on supercomputers Linux is focus
on security and stability compared to
Windows which focuses more on ease of
use as made Linux extremely popular for
servers and other super critical
applications Linux is also generally
more lightweight and less resource heavy
than Windows which is beneficial for
home users who just want a very fast
computing experience on a possibly
low-end machine and even professionals
running servers that require high
efficiency as they can pick a distro
tailored for them by being very light on
stuff like eye candy and background
processes even to the point of being
just a command-line interface and while
that all sounds great that
doesn't mean that it's a great idea to
just run home and migrate your home PC
from Windows to Linux although a lot of
work has gone into making desktop Linux
distributions more user-friendly over
the last 10 years there's still a pretty
sharp learning curve if you've never
used Linux before Linux offers a lot
more granular control over your computer
than something like Windows or Mac OS
which actually does share a common
ancestor with Linux being Unix but
that's maybe something for a different
day taking advantage of this granular
control often requires a fair amount of
technical knowledge even if you're
running a simple system like something
like a Raspberry Pi it can still be
rather complicated and even distros that
place a greater emphasis on ease of use
do take some getting used to if all
you've ever known is Windows or Mac for
example most software isn't downloaded
through a web browser and installed
during Exe file like as it is in Windows
but instead goes through a package
manager which download software from
large repository specific to each
distribution kind of like an app store
on your phone that might sound a little
bit restrictive compared to the open
nature of searching for Windows software
on the web there's actually a wide
variety of applications available
through these package managers and tons
of these are free programs continuing
the Linux tradition of using open source
code but what if you want to game this
can admittedly be a challenge for a
number of titles requiring you to run a
Windows compatibility layer such as wine
to even to get them to work at all the
good news is that steam now features
over 1,000 games that work on Linux just
fine and the new steam OS is Linux based
as well so trying to master the
challenges that Linux presents in order
to tap into its potential sounds like
something that you want to do check out
some of the numerous free resources
available online like Linux newbie guide
to get additional technical info and
figure out exactly how you'd like to
customize it but if that sounds a little
bit overwhelming and you're mostly drawn
to Linux because of its infinitely cute
penguin mascot tux
you can download the completely
open-source sewing patterns to make your
own tux plushie and even though they've
been in alpha since I believe 2004 you
don't have to worry about recompiling
the kernel in order to do it another
thing you don't have to compile the
kernel to do is Dollar Shave Club get
razors and other bathroom supplies
shipped directly to your door for only a
few bucks a month you can get dr.
Carver's shave butter one wipe Charlies
post shave moisturizer travel sizes for
like all of these things and a variety

none of that nonsense as you probably
know just some high-quality razors and
other various bathroom supplies like
butt wipes sent directly to your door go
