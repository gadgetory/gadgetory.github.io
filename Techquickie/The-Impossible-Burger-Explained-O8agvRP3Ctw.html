a long-running joke about vegetarians
and vegans they're strictly against
eating meat but yet they seem to try
awfully hard to make their food sound
and look like meat I mean Tofurky but I
can tell that they're faking it but
whether you're a fan of meatless meat or
you enjoy real dead animal on the Reg a
huge issue that most people agree on is
that vegetarian meat substitutes don't
even come close to tasting like the real
thing I mean there's only so many
condiments that you can pile on to a
tofu hotdog to try to mask that flavor
but one company's claims have made
headlines recently they say they've used
technology to fool your taste buds into
thinking that fake beef is the real
thing with a product they call the
impossible burger and we're not talking
about producing edible meat without
slaughtering animals by growing what is
fundamentally still actual meat in a lab
the impossible burger apparently
achieves this using only plant derived
ingredients come on Linus this has
already been tried with those black bean
burgers that literally didn't fool
anyone why are we even talking about
this because instead of just smashing a
bunch of mushrooms or whatever into a
burger shape and slapping it on a bun
the folks behind the impossible burger
decided to use laboratory procedures to
filter and isolate proteins in real beef
that they believe are responsible for
its characteristic flavor and texture
one technique they used is called gas
chromatography and this separates the
different compounds that contribute
flavor to cooked beef allowing
scientists to more easily identify them
by smell and then synthesize them
artificially
without the need for an actual cow it is
truly astonishing what you can do with
huge amounts of venture capital sorry
anyway one thing they've specifically
focused on is heme a component of
hemoglobin which is the stuff that
carries oxygen around your body and
makes your blood red so it shouldn't be
surprising that red meat is full of it
well their scientists were able to
isolate a heme gene from soybeans and
insert it into yeast DNA a common
strategy for producing large amounts of
a protein that you want insulin for
example heme is not only responsible for
some of the burgers flavor but also the
way that it simulates bleeding when you
bite into it so by blending heme these
flavor compounds protein from wheat and
potatoes and pieces of fat from coconuts
of all things impossible Foods thinks
it's gotten pretty darn close to the
real deal by going far above and beyond
coloring mashed-up peas with beetroot
juice the basis of the competing beyond
burger but is it any good well that's in
the mouth of the beholder of course some
commentators say it's extremely close to
real beef and they would be hard-pressed
to tell the difference if they didn't
know what they were eating beforehand
while others have said that it's way too
crumbly and soft to be mistaken for an
actual burger I personally haven't tried
it yet because with the concept of
dumping heme and real yet synthesized
beef proteins into a fake burger being
relatively new the US Food and Drug
Administration has noted that the
impossible Burger hasn't yet met the
requirements for the soy hemat uses to
be generally recognized as safe but that
doesn't mean you can't get one if that
doesn't deter you and you're curious
about the latest creation from the faux
meat industry you can get the impossible
burger at 47 restaurants in California
Texas New York City and Las Vegas
though impossible Foods is planning to
expand to grocery stores and other
countries in the future unsurprisingly
it'll cost you a little more than a real
burger but as with seemingly so many
things in life you have to cough up some
money up front to find out if a product
will meet your expectations meet your
expectations really John I wonder if we
could genetically engineer a better
writer
