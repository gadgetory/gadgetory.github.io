explaining refresh rates for monitors
and TVs but things have changed quite a
bit these days with displays featuring
super high refresh rates adaptive sync
technology and ultra-high resolutions so
it's time for round two of what you
should know before committing to just
one display for a hopefully fulfilling
long term relationship and this video is
sponsored by Intel now the first thing
it would probably help to know is why a
high refresh rate monitor is good so a
higher refresh rate measured in hertz
will not only make many kinds of motion
on your screen look smoother it can also
be quite important for gaming you see
contrary to popular belief the human eye
is actually really really good at
detecting changes in motion that is to
say that no it is not limited to 24
frames per second so a higher refresh
rate display coupled with a powerful
graphics card and processor will make
animations appear more realistic by
reducing choppiness and blur and
increasing immersion another benefit is
that not only is the action smoother but
you're actually seeing more frames in
other words you're catching visual
elements that you might be missing with
a more run-of-the-mill display in a
fast-paced game this is actually more
than just an aesthetic advantage and can
even give you a competitive edge in fact
many competitive gamers and eSports
teams value high refresh rate monitors
because they allow the player to see
things just a little more clearly or
quickly than their opponent now as I
alluded to before however to reap these
benefits you need powerful hardware to
spit out frames quickly enough to keep
your monitor fed if you drop extra money
on a 144 Hertz monitor for example but
your graphics card can only muster 30 or
60 frames per second in the games you
play most often many of those screen
refreshes that you see won't actually
contain new frames of information so
your experience isn't going to be any
better
another thing to consider is exactly how
high of a refresh rate you need these
days it's quite common to see one tier
of high-end monitors that offer a 120 or
144 Hertz refresh rate and then another
tier of displays that can push out 165
200 or even 240 refreshes per second
unsurprisingly the monitors tend to get
more expensive as the refresh rates get
higher while offering diminishing
returns for many people now the vast
majority of us can easily tell the
difference between a 30 and 60 frame per
second video or game but it's a bit
harder for some folks to tell the
difference between 60 and 120 and harder
still once you get up above 200 so if
it's at all possible to try before you
buy then by all means do that so you're
not plunking down money for something
that you won't even get maximum
enjoyment from this is especially true
if you're not gaming as applications for
frame rates beyond 60 are very limited I
mean even ultra smooth online video
typically maxes out at around 60 frames
per second so don't pick up an expensive
monitor thinking that it's going to make
your entire competing experience that
much better furthermore it's important
to remember that there are often
trade-offs if you go for the very top
end of the monitor stack very high
refresh rate models often use TN panels
as it's more difficult to incorporate
high refresh rate Tec into IPS displays
TN panels which you can learn more about
up here offer fast response but
typically they have noticeably worse
color and viewing angles
compared to other display types and
that's not to mention even that most of
the 240 Hertz monitors out there are
currently limited to 1080p resolution
now it should be noted that more
advanced solutions such as one
millisecond IPS panels ultra wide 200
Hertz and even 4k at 144 Hertz have just
made their way to the market and they
promise incredibly awesome experiences
with even HDR at those
Solutions and refresh rates but that
assumes you've got very very deep
pockets so whatever you go with just
make sure that you're leaving some room
in your budget for the games themselves
or you're not really gonna enjoy it that
is unless we could just start shooting
tech quickie at 240 FPS so I'll look
just as smooth as I do on the dance
floor yeah we all know that's not what I
look like on the day well we all know
that is what I look like on the dance
floor so let's move it
speaking of smooth this segue to our

Intel thinks you should be looking for
in a gaming monitor head over to WWE

gaming and hardware not only can you
shop for the latest gaming laptops and
desktops but you can also get tips mods
and information on eSports so be sure to
check out their article on how to buy a
gaming monitor which we've linked in the
video description so thanks for watching
