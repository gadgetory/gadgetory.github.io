most of us have experienced purchasing
an anticipated game shortly after its
release and then hunkering down to catch
up on some serious play time just to be
blown to bits by our friends who
mastered the game weeks earlier have
grown bored of it and only hopped on to
punish us for fun well in the old 8-bit
days that would be the end of the story
since whatever came with the box was
what we were eternally left with but
today thanks to the sweet sweet Internet
and a downloadable content publishers
can continue to breathe new life into
previously released products much to the
delight or sometimes dismay of their
fans DLC content such as storyline
extensions extra character packs
equipment upgrades and skins usually
range in price from nothing given freely
in the form of things like basic math
quest or item expansions to $20 or
higher for expensive storyline content
or bundles of other DLC commonly called
season passes might not seem like much
but when added up the sales from
aftermarket content have actually
created a multi-billion dollar industry
with individual companies like EA
reporting profits reaching 921 million
in the last year alone outstripping all
other digital revenue assets including
doubling their numbers for full game
downloads wow so many DLC transactions
for things like the aforementioned stat
boosts or in-game accessories are
usually cheap and don't necessarily
expand to gamers overall experience as
much as provide them with an in-game
virtual value so they've lovingly come
to be known as micro transactions by the
gaming community but while many bulk at
their mere mention they can provide
gamers with several potential benefits
for instance some games allow players to
circumvent the hours or even weeks
sometimes needed to hit certain
benchmarks and level up characters so
they may unlock stables of munitions
vehicles etc by paying a nominal fee to
obtain temporary experience boosts or on
lock upgraded gear allowing somewhat
more casual gamers to have at least
something resembling a chance against
even the most hyper elite and time
thrifty of their frenemies there are
also many decent free-to-play games and
apps which depends solely on income from
micro transactions to support or expand
their titles usually by offering players
level advantages in the form of
exclusive items extra turns or even just
exchanging real cash for good
old-fashioned in-game tokens that the
player can spend to their liking but
that is not to imply that detractors
don't have anything worth getting upset
about as there are lots of valid
concerns regarding the current trends in
DLC and microtransactions like those who
believe that downloadable content is
simply a way to piecemeal out what
should have been a single complete
experience or that micro transactions
are really meant to trick players into
doling out more moolah than a title is
actually worth or or that paying to get
ahead should just be considered another
form of cheating I mean is it really any
different than buying a Diablo 1 trainer
but arguing over the merits of DLC and
microtransactions is kind of a moot
point now I mean if candy crush saga is
still making nearly a million dollars a
day then the micro transaction model
will probably be with us for some time
so what can we do about our situation
now spend wisely in the end I think most
of us would agree that the most
important thing is to receive a decent
value whether we pay upfront or
incrementally over time and be able to
rest comfortably knowing that we weren't
ripped off as long as we can still
dominate all of our friends and family
of course so be cognizant of the amount
that you're spending on a game and when
it feels like too much the only thing I
can say is beyond not pre-ordering games
don't buy the DLC if it's not worth it
speaking of buying things that are worth
it fresh books actually it's a free
trial so you can try that out in the
link in the video description but
basically it's an online tool for small
businesses that makes invoicing getting
paid and tracking your hours and
expenses
easier all the little details about cash
flow are in one place and it shows a
full history of each invoice allowing
you to check if your client has viewed
the invoice and even accept payment
through the fresh book system so there's
no excuses you can update the fresh
books timesheet from your phone from
anywhere and they just launched their
deposits feature which will allow you to
create a new invoice and request a
deposit for it at the bottom of that
invoice which is great for like if you
do major projects like house painting
for example yeah baby you just enter the
percentage of your invoice you'd like
paid up front and bippity Boppity done
once the deposits paid the status
changes to deposit paid and the client
will be able to begin making payments
against the remaining invoice balance
cool freaking stuff so head over to
