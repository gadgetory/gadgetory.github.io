your electronics is a lot like cooking a
waffle just the right amount of heat
will give you a delicious breakfast item
you can code in maple syrup but too much
and you'll end up with a charred pile of
crap so similarly the sensitive
equipment inside your PC home theater
gaming console or whatever else needs a
certain amount of electricity to run
properly and too much will cause
malfunctions or even destroy it and
tirely so the power that comes out of
your outlet on your wall is actually
susceptible to voltage surges so that is
why many people use surge protectors to
keep their stuff safe from nasty
electrical mishaps so then how do these
work and what can they actually protect
against it might be helpful to first
understand what a surge protector isn't
it is not the same as a regular power
strip which provides no form of surge
protection or a suppression or anything
like that it is not the same as an
uninterruptible power supply or UPS
which provides emergency backup power
during an outage and it is not the same
as a power conditioner which can clean
up mild interference that causes
electrical noise if the power running to
your home isn't the best instead a surge
protector does exactly what it says it
protects against voltage surges which
happen whenever there's an unintended
change in electrical charge somewhere on
the circuit that's going to your power
outlet because voltage is basically just
a difference in charge that allows
current to flow so too much voltage can
cause too much current which can fry
your electronics
although surges are often associated
with lightning strikes the most frequent
culprit is actually power-hungry
appliances though things like bad wiring
and problems with the power grid itself
can also cause surges so then how does a
surge protector help whenever it detects
a surge it actually shunts the extra
electricity through a semiconducting
material to a grounding wire which
connects to that third prong on your
plug this will send excess
voltage back to the return line in the
building's wiring which might trip a
circuit breaker but won't damage
whatever is plugged into the surge
protector but before you rush out to buy
one remember that all surge protectors
have limitations most importantly they
don't last forever
every surge protector is rated for a
certain number of joules a measurement
of energy that it can absorb and once a
certain number of joules hit your surge
protector it won't offer any more
protection and hardly anything will save
you from a really strong power surge
such as from a nearby lightning strike
well gee Linus okay then how do I even
know what to look for there are so many
kinds that try to lure me in with fancy
packaging and promises that they'll
protect me from the hammer of Thor or
whatever well first off Thor's hammer is
actually a physical object and not
really anything to do with electricity
and second of all make sure you get one
that is certified by underwriters
laboratories or you will a consulting
company that tests electronics equipment
there are a lot of cheapo options out
there that haven't been independently
tested and may not actually protect
anything also pay attention to the
clamping voltage which is what the surge
protector will reduce the voltage to
although the power that comes out of a
North American outlet is a hundred and
twenty volts most electronics can
actually deal with small surges on their
own so anything with a clamping voltage
below 400 volts is probably fine and as
I mentioned earlier you'll also want a
protector that's rated for a high number
of joules so it will last longer and
protect against larger surges 600 is a
good place to start but there are plenty
of units that offer much more protection
then finally many manufacturers will
replace fried equipment up to a certain
dollar amount so make sure you read the
fine print carefully so that you don't
end up losing you know half a million
bucks of stuff that you had plugged into
your surge protector and have to haul
all that stuff to the scrapyard but that
kind of thing can be good to watch out
for as well and you know what else is
good to watch out for videos on
