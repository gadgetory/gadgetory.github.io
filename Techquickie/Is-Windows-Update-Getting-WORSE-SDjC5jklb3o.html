really so important that they should
interrupt you in the middle of an
all-night study session or a hot webcam
date at what point does mr. Gates just
show up at your doorbell and go hey have
you updated your windows yet well
whether we like it or not that's
basically been Microsoft's approach for
a very long time in fact it was way back
during the windows 98 era that Microsoft
first introduced the concept of
notifications whenever a critical update
was available by having the operating
system check which updates were already
installed against a list of new updates
stored on a Microsoft server every few
minutes and what a useful new feature to
ensure that you know grandma isn't going
to be victimized by the latest ActiveX
vulnerability the problem is that as the
years went on more and more control was
taken out of the hands of the user once
Windows XP hit the scene update
notifications became a much more
frequent especially that system reboot
prompt after you reinstalled the update
that would bother you literally every 10
minutes to restart not to mention that
the automatic update service was a
massive resource hog for some reason and
often ground slower computers to a
standstill so Microsoft did relax this
hit you over the head
Negi behavior in subsequent versions of
Windows and they fix some of the
performance issues but it's still quite
difficult to exercise full control over
Windows Update a huge source of
frustration especially if you have a
slower PC or one that you only use
occasionally so that basically every
time you sit down at it it needs to
perform a bloody update
I mean imagine this what if I just don't
want to be interrupted right now because
I'm doing something well in Windows 7 &amp;amp;
8 you can delay an automatic reboot but
only for four hours and three days
respectively and then in Windows 10 you
actually can't decline updates of any
sort now
even patches that are considered
non-critical now if you're running a
business version of Windows 10 you are
allowed to delay your updates there's
just no such luxury for the average Joe
virgine running Windows on his or her
home computer so why has Microsoft
insisted on making the process so
overbearing I mean do they think that
we're all a bunch of idiots that can't
maintain our pcs on our own you know
what let's not get into that moving on
then one of the most obvious reasons
that updates are continually pushed out
is to improve security although many
folks wonder why Microsoft can't just
make a secure piece of software in the
first place and at times this has been a
valid criticism the fact of the matter
is that with an operating system as
large and complex as Windows there are
many points of failure that the
developers might not even know about
that can get discovered by hackers later
on I mean you think about how a
commercial airplane has lots of
redundant safety systems because there
are so many critical parts that could
potentially have an issue that develops
down the road even if the aircraft was
initially well designed so it's kind of
like that and in fact Microsoft even
offers cash bounties for folks that are
skilled enough to find and report
security holes in Windows before the
hackers do so that they can push out a
fix the fact that this is one of the
very rare examples where Microsoft
actually pays their users and not the
other way around shows what a big deal
patching security bugs is to Microsoft
but even so this doesn't quite explain
why all of the updates rather than just
the security fixes are treated as
mandatory in Windows 10 well here's
where we get into the big mentality
shift it's a business decision
Microsoft treats Windows as a service
now meaning that with rising internet
speeds and reliance on cloud computing
the company wants to ensure their place
as the dominant platform by delivering
significant upgrades in order to keep up
with advancing technology and consumers
who frequently buy new devices so you
combine that with the fact that users
have gotten used to their mobile devices
following this similar paradigm of free
updates and Microsoft even went as far
to describe Windows 10 as the last
version of Windows in that it'll just be
continually updated rather than replaced
by another version that you'll have to
pay to upgrade to down the line so to
ensure that users aren't getting left
behind with this new business model plus
their desire to make writing software
easier for developers than it used to be
back when Windows versions were much
more fragmented Microsoft has gone the
route of making Windows 10 updates
mandatory across the board so like I get
it it's just that this can be a huge
problem when Microsoft forces users to
install buggy updates like that one that
deleted a bunch of people's data for
better or for worse though it looks like
this automatic mandatory version of
Windows Update is here to stay that is
unless of course you switch to Linux
speaking of switching have you thought
about switching your accounting solution
FreshBooks is the super simple to use
invoicing tool that actually does a lot
more than just help you create and send
slick-looking invoices it helps you
track your time with their timesheet
function manage your expenses and keep
track of who owes you what it also has a
feature that tells you when your client
looks at your invoice for the first time
and their mobile apps have all the
functionality of the desktop version so
you can take freshbooks with you
wherever you go if you have any
questions feel free to reach out to
their support staff where you will speak
to a real human being
no phone tree no escalations just
answers and I mean I guess that's all
there is to say try it out it costs
absolutely nothing go to FreshBooks tile

wiki and the how did you hear about a
section when you sign up for that free
