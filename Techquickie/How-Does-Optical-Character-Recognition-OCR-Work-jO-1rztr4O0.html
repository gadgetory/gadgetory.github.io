on your computer screen and put them on
a physical sheet of paper just click
print and unless you've forgotten to
fork out an extortion level amount of
money for a new cartridge you'll have
fresh warm satisfying documents just a
few moments later but going in the
opposite direction
scanning dead tree information into your
PC is actually quite a bit trickier I
mean sure flatbed scanners aren't all
that difficult to operate per se but
many of them are basically just taking a
picture of the document and saving it on
to your PC meaning not only will it
probably not look very crisp but due to
file compression and little bits of dust
in your scanner but you can't edit a
clean copy of your document in your
favorite word processor because the
scanner won't recognize each individual
character fortunately there are a number
of devices out there that enable optical
character recognition or OCR where each
character on a page is scanned
individually so your papers are uploaded
as actual text documents instead of
messy JPEGs but how exactly does that
work and is one kind of optical scanner
better than another well because the
whole concept of translating text into
electronic signal is pretty broad there
have been lots of different
implementations of OCR over the years in
fact one of the earliest electric OCR
devices the opto phone was invented all
the way back in 1914 this
bizarre-looking contraption relied on
the special behavior of selenium which
conducts electricity differently in
light and darkness as it scanned the
words on a page the opto phone
distinguished between the dark ink of
text and lighter blank spaces generating
tones that correspond to different
letters making it possible for blind
people to read with some practice later
in 1931 a machine was developed that
could convert printed text to Telegraph
code one of the first technologies to
translate printed characters to
electrical impulses rather than sounds
but it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s
that OCR began to take a more familiar
modern form with postal services using
OCR to read addresses and software that
could recognize many different fonts so
back to present day when you scan a
document how exactly does the software
know what it's looking at well the first
step is to cut out artifacts so your OCR
program can concentrate on the text and
nothing else so it attempts to remove
dust and other various graphics align
the text properly and convert any colors
or shades of gray in the image to black
and white only making the words
themselves easier to recognize the next
step is to figure out which characters
are on the page simpler forms of OCR
compare each scanned letter pixel by
pixel to a known database of fonts and
decide on the closest match smarter OCR
however takes this step farther by
breaking down each character down to
constituent elements like curves and
corners and looking for matching
physical features and actual letters you
can think of the differences between
these two approaches similarly to the
difference between raster and vector
images which you can learn more about up
here OCR software can also make use of a
dictionary so it won't accidentally spit
out nonsense words due to inaccurate
scanning for example if your scanner
sees this but it can't quite tell
whether the middle letter is an O or an
A it can check its own dictionary to
decide that the word is actually dog and
not gag giving OCR software situational
information can further cut down on
errors such as telling it to only try to
match numbers if it's reading zip codes
on an envelope even with these tricks
however OCR obviously is not perfect
which you've probably seen for yourself
if you've ever used it but with greater
processing power and machine learning
techniques that allow software to
recognize more subtle patterns over time
OCR has become versatile enough to
recognize harder to read typefaces in
consistently printed material and even
handwriting and free OCR cloud
processing services like Google Drive
which has a lot more machine learning
capability than your home PC for which I
hope our fairly obvious reasons
have made OCR more accessible than
her no word yet though on whether Google
will take it a step further and launch
