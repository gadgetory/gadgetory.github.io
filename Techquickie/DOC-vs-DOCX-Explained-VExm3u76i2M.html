notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so do you
know those little three or four letter
suffixes at the end of file names after
the dot
they're called file extensions and
they'll let you and other programs know
what kind of file you're dealing with
whether it's a movie a song or a love
letter and for a very long time
whenever you saved a Microsoft Word
document you see that the program would
slap a dot docx extension onto it which
made a lot of sense right doc for
document but recently you may have
noticed that your files now have a dot X
extension so YX is a four extreme to
make words sound more exciting than the
mere word processor or as Microsoft just
trying to tell you that if you need a
nice-looking document docx
going to give it to you well in a way
the answer to that second question is
actually yes
you see the old doc standard was a
proprietary format me that it was
designed only to be read properly by ms
word doc offered many more features to
the plain text documents that could be
read by virtually any PC such as the
ability to embed comments insert images
and use footnotes just to name a few but
this also meant that these features had
to be encoded in a way that could be
read by your word processor and because
Microsoft didn't open the standard so
that non microsoft programs could read
them with 100% accuracy they often don't
look quite right if you try to open them
in for example LibreOffice writer Google
Docs or apples pages and depending on
what ms word feature the original file
utilized they sometimes ended up looking
like a complete mess in fact support for
the doc format was even pulls from
WordPad the free word processor bundled
with Microsoft's own Windows operating
system partly because it had a hard time
rendering these files properly doc X on
the other hand is an open standard
meaning that it's available for other
programs to fully implement so if you
start working on the report in Word and
later want to collaborate on it in real
time in Google Docs your browser-based
copies should play nicely with the
original file so the X in docx actually
stands for X
ml a markup language that's
superficially similar to HTML the code
that defines how a web page is supposed
to look on your screen now since XML is
also an open standard that's much more
streamlined to the old docx format and
not only provides the benefit of greater
compatibility but it's simpler structure
makes it a more difficult target from
malware less susceptible to file errors
and easier for your computer to process
meaning improved loading times and
better responsiveness if you're trying
to work with a complicated document so
it was all of these advantages along
with some gentle nudging from government
regulators who were concerned about
their market power which led Microsoft
which by the way is a company that's
notorious for his preference for closed
standards to make the switch to docx
starting with office 2007 making our
home in office pcs more compatible than
ever before
though some industry players still saw
this move as Microsoft inappropriately
trying to influence open standards
bodies man portal Microsoft just can't
catch a break Andy well however you feel
about the company the docx format proves
useful and is now a mainstay on modern
versions of word with the features we
mentioned also extending to the format's
now used by other office programs such
as Excel and PowerPoint complete with
the X at the end of the file name to let
you know that you're using the new
standards collectively call it office
open XML just don't count on that making
your all-nighters more exciting because
you put off a term paper for three
