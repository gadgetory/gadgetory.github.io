might seem like a fairly straightforward
operation lots and lots of flashing
lights and candy crush sound effects you
stick a couple bucks into a slot machine
you hope it spits out thousands of
dollars or you throw down some chips on
the craps table and pray that the dice
stay hot simple right
no as it turns out the level of
Technology you interact with inside a
gaming establishment is among the most
sophisticated anywhere and it probably
shouldn't be that surprising given how
much money is constantly churning
through a casino basically the moment
you set foot inside it goes to work you
see many casinos keep databases on
specific people card counters people who
have been caught stealing or maybe even
just that guy yes you Kevin who had too
many free cocktails and decided to use
the potted plant in the corner as a
urinal and they achieved this by using
biometric scanning to capture an image
of your face when you walk in the door
to compare you against the database of
undesirables but let's say you've never
tried to pull off an ocean's 11 style
heist so security leaves you alone and
you make your way over to a slot machine
well it used to be that you would pull
down the arms cross your fingers and
hope that when the mechanical reels
stopped spinning a bunch of fruit or
something would line up but these days
the attention-grabbing graphics are just
for show slot machines determine if
you've won or lost almost immediately
after you press spin using a
pseudo-random number generator that
Awards prizes based on pre-programmed
pay tables that are spitting out numbers
at a rate of hundreds per second by
design the occassionally award big
jackpot that allow the casino to entice
others in with dreams of striking it
rich
while also preventing frequent gamblers
from being able to figure out when a
machine is hot to keep payouts tight
this is critical because over two-thirds
of the average casinos revenue comes
from slot machines so being a savvy
gambler then you give up on the slots
and go set some money down on the
blackjack table instead where the dealer
hands you a stack of chips now these
might seem like mere pieces of plastic
but the chips actually contain more
chips RFID chips that is they contain
serial numbers that are skinned both at
the tables as well as when you take them
to the cashier this prevents people from
trying to cash counterfeit chips and
also protect the casino in cases where
authentic ones get stolen one miscreant
lifted 1.5 million dollars in chips from
the Bellagio in Las Vegas back in 2010
so the casino simply invalidated their
RFID tags so the dude ended up going to
prison for stealing what were
essentially a bunch of worthless chucky
cheese tokens I almost feel bad for him
and for yet another layer of security
chips can also contain special UV inlays
that only show up under a black light
similar to features found in modern
currency which you can learn more about
here and chips aren't the only little
handheld items at casinos with bacon
protection the playing cards can have
barcodes printed on them with invisible
ink
these are scanned when the dealer clears
them off the table so the odds are that
if you're trying to use sleight of hand
to switch cards you're going to end up
with a date with big Tim but you're an
honest player and besides surely you
wouldn't think of trying to cheat with
all of those cameras on the ceiling
anyway and that would probably be wise
although some of them are just regular
surveillance cameras others are actually
can
two systems that can recognize which
cards are dealt bedding patterns and
even wins and losses for each player at
the table
so because long-term trends in casino
games are rather predictable these
cameras can help casinos pick up on the
abnormal patterns that occur when
someone might be counting cards trying
to perform trickery with their chips or
colluding with a dealer or another
player to cheat now of course not all
casino technology is security-related
you know that Players Club card they
give you for free that you've been
inserting into slot machines handing to
dealers and even showing at the cocktail
bar although they track how much you're
spending so they can give you comps and
discounts they also use that data to
build a detailed picture of what your
favorite games are how much you've won
or lost whether you're a skilled player
and even which casino restaurants you're
eating at in order to offer you perks
that will lure you back to the casino
and entice you to keep gambling
especially if their algorithms think
that the casino can suck lots of money
out of you in the future
so if you won big on your last trip to
Vegas be wary of any special offers you
get that are designed to get you to hand
all of that money right back but feel
free to go crazy with that two-for-one
buffet coupon that one's okay
speaking of buffets do you find yourself
with too much on your plate as a small
business owner or freelancer well
