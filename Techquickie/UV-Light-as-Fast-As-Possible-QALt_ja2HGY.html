name of a metal band but most of us know
it primarily as that stuff from the Sun
that makes you look like a lobster if
you spend too much time at the beach but
even though ultraviolet or UV light is
the scourge of vacationers the world
over there are plenty of Awesome things
that it can do as well and I'm not just
talking about tanning beds but what
makes it so useful
well UV light like regular light is a
form of electromagnetic radiation which
moves through space in waves but
ultraviolet waves have a shorter
wavelength and a higher frequency than
visible light hence the name ultraviolet
as UV light has a higher frequency than
violet light which has the shortest
wavelength of any visible color higher
frequencies mean higher energy meaning
UV light has lots of effects that
regular light just well doesn't for
example sunburns happen because UV light
from the Sun has enough energy to damage
the DNA in your skin the subsequent burn
and sensitivity are part of your body's
attempt to repair your DNA and shed
heavily damaged skin cells but if you're
exposed to a lower level of UV light
this will trigger your body to release
more melanin which absorbs UV light
before it can damage your skin this
results in a suntan making UV rays
crucial if your goal in life is to look
like Christiano Ronaldo or Snooki
exposure to small amounts of UV can also
actually have benefits as it causes your
body to make more vitamin D but you've
E's high energies have plenty of
applications even if you don't spend all
of your time outside artificial UV light
bulbs use the same DNA damage effect to
kill bacteria meaning you can find them
everywhere from water treatment plants
to bathrooms where people keep their
toothbrushes under a UV lamp and
speaking of gross stuff under a UV lamp
UV tech is also used in black lights
that are user reveal stains molecules
that make up proteins can absorb UV
light allowing them to contrast with the
background enabling you to see things
like blood
stains pet urine stains and other
questionable fluids in fact some
companies even make travel sized UV
lamps so you can you know see whether
housekeeping at your hotel has missed
anything higher powered UV bulbs are
used by police even when investigating
crime scenes for the same reason and
because UV is indeed a form of light
some kinds of animals can see it even
though we unfortunately can't including
insects like house flies which are drawn
to UV light making UV bulbs a popular
feature in bug zappers but if you're
more interested in electronics that are
a little bit more high-tech UV is used
in a process called photolithography
where UV light helps to form patterns on
silicon wafers that CPUs are made from
you can learn more about this in this
video we're also seeing UV light use
more and more in the world of identity
security as things like ID and credit
cards are printed with patterns that
only react under UV light
which are quite difficult to forge or
counterfeit no word yet on whether we'll
see UV authentication on pokemon cards
however tao clean aura clean system
ships with one toothbrush three clean
brush heads a base station and a charger
and the claim that it is the cleanest
toothbrush in the world it has two speed
modes to deliver up to 40,000 strokes
per minute much better than just your
hand and it even removes things like
plaque and delivers a superior clean
that's all bundled with a two-minute
timer for brushing time with interval
alerts for when to change brushing zones
the station also contains a UVC light
that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and
keeping the brush handle on the base
station ensures that it's protected
while also drying the breast charging it
and while cleaning it the stylistic
design and choice of two colors either
black or white mean that it can go along
with your elegantly designed bathroom if
