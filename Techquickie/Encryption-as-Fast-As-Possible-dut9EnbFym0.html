that little padlock in the corner of our
browser we're trusting it to keep our
data safe and whether it's our credit
card numbers sensitive work documents
are those questionable photos that you
told your friend not to take various
types of encryption standards ensure
that they are kept out of the prying
hands of intruders eat rooters whatever
while they zip around on the Internet
but aside from the reassuring little eye
calling on your computer screen what's
actually going on what is encryption all
right so while today's video focuses on
encryption on the web specifically and
the procedures used for encrypting data
can be massively complex the fundamental
idea behind all encryption is really
quite simple
whenever you transfer encrypted
information your computer turns that
data into an unintelligible mess or
ciphertext that can only be put back
into a readable form by unlocking it
with a key of some sort that tells the
receiving computer how to decode the
incoming message this basic concept has
actually been used to send secret
messages since long before the invention
of computers ciphers are various kinds
have been used for thousands of years
and machines that could encode and
decode messages were in use before the
modern PC ever came along Thomas
Jefferson invented a wheeeeel cipher
that was nothing more than wooden disks
around an axle and then the Germans
famously used a typewriter like device
called the Enigma machine to encrypt
military messages during World War two
although the Allies were able to crack
that code now back to the web era modern
electronics often use a widespread
encryption scheme called public key
encryption suppose you want to send an
email when you click send the receiving
computer will provide your computer with
what's called a public key a public key
is generated by the computer just
randomly choosing a very large number
and running it through some mathematical
functions once your computer receives
this public key it uses the key to lock
the email using a special algorithm then
sends it on its way now since anyone can
request a public key from a computer the
public key can't be used to unlock a
message otherwise anyway
could intercept and read your encrypted
emails that would defeat the purpose
instead the recipients computer unlocks
the message with a private key that is
stored on that system alone making it
mercifully impossible for anyone else to
view the terrible poetry you sent to
your girlfriend that has her rethinking
things public key encryption isn't just
used for email it's actually the basis
of tons of websites that require you to
sign in securely
if you've ever clicked on that little
padlock and saw a mention of SSL or TLS
these are two implementations of public
key encryption that are widely used by
Google Facebook Microsoft and many more
to make sure that only you can access
your data or change your settings now
once the sensitive data actually arrives
at its destination there are a number of
other encryption methods use to make
sure it can sit on the computer or
server safely for example you probably
have a password and credit card numbers
stored without Amazon for example how do
they keep those things safe often web
servers will hash your passwords meaning
that they're converted into encrypted
strings of text through a process that
is extremely difficult to reverse and
can't be unlocked with a key now with
all that said it is important to
remember that no system of encryption is
perfect and experts in the field are
constantly searching for weaknesses in
encryption algorithms and devising new
ones to outsmart hacker so next time
you're G chatting a friend about how
awesome the latest episode of tech wiki
was remember that it was really an epic
digital arms race that allowed you to do
that without everyone knowing exactly
how much of your free time you spend
listening to me doc speaking of whatever
I was talking about Master opcom they
have all kinds of cool stuff on that
their site they got Lake knives they got
like keyboards and key caps they got
like headphones basically if it's a
consumer electronic item that's like hip
and cool and people want to buy it mass
drop works with the manufacturers and
distributors to get the lowest possible
prices depending on how many people want
to buy it so the way it works is the
more people commit to buy the more
people get an even lower price on one of
the community curated deal
that's available on the site so all you
going to do is sign up you can start
browsing around and finding cool stuff
really audio products are a really big
one but they have all kinds of different
stuff and often only available for a
limited time although sometimes
particularly popular deals come back
like for example they have the antlion
mod mic back right now we've actually
done a review of that over on my other
channel Linus tech tips and I think the
longer I keep doing this the more likely
it is that let's go for a double O the
more likely it is that I'm going to cut
myself with this so mass drop does not
in any way condone the unsafe use of
knives but they definitely do sell them
to even me so is that unsafe I don't
know you can find out by clicking on the
link of the video description thanks for
watching guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you thought it
sucked leave a comment if your feelings
are more complicated than either those
things if you have suggestions for
future facets pop full episodes just
like this one and as always don't forget
