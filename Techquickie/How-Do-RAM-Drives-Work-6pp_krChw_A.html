hundred megabytes per second solid-state
drives or SSDs are fantastic and it
brought us super quick storage
performance with lower power consumption
and without the fragile moving parts of
mechanical hard drives but what if you
want to go even faster well the absolute
fastest storage solution you can have in
a desktop ring anyway is a ram drive
which is just what it sounds like
setting aside a certain amount of RAM to
use as well a really really fast drive
so why is RAM good for this then you see
part of the reason we use Ram as the
working memory for whatever the computer
is doing at a given time instead of
using a hard drive or even a regular SSD
for that is because Ram is extremely
fast this allows the computer to read
and write the data that it needs to act
upon without having to wait around and
this paradigm has existed since long
before long-term solid-state storage
became mainstream in fact the first Ram
Drive software came about all the way
back in 1980 so just how fast are we
talking about then well depending on
your configuration you can get
sequential read and write speeds in the
neighborhood of seven to ten gigabytes
per second or more that's like
downloading an entire dual layer blu-ray
in five seconds and even if you're not
working with massive sequential files
like you'd see with audio editing or
video and image rendering you can still
get a big performance boost with
programs that access small amounts of
data very frequently I mean think about
your web browsers cache for example
because Ram drives have very low latency
or access delay with very high ions the
number of operations per second so how
then do you set this up well there are a
number of applications that you can find
with a quick and easy Google search that
will convert free memory into a ram
drive for you just tell it how big of a
round ride
you'd like to make assign a drive letter
and you are pretty much good to go after
that Windows will recognize your RAM
Drive just like it would any other
storage device connected to your system
so you'll be free to copy files and
install programs to it as you normally
would
but even though system memory is much
cheaper these days there are other costs
associated with storing anything
resembling important data on a ram drive
anyone who's ever suffered a power
outage while they were doing something
important on their PC has probably
learned the hard way that Ram is what is
called volatile that means that its
contents disappear when you power off
your system so some Ram Drive utilities
will backup the contents of your Ram
disk to a hard drive or SSD for you
periodically but this will still mean
long delays on shutdown while it purges
and on boot while the RAM Drive fills so
sorry if you were hoping to store your
operating system on a ram disk this
pretty much kibosh is that unless you're
like a computer magician or you buy a
super expensive hardware based Ram disk
solution with like battery backup which
is very rare outside of an enterprise
setting and because of platform
not to mention cost limitations Ram
disks aren't great for storing tons of
stuff either the most standard
unbuffered memory that can fit on even
the highest end consumer motherboards
these days is a hundred and twenty eight
gigabytes and since your operating
system and other applications will need
some of that space as well the largest
Ram disk you can comfortably make will
be a little bit less than that but don't
let any of that discourage you if you've
got some excess RAM sitting around and
you'd like to see just how blisteringly
fast you can make your storage
experience this is a fun little science
fair project and free there are free
ones and can possibly even be useful for
frequently used programs or applications
that are otherwise bottlenecked by drive
speed especially as you can increase
read and write speeds even further by
overclocking your CPU and RAM or by
tightening up your memory timings
however if you're putting anything
resembling crucial data on a ram drive
even savegames okay anything that's
going to waste your time
invest in a ups for your rig as well
because I'm sure you don't want to have
your world record speed run your taxes
or your weird political manifesto wiped
out because your cat decided to chew on
your power cord
speaking of chewing here's something to
chew on with a lynda.com membership you
can watch and learn from top experts who
are passionate about teaching so whether
you're sitting there going
gee I'd really like to move up in my
career or gee I love taking pictures of
things as a hobby but what if I could do
it in a way that other people might
actually enjoy watching those slideshows
that I'm constantly putting in front of
them well Linda is the way to go for
that they've got thousands of video
courses that you can stream or watch
vod's if you download them to your
compatible iOS or Android device and it
lets you learn on your own schedule at
your own pace you can browse the course
transcripts to follow along or you can
actually click to a spot in the course
transcript and it'll move to that point
in the video so you can review any
associated diagrams or visuals and you
can take notes as you go and refer back
to them later and if you don't want to
do that alone you can create and save
playlists of the courses you're
interested in so you can have a study
buddy as you go along with whatever your
education goals are so check it out at
the link in the video description
your lynda.com membership will give you
unlimited access to training on hundreds
of topics at a flat rate starting at
just 25 bucks a month and with that link
below you can get the first 10 days for
