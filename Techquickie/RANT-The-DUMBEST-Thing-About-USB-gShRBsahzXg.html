when groups of seemingly very smart
people in positions of power in the tech
world build this really cool technology
then when it's finally time to bring it
to market come up with naming schemes
for it that make no sense the worst and
yes that's right I am looking at you USB
forum and for you guys specifically what
really confuses me is that you went over
to the dark side after a long history of
making things actually pretty simple and
straightforward so we started out with
USB one then we got 1.1 which was a
minor revision to one cool then we got
USB 2.0 which was much faster then we
got USB 3.0 which was much faster again
so then it wasn't until around 2013 that
things started getting a little weird
you see the original USB 3.0 spec had a
max theoretical speed of five gigabits
per second so you would think that the
next revision which doubled that speed
to ten gigabit would be USB 4.0 right
wrong instead what we got was USB 3.1
but honestly it was even okay with that
I mean one is clearly a larger number
than zero and I guess it wasn't a
fundamental redesign of the spec or
anything no no the issue is that at the
same time they also renamed the original
USB 3.0 spec as USB 3.1 gen2 new ten
gigabit spec USB 3.1 gen2 I mean how do
you just rename something after the fact
dear are you shampoo do you think that
makes it seem new and cool now now
improved but it's the old one but you're
also releasing a new one that is
improved why and in fairness yeah it's
been done before but still then making
matters worse we've just gotten a
they're doubling in speed to 20 gigabits
per second why am i mad how the extra
speeds a good thing right the reason is
that the USB forum has given us an even
worse nonsensical naming twist so bear
with me here
the original USB 3.0 five gigabit spec
is now USB 3.2 gen one with the 10
gigabit version becoming USB 3.2 gen -
which okay so by this moon logic then
the 20 gigabit variation would be USB
3.2 Gen 3 right no because the USB 3.2
spec just involves adding more lanes to
the connection so the 20 gigabit version
is USB 3.2 Gen 2 by 2 with the by 2
indicating that there are two data lanes
instead of just one the US beef so the
USB forum whose marketing department
clearly isn't much better at naming
things than the engineers has then gone
and recommended the names super speed
super speed USB 10 gigabit per second
and super speed USB 20 gigabit per
second to differentiate the products on
store shelves now to be fair to the USB
forum the method behind their madness
seems to be to have the naming scheme
reflect how many lanes can be used in
each revision and I do get that when
they transitioned from USB 2.0 to 3.0
part of the rationale for a big number
change was that there were physical
differences with the connectors which is
not the case for the various USB 3
revisions the problem though is that
Jenn is generation it means time you
can't just rename a generation a later
generation that's not how it works my my
great-grandpa doesn't become my dad
later furthermore USB 3.0 was backwards
compatible with USB 2
we know connectors anyway and more
importantly app than all of this is that
consumers don't care about things like
the configuration of data lanes and
exactly how the pins and the traces on
their motherboard are laid out they just
want to know if the gadget they're
buying is gonna work with their gear and
how fast it's going to be I mean PCI
Express has this sort of thing figured
out now to be clear there are some very
complicated sub elements of the PCIe
specification like like hot plug support
that are optional on certain revisions
and then required on others etc etc etc
but from a consumer standpoint when
there's a speed boost the version number
goes up by one and that's basically it
and even though the various revisions of
PCI Express are all backwards and
forwards compatible with each other the
folks in charge haven't felt the need to
mess around with silly rebranding to
make the point that it all works
together it's all called PCI Express
it's all called USB Tata but alas this
is the system we have so if you're going
to be in the market for a USB gadget
anytime soon I would recommend paying
really close attention to this chart
that we created for your convenience or
better yet print it out and keep a copy
in your wallet like I do so that you two
can be the life of the party
whenever the subject changes to
something lame like this all right so
that's it if you'll excuse me now I need
to go have a word with Intel about how
they decide on names for their
processors as well be right back and the
back ah no matter what your routine is
