seems like somehow when you most need it
it's not available or maybe the problem
is that you just often find yourself
needing to use your laptop out in the
middle of nowhere fortunately most
smartphones and cellular enabled tablets
these days support tethering and no I'm
not talking about that dorky holster
that came with your phone case tethering
is the act of routing your phone or
tablet's cellular data connection to
another device such as a laptop
tethering can be accomplished via a USB
cable or even wirelessly which
effectively turns your phone into a
personal Wi-Fi hotspot so then how do
you make this happen well assuming
you've got a strong cellular signal you
can enable tethering on iOS simply by
going into the Settings app and enabling
the personal hotspot option on Android
you'll go to the wireless and network
settings tap more and find tethering and
portable hotspot if your tethering with
USB you might need to connect your cable
before some of the relevant options will
become available but if you're using
Wi-Fi a bit of additional setup is still
required just like a home router you'll
need to enter a name or SSID for your
hotspot so your computer will know what
the heck to connect to and optionally a
password though I would definitely
recommend doing this and securing your
connection preferably with wpa2 security
if you don't anyone in range can use
your hotspot so they could run up your
data bill or even potentially see what
it is that you're doing you can also
tether via bluetooth but due to its low
maximum speed I'd recommend against it
unless you have no other choice for some
reason once you've followed these steps
and connected to your hotspot on your
second device via the usual process
you're pretty much good to go
but tethering does come with a few
caveats the most obvious being that
you're going to be limited by house
asked your cellular network is and
although LTE connections that can get to
100 megabits per second or more are
becoming commonplace these days your
real speed might top out far below what
you're used to at home if you aren't
getting an optimal signal you also might
be fighting data limits imposed by your
mobile provider even carriers that
promise unlimited everything sometimes
have a separate cap for tethering and or
they severely throttle your speed once
you use a certain amount of data often
much lower than what your home is P
allows and this assumes that your
cellular plan even allows tethering at
all if you bought your phone directly
from a carrier they may have hidden away
the tethering options or even gone as
far as to disable them outright
unless you pay a monthly fee so be sure
to check the fine print whenever you
sign up for a mobile plan although some
resourceful users have found ways around
carrier restrictions by jailbreaking or
reading their phones which you can learn
more about up here or even installing
special apps that hide exactly how much
data is being consumed from tethering
from their providers this particular
practice caught the ire of t-mobile back
in 2015 when some users were found to be
consuming as much as 2 terabytes of data
per month but even if you do have a cell
plan that doesn't place onerous
restrictions on tethering you may want
to pick up a portable battery bank if
you're planning to tether for any
lengthy period of time as pushing all
that data through your phone can drain
it quickly especially if you're doing it
over Wi-Fi which requires even more
power to blast a wireless signal to your
other devices which is really
inconvenient if you're stuck somewhere
like fire festival and your iPhone is
your only conduit to the outside world
speaking of conduits to the outside
world tunnel there VPN lets you tunnel
through up to 20 different countries
allowing
you to browse the internet and use
online services as though you are some
anonymous bloke or bloke it in some
other freaking country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac also a Chrome extension and all you
got to do is just to the country in the
app press like one button and watch as
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so you show up as
if you are in that other country they
also have a top rated privacy policy and
do not log user activity so if you're
looking to keep your internet connection
private you can try out tunnel Bayer VPN
with 500 Meg's of free data and no
credit card required at the link in the
video description then when you upgrade
to unlimited data you can save 10% by
going to tunnel bear comm slash Linus so
thanks for watching guys if you liked
the video well you can do that if you
disliked it well you can do that and if
you want to check out our other channels
we've got links to those if you want to
leave a comment with a video suggestion
you can do that if you want to subscribe
well hey here's a big Internet hug for
you know that was kind of long that
wasn't really a just friends hug was it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
