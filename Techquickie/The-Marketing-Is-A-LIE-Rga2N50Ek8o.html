tact on resort fees from your last vegas
vacation or that photo of the big mac
that looks nothing like the burger
you'll be eating the corporations are
always finding new misleading ways to
market their products and this is no
less true in the tech world especially
when it comes to SSDs so Sabourin
sponsored this video demystifying some
of the SSD marketing that's out there
now don't get me wrong when companies
claim that SSDs are faster than
traditional hard drives
they are definitely right about that the
issue is that typically the numbers on
the spec sheet or the advertisement from
the manufacturer while very impressive
sounding and big in many cases seem to
be designed only to make their drive
sound incredibly fast now in this video
we discussed which specs to pay the most
attention to when shopping for an SSD
for example an SSD will be able to read
or write large sequential files
something like a space hogging video
file more quickly than lots of small
more random bits of data like you would
encounter with frequently used programs
like web browsers meaning that the
random performance specs are more
relevant to the everyday user than the
sequential ones but here's the rub there
isn't any kind of body or industry
association that oversees SSD testing
and while SSDs work very differently
compared to mechanical hard drives and
even compared to each other in many
cases oftentimes the exact same tests
are used on hard drives and SSDs you see
most quick and dirty drive benchmarks
measure how long it takes for a drive to
accomplish some task say transferring a
large file but this kind of work is a
lot more straightforward for a hard
drive because fragmentation aside it can
simply overwrite whatever space on the
platter is marked as free SSDs on the
other hand often need to erase the data
first and
move some existing data before new data
can be written to a specific block you
can learn more about that up here but
basically it adds more time to your SSD
write operations especially if your SSD
is getting full and doesn't have as much
free space to work with and while it
might not be difficult to measure how
long this process takes the issue is
that in the real world people aren't
writing to mostly empty drives which is
what many manufacturers use for their
benchmarks instead as your SSD fills up
from daily use there's more and more
performance overhead due to data
reshuffling which can cause real-world
speeds to drop off dramatically far
below what's listed on the spec sheet
then making matters much worse you have
the fact that the number of random reads
in particular that an SSD can do this is
measured in AI ops is often reported
while the SSD isn't also trying to write
much data and in the real world there
are many scenarios where you would be
doing both reading and writing at the
same time meaning that these read AI ops
that are reported on the sheet can
easily end up inflated throw in the fact
that an increasing number of SSDs employ
complex data management and caching
algorithms to boost drive performance
beyond what should be possible with the
underlying flash memory under certain
conditions and it can be very unclear
exactly what kind of data was used to
get the numbers that you see when you go
to buy a drive on Amazon or Newegg so
then does that mean that SSD
manufacturers are all evil and going out
of their way to lie to you well actually
probably not it's more likely that
because proper SSD benchmarking is way
more difficult and time-consuming than
testing a hard drive manufacturers
simply can't be bothered to develop and
run these complicated benchmarks versus
the quick ones that they do on these
mostly empty drives because it not only
spits out impressive looking numbers
that look great on the spec sheet but it
also saves them time and resources and
the thing is that so far this is only
even bitten a handful of manufacturers
in the but because the truth is that
many people who buy an SSD just want an
easy
boost in speed and responsiveness
compared to their hard drive and they
may not even care about the exact
performance numbers but anyway let's say
you really are concerned about how a
drive stacks up before you buy it well
for the discerning buyer we've linked a
couple of websites down below that do
more comprehensive Drive testing using
methods that closely simulate real-world
workloads and then drawing conclusions
from that so grab those reading glasses
and get crackin it takes a bit more
effort but this knowledge could come in
handy for when you need peak performance
for all that super critical work you do
speaking of peak performance check out
the rocket nvme SSD from our sponsor for
today's video Sabourin it uses an N dot
2 interface so that means it's super
small not taking up pretty much any room
in your computer and it supports PCI
Express 3.0 Gen 4 so it's super fast
whether you're gaming editing videos or
completing projects it also features
advanced wear leveling to ensure that
it'll be snappy and reliable for a long
time to come and you can check it out
today at the link in the video
