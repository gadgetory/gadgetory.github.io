heard the term radar before so many
movies contain a scene where someone
looks over in distress and says captain
the ship's radar is picking up an
unidentified object headed in our
direction while examples including
aircraft pilots may be the most readily
available to some of us the definition
of radar actually allows for pretty well
any device which detects and tracks the
speed size or movement of objects all
radars operate by using a similar
technique of sending pulses of radio
waves to illuminate potential objects
these radar pulses are either dispersed
or reflected back by the objects they
contact which is then detected by a
receiver received data is then
calculated in one of many complex
fashions to determine varying statistics
about the detected object
it wasn't until somewhere around the
1940s during World War two that military
science figured out how to use the
Doppler effect for more accurate
detection you know the Doppler effect
that thing you've heard of in school
anyway before this point in time
multiple radar units were necessary for
calculating an object's speed and travel
direction which was accomplished by
comparing signal return times at
different points over several instances
than coordinating the data to determine
a bogies trajectory but by also
measuring the variances in a returned
signal caused by interaction with the
moving object engineers discovered that
they were able to determine an object's
velocity more quickly precisely and with
smaller individual units that could
employ microwaves instead of radio waves
this eventually led to the Doppler based
weather systems you may have heard about
on the local news another cliche movie
scene you might have encountered is the
one where the guy says sir they're
jamming our radar signal that's not just
Hollywood nonsense though radar jamming
is done by broadcasting another radar
signal on the same frequency which
overwhelms the enemy's detector it's
kind of like trying to see fireflies in
front of a spotlight radar interference
can also happen accidentally when radar
systems on the same frequency are
located too closely together another
common problem with radar functionality
has to do with signal variations or
noise which can result from naturally
existing external conditions like
thermal radiation or from internal
conditions such as a result of the
signal amplification process
radar can also be physically blocked by
things like buildings or hills or
mountains or even the curvature of the
earth which is one reason why planes
will sometimes fly a low to the ground
to avoid radar detection
even though radar technologies and the
problems which plague them are not
exactly the newest kids on the block
that doesn't mean they don't have the
right stuff our abilities to monitor
things in increasingly sophisticated
ways is constantly leading to
improvements we can see in our daily
lives such as better abilities to track
live weather and traffic conditions for
the purposes of safety and
transportation and ground penetrating
radar systems which provide insight into
the structure of geological areas or
objects for purposes like excavation
manufacturing or military information
collection there is no doubt that
advancements in radar technology will
only continue to expand our horizons and
if you're looking to expand the horizons
of your mind then maybe you should look
into ok guess it guess what's gonna be
uh that's right lynda.com lynda.com is a
great source for instructional videos on
a huge range of topics like web
development photography visual design
business and more Plus software training
for programs like Excel WordPress
Photoshop and all these other ones that
I don't have time to mention all their
thousands of courses are taught by
industry experts and the videos come
with transcripts and project files if
you spring for those there are beginner
intermediate and advanced courses so
there's always something new to learn
and at least in the courses that I've
taken everything is covered very
thoroughly leaving no gaps in your
knowledge which is exactly what will
happen if you try to piece this stuff
together on your own oh and they have
iPhone and Android apps as well so if
you're interested in learning new skills
or hobbies or whatever you can go to
lynda.com slash tech wiki and get a free
10-day trial and see for yourself what
they have to offer without any risk to
you you're welcome
so that's it guys thanks for watching
like or dislike this video if you must
share comment subscribe do all that
stuff and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
