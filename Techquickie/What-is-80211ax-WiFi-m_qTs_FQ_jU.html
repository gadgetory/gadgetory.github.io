won't miss any future videos in a recent
episode we complained about confusing
CPU naming schemes but you know what I
think Wi-Fi revision nomenclature may be
even worse I mean seriously they started
out with 802.11 which to the average
person is about as meaningless as a
promise about political campaign finance
reform and then they stuck a bunch of
seemingly random letters on the end like
B G and AC and AC wave too of all things
now the powers that be are giving us
802.11 ax as our next Wi-Fi standard so
either they threw in an X to appeal to
the younger generation Taco Bell style
or there were in between revisions that
never made it into an end-user product
we'll never know what we do know is that
Wireless ax does look like it's going to
bring some exciting improvements to your
Wi-Fi experience starting perhaps
unsurprisingly with speed now if you
look at the spec on paper you might
notice that the maximum theoretical
speed for the previous standard wireless
AC wave 2 is 866 megabits per second for
a single stream and then only 1201 for
wireless a X so it's higher but not a
nearly six-fold increase like when we
went from n to AC but that is actually
okay because as some of you probably
know the theoretical maximum speeds for
Wi-Fi are notoriously inaccurate anyway
and real-world performance can vary
widely depending on range obstacles
other signals in the air and the quality
of your access point and your device so
to address this wireless ax aims to
improve efficiency in a number of ways
to give you consistently higher
real-world speeds than what you'd get
with AC perhaps the biggest change is a
feature called OFDM a Optima well
however you say it what it does is chop
up each wireless Channel
into many smaller partial channels which
allows up to 30 different gadgets to
talk to the access point at once over a
single channel instead of just one even
though these sub channels are smaller
than the main channel the access point
gets more flexibility allowing it to
allocate bandwidth to each device based
on its data needs this should increase
performance over all OFDM a also works
in tandem with multi-user MIMO you can
learn more about this up here but the
gist of it is that multi-user MIMO
allows an access point to address
multiple devices simultaneously instead
of one at a time sequentially and while
multi-user MIMO was introduced for
consumers with last gen wireless AC
wireless a X improves on it not only by
allowing 8 simultaneous streams instead
of just 4 but also by enabling it for
both uploads and downloads so uploading
photos or streaming video from a crowded
area like a trade show or a concert
venue with Wireless ax support should
get a fair bit easier another cool
feature is the addition of color and oh
I don't mean that wireless ax will make
the color on your crappy $200 notebook
screen look better
instead it supports a feature called VSS
color which is an identifier that is
attached to each data chunk or frame to
indicate what wireless network it came
from you see access points typically
wait to transmit if there's already
another frame flying through the air
with BSS color and ap can tell which
frames are coming from other networks
and ignore them as long as they're below
a threshold of weakness to prevent
interference this should help avoid
unnecessary slowdowns and if all these
improvements aren't enough wireless ax
can utilize both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz
bands with tech companies currently
trying to get even more spectrum in the
6 gigahertz range allocated to Wi-Fi and
for your battery-powered devices
it supports yet another new feature
called target wakeup time that allows
gadgets to negotiate how often
and for how long they will need to
transmit or receive data this allows the
Wi-Fi transponder to sleep when
transmission isn't necessary which
should help to preserve precious battery
life once a X devices are available but
when will that be
ah I'm glad you asked well the first
devices will be routers as usual with
earlybird network vendors like a soos
planning mid 2018 launches so since the
new standard is backwards compatible you
could make the upgrade early if you
wanted to
and as for client devices well the word
on the street is that phones and laptops
will probably start hitting the consumer
market sometime in 2019
