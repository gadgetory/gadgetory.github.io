when watching videos online meant
squinting at grainy pixelated clips in a
tiny RealPlayer window
assuming our connection was fast enough
to support streaming video at all but in
2005 a few guys that used to work for
PayPal came up with the idea for YouTube
after they noticed how difficult it was
to do something as simple as share a
popular video of a big news story or
wardrobe malfunction and although
YouTube wasn't the first site that was
dedicated to sharing videos those
actually started popping up in the mid
to late 1990s
thanks to their timing they were among
the first to take advantage of the
increasing popularity of broadband
connections fast enough to even watch
videos easily as well as miniature
cameras on things like cell phones that
allowed people to take videos anywhere
creating a large market for both
watching and uploading videos online
YouTube also converted all videos into
Adobe Flash to ensure that as many
people as possible could use the site
since virtually every web browser at the
time supported the Flash plugin though
today they're migrating towards the less
resource heavy html5 youtubes good
launch timing made it wildly popular so
much so that Google bought the site less
than two and a half years later for over
a billion and a half dollars good thing
too since as at the end of 2014
300 hours of footage are being uploaded
to YouTube per minute fortunately though
you two bags access to Google's hundreds
of thousands of servers to handle all
those terabytes upon terabytes of bad
infomercials reaction videos and
professional unboxings of course Google
wouldn't have shelled out all dat paper
if they didn't think that YouTube had
the potential to be a huge moneymaker
so YouTube rolled out its partner
program in 2007 allowing youtubers like
yours truly to share in the site's ad
revenue by placing banner ads and later
pre-roll ads on their videos and the
gravy train didn't stop there as YouTube
also formed partnerships with major
content distributors like NBC Universal
in 2006
vevo in 2009 to gain even more ad
revenue by featuring highly sought after
videos like music videos and also to
ward off the copyright lawsuits that
plagued the company in its very early
days 2009 was a big year for YouTube
that was the beginning of support for
1080p full-hd video and in 2011 just two
years later to contribute to the trend
of cord-cutting in which people were
finding ways to watch high quality
content without paying for an expensive
cable or satellite subscription they
poured a hundred million dollars into
the funding of startup original content
from existing creators and from other
celebrities YouTube also tweaked its
search algorithm in 2012 placing more
emphasis on watch time instead of raw
view count which not only helped to bury
irrelevant videos with view counts
inflated by BOTS or people watching them
for a few seconds because of an
attractive thumbnail that turned out to
have nothing to do with the actual
content but also allow the trending
content to get to the top of search
results more easily making the site more
of a distribution platform for new
videos rather than just a huge dusty
repository for 10 year old home movies
of people's cats since then the site has
continued encouraging its users to cut
the cord so to speak even further by
live streaming popular events and
launching YouTube read a monthly
subscription service although cheaper
than a cable subscription that will
offer ad free playback access to more
original content although that depends
on the creator's to make it and music
streaming with playback in the
background and while it's relatively
high cost of ten dollars a month has
been roundly criticized it's reflective
of Google's push to get people away from
their TVs
unless of course those TVs are connected
to a chromecast beautiful powerful
