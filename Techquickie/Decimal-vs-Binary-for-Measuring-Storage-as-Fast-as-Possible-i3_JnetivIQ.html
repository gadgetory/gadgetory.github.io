mean you don't drive anywhere in them
the hardest thing about them is you buy
a thousand gigabyte drive put it in your
computer and you got nine hundred and
thirty one gigabytes I mean what were
they shaving in there now I'm sure you
guys have seen this before and the
discrepancy is caused by the fact that
there are actually two different ways of
representing amounts of data decimal or
base ten is the more conventional way of
representing these numbers but with the
advent of modern computing binary or
base two has sprung up now back when
data sizes were much smaller an
approximate equivalence II was drawn
between a decimal kilobyte that is a
thousand bytes and a binary Kibby byte
which is 1,024 bytes sure why not it's
all good well in their defense the
difference was only a couple percent so
it didn't matter this led to many cases
of the incorrect use of prefixes but if
this has been going on for years why are
we suddenly noticing it now
well customers never really cared when
they're 16 megabyte fum drives
showed up as 15 megabytes unchanged you
chalked it up to inefficiencies in the
formatting or rounding errors but check
out this chart right here this shows how
much smaller your drive will be if the
manufacturer is calculating in decimal
and the software is calculating in
binary the difference becomes greater
and greater as capacities continue to
increase to make matters worse your hard
drive is manufactured and reported in
decimal capacities but many operating
systems report the capacity in decimal
but are actually calculating it in
binary and what that means is that that
one terabyte drive that Jerry Linus was
talking about at the beginning actually
is exactly what it says it is it's a
thousand gigabytes but it's being
reported as 931 gigabytes and I think we
can all agree that a thousand gigabytes
does not equal 931 gigabytes so there
have been product return
thanks for that there have even been
lawsuits about this but the reality of
it is there's not much you can do about
it and once you look into it you'll find
there are many discrepancies somewhere
you're getting less than you thought
some like computer memory where you're
actually getting more than you thought
you were this contrasts sharply with
audible.com where you get exactly what
you thought you were going to get in
fact head over to audible.com slash tech
quickie right now you can get yourself a
free audiobook I listen to the one I'm
falling asleep these headphones are
great they actually stay in while I'm
sleeping so it acts as noise
cancellation for me as well and right
now I am trying the first
Twilight book which I can tell you guys
so far is definitely helping me fall
asleep but if you're not into Twilight
don't worry there's thousands of other
options on audible.com and the first one
is free it always is
so head over to audible.com slash tech
wiki right now to check it out and learn
more and as always guys don't forget to
like this video share this video and
subscribe to tech wiki for more fast as
possible episodes just like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
