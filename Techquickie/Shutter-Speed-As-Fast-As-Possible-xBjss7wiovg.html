a moment in time than taking a great
photo but how do you do this when that
moment passes in the blink of an eye and
the photo you took comes out super
blurry or what if you want to capture a
sense of movement in a photo but you
don't want it to look like one giant
smear this is where knowing how to
properly adjust your camera's shutter
speed can be the key to getting your
shots perfect
along with aperture and ISO which we
previously covered here on tech wiki
shutter speed is one of the three key
exposure variables that will affect how
a picture looks shutter speed is simply
a measure of how long the cameras you
guessed it
shutter stays open to let light through
unlike aperture which is a measure of
how wide the shutter opens and ISO which
controls the sensitivity to light the
shutter speed directly affects how long
the camera will physically see whatever
it's pointed at meaning that if you have
two cameras pointing at the same moving
object but with significantly different
shutter speeds the two pictures will
come out looking dramatically different
why is this well if you have your camera
set to a slow shutter speed the shutter
will be open long enough to capture a
fast-moving object traveling from one
place to another and since you're
recording a still image not a video
which is comprised of multiple still
images this will just come out as a blur
a fast shutter speed on the other hand
will open and close so quickly that you
won't see much motion at all just like
it's harder for you to perceive
something as actually moving if you open
and shut your eyes very very quickly so
the result then is a frozen moment
captured in the photo without blurring
now typically shutter speeds are
measured in fractions of a second with
speeds between one sixtieth of a second
and one 250th of a second being common
for everyday photography such as
landscape shots or casual portraits of
your friends but what if you're getting
shots of something like
a basketball game where the players are
running up and down the court or you're
doing nature photography and need to
capture a fast-moving bird or wild cat
this is where much quicker shutter
speeds come in handy to prevent blurring
and higher end cameras can have shutter
speeds as quick as one four thousandth
or one eight thousandth of a second and
some highly specialized cameras can even
handle one sixteen thousand of a setting
that can capture really cool shots like
a bullet as it travels through the air
well hold on a second then our fast
shutter times always the best thing then
while all those slow shutter speeds can
produce undesirable blur in some
situations in others they can produce
really cool effects that you just can't
get any other way have you ever seen
those shots of cities at night where
highway traffic just looks like long red
and white streets those were produced by
using long shutter speeds of two seconds
or even longer because while things like
buildings and street signs will stay in
one place the cars are obviously moving
meaning that you can get those cool
light streaks without making the city
around them look blurry slow shutter
speeds are also useful for making
waterfalls look like they're moving
without affecting the rest of the photo
and even showing the movement of stars
across the night sky where a shutter
might be open for hours at a time just
make sure you're using a really stable
tripod or something else to keep your
camera in one place
so that final shot looks crisp and sharp
another thing to keep in mind is that
shutter speed affects the amount of
light hitting your image sensor so make
sure that you're adjusting your ISO and
your aperture to compensate if you're
going to be experimenting with really
fast or really slow shutter speeds but
once you master shutter speed you'll be
able to do some extremely cool things
with your camera if you're in the right
place at the right time you might even
get some sick shots of Tarin pulling off
stunts on his razor scooter and somewhat
ironically this is a video about still
photography today's episode
sponsor is videoblocks whose unlimited
library remains the best deal in stock
footage you can get unlimited downloads
from a library of over 10 million
dollars worth of footage we're talking
After Effects templates motion
backgrounds all kinds of great stuff and
they are now adding new footage to the
unlimited library twice a month and
subscribers get free access to the new
footage at no additional cost
as always it's 100% royalty free and
yours to use forever in personal or
commercial projects videoblocks has also
now launched a marketplace where
contributors get 100 percent commission
and the customers save so they don't
take a cut and pass the savings directly
on to the customers which is an average
of 40% on HD and 4k downloads versus
competition like Shutterstock and pond5
so the unlimited library and the
marketplace makes it your one stop shop
for footage and you can get unlimited
access to the unlimited library with
your membership awesome with just 2
downloads the $99 annual subscription
pays for itself and if you have more
specific footage knees buying directly
from the global contributor community
makes a ton of sense so all you've got
to do is head over to our video blocks
