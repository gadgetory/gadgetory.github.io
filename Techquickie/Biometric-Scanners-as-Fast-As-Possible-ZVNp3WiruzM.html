scanners it's hard for me to not
instantly start conjuring up images of a
secret agent breaking into a fortified
facility by like some dudes I am
gonna skull and using it to bypass the
seventh door or something but the fact
of the matter is that both the
definition and application of this
technology tend to fall more into the
everyday use category biometrics is
defined roughly as the analysis of
biological data using statistical
methods also including the use of
digital scanners which utilize
physiological traits as a way of
personal identification while that may
sound like a really technical boring
definition the most commonplace one runs
into such futuristic concepts and
hardware is something very technical and
boring a hospital in fact thanks in
large part to the original Star Trek
series which spurred their invention
heads-up biometric displays have been in
operation at hospitals for decades now
their nurses and doctors work to analyze
changing factors such as your heart rate
blood pressure and fluid levels to
determine whether you've come down with
the Ebola or you're just faking it to
get away from your obnoxious boss
biometric security scanners on the other
hand work by analyzing physiological
characteristics that are unlikely to
change over time such as fingerprints
retinas or voice patterns voice patterns
patterns to verify the identity of an
individual for businesses and
governmental agencies the use of these
devices is becoming more and more common
with each passing day with important
facilities from private engineering
firms to airports and military bases
starting to implement them in ways that
not only help to ensure secured access
but also help to monitor and verify that
important documents such as shipping
manifest dozer
top-secret weapons plans have been
handled and delivered accordingly
changing gears to the personal side of
the spectrum offerings have just started
emerging that are putting this
technology to great use many of our
viewers out there who are lucky enough
to have their hands on either an iPhone
6 with touch ID or a galaxy s5 with its
fingerprint scanner can actually speak
directly to the benefits of this amazing
future technology not
only do they gain increased security on
their personal devices but there's a
certain ease of access that comes along
with this implementation as well as one
merely needs to press their finger on
the appropriate place to quickly unlock
their phone also with the iPhones
offering you get the ability to make
purchases with the swipe of a finger
which helps by eliminating the need for
them to hand personal information to
retailers every time they make a
purchase convenient and secure but of
course those of you lucky enough to own
one of these devices is probably also
aware of the many reports that claim
that hackers have been able to defeat
these security measures in certain
instances and while the chances of that
happening to a an average Joe individual
are probably actually less likely than
your standard type of you know 1 2 3 4
or 6 9 6 9 type of hack it goes without
saying that this is one of the pitfalls
of automated design while a standard
Locker analog device such as a vault
dial might not be able to distinguish
between users that are allowed access or
not allowed access it also actually
gains some of its strength from this
lack of features is the owner can easily
prevent unwanted access by making sure
that the key are the combination to
either of them is never misplaced
whereas if someone defeats a biometric
scanner they are offensively considered
to be you by whatever program they've
accessed possibly preventing the
realization that there has ever been any
intrusion at all and none of this even
mentions the sorts of ordinary hurdles
that need to be ironed out with any of
these emerging technologies like
creating an eye scanner that doesn't
slowly burn your retinas out over time
although on the bright side I guess it
wouldn't matter that if you had your eye
 out by a ticket agent in that
scenario
great job speaking of plucking that's
something that you won't have to do if
