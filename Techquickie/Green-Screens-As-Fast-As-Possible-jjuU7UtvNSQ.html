these days are always trying to outdo
each other to see which film can have
the most wildly over-the-top
multi-million dollar special effects and
while this sort of movie magic can
require some really complicated
post-processing much of it relies on a
pretty simple piece of equipment the
humble green screen which allows it to
appear as though a piece of content was
filmed in a completely different
location via de fantastical one or
totally mundane one but how does it work
well when you shoot something in front
of a green screen such as your favorite
YouTube host you can tell whatever video
editing software you're using to detect
a range of colors in this case shades of
green and replace anything that falls
within that range with a transparent
layer that means you can put anything
you want behind it and it will peep
through and although this is a pretty
simple idea green screens have proved to
be extremely versatile and are widely
used to overlay even extremely complex
and expensive CGI in high budget films
now part of the reason for this is how
useful the color green is modern digital
video cameras use things called bayer
filters to capture light these filters
are designed to be more sensitive to
green light than to red or blue because
our own eyes operate the same way and
are most responsive to green this allows
the camera to record many shades of
green very accurately so that when the
raw footage is edited on a computer the
software can precisely replace only
green pixels and leave everything else
intact green also contrasts very well
with human skin color unless your name
is Bruce Banner making it an ideal
choice for use in a studio but green
screens weren't always the most commonly
used background for special effects
before the advent of modern digital
recording blue screens no not that kind
we're actually more popular you see back
in the era of the physical film real
special film that was only
- blue light was readily available
making it easy to produce a negative
that came out clear where the blue
screen was which could then be overlaid
with the background to produce a full
scene blue screens were used extensively
in classic movies such as the original
Star Wars trilogy where producers filmed
miniature models of starships in front
of blue backgrounds and they continued
to be used today in certain situations
such as shooting low-light scenes so
wait a minute Linus are you telling me
that all I need to create awesome scenes
at home is a camera and editing rig and
a big green or a blue sheet well sort of
before you whip out the camera and try
to give James Cameron a run for his
money there are a couple of things to
keep in mind if you're shooting with a
green screen
although modern video editing software
is very good at differentiating shades
of green from other colors shadows and
shiny surfaces can absorb or reflect
enough green light to throw off your
software and make the finished product
look like a mess for this reason proper
lighting is extremely important to
professionals who make a living off of
green screen recordings but are
youtubers like me going to be using
green screens forever
we are starting to see cameras that can
actually record depth information kind
of like the Kinect for Xbox so the
future could be very interesting but for
professional cinematographers instead of
casual gamers this technology is very
very far away from mature so for the
foreseeable future
you won't be expecting to see me wear
any green shirts on the st. Patrick's
Day so let's say you were watching this
