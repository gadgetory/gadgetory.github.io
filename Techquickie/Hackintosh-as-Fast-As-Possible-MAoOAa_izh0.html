world of computer building you might
have noticed a common thread and most
how-to guides out there on the internet
they almost all end showing you how to
configure windows after you're done
piecing everything together but what if
you've grown tired of Cortana the Start
menu or lack thereof and that frowny
face blue screen of death and you want a
different kind of computing experience
well you could choose one of a number of
free Linux distributions as we discussed
in this episode but some people find
themselves irresistible drawn to the
interface of Mac OS just not to the high
price tag Apple says tough luck to you
bud but fear not a community has popped
up around building hacking Tasha's pcs
that run Mac OS on non-apple hardware
but how does this process work
just throw Mac OS onto a USB Drive boot
from it and click install ya know
first of all Apple only guarantees
compatibility for Mac OS with a very
limited number of hardware
configurations
there's unlike Windows which is supposed
to work on any x86 or x64 based system
provided it meets the minimum
requirements so how in the world then
are you supposed to know what will be
compatible well though there isn't
really a good way to know if the extreme
gamer over 9000 motherboard will work
with Mac OS outside of just trying it
and seeing what happens the hackintosh
community has actually compiled lists of
components that users have had good luck
with on websites like OS X 86 and df/dt
all right then so once you've built your
system or verified that your existing
one is compatible the next step is to
get a copy of Mac OS typically this
means
using an actual Mac to download the
latest version through the app store or
buying an older version on optical media
directly from Apple so you got your
grubby little hands on Mac OS now you
need to create a bootable USB using some
special software
yuuna beast is a popular one simply
click through the menus and indicate
whether you'll be installing mac OS on a
newer UEFI capable system or on an older
computer and your boot media will be
ready but before you shove it into your
PC you'll want to tweak your BIOS
settings this typically involves
disabling features designed for for
Wintel machines that Mac OS won't play
nicely with such as vtd CFG lock secure
boot IO serial port and even USB 3.0 if
you're rocking something older like a
motherboard with an Intel 5 Series
chipset enable X HCI handoff and you are
ready to install Mac OS from your USB
Drive
but after you've done this now you got
to make your mac OS target disk bootable
as it doesn't happen automatically a
popular option is to use a utility
called multi beast which will not only
make your machine bootable but will
attempt to install additional necessary
software like drivers note however that
you'll probably still need to find Mac
drivers for your graphics card on your
own and that's it theoretically by this
point you're good to go but hold on a
minute
I've heard that Apple is extremely
unhappy with people building hacking
Tosh's will I get in trouble well Apple
to me well I do hard time in a
white-collar minimum-security prison so
here's the deal with that
downloading Mac OS from the Apple Store
is free but the fine print stipulates
that you may only install it on a
bonafide Mac system so that means that
technically even though you downloaded
it for free from Apple its software
piracy because you are in breach of the
end-user License Agreement so apple
indeed does strongly frown upon people
building
and using hackintosh systems but with
that said the chances of Apple coming
after a single user that just wants to
use a hackintosh at home are virtually
nil and if they do find out somehow the
most they are likely to do is something
like ban your machine from the App Store
though it should be noted they did sue a
company back in 2009 that was marketing
and selling hackintosh shoes which could
actually be considered a crime under US
federal law
so the takeaway then is that we're not
telling you what you should do we are
not your legal advisers but if you are
going to dabble in hackintosh inge do it
for personal use not to make a quick
buck and in any event you are far more
likely to run into technical rather than
legal issues iMessage is infamously
tough to run on a hackintosh and you'll
probably find other things small or deal
breaking that aren't exactly on par with
the authentic Mac experience but there
are plenty of resources online to help
both newbies and veterans so go check
them out and just hope that Steve Jobs
isn't watching you from beyond the grave
do you run a small business are you a
freelancer do you have lots of work to
do but you just can't get organized
enough to find all the time to do it
well FreshBooks is here to help you it's

designed for the way that you work it's
