guys remember the last time there was a
version 4.0 of something its creators
envisioned running on nearly every
desktop PC yeah me too but don't worry
the subject of today's video isn't an
ill-tempered web browser will be looking
instead at PCI Express 4.0 the newest
revision of the computer bus for your
graphics cards and your high performance
SSDs and like the kind of bus that has
tires PCIe 4.0 has been rather slow to
roll its way into our lives the
specification for version 3.0 came out
all the way back in 2010 so why exactly
has it taken so long well remember that
pcie 3.0 had a maximum speed of almost
16 gigabytes per second in each
direction for its full sized 16x link
that is already blisteringly fast and
the PCI special interest group which
develops the spec wanted to keep with
how previous revisions doubled the speed
every time so basically it took them a
while to figure out how to force 32
gigabytes of data per second each way
through the same interconnect and figure
it out they did but what are the
practical benefits
I mean 3.0 has been doing just fine who
needs that much speed unless they're
doing literally nothing but moving fork
a video around even modern graphics
cards don't fully saturate a last gen
PCI Express 3.0 x16 link so is this more
speed just for the sake of it well no
actually because PCIe 4.0 can support so
much data it may very well end up being
helpful in the sense that it will free
up PCI Express Lanes allowing for more
devices to connect without any of them
being bottlenecked this is a major
concern because even the late
high-end consumer CPUs support just 20
or 24 PCIe lanes directly off the chip
most of which gets immediately consumed
by a graphics card leaving multiple
devices competing for bandwidth on a
PCIe communications hub of some sort
so with PCIe 4.0 we could have things
like high-speed nvme SSDs and 10 gigabit
ethernet connections using just one lane
each with nearly 2 gigabytes in each
direction available to them so now then
I can use the other lanes I freed up for
more drives more high-speed USB I don't
know that holographic interface cards
look I can't predict the future
and don't forget about notebooks
Thunderbolt you know that super cool
interface that can be used with external
graphics cards also connects to the PCI
Express bus as it stands today the
ability to run a desktop graphics card
outside of the chassis is pretty darn
cool
but we've observed some definite
performance reductions when we've tested
these kinds of setups so then with PCIe
4.0 s higher speeds and lower latency
the market for external GPU enclosures
may get a little more vibrant if they
can deliver the same or similar
performance to what you'd get with the
GPU actually sitting inside your
computer and all of this ignores the
data center where cloud applications for
high-speed obtain caches of your feed
will help Facebook load a delicious
second faster and where scientists are
using supercomputers with dozens or even
hundreds of GPUs for climate research
and AI development all of those things
are going to need faster PCIe
connectivity - now of course only time
will tell how relevant this new PCI
Express revision will be but if the past
is anything to go by we could end up
seeing the first motherboards featuring
PCIe 4.0 in mid to late 2018 so you'll
be able to see for yourself with
that said while the faster speeds may
not be enough to get you to rush out and
buy a new motherboard as soon as they
drop it will be interesting to see how
component manufacturers take advantage
of the higher bandwidth if nothing else
maybe we'll see an RGB expansion card
with AI onboard that proactively adapts
the lighting to your mood speaking of
being proactive
are you finding yourself at the end of
the day whether you're a small business
owner or a freelancer struggling with
this frustrating accounting software
it's time to get ahead of the issue and
switch to fresh books fresh books is
easy to use its cloud-based so you can
access it from anywhere they've got apps
for Android and iOS and it's got tons of
practical benefits as well it allows you
to create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds set up
online payments with just a couple of
clicks to get paid up to four days
faster it allows you to see when your
client has seen your invoice and put an
end to the guessing games and more and
