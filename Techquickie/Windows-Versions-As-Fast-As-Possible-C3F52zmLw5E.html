of our younger viewers out there but
there was a time when operating systems
and graphical user interfaces you know
like Mouse pointers didn't exactly go
together leaving computer enthusiasts
with only plain text and cat posters to
stare at in their moms basements the
long winter ended however in 1985 when
Microsoft delivered Windows 1.0 shining
and graphically generated light for the
first time ok so they actually weren't
the first to do that at all but we've
got to give them credit where it's due
and while the first several windows
version still basically ran over top of
NS DOS relying heavily on command line
entries they also introduced many things
we take for granted today such as
differing executable file formats device
drivers and multitasking that's right
for the first time people can play
minesweeper and solitaire simultaneously
the next big developments came with the
smash hit release of Windows 95 arguably
the most prolific OS to date with sales
reaching 40 million copies that year
many of which are still running on
elderly people's computers worldwide
Windows 95 was the first OS capable of
running 32-bit applications it
introduced plug-and-play hardware
commonly called plug and pray at the
time and pre-emptive multitasking and
OSS ability to pause and resume program
operations users were also treated to a
groundbreaking new way of launching
programs and ironically powering down
the computer this Start menu from then
until Microsoft stopped supporting
Windows 95 and launched Windows XP in
the year 2001 we had witnessed much
advancement multi-monitor and Universal
Serial bus or USB support with Windows
98
the first non server OS based on the NT
kernel in Windows 2000 and that very
unhelpful but friendly little paper clip
but XP is the next proper stop on our
tour because of this milestone it was
the first consumer oriented Windows OS
to break free from Gauss's stranglehold
in favor of an NT kernel although many
remnants of the Hedi daus days rim
and in fact still exist like the command
prompt or the Tildy menus used to enter
god mode anyway this combined with its
robust features like a restyled
double-wide Start menu searching by
document types not just name easier
networking and file sharing and even
autoplay all eventually led to 400
million copies being distributed with
extended support continued up until last
year this success did not come without a
price though
literally and Microsoft shocked many by
announcing that while Internet Explorer
and space-cadet pinball were bundled for
free office would no longer be included
and would have to be purchased
separately a tasty premium a trend that
continues today
eventually demand for a 64-bit operating
system capable of breaking through the 4
gigabyte system memory limit imposed by
32-bit processors and OSS led to the
release of Vista in 2007 whose reception
was less than lukewarm with DirectX 10
ending up not being relevant for quite
some time and controversy over things
like the unavailability of hardware
drivers and its very high system
requirements for the time Microsoft
hurriedly released Windows 7 just two
years later though which while sharing
much of the same codebase ended up
looking and performing better than its
predecessor thanks to Windows 7's
critical acclaim it got a longer shelf
life but the same can't be said of
Windows 8 and it's free incremental
point one improvement they did deliver
better performance monitoring faster
boot up and sleep and wake times
improved networking performance and the
Microsoft Store for apps but they
replaced the beloved Start menu with the
large brightly colored tiled Start
screen meant to blend the experience
between Windows desktop and Windows
Mobile devices a halfway measure that
ended up not pleasing anyone but that
doesn't mean they don't learn good old
Microsoft which brings us to the present
day Windows 10 while it may be too soon
yet to determine what we'll remember
about Windows 10 in
ten years there are some solid additions
like Cortana for voice control the new
and improved Start menu and a new way of
handling upgrades with Microsoft
offering Windows seven and eight owners
a free Windows 10 license within the
first year as long as they're willing to
wade through the appropriate menu
options to preserve their privacy if
