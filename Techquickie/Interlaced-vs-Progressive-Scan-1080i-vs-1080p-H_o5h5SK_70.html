TV service chances are there's a toggle
somewhere on your set-top box that
allows you to switch between 720p or
1080i but you've also probably noticed
that most TVs and monitors advertise
themselves as 1080p these days which
doesn't match up with either of those so
what gives you see that P you always see
at the end of 1080 P stands for
progressive and no I'm not talking about
the insurance company or Bernie Sanders
I'm talking about progressive scan which
means it will draw all of the lines in a
single frame of video sequentially so
that each frame contains a complete
image that fills the screen
by contrast the little I stands for
interlaced in which only every other
line of an image is displayed in one
frame interlaced signals are common not
only for 1920 by 1080 TV channels but
they were also dominant back in the day
of analog television where almost
everyone was watching at 480i or 576i on
CRT displays but why wouldn't it be more
straightforward to display one whole
image per frame well part of the reason
was bandwidth you see only so much data
can be flung over the airwaves or a
coaxial cable at once interlaced video
saves on bandwidth by only sending half
of a complete frame at once
this allowed older TV sets to refresh
more frequently for smoother motion as
they could show 60 half frames per
second instead of 30 full frames but
modern LCD flat panel TVs only support
progressive scanning so how do they work
then with interlaced 1080i signals
provided by cable or satellite TV
services well the signals have to be
what is called D interlaced this can be
done by either the set-top box or the T
itself but either way it's an imperfect
science you see the two halves of a
fully interlaced frame are at two halves
of the exact same image rather they are
usually delivered as the halves of two
separate slightly different frames so
when you put them together they don't
look quite perfect and on low-quality
displays this can show up as what's
called combing in places where the two
half frames don't match up very well tvs
use processing tricks to help avoid
really bad artifacting in D interlaced
video and generally it works fairly well
on displays that are worth their salt
and although many cable boxes can also
delay signals it's typically a better
idea to let your TV do it as cable boxes
are all too often made by the lowest
bidder and the deinterlacing logic
inside them won't be as good as what
your TV offers but even with a nicer TV
it can still be possible to notice a
reduction in picture quality when
there's rapid movement on-screen such as
if you're watching a sporting event
because two half frames in sequence
during something like a hockey game can
be way out of sync due to the fast
motion of the players many sports
networks like ESPN have actually chosen
to broadcast in 720p
instead of 1080i sacrificing resolution
for better movement but come on Linus
this is 2016 why do we have to sacrifice
anything well due to the cost of
upgrading systems as well as the fact
that most bourgeoisie viewers seem to be
content with 1080i service we probably
won't see real 1080p at 60 frames per
second over cable and satellite anytime
soon however the good news is that
computers have no problem outputting
1080p signals so if you're one of the
many folks who are constantly using
their rigs for everything from gaming to
watching Netflix in HD or even 4k you
won't have to worry about interlacing
artifacts yet another reason to join the
PC master-race
just make sure that you don't have to
give
up a kidney to your satellite provider
in order to get out of your contract
tunnel Bayer VPN lets you tunnel to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as though you are in that a for
mentioned different country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they've also got a Chrome extension
and all you do like seriously my family
could do it which is like a serious
endorsement is click the button the
little switch moves to on then whatever
country it is that you pick boom your
connection gets encrypted and the public
IP address that you are showing to the
websites and services that you use gets
switched to pretend as though you're in
somewhere else and tumblr lets you
bypass all the annoying details that
typically come with using a VPN like
messing around with port configurations
or DNS or router settings or any of that
nonsense they've got a top rated privacy
policy and you can try total bear for
free with five hundred Meg's of data
with no credit card required at the link
in the video description then if you
want to save 10% on your unlimited data
plan you can also go to that link so
you've got to go to the link either way
so you might as well just get on with it
