output heat especially when they're
working hard too much of which can
result in sweaty palms melted chocolates
and even catastrophic failure but do you
know why it's because the circuits and
wires inside an electronic device don't
conduct electricity perfectly they have
a certain amount of electrical
resistance which is the tendency for a
material to resist the flow of electrons
this resistance manifest itself as heat
and sometimes light this is a good thing
for something like a stovetop electric
heater light bulb or a toaster without
electrical resistance your toaster
wouldn't toast which would make it one
of the world's least useful inventions
ever but most of the time you don't want
your electronics to heat up imagine for
a moment that your house used tungsten
wires that's the same material used for
incandescent light bulbs your whole
house would burn to the ground
that's why most wires are made out of
copper which conduct the electricity
quite well and without much resistance
aluminum copper silver and gold are
great conductors of electricity but gold
and silver are rare so aluminum and
copper are often used because they're
less expensive but even these highly
conductive materials still don't conduct
electricity perfectly which is why
electronic devices like computers get so
hot without all those heat sinks fans
radiators and heat pipes your computer
would heat up so significantly that it
would basically melt or catch fire
electrical resistance is a big issue for
pretty much anything that uses
electricity modern power lines use thick
cables and high voltage to reduce
electrical resistance but a lot of
electricity is still wasted it just
turns into heat and floats away if only
there was a way to conduct electricity
with absolutely no electrical resistance
that's what a superconductor is
superconductors are able to conduct
electricity perfectly with no resistance
and no heating of any kind and they are
so cool superconducting wires are used
for things that require massive amounts
of electricity like inside MRI machines
power plants and particle accelerators
and superconducting magnets look like
something straight out of science
fiction since they move only along their
magnetic field and never against it they
can hover in the air indefinitely sounds
awesome right but there's a huge catch
for superconductivity to work you need
incredibly low temperatures near
absolute
which requires the use of liquid
nitrogen or helium this greatly
restricts how and where superconductors
can be used today that's why scientists
have been working to create
superconductors that work at higher and
higher temperatures if we had
room-temperature superconductors modern
technology would be changed forever
remember all those heat sinks fans
radiators and heat pipes with a
superconducting computer you won't need
any of that anymore electronics would
get smaller and use less electricity
more efficiently this is one of the
great scientific advancements that I
hope I get to see in my lifetime
maybe we'll get that back to the future
hoverboard after all anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this episode of fast as
possible like it if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it and leave a
comment telling us what you would do
with a hoverboard and also let us know
how you feel about having alternative
hosts on fast as possible thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
