to create a new programming model to
fully exploit the capabilities of modern
GPUs to improve graphics performance the
idea is to give developers the ability
to have their game engines interact
directly with the hardware to reduce
unnecessary overhead that is introduced
by other API s most developers who are
embracing mantle seem to be particularly
fed up with the shortcomings and lack of
innovation from Microsoft with respect
to Direct X ok so it's better but there
are a lot of questions that remain I
mean is this just plug-and-play
what games does it work with well right
now mantle is supported only on Windows
platforms and only in games that are
specifically coated to take advantage of
it including battlefield 4 in star
citizen
there is no Linux or steam OS support
for now and while there were rumors
early on that the Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 would support it that was
a misunderstanding mantle allows PC
developers to improve performance by
letting them better control the graphics
hardware and by allowing them to use
techniques that were previously limited
to console game development on the PC
that should in theory facilitate porting
games from a console to a mantle enabled
PC but that doesn't mean that Microsoft
and Sony's latest council's support
mantle or really anything that closely
related to it ok so how do you use it
well I mean have you ever had a game
that supports both directx and opengl
rendering paths it'll have a drop-down
menu allowing you to choose the render
path you want mantle aims to be that
simple select which API you want to use
fire up your game and enjoy the
performance advantage all right sounds
great but hold on I've got a mantle
supported game and the dropdown isn't
there well every aspect of your system
needs to support mantle you will need a
mantle compatible video card and mantle
compatible driver to go along with your
mantle compatible game all right so I
need an AMD graphics card for now yes
but AMD says it's designed mantle in
such a way that makes it applicable to a
range of modern GPU architectures so
while it is a proprietary technology
right now
AMD says they're planning to release
mantle as an open space
vacation sometime in 2014 so stay tuned
on that one
all right so why did IMD do all this
work on their own rather than improve
what was already there and that is a
great question and one that I'm actually
just gonna leave it to AMD dancer from
their FAQ the design of mantle was
driven by feedback from leading game
developers who preferred the idea of a
fresh start with a new API to the
extension and patching of existing ones
okay but what does that mean for directx
and opengl in reality for now nothing
mantle is in its infancy and the
industry could still kind of tinker with
it for a while and then leave it
abandoned in a corner but if instead the
industry adopts it wholeheartedly or
even just borrow certain aspects of it
and applies them to improving directx
and opengl AMD figures they can call the
project a success so all right which
leads us to the meat of it you sat
through the video how much of a
performance improvement is there with
mantle and I'm sorry to disappoint you
but unfortunately there's just too wide
a range to give you a straight up single
answer different PC configurations will
behave in different ways
but the general rule is that mantle will
have the biggest impact in CPU limited
scenarios particularly because of how
much more efficiently it allows a game
engine to utilize a multi-core processor
speaking of multi-core processors
hotspot Shield weather you need to make
yourself a bit more difficult to track
on your multi-core desktop PC or whether
you need to leverage the mobile-data
saving services that are available on
iOS devices when you're on the go
hotspot shield is the fast simple way to
improve your security online that was a
terrible segue but my point still stands
and there's great news you can get a
free trial of their elite service at any
time and if you use offer code Linus you
can save 20% when it's time to take the
plunge so check out the link in the
video description to give it a shot like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you dislike it leave a comment under the
video and let me know your thoughts on
mantle I mean by the time you're
watching this video it could be a year
later in the landscape could have
completely changed so I'd love to keep
the discussion up to date and as always
