apparently I need to explain resolution
what is it why is it important it's
become a much hotter topic than usual
because of a quote from the ubisoft blog
justifying their use of the lower than
1080p resolution and watchdogs that
reads as follows resolution is a number
just like framerate is a number all
those numbers are valid aspects of
making games but you make choices about
the experience you want to deliver in
our case dynamism is everything so for
that reason I will focus on the role
resolution plays for gamers more and
less on the role it plays for
photographers and movie buffs although
much of this will also be applicable to
those folks
the term resolution is used to describe
the finest or detail in an image it
quantifies how closed lines can be to
each other and still be visually
differentiated from each other by the
eye there are actually lots of different
ways to measure resolution but they all
boil down to this add an equal distance
given to same sized and otherwise
equivalent images the higher resolution
one will look sharper clearer more true
to life and just generally better to a
point first there's the requirement that
all links in the chain the content the
software and the display need to be
capable of the resolution you're trying
to achieve or you'll only realize the
capabilities of the weakest link and
second is that there's actually an upper
limit to what your eye itself can
resolve anyway the marketing term that
Apple coin for this is retina you can
actually learn more about how they
calculate that in the video that we made
here and this is where things start to
get a little bit tricky on that Retina
calculator you see three values the
pixel count of your display the size of
your display and the distance from which
you'll normally view it so you can have
a 1080p display that delivers an image
so fine you can't see the individual
pixels and a different 1080p display
with an effective resolution so low you
might as well go back to playing Atari
because it's so big or you're so close
to it you see maybe Ubisoft on their
blog had a point 1080p is just a number
the perceived quality of your content
depends on much more than whether it
runs at 1920 by 1080 pixels versus 1280
by 720 or whatever else the distance and
screen size factors are just the tip of
the iceberg
- what about color death or framerate
what about visual effects that we can
turn on if we use up less of our
graphics processors horsepower to push
more pixels the one you're looking at
right now is a bit of an embellished
example here but hopefully you see my
point so yeah all of these things are
important - so why do we fixate on one
and gains to run at 1080p or higher so
much well the answer is that on a
typical flat-screen TV at a normal
viewing distance a 1080p pixel count has
a reasonably fine resolution one that
most people will find tolerable and
running less than that has a couple of
undesirable effects number one is that
it makes curved and diagonal lines look
block here and less sharp which draws
the users attention to the fact that
they're looking at a digital simulation
rather than a real image and number two
goes back to that chain I was talking
about before if one part of the chain
let's say your Xbox can't handle the
pixel count of the others let's say the
game in your TV instead of getting a
pixel by pixel perfect representation of
what the image was supposed to look like
some approximations are being made these
approximations are called interpolation
and if you want to know what that does
to image quality go ahead set your
display right now to something other
than its native res and see what it
looks like
yeck so there you have it resolution
might be only one determining factor
when we're evaluating visual quality and
it might just be a number but it's a
really important number because a high
resolution simple scene can look great I
mean look at look at Nintendo's graphics
on the Wii U but even the best-looking
the best image in the world can be
easily ruined by lowering the resolution
too much because you can't see the
details in the image anyway speaking of
detailed images shutterstock we
absolutely love shutterstock around here
I actually found out I'm supposed to be
getting a free account as part of this
sponsorship deal and it hasn't been
happening and honestly even if the
paperwork doesn't get sorted out and I
keep having to pay I'm going to keep
using it even though it's over $200 a
month if you're a content creator or
really anyone who needs to be able to
quickly and easily find high resolution
royalty-free images and video for
integration into other content
Shutterstock is fantastic they have a
ton of different plans all the way from
just buying a couple of images at a time
to enterprise-grade ones that you
podcast on TV and stuff we save so much
time that our account pays for itself
easily we just grab the images we like
embed them in our videos then proceed to
not sit around worrying if we're going
to get a YouTube strike for using
someone else's content without an
appropriate license and if you decide to
give Shutterstock a try today we've got
a 20% off code for you tech quickie 614
give it a try it really is awesome
thanks for checking out this episode of
fast as possible don't forget to
subscribe for more videos just like this
on tech quickie like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you dislike to
leave a comment if you have anything to
say about resolution or our videos or my
hair or who knows ponies I don't care
you can believe a comment with whatever
you want I'm if that's YouTube
confidence I can't control what you put
in there so I could let me tell you
happy you wouldn't be allowed to comment
at all so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
