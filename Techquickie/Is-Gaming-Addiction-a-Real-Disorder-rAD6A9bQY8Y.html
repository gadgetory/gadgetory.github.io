the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos when you
were younger did your parents ever
complain that you were addicted to video
games after you'd been hanging out in
the Mushroom Kingdom for too long I mean
maybe you're still hearing that from
some members of your family well guess
what the World Health Organization not
to be confused with that band from the
UK classified gaming disorder as a real
health problem earlier this year so did
that scolding that you were given about
how much time you spent in front of a
screen actually have some merit to it
well it turns out the answer is maybe
but it's important to keep in mind that
whether you have an actual gaming
addiction isn't predicated on just how
long you spend playing in fact plenty of
people frequently engage in lengthy
gaming sessions without suffering from a
true addiction instead the folks who
classify gaming addiction as an actual
disease focus on the ways that gaming
can affect an individual's life
specifically the who focuses on whether
a gamer has difficulty putting the
controller down when they want or need
to do other things and whether they feel
compelled to play games like a 15 year
old boy from Britain who missed an
entire year of school playing fortnight
rather than simply gaming because it's
an activity that they enjoy and to be
fair that definition does actually sound
fairly reasonable and it also sounds a
lot like how people decide if they have
a problem with other more traditional
vices such as substance use or gambling
there's obviously a much greater risk of
losing staggering amounts of money if
you feel like you have to gamble as
opposed to spending a few bucks on the
occasional lotto ticket but if gaming
addiction is so similar to other forms
of dependence why is its classification
by the WHO generating so much backlash
after all the who said that it based its
decision on the fact that many people
around the world were being treated for
the same symptoms well
many in the gaming community feel that
this is just yet another undeserving
black eye for the industry after renewed
public discussion about whether video
games are partially to blame for things
like school violence despite the fact
that a causal link has never been proven
there and there does seem to be merit to
the argument that the real problem for
those who are addicted to something is
the state of mind rather than the actual
focus of their specific addiction and
that a person who's addicted to video
games might have the same compulsive
feelings as a person who's addicted to
smoking junk food or alternative forms
of entertainment
there's also concerned that whose
classification is reflective of a moral
panic in which video games are simply a
punching bag for societal and health
issues that may actually be caused by
different things and this view isn't
just widespread among gamers but some
psychologists also believe that the
decision to list gaming disorder
specifically in the international
classification of diseases was premature
and based on weak evidence and even the
who itself admits that the alleged
disorder only affects a small number of
people and there was actually an Oxford
University study in 2016 indicating
gaming addiction might affect only about
3% of gamers at most but there are fears
that the mere fact it's being recognized
as a disease will result in heightened
scrutiny on the game industry and on
individual gamers themselves whose
passion for their hobby could easily be
mistaken as addiction to someone who
doesn't share the same interests but
with specialized clinics for treating
compulsive gaming sprouting up around
the world and with some countries like
South Korea even looking at banning
children and teens from online gaming
during certain hours
who exactly is right here well we aren't
doctors here at Tech kwikki but here's
what we can say with a fair degree of
certainty if playing games is a major
part of your life but it doesn't keep
you from your other obligations and you
don't have difficulty putting them down
when you need to rock on brother but if
you do think you might have a problem
it's really important to
remember that there is zero shame in
seeking out help if you need it
speaking of getting help if you're
trying to stay private online PIAA is
the help you need for that not only this
P ia work on up to five devices at once
by hiding your true IP address and
allowing you to bypass geo restrictions
and censorship it also blocks unwanted
connections to help prevent attacks it
Auto blocks all the traffic if the VPN
disconnects it keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and Stoops and
it even includes mace P is built-in
malware blocker BIA supports multiple
VPN protocols and encryption levels and
they've got apps for Windows Mac Android
iOS Linux and a Chrome extension with
support for more platforms coming soon
