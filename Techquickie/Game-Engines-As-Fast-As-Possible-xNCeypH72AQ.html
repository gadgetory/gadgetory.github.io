most sensible Footwear on earth you
occasionally get excited about the
release of a big-name game title you
have at some point in the past heard a
friend complain about a for mentioned
big-name game using the same worn-out
old engine or conversely I've
encountered the massive hype train that
usually accompanies a shiny new engine
but these overly enthusiastic game
journalists and downer type friends
often neglect to explain what exactly a
game engine is so here we go firstly
they provide a rendering engine which
allows designers to pair their in-house
made 2d images with 3d wireframes
to create fully actualized models then
usually one or several application
programming interfaces such as the
upcoming DirectX 12 and Vulcan are used
to furnish the rendering engine with
efficient access to a systems processing
and graphics hardware secondly game
engines must provide well everything
else as well there's the obvious stuff
like physics or collision detection
engines which account for general
movement and the interaction between
models like you know characters and the
Grouch as well as the stuff that you
might not have considered before like
realistic lighting effects with
realistically bouncing light rays
realistic diffusion through different
materials and even crazy stuff like the
scattering of light beneath the surface
of a models skin to give him
natural-looking rosy cheeks for example
and of course something thirdly has to
keep our game subjects marching
perpetually along the horizon so AI
engines are also pivotal to give our
characters the ability to create Skynet
inside about no just kidding
usually an AI engine is more like a
complex arrangement of behavior trees
but anyway the point is that a game
engine is the sciency programming
skeleton that supports the game
designers and lets them focus on the
flesh you know the story and gameplay
elements of their title instead of
spending countless hours locked away in
a
focused on like the sound oh yeah I
don't forget sound and physics of like
bouncing balls okay so now that we have
an idea of what game engines are for the
next obvious question is where do they
come from
well son let me tell you when a man
loves a woman and no surgeons just
kidding so simply put they come from
well a lot of money there are open
source game engines out there but for
the most part no one is building game
engines just to help a brother out and
there are a couple of main reasons for a
developer to build one number one your
company let's say epic makers of Unreal
Engine or valve the makers of Source
engine decides to focus on licensing
this engine technology to smaller
developers rather than trying to make
every huge blockbuster game from scratch
or even the third episode of a
blockbuster game number two your company
has the resources to absorb the
multi-year investment into engine
building to avoid paying out a
percentage on future game sales Blizzard
would be a great example of this or
number three your company just can't
find the right technology and a
prepackaged engine and needs to build
their own whether they like it or not so
that's it in a nutshell achieving
optimal cost efficiency and then in some
cases anyway allocating those extra
resources to other parts of production
like paying these guys to do voice
acting something I'm sure we all
appreciate and you know what else I
appreciate fresh books it is the online
accounting tool designed for freelance
workers or small businesses so maybe you
or someone you know it makes invoicing
getting paid and tracking your hours and
expenses easier the little details about
cash flow are all in one place so you
know where you stand and this is great
it shows a full history of each invoice
allowing you to check if your client
well you can send it to the client first
you can check if they viewed it and then
you can actually have them pay it right
through fresh books whoo collecting
money just got easier and if you're your
own boss well give it a try because
fresh books offers a free trial at fresh
books calm
tech quickie so if you're your own boss
use the tools that make you feel like a
boss and oh don't forget to enter tech
