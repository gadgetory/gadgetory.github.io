found atop any standard drum set which
sorry let me try that again
gimble's the tiny metal or plastic cups
that people wear on their fingers to
protect them while sewing which
wrong again well how am I supposed to
know all of this stuff one last time
Gimbels pivoted support mechanisms that
allow attached objects to be rotated
around a central axis but if that
definition sent your head spinning
around its central axis like it did to
mine here's a plain English one it lets
an object let's say a drink stay
oriented one way even when whatever it's
mounted to is rotating and cup holders
that don't spill when a ship is swaying
back and forth in the ocean are just the
beginning those who have seen our video
about optical image stabilization will
already be aware that miniature
gyroscopic sensors make greater
stability possible in cameras by
monitoring and affecting lens position
in response to stimuli this process is
remarkably similar to other systems like
ones responsible for keeping commercial
airliners autopilot programs
constantly aware of the horizon or those
that keep large luxury cruise liners
from tipping over usually and triple
gimbal support mounts known as gyros
that's better make it possible for an
item to rotate completely free of its
mounting allowing something like a drone
mounted camera to not only be stabilized
up-and-down pitch left and right yaw but
also on the third roll axis meaning that
the cameras shot stays level even when
the airborne platform it's attached to
is altering its angle dramatically to
get like that sick pan shot so gimbals
that are paired with sensors and capable
of manual adjustment of the orientation
of the mounted object in addition to
providing resistance to a change in
orientation are called motored systems
and you can find them on more than just
drones I mean even rocket propulsion
systems use them to allow thrust to be
applied to the rocket ship in different
directions as needed but what do drones
and rockets have in common well they're
both complicated and expensive so if the
goal is to build a better selfie stick
or whatever the other type of gimbal you
might encounter is a motorless one these
systems rely on precise balance and
sometimes even user intervention
directly to keep them still and they are
less capable of compensating for sudden
aggressive movements but they are
lighter and less expensive when a
motored gimbal is required which still
doesn't explain why the Blair Witch
Project looked like absolute garbage
none of this stuff is new and even
though it's taken until now for many
mainstream folks to realize that they're
surrounded by gyroscopes and gimble's
there are drawings of ink pots that
never tip over going back thousands of
years
cool hey you know what else is cool
fresh books it's the online accounting
it wonder strata come up with a word
there that was an extravaganza because
that what I was about to say and let's
face it even though fresh books does
make your invoicing and getting paid and
tracking expenses easier
I wouldn't call anything that involves
accounting an extravaganza basically
it's a way to keep little details about
you know cash flow and how many hours
you've worked on this project in one
place and it shows a full history of
each invoice allowing you to check if
your client has viewed the invoice as
well as allow them to pay directly via
credit card through fresh books which is
pretty awesome because we all know that
doing the work is one thing actually
getting paid for it is quite another and
you can monitor all of this from your
phone so you can do it while you're out
in between jobs or whatever else the
case maybe instead of getting home at
the end of the day plopping yourself
down in front of your computer and
trying to remember what the crap
happened that day when you're tired
because you've been working so if you're
your own boss you should be using stuff
that makes you feel like a boss and you
want to head over to fresh books comm

in the how did you hear about us section
it's always pronounced like that how did
you hear about us or just how did you
hear about us that's fine too thanks for
