forced hatch or 3d touch floating around
the internet lately but aside from their
apparent affiliation with the most
controversially loved or hated fruit in
the tech world what do these terms
really mean is 3d touch just a cool
hologram that projects from your phone
is forced touch a way to channel your
inner Jedi when you're using your phone
sadly no these terms refer to capacitive
touchscreens that are capable of reading
how hard you press on them and while
that might not sound like a big deal it
could change a lot about the way we
interact with our touchscreen devices in
the future so how do they work then well
there are so many different
manufacturers starting to patent their
own designs that there isn't really a
industry standard method yet but in the
case of Apple devices there is a grid of
special capacitive sensors and strain
gauges placed behind the screens
backlight that measure microscopic
changes in distance between the cover
glass and the backlight itself so when
you press harder on the screen the
distance between the glass and backlight
is shorter resulting in force input 3d
touch is even capable of reading
multiple levels of pressure allowing for
more interface options like the ones
that we see in the iPhone 6s
force touch however is only capable of
detecting a single level of pressure and
is better suited for devices like the
Apple watch which can benefit from
additional interface options but might
not have the room for the extra hardware
and screen thickness necessary for 3d
touch so the concept itself Bend seems
pretty straightforward you press on the
screen and the device recognizes where
and how hard but what puts this feature
into practice is the software designed
around it most of the current uses for
3d touch revolve around shortcuts and
convenience for example you could press
on the Twitter app harder to be able to
immediately start typing up your tweet
without having to navigate through the
app itself or you could press on a
preview of a picture or attachment and
it would show it to you without fully
opening it or leaving your current
application this is essentially like
having right-click and middle click and
more different ways of clicking even on
devices that would normally have such
small screens that they wouldn't have
enough navigation buttons to be able to
put in all of that functionality now at
the moment this technology is not
available on that many devices but what
does the future hold for those of us who
aren't a fan of the fruit will
pressure-sensitive screens become the
new standard in the near future at this
point it's impossible to be a hundred
percent sure this new tech has opened
many possibilities for the way we
interact with our devices but one could
argue that these changes add another
level of complexity and more room for
accidental input especially in bumpy
situations where you might not have the
best precision behind your press that
being said though 3d and forced touch
are opening many doors for third-party
app developers to expand existing apps
or develop new ones and for our Android
brothers synaptics promises to bring
what they call clear force their own
take on pressure-sensitive screens -
several unnamed Android flagship phones
in early 2016 it's unclear at this time
what clear force will enable in terms of
functionality but I'm hoping for new
ways of interacting with mobile games
and ways to type in all caps when you're
super mad which I guess brings us to the
part of the video where normally I would
close with a cheesy pun but for this one
I realized that I just have to push too
hard to find a good one speaking of
pushing I'm going to push you guys to
head over to ifixit.com the world's free
online repair manual they've got
step-by-step repair and teardown guides
for like literally thousands of
different devices we're talking iphones
ipads mac computers android devices it's
all wiki based so it's always up-to-date
and it's totally free no ads no login
walls no nothing so then how does I fix
it make money great question well with
their line of professional repair and
upgrade tools they've got a huge
selection of parts for Mac's iDevices
Android smartphones tablets basically
anything that you can find instructions
for how to take apart and they've got a
lifetime warranty on all of their parts
personally huge fan of the protec
toolkit that I first unboxed like almost
three years ago and have been using
since then for all of my repair needs
it's got all the hard-to-find
screwdriver bits but they've got all
kinds of other great stuff like their
eye opener heating pad their suction
cups for pulling off screens there
they're professional bag that's got like
all that stuff with like magnetic pad
for putting all the screws and labeling
everywhere they go it's all great stuff
so head over to ifixit.com for all your
electronics repair needs thanks for
watching this video guys if you liked it
hit like if you disliked it well hit
dislike I guess if you want to check out
our other channels we did a really cool
video over on Linus tech tips recently
where I found an eight core Intel CPU 16
gigs of RAM as well as a motherboard for
under 150 bucks so you can learn how to
build one for yourself over there and I
think that pretty much wraps it up leave
a comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible and as always
don't forget to subscribe and follow and
all that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
