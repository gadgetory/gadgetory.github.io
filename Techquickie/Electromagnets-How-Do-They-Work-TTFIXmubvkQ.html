only matter to three kinds of people
physics professors the refrigerator
industry and insane clown posse fans but
magnetic forces are actually responsible
for so many things that we take for
granted in modern life including that
sweet gaming rig next to you and that
phone in your back pocket now for a long
time electricity and magnetism were
thought to be unrelated phenomena but as
our scientific understanding evolved
over the years
we found that electricity and magnetism
were part of the same fundamental force
called you guessed it electromagnetism
one of the four basic forces that make
just about everything in the universe
possible now every electric current
produces a magnetic field from the tiny
traces on your motherboard to huge
high-voltage power lines that carry
electricity across great distances but
this effect is usually weak enough that
is not obvious or impactful so when we
want to harness magnetism so we can
actually do useful stuff with it the
conventional way to achieve this is to
loop a wire carrying a current around
and around many times in order to
concentrate the magnetic field then if
you want to get really fancy with a nice
strong magnet you can loop the wire
around a magnetic core iron is great for
this this is a pretty simple concept but
it forms the basis for many modern
electromagnets making the
electromagnetic force an incredibly
versatile tool especially since you can
control how strong the magnet is simply
by changing the number of turns or coils
of wire or by adjusting how much
electricity is flowing through them but
Linus all I've ever seen electromagnets
used for is picking up cars or scrap
metal at the junkyard how is that
relevant to me well for starters that
hard drive that's probably clicking away
inside your computer right now relies on
electromagnets to read and write data it
has tiny little heads that look like the
needle arm on a record player that are
really just small electromagnets that
orient the magnetic
Maine's in the spinning hard drive
platter a certain way as it flies past
to represent the zeros and ones of data
the current hard drives rely on thin
films rather than conventional coils for
writing
yay progress on to another example what
if all that computer use has led to some
sort of repetitive strain injury well
your doctor might use magnetic resonance
imaging that are known as MRI to have a
look at the inside of your hand this
works by using a very strong magnetic
fields to excite protons in your body
which then actually give off radio waves
that can be captured to form an image
and then when you're done with your
imaging and it's time to go home the
ease of varying the strength of an
electromagnet as I mentioned before has
even made travel via maglev train
possible electromagnetics attached to
the bottoms of these trains push the
entire train up and forward allowing
them to hover over a metal rail and in
doing so travel without friction so
thanks to this the fastest maglev trains
today can travel at 270 miles or 430
kilometers per hour fast enough to rival
some turboprop airliners but even if
you've never ridden a maglev or had to
stick an appendage in an MRI machine
you've still benefited from
electromagnets as they actually supply
nearly all of the world's electricity
whether most of your country's energy
comes from coal oil hydroelectric solar
wind or nuclear almost all power plants
eventually convert whatever kind of
energy source they use into mechanical
energy they use that to drive a turbine
which spins a coil of wire surrounded by
a large powerful you guessed it magnet
this causes an electrical current to
flow through the wire which is sent to
the electrical grid and ultimately to
your house so while watching this
episode of tech quickie isn't exactly
the same as getting your PhD in physics
hopefully you now understand the
fundamentals of electromagnets and how
do
and you didn't even need to talk to a
scientist to do it speaking of how they
work
are you a freelancer or a small business
owner do you find yourself instead of
focusing on the work that you need to do
focused on all the bookkeeping and
accounting and bullcrap that sucky part
try out fresh books fresh books is on a
mission to make freelancers like you
less stressed and more organized through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
sending professional invoices in seconds
fresh books lets you track your hours so
when it comes time to create that
invoice you know exactly what you did
when you did it and who you did it for
it lets you accept deposits for your
work through their platform it lets you
track your expenses which is pretty
freaking cool because if you've ever
done an expense report you'll know how
utterly boring and horrible it is and
the best thing about it is you don't
have to take my word for it you can try
fresh books for free for 30 days by
going to fresh books comm forward slash

entering tech quickie and how did you
hear about us section so thanks for
watching guys if you like the video like
it if you disliked it dislike it if you
want to check out our other channels
boom right over there if you want to
comment with video suggestions boom
right down there and if you want to
subscribe and follow you're a good
person and I like you very much even
though I've never met you you could be
horrible I'd have no way of knowing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
