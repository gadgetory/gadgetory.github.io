in a web browser the website you're
looking at knows to send whatever the
link contains to your computer and not
your neighbors because your computer
sends its IP address kind of like a
return address on an envelope but as it
turns out IP addresses only get you as
far as the modem you have in your house
and these days most of us have tons of
things connected to our routers
especially wirelessly phones laptops
tablets computers other people's phones
consoles chromecast's oh and they're all
connected nearly all the freaking time
you don't really want to be thinking
about it so how does your home
networking equipment know to send those
questionable videos to you and not your
parents sitting in the next room well
each device on your network has
something called a MAC address yes even
the PCs Mac in this case stands for
media access control it identifies which
device is which on your local network so
here's how they work when data arrives
at your home from the worldwide internet
your router needs to decide which device
to send that data to it does this by
keeping track of the MAC addresses of
all the devices connected to it then
assigning what's called a private IP
address usually starting with 192.168 to
every device this is also why you
usually punch in those numbers to access
your routers control panel through your
browser this is very different from a
public IP which is what the rest of the
internet sees as being your IP address
for your entire home network and what
comes up when you type what's my IP
address into google your router keeps
track of outbound requests such as when
you click on a link so when the data you
want arrives at your router it attaches
the correct private IP address to the
data packets ensuring that they got to
your computer or device since all those
private IPs correspond to the correct
MAC address now this might understand
Belize seem a little redundant since the
computer now has both a private IP and a
MAC address that can both individually
identify it but in reality you need both
since although both the public and
private IP stay the same throughout this
process the MAC addresses on the data
packets are constantly being changed
they only tell the data where to go for
its next hop when your data gets to the
next device the MAC address is changed
in order to tell it where to go
well next since your data might go
through numerous servers and routers
before it finally gets to your device
MAC address information is crucial even
though you have a private IP another
upside of MAC addresses is that normally
they always stay the same with many
devices having their MAC addresses
hard-coded into the firmware at the
factory making it easy to spot a
malfunctioning device on the network if
you're trying to troubleshoot and if you
want to protect your network by making
it so that only devices that you approve
can connect many routers use MAC
addresses to restrict access to known
devices very useful if you're worried
someone might try to steal your Wi-Fi
password or even plug in physically ISPs
also use predefined MAC addresses to
make it easy to provide you with the
service you paid for so that your
neighbor isn't the one getting that
expensive gigabit connection that you're
shelling out money for every month of
course they also use these to block
access if you aren't paying your bills
however so take that as you will it is
possible to spoof a MAC address however
and you might want to if you're
concerned about your privacy on a public
Wi-Fi connection or you connect a new
device to your network that your ISP
might not recognize but be forewarned
that this might not make your ISP happy
depending on who they are actually Who
am I kidding probably doesn't depend at
all does it
