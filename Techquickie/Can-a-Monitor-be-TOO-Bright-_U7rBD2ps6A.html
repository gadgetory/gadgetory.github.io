monitor you probably know that stores
will try to sell you on how more is
better bigger screens higher resolutions
and increasingly more brightness indeed
Apple has recently announced an absurdly
expensive five thousand dollar display
and is touting the fact that it has 1600
nits of peak brightness but why does
brightness matter so much and what the
heck is an it anyway well if you've ever
tried to use a phone direct sunlight
where the screen couldn't get bright
enough then you know that having
sufficient brightness is incredibly
important if you want to make out
details on the screen even if you're
lying in the dark with your phone
turning the brightness all the way down
to minimum can cause certain screen
elements to be much harder to see than
they would be if you turn up the
brightness just a small amount but at
the same time why is brightness suddenly
such a hot selling point now like you
probably don't have very many problems
making out what's happening on your
run-of-the-mill TV set or monitor that
you got a black friday so what's going
on well as visual fidelity has increased
on our displays manufacturers have
sought other ways to enhance the viewing
experience than simply cramming more
pixels onto the screen or making your
TVs and monitors bigger and recently
displays with high dynamic range or HDR
have promised notably better detail than
devices without it you can learn more
about HDR up here but the basic idea is
that HD are capable displays attempt to
show brighter brights and darker darks
than standard displays and HDR sets can
also typically display a wider color
gamut all of which adds up to a crisper
more realistic image but simply
supporting an HDR protocol may not be
enough for you to tell a huge difference
in picture quality in order to bring out
those sharper details and richer colors
that HDR screens promise they need to be
able to hit certain amounts of
brightness this is where those nits come
in which are a measure of brightness
commonly used for electronic displays
many average TVs and monitors can only
get up to a few hundred and its peak
brightness but for HDR content the
general baseline is that you want your
display to be able to hit 1000 nits at
peak for true HDR now 1000 nits is
fairly bright and you might even be
uncomfortable with something that bright
if you're sitting really close to your
monitor like if you're gaming for
example but the idea is that
HDR TV worth its salt will only put out
that much light in certain situations
that is when there's an image on the
screen that needs additional
illumination because certain parts of it
feature bright colors so you probably
won't need to worry about putting on a
pair of sunglasses just to enjoy your
shiny new HDR display and the higher
peak brightness the more versatility the
screen will have to accurately reproduce
more types of visual content in fact
Sony demonstrated a 10,000 nits
prototype 8k TV at the Consumer
Electronics Show in 2018 which by all
accounts delivered fantastic looking
results because of the huge variety of
scenes it could faithfully display and
because under normal circumstances your
screens only going to get that bright on
tiny areas or quick flashes there's even
been interest in going even higher
especially for settings like movie
theaters but how much is too much
I mean apples pricey new monitor claims
a 1000 nits typical brightness meaning
that's what you'll usually be exposed to
as opposed to it being a maximum that
only activates when necessary well the
answer is it really depends on how you
perceive the experience if you're
checking out a high-end display at your
local big box store and it's so
brilliant that your eyes feel
uncomfortable and of course you might
want to pass on it but I would say that
there's nothing wrong with getting the
highest NIT display that your eyes and
your wallet can handle while making sure
you're not spending just way too much
just to get the highest nit count that
you can get on the market today as a
thousand at peak brightness screen
should look good enough to satisfy most
people and just in case you were
wondering the Sun is about 1.6 billion
nits so definitely don't go that high
you'll hurt yourself
