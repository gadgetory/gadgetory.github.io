maybe not the last one but high CPU core
counts are a major selling point for
computers and even other electronics
these days whether you're shopping
online or talking to a worker be at your
local big box store and the idea behind
it is simple higher core counts suggest
more Pawa kind of like
impressive-looking horsepower numbers on
a car but is this always the case well
if you like many tech quickie viewers
are a PC gamer you've probably seen
advice around the web or from friends
that super high-end CPUs with many cores
or hyper-threading on something like a
core i7 won't help you much if at all in
games but why is that with the demand
that current titles put on the hardware
why are people averse to spending more
on a more powerful CPU well the answer
lies in a concept called parallelization
which means splitting a program's
workload across multiple processing
course so a computer can work on two
different parts of the same load at the
same time for example let's say you want
to know what five times four times three
times two is a single core CPU would
first multiply five times four to get 20
then multiply that time three to get 60
and so on and so forth however a
dual-core CPU could assign five times
four to one core and three times two to
the other solve both problems at the
same time and multiply the results
together effectively saving time since
it doesn't matter what order you execute
the instructions in since you're just
telling the CPU to multiply numbers this
math problem is easy to paralyze now
although this is a painfully simple
example it does illustrate how certain
programs can take advantage of multiple
CPU cores because they require lots of
number crunching that can be easily
split up applications for video editing
encryption file compression and even
scientific research such as weather
modeling do lots of calculations that
can be parallelized easily also
computers GPUs are designed for parallel
computing since the same idea holds true
for rendering 3d graphics in a game so
you can learn more about that in this
video but Linus if my graphics card is
designed for parallel processing
why shouldn't I also be getting a CPU
with tons of course well the thing is
that your GPU often doesn't handle much
else other than pushing out frames to
your monitor other important aspects of
games such as artificial intelligence
responding to inputs and telling the GPU
what to render are still handled by the
CPU because of the complexity involved
in processing things like AI and other
forms of game logic and the fact that
many of these code instructions for
these types of things must be done in a
specific order or in reaction to the
gamer they're much harder for
programmers to paralyse and split the
workload especially as many current game
engines aren't designed from the ground
up to take advantage of multiple cores
that said though your mileage may vary
depending on what game you're playing
some games due to variations in the
processes the CPU is handling are more
CPU bound than others and can benefit
slightly from additional course and
since getting games to take advantage of
lots of course is a bit of an unsolved
problem in the industry work is ongoing
to try to figure out how to make higher
end games easier to parallelize which
could ultimately result in cooler more
immersive experiences but for now if
you're just using your PC to game
getting if anything above I'd say about
a 4 core is probably overkill and you're
better off focusing your resources on
well getting cores that perform well
individually for one thing and on other
components of your system
speaking of individual performance do
you wish your internet connection could
perform better
well tunnel bear VPN is not the solution
to that no a VPN does not make your
internet faster but what it does do is
it makes it so that you can tunnel your
internet to a different country up to 20
different ones with tunnel bear and use
online services and websites as though
you are browsing from that country
they've got easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac as well as a Chrome
extension and it is as simple as
choosing the country that you want to be
browsing from you know like let's say
there's a Content block on browsers from
a particular region you're like I want
to see that stuff boom you click the
button tunnel bear encrypts your
connection and makes it appear to all
those services and websites as though
you are browsing from a completely
different place and they take all the
nonsense out of it there's no port
forwarding or DNS configuration or
anything like that and they've got a top
rated privacy policy - the best part
though is you can try tunnel Bayer VPN
with 500 megabytes of free data per
month no credit card required for free
at the link in the video description and
if you decide to upgrade to an unlimited
data account you can actually save 10%
at tunnel bear comm slash Linus so
thanks for watching guys if you liked it
liked it if you just like to dislike it
if you want to check out our other
channels boom boom cool video on channel
super fun right here leave a comment if
you have suggestions for future fast as
possible John really does read them even
though I'm not sure if he replies too
many of them and as always don't forget
to subscribe and follow and all of that
good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
