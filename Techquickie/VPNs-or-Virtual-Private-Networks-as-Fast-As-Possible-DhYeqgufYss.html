short are used today for many reasons
but all of them fall under the same
general umbrella securely connecting an
individual client often a PC to a larger
server a provider now in the past these
types of connections were mostly used in
business settings when a large employer
wishes to allow employees access to a
secured internal network over the
Internet while working from home or in
the field but it's becoming more and
more common now to see them used by even
small businesses or even individuals who
for a range of reasons wish to keep
their activities online secure and
private reasons that range from the
completely understandable to the legally
and or morally gray to the downright
paranoid and delusional now the first
step of the security process for a VPN
involves creating a tunnel protocol
which acts as well a tunnel or conduit
for the information packets being
transferred to pass through it creates a
security layer which instantly
terminates the connection whenever it
detects an intrusion and then reconnects
the client back to the server using a
different route avoiding the compromised
point points or the entire previous
route altogether the next time around
some services even utilize highly
specified routes which they consider to
be lower risk than other ones usually
based on some sort of internally
established metrics or a working
partnership with the operator now inside
this protective hard chocolate tunnel is
where the gooey caramel and nougat
Center or data can be found this data is
also encrypted as one might expect but
on top of this further efforts are made
to ensure that the contents of one's
email don't become public Sonne anyone
mmm beyond standard encryption nonlinear
transfer methods such as utilizing
multiple routes for the traffic or the
introduction of dummy code into the
information packet prevents prying eyes
from seeing anything but a small garbled
slice of the overall pie so to summarize
the way a VPN security works I'll turn
this into a classic analogy it's like a
taco inside a taco within a taco bell
that is inside a KFC within a mall
brainy okay then - if data transfers
happen in basically the same way that
all other internet traffic does while
offering a tremendously higher level of
personal protection and the ability to
access secure networks from abroad then
there's no downside right let's just use
them all the time
well actually basically yeah VPNs are
super cool but come on man these videos
are pretty much a formula at this point
you know the other shoe is going to drop
although some VPN companies have made
utilizing their service as easy as
double-clicking the correct icon and
beginning to surf and they're getting
more affordable than ever some pages and
services might not work correctly over a
VPN and content loading performance can
be affected as well since encryption
efforts coupled with what can be
considered less direct routes can lead
to a slower overall experience in many
cases though this can be solved quite
easily by keeping another stock web
browser installed on your computer for
non mission-critical use and it's also
worth noting that many VPN users
actually report faster speeds on certain
popular sites such as YouTube at peak
times presumably because their traffic
is avoiding some of the congestion seen
along the other traditional routes there
are some other less easily address
problems too though in buildings with
shoddy wiring packet loss can look like
the network is compromised causing the
connection to be continually dropped and
re-established and another is the widely
reported one where the NSA in the United
States has actually been known to flag
accounts for using keywords related to
accessing these services meaning that
seeking out extra security could
potentially open one up to intrusion
speaking of intrusion Dollar Shave Club
you know the guys that walk past you
while you poop kick the door open to
your stall while you poop and bother you
while your nugget mining in poop well
