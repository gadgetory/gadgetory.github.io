tables are in the upright and locked
position and turn off any handheld
electronic devices wait a minute what I
mean I understand why I had to check my
paintball gun but it's my tiny little
iPhone really going to bring down a
Boeing 787 does it really matter if I'm
watching the an excellent recent tech
quickie episode about fax machines as
the plane rolls down the tarmac well to
answer this question we need a little
bit of history the United States Federal
Communication Commission or FCC you know
the same group of folks at the center of
every debate over net neutrality banned
phone calls on planes way back in 1991
when the privileged few that had cell
phones were carrying around things that
looked like this this rule was passed
over concerns that the radio waves
emitted from a cell phone could
interfere with more important radio
transmissions such as communications
between air traffic control and pilots
so that your plane can avoid you know
little obstacles like thunderstorms
mountains and other planes later on as
other types of devices like portable
audio and video players became more
widespread there was further concern
that even devices that didn't transmit
data over the air could interfere with
critical airplane electronics like
Positioning Systems and to be very clear
this was more than the type of idle
paranoia that you'd find at a typical
PTA meeting in fact one passengers
handheld DVD player caused an instrument
in a cockpit to indicate the plane was
pointed in the wrong direction in an
incident back in 1999 with that said
modern aviation electronics or avionics
resist interference far better than they
used to and on top of that there's never
been any definitive evidence linking
portable consumer electronics to an
actual crash
so in response to this reality the
Federal Aviation Administration relaxed
their rules about exactly when
passengers could use their gadgets in
2013 and since then US flights have been
allowed Electronics use throughout the
flight even below 10,000 feet which was
previously banned because takeoff and
landing are the most dangerous segments
of flight where lots of things need to
happen with precision in a particular
order for safe departure and arrival but
the new rule only allows the use of non
transmitting devices so while you can
use an iPad to watch a movie that you've
saved to its local storage you can
forget about a voice call on a cellular
network hence the famous airplane mode
that stops all transmissions to end from
the device but why I mean we're living
in the age of in-flight Wi-Fi for crying
out loud which you can learn more about
here and the FCC has even allocated
specific frequencies to cellular
connections to reduce the risk of
interference with flight why are we
still told not to make a quick call
while waiting on an overpriced cocktail
from the flight attendant well the
answer may be as simple as the powers
that be being fine with the rule as it
is in April 2017 the chairman of the FCC
actually rejected a proposal to allow
cell phone calls on flights because he
the quote valued a moment of quiet at
30,000 feet with the press release not
saying a single word about actual safety
and in Europe passengers are allowed to
use their cellular data
it's just calls that are banned to avoid
annoying other passengers and I guess
there are also those who further
speculate that this could be a case of
government regulators cozying up to
companies who want to charge people for
in-flight communication services we're
not going to get too deep into how true
that may or may not be but now that I
think about it with the lag at
nickel-and-dime by the airlines these
days it wouldn't surprise me that much
if that were true although with that
said it wouldn't surprise me that much
to see a credit card reader on the
lavatory door at some point so speaking
of getting nickel and dimed synergy
doesn't do that synergy is a software
download that solves the problem of
having two keyboards and two mice on
your desk at the same time forget that
stuff just install synergy on all your
computers and share one Mouse in one
keyboard between two or more so you'll
no longer confuse which one goes with
which they offer a basic and a pro
option with a one-time payment for
lifetime access features include things
like clipboard sharing between computers
dragging and dropping files between
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and even the ability to share your
peripherals between different operating
systems seriously you can have like a
Windows a Mac and a Linux PC you just
move your mouse across them it's like
freaking magic so if you want to try out
synergy and save some money check out
the link in the video description now so
