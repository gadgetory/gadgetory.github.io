images with data stored inside them and
you might ask what are you rambling on
about now Linus are you talking about
like crazy magic eye pictures or
something more sinister no actually what
I'm talking about is something very
mundane bar codes those like square
lyonie images found on everything from
cereal boxes to serial killers that
store information in sequences of lines
that can be read and interpreted by
machines but where did they come from
well Norman Joseph woodland inspired by
a conversation that he overheard and
taking inspiration from Morse codes dots
and dashes theorized by shining a bright
light at a series of elongated dots and
dashes then using a machine to read the
pattern of light reflection back to a
receiver remember black absorbs light
and white reflects it one could quickly
read stocking codes for groceries
dramatically simplifying records keeping
and speeding up the customer experience
in one fell swoop well the theory was
solid but in practice while it did work
the first attempt was the size of a desk
and used a 500 watt bulb that got so hot
it could light paper on fire not exactly
practical to deploy for price checks in
the aisles at the local Toys R Us am i
right
but the proof of concept was enough that
when combined with laser technology a 1
milliwatt helium-neon laser in the early
days and more recently the super awesome
disco dance party ones that we all like
yo that's a jar of Marmite from any
angle within a fraction of a second
barcodes became the most efficient way
to quickly read a string of alphanumeric
characters but while all barcodes look
pretty darn similar to the naked eye and
share common features like a start and
end code so they can be read correctly
regardless of orientation there are a
variety of different standards with
different characteristics with UPC being
the most common that encode data in
different fashions and can only be read
by compatible scanners and software so
watch out for that when you're
getting barcodes to itemize your stamp
collection another thing that all
barcodes share is that practically
speaking they are limited to about 20
alphanumeric characters that my friends
is where QR or quick response codes
developed in 1994 come in these consist
of black dots arranged in a square grid
on a white background and they've got a
couple of significant advantages while
the Venerable barcode functions in just
one dimension QR codes work in both the
horizontal and vertical and can hold up
to 350 times the information of a UPC
barcode with finer or higher dpi prints
capable of holding more information than
fuzzy ones on top of that they have
built in error correction making them
less susceptible to damage from water
wear and tear or killer penguins and
this was more relevant before phone
cameras got so badass they are much
easier to read with a camera versus a
specialized reader meaning that throwing
a QR code onto your product will allow a
marketer to direct smartphone equipped
shoppers to see more detailed product
information check out educational videos
and more cool right so what does the
future hold for the barcode though it's
hard to say 40 years of dominance would
suggest that it's not going to be
completely overthrown anytime soon but
that doesn't mean that time is standing
still and 3d codes where height can also
be used to store data already exist but
with the way that 24/7 Internet
connectivity and cloud-based image
recognition are advancing I'd say a more
likely long-term replacement even if
we're still a few years away from it is
simply pointing your camera or looking
forward even further your augmented
reality glasses or contact lenses at
something and having its key stats show
up in your peripheral vision so it'll be
kind of like tinder but for everything
speaking of the future and looking
forward wouldn't it be cool if instead
of like sitting at your desktop computer
at the end of the day and crunching all
of your accounting for your small or
home business you could just do that
stuff while you're on the go with your
smartphone using an online tool that's
always connected oh right fresh books
all the little details about your cash
flow and your business can be kept in
one place with fresh books you can do
things like log your hours I'll show a
full history of each invoice and even
snoop on your clients to see if they
viewed that invoice which at which point
there is no excuse for not having paid
it and billing them through fresh books
via credit card directly so fresh books
is basically the tool that lets you
spend the time doing what you're
supposed to be doing working as opposed
to fussing about with paperwork and you
