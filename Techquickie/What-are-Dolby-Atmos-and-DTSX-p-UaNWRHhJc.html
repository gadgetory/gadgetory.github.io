360-degree virtual reality movies aren't
quite mainstream yet I mean who wants to
strap on the headset every time there's
another disappointing Justice League
movie but at least 360-degree surround
sound has long been a mainstay of not
just movie theaters but home theaters as
well or a typical setup would be a
subwoofer too for bass and 5 or 7
speakers surrounding the viewer to help
the sound well surround the viewer now
traditionally the way this is worth is
that depending on the surround audio
encoding scheme used by the publisher a
device called the receiver would decode
and playback discrete audio tracks for
each speaker that would correspond to
the action on the screen assuming a
high-quality mix so the idea is that if
you're looking at the scene featuring a
conversation the voices will probably be
coming mostly out of the center channel
while the satellite speakers behind you
focus on let's say ambient background
noise this one track for one speaker
paradigm has been powering surround
sound systems for a long time and it's
worked pretty well but we've
increasingly seen a different method of
surround sound delivery both in theaters
and on blu-ray that's actually based
around encoding saliz's objects of
channels the principle behind Dolby
Atmos and DTS X but hold on a minute
sounds as objects okay so it means that
instead of each audio track
corresponding to only one speaker the
tracks are encoded with data that
indicates some location in space instead
of a specific channel so let's say
you're watching a scene where a plane is
flying overhead toward you instead of
for example of the tracks match to the
front speakers getting quieter and the
tracks for the back speakers getting
louder as the plane passes by the
plane's engines will instead be encoded
as a spot in space above you that moves
around in real-time now this may not
sound like too much of a difference but
the idea here is that Atmos and DTS X
scale very well traditional surround
setups had no way of knowing much more
than distance from your couch about the
physical placement of the speakers in
your room so results can be very
inconsistent from setup to setup
because Atmos and DTS X allow sounds to
be coded with location data like above
the listener halfway between the screen
of the chair and against the right-hand
wall rather than just right front
speaker a decoder compatible with these
formats will then take this positional
data and the specific speaker
configuration into account to produce
sound that's more accurately reflective
of where it's supposed to be in space
whether it has five speakers propped up
on two by fours around your computer to
represent this data or fifty
professional-grade loudspeakers in a
large cinema and even includes support
for sounds above you some of the
traditional surround doesn't offer at
most supports up to 118 objects and DTS
X supports an unlimited number of
objects and both technologies can work
with your conventional 5.1 and 7.1
speaker setups with Atmos boasting
support for up to 34 speakers for home
theater now that max sounds excessive
and it probably is but more speakers
will enhance the sense of space and
realism you'll get now as for those of
you who are at the type to install
speakers everywhere you can find an
empty spot on your wall or ceiling there
are a number of upward firing speakers
that reflect off of your ceiling to
simulate a real speaker above you and
you can even upgrade your existing power
speakers just by plopping one designed
to fire upward on top of them we checked
out the sound bar that uses this
technique recently over online as tech
tips and the effect was fairly
convincing of course like with any new
standard not everything is at moose or
DTS X capable you'll need a compatible
receiver though the good news is that
most receivers support both and some
Atmos or DTS X and coda media
fortunately the technology is becoming
more and more common on blu-rays
streaming services and even game
consoles so maybe at some point we'll
feature at most support right here on
tech cookie and envelop you with a
velvety tones of my voice coming at you
from a hundred and eighteen different
angles No no takers at all all right
