this experience there's some much
anticipated triple-a title that's coming
out soon and the game developer drops
this epic looking trailer that makes the
game look like the culmination of
humanity's progress at least as far as
computer graphics are concerned but then
the game gets released and you're left
feeling a little bit like you did after
you ate at Golden Corral drawn in by the
promises of affordable
attractive-looking food but ending up
with nothing but the stomachache you got
after trying out that chocolate fountain
thing so why is it that games often
don't look like their trailers well
companies jazzing up their advertising
to make their stuff seem cooler or more
delicious than it is isn't exactly new
in video game land this often takes the
form of rendering trailer footage using
a completely different engine learn more
about game engines here but the gist of
it is that a game engine is the software
framework the game is created in that
ultimately defines how it will look on
your screen lighting effects physics
textures etc well then what kind of
engines do trailers use isn't computer
graphics rendering pretty much all the
same well no the computer animation
software that would be used on a film
like Avatar which media division handily
listed here is designed for maximum
beauty and detail with I don't want to
say 0 but very little regard for the
resources required to render the scene
to put it in perspective a single frame
of a big-budget movie like Pixar's
monsters you might take hours or even
days to render on a large
multimillion-dollar render farm while
the typical gamer expects 60 plus frames
per second from their $200 video card
from Amazon add to that that the trailer
doesn't need to work with any input from
the player so no AI no collision
detection no camera angle changes no
real-time hair physics the list goes on
and it's not surprising then that they
end up feeling like artsy short films
side projects sometimes
looking at you Final Fantasy with that
said some developers are a little more
honest and do use the game's actual
engine but even in those cases they
often come out looking a lot cooler than
the game itself this is because the
developer has access to graphical
settings modifications that they might
never plan to expose to the end-user for
whatever reason watchdogs and
furthermore for the purposes of a
trailer the developer isn't playing the
game so even if the scene renders super
slowly the frames can be stitched
together into a smooth video to be used
in the trailer later on so even for
trailers labeled actual in-game footage
I only 100% trust them if I can see the
dev on stage pressing the controller
buttons in real time on the subject of
time however as transistor sizes
continue to get smaller and materials
other than silicon should be showing up
on our processors over the next decade
or so the next big leap in home computer
graphics might be closer than you'd
think I mean do you remember how amazing
Toy Story looked in 1995 I can say with
confidence that you could play a Toy
Story game that looks just like that
today that is to say unless you're still
rocking one of those super old graphics
cards with like fighter jets or
attractive cyborg women on the shroud so
bad
speaking of bad you know what's bad
getting home at the end of a long day of
working on painting houses or you know
making cool crafty things that you sell
online or plumbing or whatever it is
that you do if you're a small business
owner and having to sit down and deal
with your accounting crap that sucks and
FreshBooks is on a mission to make
freelancers like you less stressed and
more organized through their easy-to-use
tools for crafting and sending
professional invoices and seconds
tracking your hours so that when it
comes time to create that invoice you

did it for and even accepting payment

the final work all at once it's up to
you the work can be paid for
on your schedule they've even got a
great tool for managing expense reports
the mobile app just lets you take a
picture of your receipts and pretty much
handles the rest getting started on
fresh books is easy even if you're not a
numbers person and you can try it for
free for 30 days by going to fresh books
