notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos you know
how when you use a keyboard for a long
time the letters wear off or you get a
layer of finger dirt so deep you have to
physically scrape your keys well if this
has ever happened to you and you don't
have to admit it I'm sure that what
you've noticed is that it mostly affects
the keys that you're pressing down all
the time like Eeyore enter so I'd be
willing to bet that for most of you one
key that's remained more or less
pristine is scroll lock but what the
heck is scroll lock anyway is it
something people use to keep their
documents secure before books were
invented sorry for that anyway we don't
need to go quite that far back for our
answer but the scroll lock does hail
from a bygone era of computing these
days if you were working on a document
for example you would generally
reposition the typing cursor by moving
your mouse and roll the wheel to scroll
up and down the page but back before
graphical operating systems and mice
were widespread people used the arrow
keys on their keyboards to move their
cursors around or to scroll the page so
the scroll locks purpose was to toggle
their arrow keys between scrolling when
it was on and just moving the cursor
around when it was off so then is scroll
lock still relevant in the era of mice
and fancy gooeys while many people and
keyboard manufacturers are clearly
saying no it's not uncommon to find
keyboards without the scroll lock key
but that doesn't mean that it's totally
useless some modern programs notably
Microsoft Excel still use the scroll
lock key as it was originally intended
turn it off and the arrow keys will
highlight an adjacent cell but turn it
on and they will scroll through the
entire worksheet which can actually
be handy if you're working on a laptop
and your trackpad is terrible there's
also a little-known Windows feature that
makes use of scroll lock if you modify
the registry with this key then hold
right control and press scroll lock
twice you'll get the blue screen of
death cool right
now I'm serious this feature is included
to give advanced users the ability to
look at the contents of the system's
memory which are dumped to a log file
when a blue screen crash occurs finally
if you've got several computers hooked
up to a KVM like in the server room here
at Linus Media Group pressing scroll
lock twice then a number key will
actually switch the input on most of
these types of devices however as you've
probably noticed all of these use cases
are fringe at best so these days the
most common use of the scroll lock is
simply as a free key that can be
remapped for any number of other
purposes some people use it to trigger a
macro or some other special function
during gameplay while others use special
hotkey software that can repurpose
scroll lock as a toggle between two
different virtual keyboards so if you
were looking for a way to finally
achieve your life's goal of having a
dedicated wingdings keyboard without
missing out on desk space for your
regular one this could be the answer or
maybe an alternate Cyrillic or Mandarin
layout would make more sense there's a
ton of different reasons you might want
multiple computers maybe use one as a as
a coding workstation and the other one
for gaming for example but no one likes
having two keyboards and two mice on the
desk it's confusing and it's cluttered
well synergy solves that problem at once
and for all letting you use a single
keyboard and mouse across multiple
computers even if they have different
operating systems all together it works
on Windows Mac and Linux and has great
features including clipboard sharing
dragging and dropping files between the
computers custom hotkeys and more
synergy is available in basic and pro
versions with the latter including s
cell encryption to secure the data sent
between the computers and synergy is
