toughest parts of building a new PC now
we recently covered choosing the right
wattage power supply but today is all
about modular versus non modular
interfaces first a glossary non-modular
means all of the cables are pre attached
and cannot be removed
modular means at least some of the
cables can be stashed away if they
aren't needed and fully modular means
every single cable even the one the
system cannot run without can be taken
off and put somewhere else if you want
to so will kick things off with non
modular power supplies I mean well I
guess there's not much to say the power
comes in from the wall and the wires
connect to other stuff in your system so
it turns on if you have extra cables you
Jam them into a corner somewhere and
call it a day next up is the middle
ground a semi modular power supply unit
why would you want that
well most PC systems use only a fraction
of the connectors that a high
performance power supply can support a
semi modular power supply has the
necessary connectors pre attached and
then lets you pick the other ones based
on your individual needs I'll leave all
the other stuff in the box
right but that didn't really answer my
question Linus you literally just said I
can just jam the extras in a corner in
my case so who cares
you're right there's actually nothing
wrong with that but there are a couple
of reasons you might not want to air
flow and aesthetics with fewer cables
attached to your power supply you can
more easily keep that otherwise
difficult to manage rat's nest of wires
out of the way of your fans where it
will accumulate dust something that
impedes cooling and also just plain
looks nasty not to mention that the
prevailing opinion amongst PC
enthusiasts is that fewer cables just
plain looks better in the first place
okay Linus but what about those fully
modular power supplies a 24-pin
connector is needed for literally every
PC so why would you take it off great
question and normally you wouldn't but
what if you wanted to army your power
supply back to the manufacturer without
them doing all of your careful cable
management BAM
easy power supply swap or speaking of
swapping what if you wanted different
colored cables or a short kit for a
really small case fully modular power
supplies are much easier to do this kind
of thing with but there are some
drawbacks modular power
applies and fully modular ones tend to
be more expensive than their non modular
brethren and they also tend to be a bit
physically longer as well to accommodate
the internal modular interface and
plastic connectors but there's good news
along with modularity more expensive
power supplies have other premium
features like all Japanese capacitors
hybrid fan modes for silent operation
and many other perks so you don't have
to feel like you're just paying for the
ability to like do this how are much fun
that might be now aside from costs and
size there is one disadvantage that's
actually just a big myth that keeps
people away from modular power no myth
not moth
you're not even trying are you anyway a
common misconception is that modular
power supplies are less efficient now
early DIY modular power supplies by
modders or like stores that like did
them and then send them to people
sometimes used connectors that didn't
make sufficient contact and increased
resistance resulting in a drop in
voltage but these days the impact of a
professionally made modular connector
would be difficult to measure without
fairly sensitive equipment and yeah you
could use one of those tests of power
supplied but I really wouldn't recommend
it I meant more like this get up from
Johnny guru.com anyway my point is that
some of the most efficient power
supplies in the world are modular these
days and I wouldn't let that be a
concern at all and sure both ends of
your cables are connected securely again
all that fun and you won't have anything
to worry about
speaking of nothing to worry about don't
worry about missing any more of the
content of this video because I always
do my sponsor spots at the end of our
videos for your convenience you can tune
out now but both my sponsor and I would
appreciate if you hung around to hear
about how coolermaster makes them
absolutely fantastic modular power
supplies that you might want to check
out I mean they have non modular ones as
well but whatever without the help of
our sponsors guys shows like fast as
possible here would not be possible
never mind fast and I'd have to go back
to cleaning the floors of the public
swimming pool change rooms because I
never got enough seniority to get the
cushy lifeguarding shifts true story the
V series from coolermaster in particular
is
really high-quality and worth a look if
you want great efficiency full
modularity and an outstanding warranty
so thanks again Coolermaster for
sponsoring today's episode and thanks to
y'all for watching like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment let me know why you just
liked it so that I can go and eat a bug
for every negative comment that's on
this video I'm not going to do that I'm
not going to eat the bugs although if I
did eat the bugs would you guys all
dislike the video
I'm curious would you want me to have to
eat bugs I think I've lost my train of
thought a little bit here guys don't
forget to subscribe to tech wiki for
more videos like this from us team here
