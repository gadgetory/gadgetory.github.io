ability to fly is it
laser eyes nah man this is computers
we're talking about they're super fast
and great for a complex simulation
script analysis resource exploration
weather forecasting all kinds of amazing
stuff but first a bit of history
according to the authoritative source on
absolutely everything the first
computers are earned the super prix fixe
was designed by Seymour Cray and
released in 1964 it was about ten times
faster than all other computers at the
time and CDC the company for which Cray
worked before leaving to start his own
sold a hundred of them at eight million
dollars each now early supercomputers
well for about thirty years actually I
guess relied on designs with just a few
powerful specialized processing cores
but in order to keep up with the ever
increasing demand for more power the
approach has shifted starting in the 90s
towards many off-the-shelf processing
course with modern supercomputers
containing even hundreds of thousands of
processing cores some of them
traditional CPUs and some of them
actually GP used which can be very
efficient for certain workloads now hold
on a second there Linus questioned CPUs
and GPUs and these things look just like
my gaming rig yes but on a much larger
scale the titan supercomputer has over
18,000 16 core Opteron processors and
over 18,000 Tesla K 20 X GPUs all right
then Linus two more questions how do
they power and cool that sucker and can
it run Crysis power and cooling are
pretty much handled by the system
designer on a case-by-case basis but the
main theme is with as little waste as
possible because a supercomputer can
consume as much power as thousands of
individual homes and cost millions of
dollars a year to operate Titan uses 480
volt electrical power to allow thinner
gauge cables saving about a million
dollars in copper during construction
the IBM aquas our system actually
recycles the water cooling fluid that's
used to cool the processors to heat
buildings
and Intel and three I'm showed off in
inert fluid submerging concept earlier
this year that looks bananas as for
crisis very funny but no most
supercomputers run Linux based operating
systems that are heavily customised to
best leverage the architecture of their
own exact hardware design and to keep
inter system communication as fast as
possible for optimal efficiency this is
what allows these extravagant designs to
work so cohesively to complete a single
task and unlock new computing paradigms
that were impossible or at least
impractical with previous hardware but
high-speed light based interconnects
between ginormous racks of modules isn't
the only way to achieve supercomputer
level performance usually measured in
flops or floating-point operations per
second with the Linpack benchmark if
your work can be broken up into small
chunks to be crunched as part of a
larger project then distributed or grid
computing is another option where each
processor might be in a laptop or even a
phone belonging to an individual that
calculates everything and then submits
the results back to a central system
this is how volunteer projects like
folding at home which allows regular Joe
schmo's to contribute to protein folding
research for Stanford University work
and all it costs for each person is a
few bucks on their monthly electric bill
speaking of your electric bill it's
bound to go up if you sign up for Dollar
Shave Club comm because instead of going
outside and trekking through the snow to
get fresh high-quality razors every
month your post men can do that crap for
you while you sit inside and watch TV
play games or generally don't have to
leave the house Dollar Shave Club
service starts at just a few bucks a
month
and aside from great razors they've got
their one wipe Charlies peppermint
scented butt wipes for men or women I
guess and dr. Carver's shave butter and
aftershave
for the best possible hair removal
experience head over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to join
the club and start shaving time and
shaving money guys thanks for watching
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment
letting me know if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible just like
this one and as always don't forget to
share the video
subscribe and all that good you to be
