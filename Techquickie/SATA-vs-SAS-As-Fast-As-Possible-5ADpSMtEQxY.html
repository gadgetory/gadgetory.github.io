computer used to be a pretty large
production between fiddling with jumpers
master/slave cable select yeah dealing
with weird settings and finding
somewhere to put those ugly ribbon
cables it wasn't exactly straightforward
for the average user nowadays though the
SATA interface has made things simple
almost to the point of making expanding
your storage a plug-and-play experience
can you pick a capacity and speed you
connect the cables in BAM
more space for your Steam library or
your private videos but while you were
combing through all those pages of hard
drives and SSDs you might have noticed
an option to look at something called
that fast drive instead of SATA and
being the intrepid shopper that you are
you clicked on it wondering if this
strange exotic interface could give you
faster load times in battlefront or
whatever then you quickly retreated
after experiencing the sticker shock so
what is this SAS anyway and why the heck
is it so much more expensive than SATA
and could it be worth it for your
personal computer alright so let's go
back to the beginning SAS stands for
serial Attached scuzzy which might sound
familiar to you as there's an older
version called parallel scuzzy and that
was a popular choice for things like
cd-rom drives way back in the day modern
SAS connectors however can be difficult
to find on consumer motherboards even
though they look extremely similar to
SATA in fact SATA drives will work on a
SAS controller so the what is the
difference exactly well SAS can perform
significantly faster than SATA for a
number of reasons one of which is the
bus or the or the communication method
itself the latest revision of SAS
revision 3 if you're keeping score at
home supports up to 12 gigabit per
second transfer speeds that's twice as
fast as SATA 3 with speeds of over 22
gigabit per second expected in the year
2017 SAS also has the advantage of being
full duplex meaning that a SAS Drive can
send
and receive data at the full speed at
the same time SATA drives on the other
hand can only deal with full speed data
in one direction at a time and if you're
interested in a more traditional
mechanical hard drive instead of an SSD
SAS drives often feature much faster
rotational speeds to improve performance
it's actually pretty easy to find 15,000
rpm SAS drives which is over twice as
fast as your typical SATA hard disk
would spin
but then if SAS is so great then why
don't people who build you know even
very high-end home PCs use it much well
it's actually targeted more at the
server market for companies that need
very reliable storage that many many
people are accessing at once so it's got
more durable construction and higher
throughput and support for a large
number of drives on one controller
making SAS a popular choice for
high-capacity servers that need to be
online 24/7 such as for larger
businesses or company websites or
whatever else unfortunately as I've
mentioned before these additional
capabilities mean that SAS drives are
typically much more expensive per
gigabyte than SATA but I mean let's say
you could get your hands on a SAS
capable motherboard like we did recently
in this video would the extra
performance then be worth it well
actually the answer is unless you're
doing some really weird stuff with your
personal gaming rig probably not the SAS
protocol is optimized like I said for
when many users are connected to the
machine accessing data at once meaning
you probably wouldn't see much
real-world benefit if any at all but I
guess it could be an interesting choice
for like a home database server
something like that which probably
probably you aren't doing speaking of
things you probably aren't doing if you
aren't using Squarespace there's a good
chance you aren't building yourself a
simple powerful beautiful website
they've got 24/7 tech support via live
chat and email and you can get yourself
set up with a Squarespace site with all

the cloud for only $8 a month
you get a free domain if you by
squarespace for the year all of their
gorgeous templates feature responsive
designs your website scales to look
great on any device whether it's a
desktop laptop phone or watch actually I
don't think they'd have watched support
yet but I'm sure once we have an
internet browser that's any good on a
watch Squarespace is going to figure
that stuff out they've got a ton of
different features that are included
including every template coming with a
store feature and you can start a trial
with no credit card required and start
building your website today all you got

description and if you decide to go
ahead and keep your Squarespace site you
can use offer code Lynas to get 10% off
your first purchase so thanks for
watching guys if you like this video
like it if you disliked it I'll dislike
it I guess if you want to check out our
other channels we've got a pretty sick
lightsaber battle thing going on over on
channel super fun that's either out
already or coming very soon so don't
miss that and as always leave comments
