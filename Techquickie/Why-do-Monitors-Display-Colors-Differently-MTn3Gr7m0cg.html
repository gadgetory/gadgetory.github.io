see color on our monitors unless of
course all you wanted to do was watch I
Love Lucy reruns but despite the fact
that all modern computer monitors can
display thousands if not millions of
different colors many of us perceive
colors very differently and I'm not
talking about whether or not you spell
it with a u what I'm referring to is how
colors tend to look different on
different monitors something that's very
easy to see if you have a multi monitor
set up with different models of displays
or if you walk into a big box store and
see a bunch of TV's all displaying the
same thing so why does it seem like it's
hard to get monitors to reproduce colors
correctly and consistently well aside
from obvious fixes like adjusting
brightness contrast or even fixing
ambient lighting in your office bedroom
or hacker's then one cause of the
differences between displays is the use
of color spaces the human eye is capable
of distinguishing many millions of
different colors but most monitors can't
reproduce every single one of them
instead they can display a subset of
those colors known as a color space
the default color space for modern
displays is called srgb which is very
widely used by web designers when they
create images and other elements for
webpages srgb can be handled easily by
displays graphics card software etc so
unless you've set your monitor to some
kind of theater mode or told your
computer to use a different color space
srgb is probably what you're using but
higher-end monitors sometimes support
other color spaces such as Adobe RGB
which you'll see on spec sheets if
you're going for a professional-grade
display aimed at graphic designers
although Adobe RGB supports the same
number of colors as srgb the color space
is a bit more spread out
meaning Adobe RGB is popular with
designers who need to work with pure
colors that can be more heavily
saturated color saturation also ties
into bit depth many monitors use 8 bits
per channel meaning that the
intensity of red green and blue is
expressed with an 8-bit value with an
8-bit display you wind up with 255
possible values ranging from pure white
to a completely saturated red green or
blue 10-bit displays by contrast have
1023 possible values meaning that they
can display over a billion colors and
make gradients appear smoother as
opposed to having the like bars on 8-bit
displays but suppose you're not looking
at high-end monitors and are still
baffled why your $150 a pop displays
look so different in this case check and
see if you're looking at an IPS or TN
display at the same time cheaper TN
panels have a much worse viewing angle
than their IPS counterparts meaning that
the colours can appear washed out if
you're not looking at them dead-on
monitors can also vary quite widely in
native contrast which affects how well
they can display black levels meaning
darker colors can be hard to tell apart
on screens with low native contrast and
although we've already gone through more
variables than you did in your high
school algebra class different kinds of
backlighting will also affect your color
you can learn all about how that works
in our video on backlights right up here
of course the human element is also a
factor and just like how some people
need glasses while others have 20/20
vision
we also perceive colors differently from
each other so stay tuned for a follow-up
video on how that works and why it's
actually more of a problem now than it
used to be also thanks to Tyler from
spectra Cal for giving us an assist with
this episode fresh books is on a mission

Dennis's is Dennis is hung yeah anyways
check out this video the channel super
fun video it's cool like this video
liked it dislike it if you're like no
everything looks the same forever
although you might want to get your eyes
checked if that's true because you might
be like super colorblind anyways uh yeah
see you next time
