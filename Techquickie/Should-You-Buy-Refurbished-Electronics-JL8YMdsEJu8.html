the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos when you
hear the word refurbished do you think
of a great opportunity to save money or
a collection of second-hand junk that's
been dropped spilled upon or are
generally mistreated also we always
tackle the tough questions around here
isn't even possible to just furbish
something oh I guess it is anyway these
refurbished goods are a common sight in
pretty much every major gadget store but
what exactly does that term mean well a
good number of these items are returns
from regular customers that could be for
any number of reasons maybe it was a
smart speaker that creepily cackle
ducked them while they were trying to
sleep or a toaster oven that someone
simply had second thoughts about because
they decided to go on a keto diet other
refurbs may have been damaged
not necessarily by consumers but maybe
in shipping when they were originally
sent to a retailer or warehouse and
finally what about demo or floor models
even once they aren't the latest and
greatest anymore
they are usually fully functional and
many stores decide to flip them for a
few bucks the bottom line is that when
you buy refurbished you don't know where
that product has been kind of like a
stray dog or a random tinder date but
that doesn't necessarily mean that your
chances of getting a lemon have to be
higher you see often times new
electronics come right off an assembly
line get packaged up and are shipped out
and in most cases this is fine but
sometimes that brand new shiny that you
just bought might not have had a careful
inspection before it was sent to you by
contrast when a unit marked for
refurbishment is being prepared for sale
by a reputable dealer somebody has to
specifically examine it for functional
or aesthetic defects determine if it can
be repaired and tested so that they know
that it won't generate a costly and
time-consuming return and
in mind that fixing up a product doesn't
usually mean that it was actually
mangled by the previous owner it is so
expensive and complicated to repair
modern electronics that anything beyond
a scratch on the screen that won't
affect performance or an easy
replacement of a defective component or
accessory is beyond the capabilities of
a typical retailer to deal with anyway
of course that doesn't mean that
refurbished products are always going to
be pristine in the case of expensive
items it is possible for more advanced
reworking of parts or products to be
done so you usually see this either if
you buy directly from large-scale
manufacturers or from a very small shop
that specializes in repairing items that
others have written off just make sure
in either case that you are checking the
warranty terms carefully some
manufacturers or stores will warrant
refurbished items that they sell for up
to a year giving you similar peace of
mind to a new item others though might
offer only a month or even as little as
a week and it is common for there to be
no recourse beyond that time if
something goes wrong so that's where
factory certified refurbished items come
in this term or something similar
usually means that regardless of the
warranty being offered that at least the
refurbishing process was handled by the
company itself or an authorized third
party to meet a certain standard of
quality Dell and Apple for example are
notable for trying to restore these
certified products to as close to a
like-new state as possible now of course
for certain kinds of electronics like
new isn't really possible once an item
has been used so we would recommend
avoiding certain things like hard drives
or SSDs or certain types of TVs and
monitors that only have a limited
lifespan those are not worth saving a
few bucks over even if you burn the last
of your dough on like a refurbished car
and speaking of cars are you racing
against the clock as a freelancer it's
challenging but

been more opportunities for the
self-employed and to meet this need
