short is a term that describes any
external effects that disturb electrical
circuits by way of induction or
radiation and while that definition may
have been a bit boring for some rest
assured that the EMP blasts from action
and sci-fi films are coming later so
stay tuned because graphics of extreme
EMI generate angeling nuclear explosions
and like maybe even some fighter jets
are coming for now let's return to the
everyday world with examples you'll be
much more likely to have encountered
when you and your buddy could
accidentally control each other's RC
cars in a race that buzzing humming
sound that you can hear from a speaker
if a nearby cell phone rings or that
bizarre thing where one radio station
can lead right into another so you're
essentially listening to a Mormon
creature and hardcore Punjabi rap at the
same time now these types of interferes
could generally be classified as narrow
band since the trouble stems from to
intended broadcast transmissions that
have essentially become entangled with
each other and while they're certainly
annoying the good news is that they are
easily dealt with by switching between
alternate broadcast channels breaker
breaker one-niner this is line is coming
in with a big ten-four there sir this
channel is for police use only ah anyway
or by shielding conductive wiring that
might turn into an accidental antenna
the second main type of interferes would
be broadband and these kind of suck
things like lightning strikes and
high-voltage power lines are a little
tougher to deal with since the EMI that
they spew out is from copious amounts of
energy and covers many frequencies
something that a controlled and
intentional signal shouldn't do thanks
to the regulatory bodies more on that
later the good news here is that even
broad interferes like lightning won't
interfere with everything and as long as
you're sensitive junk isn't too close to
strike the
Mexico only lasts as long as the storm
so then what is it lioness that we're
all worried about exactly EMI doesn't
sound too bad and yeah actually
naturally it's not but for every
humanity advancing invention from some
like way heavy dude there's a
countermeasure from some butthole to
junk it up jammers can block
communications or under the radar Road
asparagus how to make a video here can
block communications or even radar by
talking over all of the intentional
signals and to deliver on the nuclear
explosions I promised at the top ala
pause here while they throw those in
real quick
the electromagnetic pulse which
accompanies one of these behemoths can
actually be as devastating as the blast
itself instantly frying sensitive
electronics crippling the communications
and responsibilities of those affected
some had even theorized that it would
only take a couple dozen or so these
things detonated in the atmosphere to
essentially wipe out all of the world's
power sources including batteries bomber
so that settles it then right Linus
nothing is safe and we should go back to
living scantily clad in the forest right
wrong well mostly wrong anyway you see
michael faraday certified heavy dude
brought us faraday cages or shields
devices that protect their contents from
electrical disturbances by channeling
them around the exterior in other words
they bounce electromagnetic wave
activity off them and while these
devices sound kind of complex really
they're just a metal or mesh container
you know like the ones on the door of
your microwave and the ones that we
already ship batteries back and forth in
now so you see as long as we continue to
make sure that we don't overload
wireless channels bandwidth like we did
during the release of the first iPhone
be sure to place power sources away from
high-traffic areas and keep potential
supervillains in check through use of
sexy British intelligence agents
everything will be just fine that is
unless of course an unpredictable solar
flare strikes us without warning
speaking of unpredictable solar flares
actually nothing to do with those at all
but they may make you appear to be
brighter as well the service that I'm
talking about is of course lynda.com
with a lynda.com membership you can
watch and learn from top experts who are
passionate about teaching whether it's
like digital photography or video
editing two things that we're pretty
passionate here at - Media Group about
or whether it's business or even just
learning basic office programs like
Microsoft Word you can stream thousands
of video courses on-demand and learn at
your own pace on your own schedule
whenever it is you have time whether
you're trying to you know improve your
ability in some hobby that you do or
whether you're trying to look for a new
job or get a promotion at your
one you can take notes as you go and
refer to them later you can download the
tutorials and watch them on the go
including access on your iOS or Android
device and the best thing of course
about lynda.com actually the two best
things are number one it's affordable it
starts at only $25 a month and number
two if you head over to lynda.com slash
tech wiki you get 10 days for free
unlimited access to decide if lynda.com
is right for you so thanks for watching
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you're feeling some
more complicated than that or you have
the suggestion for a future fast as
possible and as always don't forget to
subscribe and following all that good
stuff so that you get more videos from
us more explosions</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
