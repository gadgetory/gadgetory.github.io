has been on their computer processors
for over 10 years and yet much like the
elusive Fox most people know very little
about what it says let's start with an
analogy let's say I am a CPU and I'm
trying to process food or eat as some
people call it I can only do as much
eating as one mouth can do if I could
add more mouths than I could process
more this is what multi-core processors
do but due to cost constraints among
other things it's not always possible to
take that approach so I've got just one
mouth I can use my hand to pick up the
food bring it to my mouth then grab
another bite while my mouth is busy if I
finish chewing before my hand is ready
to deliver me more food however then my
mouth is just sitting there doing
nothing
if only I could use two hands to prepare
food for my mouth then even though my
mouth can't actually work any faster I
wouldn't waste any time oh wait I can do
that that's hyper-threading one
processor and intelligent scheduling to
make sure that it's always working
pretty awesome right well usually
hyper-threading can't do much for single
threaded workloads where you can only
work on one thing at a time for example
if you wanted to eat a two scoop ice
cream cone you can't work on the bottom
scoop until the top scoop has already
been consumed and heaven help you if you
try to eat the cone first in this
example there is no benefit to adding
more mouths or more hands the opposite
of this would be eating from a bowl of
candies grabbing and eating a red candy
does not in any way depend on finishing
the blue candy that's already in my
mouth in fact if I had some friends to
help me eat it we could consume the
candy very quickly by adding more hands
and more mouths this is an example of a
multi-threaded workload and
hyper-threading can definitely help with
this all right so let's bring it away
from the eating analogy for a minute and
bring it back to the real-world
computing tasks that benefit from hyper
threading and multiple processing cores
are video editing 3d rendering and heavy
multitasking on your PC video editing is
a great example because one frame of a
video can be
well the next one is queued up because
the video is already shot the PC doesn't
have to guess what's going to be in the
next frame it already knows
here's another multitasking example one
processor can be handling your light
tasks like Skype and music playback
antivirus and whatever else you have
running in the background while another
one can focus all its attention on
running a power-hungry video game in the
foreground so with that out of the way
how do you actually choose a processor
for your PC the first thing I hope you
got out of this is that whatever task
manager might say hyper threading is not
the same as doubling your processing
course it's basically a clever trick for
more efficient scheduling of the work
that is done by the processing course
that you have it also increases power
consumption and heat output a little bit
but the benefits usually outweigh this
drawback in the real world you can get
huge double-digit performance
improvements all the way to no
performance improvement at all and in
very rare cases even very slightly
decreased performance depending on how
the software is optimized so it's
important to do your research about the
software you'll be running if the work
you do isn't heavily multi-threaded then
you might do just as well to save your
money and buy a processor that doesn't
have hyper threading most games right
now for example can take advantage of
more than a couple of threads however if
the work you do is heavily
multi-threaded them remember this
general rule hyper threading is better
than no hyper threading but is not
nearly as good as adding more physical
processors in an ideal world lots of
physical processors each with hyper
threading is where it's at speaking of
where it's at audible.com gives you a
free audiobook just for setting up a new
account and if you use the audible.com
slash Linus link below me then it makes
me look pretty good they've got over
150,000 books with everything from
fiction to self-help to business I
checked out the 4-hour workweek by
Timothy Ferriss which is why I am in
Hawaii right now that's right suckers I
recorded this before I left and now I'm
on vacation actually I'm not on vacation
I'm in Hawaii working but you know I'm
taking a few days to not work on there
so you know yeah YouTube's a tough gig
but you can help by heading over to
audible.com

this has been another episode of fast as
possible here on tech quickie don't
forget to subscribe for more videos like
this and if you check out the other link
in the video description you can suggest
future topics for fast as possible and
that is exactly why we're doing this one
about hyper-threading so many people
requested it so we do read them and we
do listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
