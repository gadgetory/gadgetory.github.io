you're super excited to play games at 4k
or watch tech quickie on a screen that's
big enough to let you spot that weird
growth on my chin that sorry anyway so
you plug in your new display but
something doesn't seem right is there
something wrong with it or do you just
need to adjust some dials while it's
true that many new monitors could use
some adjustments called calibration to
look their best defects out of the box
are unfortunately not that uncommon so
what should you be looking for on both
new displays as well as your existing
display after you've been using it for a
while
well one relatively straightforward
thing you can check for is dead or stuck
pixels this is as easy as throwing up a
little application called dead pixel
body on your screen and cycling through
all the different colors looking for any
small points that are black or
displaying the wrong color this can
happen due to defects in the
manufacturing process or even from
touching your screen too roughly if
you've owned your monitor for some time
stuck pixels can sometimes be fixed with
gentle pressure from something soft like
a pencil eraser or with freely available
utilities that flash many colors per
second on the spot where you're stuck
pixel is dead pixels however are usually
dead for good so check to see if your
monitor is still under warranty and what
the dead pixel terms of your warranty
are some manufacturers need like five in
one spot in order to qualify but what if
your pixels all look okay but you're
noticing areas that are strangely
brighter than the rest of the screen
well if these areas are toward the
corners or the edges you could be
suffering from bleeding which doesn't
say blood loss I'm talking of course
about backlight bleeding which happens
because modern flat panel displays with
the exception of Oh loads work by
shining a strong backlight through a
liquid crystal display panel to create
an image oftentimes this backlight is
not
completely blocked from leaking around
the outsides of the LCD by the screen
bezel this results in that backlight
bleed that causes that lightness around
the edges now I do have some bad news
about backlight bleed and that is that
the best way to avoid it is simply to
buy a higher quality display with higher
manufacturing standards as there's
pretty much nothing you can do to fix it
yourself
although some intrepid do-it-yourselfers
have tried dismantling their monitors
and sealing the edges of the LCD with
electrical tape but if you have an IPS
panel make sure that you are not
confusing backlight bleed with an effect
that many have called IPS glow this is a
glow that's present on some parts of IPS
screens especially when you view dark
images at an off angle and it actually
is a result of the way that IPS
technology works so moving back from the
screen a small amount or looking at the
screen dead-on by moving your head to
the side rather than turning to the side
should mostly solve this problem and
tell you whether you're dealing with IPS
glow or backlight bleed and the only way
to avoid IPS glow is to make sure that
you read user reviews and see if other
people are complaining about excessive
glow on the model that you're looking at
okay then what if you've got light
splotches on your screen that clearly
aren't backlight lead or IPS glow and
look worse when your screen is very dark
this one is called clouding and is
usually a result of a physically damaged
screen that was stored or transported
improperly there isn't much you can do
about it once it happens so make sure
you're handling your display with care
or get a prompt replacement if your
monitor is new which leads us finally
speaking of things you can't reverse be
aware of this one to burn in which can
happen if you display the same static
image on your screen for a long long
time you'll see this often in public
places like restaurants or airports that
often have things like a channel logo
burned into the corner of the screen or
a grid that has constantly changing
information in
the cells but not in the lines
themselves
now although burnin is less common on
modern flat panels than on older CRTs
and can sometimes actually be fixed in
more moderate cases long-term burnin can
still permanently damage your monitor so
unless you want to see the ghosts of
computing sessions passed every time you
sit down in front of your display it is
worthwhile to turn it off when you're
not using it or at the very least run a
screen saver so I hope this summary
helped but I also don't want to scare
you guys because even with the army of
problems that you can face as a monitor
owner most of them can be avoided simply
by doing your homework before buying
returning defective units on time if
there is a problem and by taking care of
it after you buy it
after all I shouldn't have to tell you
guys not to have cat agility contests or
BB gun fights in the same room where you
keep your thousand dollar ultra-wide
though of course if you are the kind of
person who doesn't know those kinds of
things on their own maybe you should do
