car or even a really fancy coffeemaker
anything with a microprocessor needs
some kind of operating system in order
to do anything more useful than sit
there and look pretty but what do they
do exactly well in a nutshell an
operating system is a piece of software
that acts as a liaison between the
system's Hardware through some other
software bits called the kernel and
drivers and the software applications
through which the user that's you
interacts with the aforementioned
hardware and while all operating systems
have on a fundamental level the same
objectives protecting users security by
preventing malicious code from
exploiting your hardware allocating
system resources like memory to complete
the user's required tasks as efficiently
as possible and in the case of more
complex ones providing a platform on
which compatible programs can run and
interact with the user be it through a
keyboard touchscreen or even a steering
wheel there are two fundamental ways
that these tasks can be managed let's
start with an example that you're likely
to find in your pocket no not that your
phone if you're a caveman it's possible
that you're still using a single tasking
operating system these as you might have
cleverly figured out are only capable of
running a single program at a time which
is one of the reasons you couldn't
browse your contacts while playing games
on your old Nokia brick hold on a second
- I remember when my snake high score
run was disrupted by a pesky phone call
from my mother isn't that kind of
multitasking
actually that's called an interrupt in
all operating systems even single
tasking ones override less important
functions when their environment changes
so a real-world example of this would be
if a simple operating system like the
one on your fancy coffee maker stock a
brewing cycle to give the user an alert
to change the filter to a DRM approved
one or here's a good analogy if a car
came barreling through the front of your
house while you were cooking
your brains operating system knows only
one of those things can be dealt with at
a time so it tells you to turn off your
cooking elements it saves the
in-progress
state of your meal in your memory so you
can come back to it later and then tells
you to focus on all the screaming
burning people and you're living in
until you can return to it so now let's
move on to modern multitasking operating
systems like Android and Windows these
use a process called time sharing to
split resources allowing more than one
thing to be done at once or so it would
appear let's use our human brain analogy
again where this time the door bill and
your phone
both ring at the same time both tasks
with similar priority rankings that
cannot be completed one at a time
without ending up with a voicemail or a
package delivery notice on your door so
you answer your phone and say hello just
a second you open the door to find out
it's a sexy DHL driver continue your
phone conversation while the courier
prepares the paperwork then you sign for
the package close the door and continue
your conversation if you're honest with
yourself you haven't really devoted your
full proper attention to either of these
tasks but by regularly scheduling
interrupts remember that word from
before - each of these tasks you can
devote resources as needed to each of
them so they appear to be being
completed at the same time and
multitasking operating systems work in
much the same way but of course this
video mostly ignores the actual topic I
meant to address when it was originally
scripted which is what are some of the
different types of operating systems and
how do they differ so let me know in the
comments below if that's something you'd
like to see speaking of things you might
want to see my face after I shave with
Dollar Shave Club razors
Oh what you want me to actually tell you
what Dollar Shave Club is like that
thought it was pretty self-explanatory
at this point you get razors and other
bathroom supplies shipped directly to
your door for only a few bucks a month
they're high quality products for way
less than what you would pay at the
store so they got the razors they got
the dr. Carver shave butter which goes
on clear they got their one wipe
Charlies which are peppermint scented
face wipes just kidding they're for your
butt wipes for men they've got their
post shave moisturizer and travel sizes
as well there's a variety of razors all
the way up to the six blade executives
and did I say executives no no we don't
have six blade executives here just six
blade executive razors so there's no
vibrating handles or other nonsense like
that just high-quality razors and head
over to dollarshaveclub.com slash Lynas
to sign up and join the club it's
available in the US Canada Australia and
New Zealand so that's pretty much it
guys thanks for watching like this video
if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it blew chunks leave a comment
if you have suggestions for future fast
as possible tuned as always don't forget
