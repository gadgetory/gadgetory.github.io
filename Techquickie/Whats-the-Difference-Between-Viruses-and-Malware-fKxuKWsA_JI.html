malware and spyware a lot more than
virus making the latter conjure memories
of Windows 95
AOL CDs and Jeff Goldblum taking down an
alien mothership so why is that what
qualifies something as a traditional
virus as opposed to the more recent
malware designation and our virus is
still around great question to
understand what a virus is we'll start
with a look at the original biological
meaning of the word biological viruses
like the ones that can make you sick are
parasitic they inject their own code in
this case either DNA or RNA into a host
cell as a means of replication this code
causes the cell to make a ton of copies
of the virus and ultimately burst
sending new viruses everywhere rensen
repeats computer viruses operate via a
similar principle unlike some forms of
malware which are fully executable
programs viruses tend to be smaller
pieces of code that confused with other
programs or files and only replicate
when conditions are right so they can be
triggered by a certain date and time
opening a certain program or even
hitting a certain amount of disk usage
of all things
after a virus is triggered it will try
to copy itself and spread infecting
other files and programs along the way
sometimes over a network and just like
real viruses these virus copies can be a
little different from the original
making it hard for antivirus software to
eliminate them similar to how the many
variants of the cold virus make it
difficult to create a vaccine for some
even come encrypted making detection
even more complicated of course viruses
biological or digital wouldn't be a
problem if all they did was just copy
themselves but just like the chicken pox
virus will make you sick a computer
virus can contain a payload that will
cause some kind of effect which could be
anything from just displaying a joke to
permanently corrupting your important
data these days viruses can trigger DDoS
attacks which you can learn more about
up here by infecting lots of computers
and getting
all to attack a specific server at once
and since these annoying effects can be
caused by other types of malware many
people have used the terms virus and
malware interchangeably but this is
incorrect for example the famous I love
you attack back in 2000 was caused by a
standalone script or program disguised
as a love letter and sent out via email
attachment so because it emailed itself
to other people in the victims contact
list rather than relying on inserting
itself into other programs to spread
there was no host program that I love
you infected it would be more accurately
referred to as a worm rather than a
virus and indeed many modern forms of
malware like ransomware and adware are
also standalone programs that can be
passed around and executed on their own
meaning that they aren't really viruses
which doesn't mean though that true
viruses aren't still around causing
mayhem and the ill effects they can
cause are only really limited by the
creativity the black hats programming
them have things like logging keystrokes
to steal your financial data and
attacking corporate networks as a
destructive form of protests are just
the tip of the iceberg so what can you
do well even though modern viruses tend
to spread over the Internet unlike the
old days where they were mostly spread
around bypassing corrupted floppy disks
and flash drives around what hasn't
changed is the importance of having
strong up-to-date antivirus software
installed to help prevent accidental
exposure after all when risk of viral
infection is on the line you always want
