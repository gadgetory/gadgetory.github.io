the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so I would
argue that it's healthy to be a little
concerned about the people who follow
you around online be it the government
unscrupulous advertisers or maybe your
crazy ex who swear she'll never love
another man hmm but even if you've taken
all of the obvious precautions including
hiding behind seven proxies browsing
only in the incognito mode hole drive
encryption and stationing an attack dog
outside of your computer room
unfortunately there might still be in
the Sidious hole in your defenses that
could expose a fair amount about you I'm
talking about DNS leaks and if you don't
know what the DNS is you can check out
our other video right up here on how it
works but simply put is the system that
matches web addresses you enter like
youtube.com to numerical IP addresses so
that your web browser will know which
site to bring up now typically whenever
you try to visit a new website your
computer will ask a DNS server
maintained by your ISP for its IP
address now this means that your ISP
knows which size you're visiting which
normally wouldn't be an issue but if
you're doing something sensitive you may
not want your ISP to have this
information especially if they're
logging it indefinitely or much worse
selling it to third parties oh but come
on John that's amateur hour stuff I use
a VPN that I pay actual money for so I'm
totally safe right well maybe not
depending on how your VPN is configured
it might be using a secure encrypted
toll to connect you with the websites
themselves but the DNS requests to help
you navigate to those sites might still
be going to your ISPs DNS server now
this is because some operating systems
and windows is notorious for this will
rely on whatever DNS server it is saves
as the default so if this is your ISPs
it might completely ignore the fact you
have a VPN running and send all of your
browsing requests to your ISP anyway now
they won't see exactly what pages are
visiting or the contents of a message
you type but they can build a shockingly
robust profile of your online life based
on just this information alone
so how can you plug these pesky leaks
well if you are using a VPN you trust
the most straightforward way is to
enable its anti DNS leak which will
encrypt and route all DNS requests to
their servers instead of your ISPs
after turning this setting on you can
test it at a site that checks for any
remaining leaks to see if it's
functioning properly and won't put a
link to one of those sites down in the
video description and even if you're not
using a VPN you can still route DNS
requests through different servers if
you don't trust your ISP there are a
number of public DNS servers out there
that you can find with little research
two of the more notable ones are run by
Google and CloudFlare to set this up
just bring up your ipv4 settings under
Ethernet properties and windows and
enter the IP addresses of the DNS
servers you'd like to use though Windows
8 and 10 users should note that a new
feature called SMH and are that's a
mouthful anyway well it could still
route your request through your ISP so
we've linked a plug-in that can disable
it in the video description if you're
using a VPN and well-regarded public DNS
servers can have other benefits for
example google claims that their service
only keeps logs of user's IP addresses
for 48 hours before deleting them
provide speed improvements in many cases
and encrypts your DNS requests as well
of course no matter who you use you're
still trusting essentially some Rando
just not your ISP to be respectful with
your privacy so read their privacy
policies thoroughly you don't want to
spring a leak somewhere else or else
your requests for privacy will end up
feeling kind of like a boat ride and a
pasta strainer and speaking of racing
across the lake and a pasta strainer are
you racing against the clock as a
freelancer it's challenging but with the
growth of the Internet there has never
been more opportunities for the
self-employed to meet this need check
