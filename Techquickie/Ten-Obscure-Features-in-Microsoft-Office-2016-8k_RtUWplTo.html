the words Microsoft Office periodically
pulling upward to pretend you're writing
this video finding that exciting new
PowerPoint transition that will surely
keep your audience's attention your
brief love affair with Clippy whose time
in this world was cut so tragically
short
well Microsoft sponsored this video and
asked us to pick out some new stuff to
think of from Microsoft's latest
offering office 2016 which has a lot of
tweaks that you might not be aware of in
addition to those cute little
backgrounds up on the title bar starting
off office now offers a real-time
collaboration feature similar to what
you'd see on Google Docs so if you're
working on a group project and needed a
more powerful word processor word will
let you see what everyone else is typing
as it happens or just how much chad is
slacking off because he figures the rest
of you are going to get them in easy a
speaking of impressive looking projects
office 2016 offers new chart styles if
you've gotten tired of the Plain Jane
bar pie and line you can now create tree
map and sunburst style charts which are
becoming increasingly common for large
datasets on sites like Wikipedia and
read it
there are also map charts that allow you
to highlight countries or states in
different intensities according to
whatever metric you like like population
income or a number of tech quickie
subscribers and even the basics got a
facelift Excel 2016 features a
forecasting tool for line charts to make
future projections based on past trends
I mean it obviously can't project
game-changing occurrences in the future
like a sudden stock crash or your
decision to go on a diet if you've been
using Excel to track the costs
associated with your Mountain Dew
consumption but it does use a standard
algorithm to keep things realistic and
if you're devising your own algorithms
for something like math or economics
class well the ink to math feature in
OneNote 2016 allows you to scribble
formulas and equations with a tablet pen
and then convert them to actual computer
readable expressions then whether it's
basic algebra or calculus it can
actually even solve them for you there
are some more ink features too like
editor which enables striking through
words to delete them circling words to
select them and replaying sketches that
you made with your tablet pen enabling
others to see animations if you'd rather
express an idea that way and for those
not using Windows ink there are a number
of other interesting cross-platform
features like the ability to use vector
graphics that look great at any size
directly in office applications built in
background removal for photos and new
icon sets that provide a slicker
solution than copy pasting icons from
other programs or just using wingdings
all the time for everything and on the
subject of putting interesting visuals
into your office documents PowerPoint
now has a feature that lets you screen
record any portion of your display and
then insert it directly into your
presentation this is handy for
demonstrations or tutorials and
QuickStart can actually pre fill a
presentation on lots of different topics
potentially saving you time that you
would have spent hunting down basic
facts and coming up with an overall
outline just make sure that that's not a
shortcut that your teacher or professor
would frown upon
and speaking of frowning you certainly
wouldn't be if you were using office on
the HP Pavilion x360 15 a new pen and
touch enabled two-in-one or sec call it
a foreign one but so it's got laptop
mode stand mode tent mode and tablet
mode it's a versatile solution for work
home or working at home or as I like to
call it homework in fact
speaking of homework students can save
10% on the Pavilion x360 15 right now at
the Microsoft Store both online and at
any brick-and-mortar location speaking
of physical versatility that and a
student discount aren't the only
highlights the Pavilion x360 15 also has
it where it counts with the seventh
generation Intel Core i5 processor and a
one terabyte hard drive under the hood
