cooking up malicious software to do
stuff like steal your precious data the
security industry has been thinking up
creative names for their little schemes
Trojans worms ransomware you get the
idea but one of the most sinister forms
of malware prevalent today is the
dreaded rootkit and a little to the
laymen this sounds like some kind of
dental procedure an actual rootkit on
your PC can be far more unpleasant but
then what exactly are they and why can
they be even more problematic than other
types of computer infections great
question like with a lot of the other
threats to your system the name rootkit
reveals a lot it's derived from the
concept of root access in the operating
system Unix which allows a user broad
permissions to change files and settings
and while the means by which different
rootkits access to usually off-limits
parts of the computer differ all rootkit
serve the same general function to
conceal either their own presence or the
presence of another piece of malware so
that it can carry out its nefarious
deeds on your system without you ever
knowing and it's because of this
concealing behavior that root kits are
often very difficult to remove as many
users in the mid-2000s found out when
they realized Sony had shipped a metric
but ton of music CDs with root kits
designed for you guessed it copy
protection these root kits hid the DRM
software which limited what users could
do with their optical drives and also
caused serious system slowdowns and
introduced a ton of security flaws that
other malware creators were able to take
advantage of and then when Sony finally
released a removal tool after news of
the rootkit went viral
all it did was cause even more issues so
how do root gets hide themselves anyway
while some root kits just inject
themselves into your programs somewhat
like traditional computer viruses the
more dangerous forms run as part of your
operating systems kernel no not the
chicken guy but the core
part of your OS that allows your
programs to communicate with your
hardware through things like device
drivers since drivers usually run in
kernel mode many root kits disguise
themselves as drivers which is why you
should only download drivers from
trusted sources like the manufacturers
website no matter how badly you want to
get your fancy new graphics card working
what makes kernel-mode rootkits so
insidious is that they essentially
appear to be a part of the OS itself
meaning you can't really trust your
antivirus program to detect it or
anything else your system says about
itself for that matter and as if that
weren't bad enough other kinds of root
kits even go beyond infecting your OS
kernel by doing things like
contaminating your hard drives boot
sector often done to break encryption or
getting into your systems firmware such
as your motherboard or GPU bios if that
happens not even completely reformatting
your PC will help
well Linus that all sounds pretty darn
awful if I don't even know I have a
rootkit how can I get rid of them that
admittedly is a challenge larger
organizations have tried strategies like
logging suspicious access requests
through a firewall or dumping everything
in a systems memory to look for
malicious code but these aren't the
kinds of things a home user can easily
do modern motherboards with UEFI BIOS
have some features to block rootkit such
as secure boot but this solution has
been criticized for keeping a user from
doing legitimate things like installing
multiple operating systems so while some
simpler root kits can be detected and
removed by your favorite anti-malware
program the best counter strategy is to
just be super careful about what you
download speaking of things to be
downloaded why don't you download some
knowledge to your brain
little bits lets everyone use
electronics as modular building blocks
their modules snap together with magnets
so you can create circuits in seconds
it's perfect for kids parents big kids
yo coders hardware hackers makers
artists designers engineers
and students in with little bits you can
even get your dog to like send text
messages or make a robotic snack server
so why buy electronic toys and gadgets
when you can literally invent them the
modules range from very simple you know
power sensors LEDs to very complex with
Wireless and programmable modules and
there's over 60 modules that can be used
in a vast number of creative
combinations and better yet little bits
is offering new customers
20 bucks off their first kit and free
shipping anywhere in the continental US
all you got to do is go to little bits
comm slash tech quickie
that's little bits cop slash tech
quickie I don't know why that's in there
twice and go ahead and get 20 bucks off
whoo after you make something actually
puffed send me an Instagram or better
yet tag me on Twitter because I'm more
likely to check that I would love to see
it so thanks for watching guys if you
liked the video do that thing if you
disliked it do the other thing
check out our other channels we've got a
great video on channel super fun right
now it's like part two of the nerf
battle the fire department shows up so
definitely not gonna want to miss that
and also leave a comment under the video
if you have suggestions for future
passes Possible's don't forget to
subscribe and follow and all that good
stuff see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
