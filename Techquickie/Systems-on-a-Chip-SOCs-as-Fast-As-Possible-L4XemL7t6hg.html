this episode of fast as possible
I saw the folder name for the project
and I asked John what is a
system-on-a-chip and he replied I'm glad
you asked it's all in the script we're
about to go over so uh here we go then
we are now in an era where a lot of us
expect the smartphones we carry around
in our pockets to do most of the things
a PC can I mean the Samsung Galaxy even
has a setting for multisample
anti-aliasing so your mobile games will
look nicer but given that flagship
phones are much smaller than even the
most compact pcs how have they grown
from novelties that can't even
copy/paste to do it all devices in only
about ten years well much of the growth
has been driven by advancements in
systems on a chip commonly called SOC s
well hold on a second Linus my phone
isn't a system on a chip it has a screen
and buttons in a case with rhinestones
on it well when I say system I'm talking
about all the crucial innards that a
phone or a tablet needs to function like
processors memory and storage and i/o
controllers and if you've ever built or
upgraded a desktop PC what you'll know
is that for the most part these
functions are all handled by different
components that you have to either
physically install separately or are
installed separately on something like a
motherboard and SOC by contrast
integrates multiple or even all of these
functions into one piece of silicon
that's the same size or even smaller
than a conventional CPU but how can all
of this stuff fit onto just one chip
well remember that because phones and
tablets are mobile devices that spend
most of their lives running off of a
battery a lot of the components inside
have to suck less power and produce less
heat I mean a phone with a 10-minute
battery life that feels like a hot stove
top would
do you much good would it so this means
that manufacturers have to save energy
somehow which usually translates to less
powerful components with fewer
transistors which makes them physically
smaller but just because components on
an SOC don't pack the punch of their
desktop PC counterparts doesn't mean
that they're bad in fact many mid-range
and higher-end SOC a very smooth
performance in part because their CPUs
use the ARM architecture which runs a
smaller simpler instruction set to make
processing easier though perhaps less
versatile and you can learn more about
arm CPUs in this video and because
mobile apps and operating systems like
iOS and Android are written for these
CPUs that means that you're not waiting
around three times longer for your phone
to do something even though your SOC
might be several times less powerful
than your desktop rig and if you're an
Apple fan there SOC s take the concept
of less is more even further because
unlike android SOC s which have to work
with tons of different devices and
brands apples SOC s only need to work
with their own hardware and their own
software so iOS has been further
optimized to run well on Apple chips
that are at times less impressive
sounding than their Android equivalents
on paper for example the new Apple a 10
SOC inside the iPhone 7 is the first
quad-core chip we've seen in an iDevice
when androids have been available with
eight core chips for years now and we're
even seeing the same integration concept
in desktops it's not limited to SOC s
although pcs aren't packing everything
from ran to LTE communication logic onto
the die or even the package for that
matter and the trend towards this goes
back decades even with Intel being the
first to move the cache which used to be
an external chip that you plugged in
onto the CPU and a
these more recent integration of the
memory controller into the CPU die which
used to be a separate chip on the
motherboard called the Northbridge this
might have seemed at first glance like
they were just increasing the CPUs
complexity for the sake of it when we'd
rather just have a bigger more powerful
CPU and keep all that stuff off board
but in reality the reduction in cache
and memory access latency from getting
them closer together more than
compensates for the wasted die space and
additional cost and this is even true of
onboard graphics with better on chip
GPUs now being pushed as an all-in-one
solution for light to moderate gaming as
we've seen with Intel's iris pro
graphics and AMD APU series not quite
the same as a full fat graphics card but
who knows with the way things are going
maybe one day we will have entire
systems the size of a postage stamp or
you know failing that even just a modern
CPU that can max out crisis speaking of
postage stamps ah Thank You Internet we
hardly ever need those anymore and
thanks to the growth of the internet
there have never been more opportunities
for the self-employed and to meet this
need freshbooks is excited to announce
an all-new version of their cloud
accounting software it's been redesigned
for the way that you work and it's the
simplest easiest way to be more
productive more organized and most
importantly to get paid faster you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds that's
right less than the time it takes to
watch this integration you can set up
online payments with just a couple of
clicks and get paid up to four days
faster by snail mail and you can see
when your client has seen your invoice
and put an end to the guessing games and
the excuses and freshbooks is offering a
30-day unrestricted free trial to our
viewers so to claim it all you got to do
is go to fresh book stock comm slash
tech quickie and enter tech clicky in
the how did you hear about us section
