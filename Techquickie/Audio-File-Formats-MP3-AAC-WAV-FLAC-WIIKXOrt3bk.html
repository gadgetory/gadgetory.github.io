you get your 256 AAC on iTunes be your
lossless FLAC on title well if you're
one of the two dozen people that has a
title subscription edit if you're into
music it might seem like they're just
way too many audio formats to choose
from can't we all just use mp3 wrong no
we can't there's a very good reason for
all of the madness different audio
formats make things more optimized for
different types of users electronic
music artists home theater enthusiasts
or just straight-up basehead let's start
by looking at common formats used by
average listeners mp3 AAC and Vorbis
these all store audio using lossy
compression which means these formats
are often defined by the fact that they
discard some information from the
original audio source well hold on now
is that like an mp3 of don't fear the
reaper doesn't include the cowbell
not exactly you see most people simply
can't hear much of the information in
the uncompressed audio files you'd find
on a retail CD we're talking sounds that
are so low in volume so high in pitch
are so close in time to other sounds
that the vast vast majority of people
can hardly perceive them so lossy
formats just cut them out oh and they
also save space by using a different
bitrate
you see when a song gets digitally
recorded in a studio the recording
equipment takes samples of the analogue
sound waves coming out of a guitar or a
singers mouth and stores them as digital
bits just standard ones and zeros on an
uncompressed CD the audio you hear is
typically stored at a bit rate of 1411
kilobits per second but lossy
compression discards a lot of these bits
to make the file often many times
smaller
for example a four minute uncompressed
song that takes up about 42 megabytes
would only be about 8 megabytes as a
relatively high
256 kilobits per second mp3 and although
mp3 is probably the most familiar lossy
format others are widely used for
different reasons such as AAC which
pitches higher quality at lower bit
rates due to a fancy compression
algorithm and OGG Vorbis which is
completely open-source and patent free
unlike mp3 but some folks aren't
satisfied with the level of quality you
get with lossy audio especially audio
files who want to get the most out of
their high-end headphones and speakers
and instead they turn to formats like
black or a lack which offer lossless
compression these files contain all of
the original audio data but with smaller
file sizes if that sounds like magic
it's not lossless compression is
accomplished by looking for ways to more
efficiently store redundant data so this
string would be expressed this way
instead and by predicting what sound
should come next lossless codecs can
store only the difference between the
predicted data and the actual data which
takes up much less space and because
formats like flack and a lack are
specifically designed for audio they can
compress sound clips much more than
general-purpose compression schemes like
zip in fact a typical audio file with
lossless compression will only take up
about half as much space as an
uncompressed equivalent and if you're
wondering about the difference between
flack and a lack you'll need to use the
latter if you want to listen to lossless
music in iTunes and yeah that's about it
but there are also other lossless codecs
like Dolby true HD and DTS HD master
audio for both home theaters and
commercial multiplexes that have proved
popular with movie studios so look out
for these logos when you're out buying
blu-rays if you're a home theater
enthusiast even more interesting is
Dolby Atmos which encourse each sound in
a movie soundtrack spatially meaning it
can scale to a huge number of speakers
because the audio is mapped in space
instead of being coded for just one
speak
you can learn more about that right up
here but despite the popularity of
compressed formats keeping audio and
uncompressed form does have its
advantages uncompressed files stored in
wav or AF format are not only compatible
across a huge range of devices because
they undergo very minimal processing
from the original audio signal but they
also contain all of the information that
was originally converted from analog to
digital they're easier for audio editors
and creators to fine tune as much as
they'd like all of that being said at
the end of the day if you just like
listening to music pick a format that
you think sounds good or whatever the
format the music already comes in and be
sure not to judge other people too
harshly because their library is full of
128 kilobyte rips from YouTube the
racing against the clock is a freelancer
challenging yes but with the growth of
the Internet there's never been more
opportunities for the self-employed to
meet this need check out fresh books
