videogames is the total angular extent
of any scene that can be viewed on the
screen at any given moment got that
great thanks for watching give us a
like' or dislike' share comments okay
maybe I should explain it a bit better
than that now your own eyes assuming
your human can see almost 180 degrees of
the world out in front of you but a
monitor huge enough to take up your
entire field of vision would be really
really impractical for a variety of
obvious reasons so if you're sitting a
normal distance away from a reasonably
sized screen it will take up something
like thirty or forty horizontal degrees
of your vision but if the camera within
a first-person video game is set up to
show only 40 degrees of the game world
well that's a bit of a problem
you've got no peripheral vision some
first-person video games that I've
played certainly do suffer from this
tunnel vision effect which is pretty
terrible when there are people shooting
at you that you can't even see also a
narrower field of view causes many
gamers to feel nauseated while playing
because camera movements are more
exaggerated alright so here's the other
extreme now we're on a GoPro Hero 3 Plus
which has something like a 170 degree
horizontal field of view so even if the
screen you're watching this on takes up
only 40 degrees of your vision you can
still see 170 degrees in this scene here
this definitely solves the tunnel vision
problem but it's not a perfect solution
first of all everything on screen is now
smaller and therefore more difficult to
see secondly with extremely wide angle
views you get this funny sort of
distortion that occurs around the edges
of the scene so how do gamers solve this
problem one way is to add more screens
but then of course you have to go buy
more screens and maybe a monitor stand
and then maybe a better graphics card to
help you render out all those pixels but
that's an expensive way to go another
option is to change the field of view or
fov slider within the game to whatever
is most comfortable for you however some
games don't have this option so why
would a game developer leave that out
well one reason is the dreaded cps or
console port syndrome for a console game
you're you
really going to be sitting farther away
from the screen so a narrower field of
view looks and feels more natural even
if it does result in tunnel vision it
also requires less processing power
widening the field of view puts more
objects on screen which makes the game
more demanding for your little console
to render so console games are often
made without a field of view slider to
optimize performance and so the ported
PC version sometimes doesn't get one
either and that's a real shame you know
what else is a real shame my lack of
beard in this episode you see I've
received a number of really lovely
comments telling me to shave my beard
