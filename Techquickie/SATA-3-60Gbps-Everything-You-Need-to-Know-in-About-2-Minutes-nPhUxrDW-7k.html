of one minute or less we're going to
tell you everything you need to know
about the third-generation serial ATA
interface also known as SATA 3 SATA 3 is
not technically the correct name for a
third-generation SATA drive this can
cause some confusion especially because
the second-generation interface operated
at 3 gigabit per second so to say 2/3
refer to the data rate or the generation
most people think of it in terms of the
generation so if you use it that way
people will generally know what you're
talking about determining if your
storage device supports SATA 3 is easy
all you got to do is check for a large
SATA 3 label on the box check the
manufacturers website or in the cases of
things like motherboards you can look
for the little label on the PCB itself
finally if you're having trouble with
that or if you have a laptop where you
can't see it clearly you can download HW
info 32 for free and find out what speed
your SATA ports are running at
installing SATA 3 devices is simple all
you got to do is power down your
computer plug the power and the serial
ata data cable into the drive and the pc
itself and you're ready to go you don't
even need to worry too much about what
generation of SATA device you have
because if they're not all SATA 3 it
might be a little bit slower but the
standards are forwards and backwards
compatible so the devices will work
together thanks for checking out this
episode of one minute or less we'd love
