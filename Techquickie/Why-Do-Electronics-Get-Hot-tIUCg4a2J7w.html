thinks the size of a small child PC
enthusiasts have been looking for ways
to keep their rigs from turning into
little mini ovens or large ovens as it
were for a very long time and even
people who aren't tech heads have had to
fight smart phones game consoles or even
televisions that get too hot but while
there's plenty of discussion online
about how to set up the most effective
cooling solution a question you don't
often see asked is why the heck do our
electronics heat up so much in the first
place okay well before we dive into the
specifics it's important to understand
one of the fundamental laws of the
universe that ultimately causes heat
generation not just in computers but in
everything from car engines to
lightbulbs I'm talking about the second
law of thermodynamics and while there
are a bunch of smart guy sounding ways
to state the second law for the purposes
of this video it's pretty easy to
understand whenever energy is used some
of it becomes waste heat now we could
just say that since electronics use
energy and therefore generate waste heat
they need to be cooled and then the
episode there I mean I'm getting kind of
hungry lunch break right but we're all
about viewer satisfaction here at tech
wiki so let's dive a little deeper if
you watched our previous episode about
motherboard components right up here
you'll remember that nearly all
electronic circuits feature resistors to
limit the flow of current so that the
sensitive parts of your system like your
processors and RAM modules get the
correct amount of power since too much
can cause them to function incorrectly
or even damage them and this energy that
gets resisted just to go somewhere so it
ends up as heat that needs to be
dissipated and with as many resistor
as there are in modern electronics that
heat adds up pretty quickly but what
about the hottest parts of your computer
your central processing unit or CPU and
your graphics processing unit or GPU
well processors are made up of millions
or even billions of tiny transistors
which switch on and off
you know zeros and ones to run programs
and since modern processors run through
billions of cycles a second these
transistors can generate lots of heat
due to the extra current that they use
while you're putting a load on your
processor such as while gaming or video
editing or compressing files the heavier
the task you're running the more of them
need to be switching and this is all
happening within a space of a few square
centimeters necessitating those hunks of
metal or heat pipe type coolers that
come directly into contact with the CPU
or GPU package carrying heat away
usually to a large metal radiator
structure to be dissipated into the
surrounding air again usually by fans
and this is interesting even if you're
only using your computer for things like
Facebook and Microsoft Office you still
won't get very far without a cooler as
some current is always running through
your processor this is called leakage
even when it's idle so seriously don't
try it unless your goal is to start
another one of those weird tech
destruction YouTube channels but if you
were starting a tech destruction YouTube
channel and you were looking to create a
website to promote your channel you
would want to use Squarespace
Squarespace lets you pick from any one
of their gorgeous templates and just
immediately start building they've got
all kinds of great tools and it's all
through a simple web interface you just
kind of go yeah I want like a text box
there and I want a gorgeous picture
there and I want like a boy
be things like you go through some
different information there and you know
whether you're trying to promote your
hobby or small business or you run a you
know a little league bowling team or
whatever the case may be if you need a
web presence that is easy to use and
affordable starts at only twelve bucks a
month Squarespace has got you covered
and if you're not super techie they
offer tech support 24/7 via live chat
and email
Mehcad like just tons of great features
they support Apple blog format for news
posts they've got commerce built into
every site cover pages lets you have a
one page online presence in minutes
they've got a logo designer boom it's
awesome so start a trial with no credit
card required and start building your
website today at the link in the video
description and when you decide to sign
up for Squarespace use offer code
technique to get 10% off on your first
purchase so thanks for watching guys
like just like check out our other
channels leave a comment with video
suggestion then subscribe blue yeah do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
