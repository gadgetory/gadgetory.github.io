words big iron heavy construction
extreme laundry my nickname in high
school well it turns out that big iron
is none of those things and usually
refers to mainframe computers massive
machines that typically live inside of
large cabinets
okay then Linus so you're talking about
a supercomputer right actually no
mainframes are defined a little
differently in our episode on
supercomputers which you can check out
here we discussed how they are great at
number crunching to complete extremely
complex tasks like weather forecasting
medical research and crypt analysis but
with mainframes the focus is more on
throughput and reliability so what
exactly does that mean
well compared to something like a
supercomputer mainframes have a lot more
inputs and outputs or i/o because
they're often deployed in situations
where they aren't working on one massive
complex problem but rather they have to
process tons of smaller simpler
transactions extremely quickly in fact
even though there is a popular
misconception that mainframes are relics
of a bygone computing era to process the
up to millions of card swipes and
account transfers that occurred daily 96
out of the world's top 100 banks and 23
out of the top 25 US retailers currently
run mainframes from IBM who has been the
dominant player in the industry for a
very long time building one though isn't
just a matter of installing a wack ton
of Zeon's in a box
plugging in lots of ethernet cables and
calling it a day
mainframes use special CPUs many of
which are much larger physically than
even big desktop chips like 2011 socket
CPUs from Intel as well as additional
processors called system a
distance processors or saps that do
almost nothing but move data around as
quickly as possible like glorified
traffic controllers rather than
general-purpose number crunchers and
that's not all on a modern mainframe
like the top end
IBM z13 each individual IO card of which
there can be a hundred and sixty has its
own processing course up to two per
channel on the dual channel cards
meaning you could have over 600
processor cores just for i/o and that's
not even counting the fat whoa
part of the reason that more mainframes
are designed to support this much IO is
to ensure that they stay reliable so
many of the subsystems inside a
mainframe like a modern airliner would
have redundancies Dilton this means they
can be deployed in situations where zero
downtime is acceptable such as the
aforementioned credit-card companies and
retailers as well as airline ticketing
systems in fact a common mainframe
operating system IBM's proprietary Z TPS
was originally developed as transaction
processing software for Airlines if you
want to see it in action pay close
attention next time you board a flight
and you might just get a glimpse of the
computer screen they're using to check
you in an old-school interface with
green text indicates that is probably a
terminal connected to a mainframe just
don't look too closely at it so this
high level of redundancy means that it's
common for mainframes to be built in
such a way where an administrator can
slide out one of the drawers that houses
components and simply start swapping
them out whatever that drawer was
working on is automatically transferred
over to the rest of the mainframe making
it easy to make necessary hardware
changes without any downtime which is a
good thing too because high-end
mainframes can run tons of virtual
servers at once
up to 8,000 in the case of the z13
meaning that taking down the mainframe
could result in a lot of transaction
errors on Black Friday but before you
start thinking gee I should get myself a
mainframe because I want to rent
overwatch on like some kind of 50
monitor setup mainframes and their
operating systems aren't just absurdly
expensive a single mainframe can cost
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
dollars they also aren't designed to run
games or for high-end floating-point
performance which is important for
rendering graphics but even so
mainframes are still in the background
powering lots of things you do every day
which is pretty cool that is unless
you've sworn off air travel and you
don't want MasterCard to know about all
the weird stuff you buy on Amazon
speaking of having your online
activities tracked tunnel bear VPN lets
you anonymize yourself on the internet
and browse the Internet and use online
services as though you are some
anonymous guy in some other country they
have easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC
and Mac they also have a Chrome
extension and it's super easy to use you
just press a button and boom tunnel
bears on your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
show up as though you are in a different
country tunnel bear makes it easy by
bypassing all the annoying details that
typically come with using a VPN no DNS
no router configuration no port
configurations none of that nonsense and
they've got a top rated privacy policy
and do not log user activity so try it
out for free with no credit card
required at our link in the video
description and also by using our link
you can save 10% when you sign up for a
year of unlimited so that's tunnel ver
