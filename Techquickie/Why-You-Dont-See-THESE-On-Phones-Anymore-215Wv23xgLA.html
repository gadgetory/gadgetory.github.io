new thing and a big clunky phone with an
antenna that you had to pull out was the
epitome of cool
you don't really old anywho cell phones
quickly started to shrink in the late
1990s but many models still had visible
antennas of some sort until the
smartphone era came along getting us all
used to sleek rectangular devices
without anything poking out at an odd
angle that is until you have to bust out
a dongle but how exactly does a phone
pick up a signal without a visible
antenna I mean as a 90's kid my
knee-jerk response for a long time to a
reception issue whether it was on the
phone the TV or the radio was to pull
the antenna out and start you know
waggling it around until the problem
went away so why don't we even have the
option to do that anymore well one
explanation you'll often hear has to do
with the frequencies used by modern cell
phones you see an antenna typically
needs to be about 1/2 to 1/4 of the
wavelength of the signal that it's
receiving in order to function properly
and you can see this for yourself
if you've ever noticed a CB radio
antenna attached to a car because CB
radios operate on a frequency where the
wavelength is around 11 meters the
antennas can be comically long
fortunately the wavelengths of typical
cellular frequencies are much shorter so
depending on what kind of network you're
connected to your phone needs an antenna
that's somewhere in the neighborhood of
around 5 to 7 inches but then hold on a
minute those older phones also used
frequencies in the 800 to 900 megahertz
range so it turns out that the main
issue was figuring out how to stick a 5
inch antenna inside a device that's
supposed to be handheld and this was
harder than you might think
even though older phones were relatively
speaking so large
just as the interiors of today's
smartphones are quite crowded with all
the features that are packed inside
older phones also
had tons of components taking up space
within the chassis as time went on
though and consumer demand for ever
smaller phones increased it became clear
that this was a problem worth solving as
otherwise reasonably sized phones with
large antennae sticking out of them were
less portable more fragile and for being
honest just less sexy sorry I am that
shallow
so the solution came in 1998 courtesy of
a little company you might have heard of
called Nokia instead of using a long
metal rod they stamped the antenna onto
a component inside the phone in a thin
flat layer and not only that but this
new antenna was also printed with a
number of folds and turns kind of like
the traces on a printed circuit board
instead of in a straight line that meant
it took up very little space but was
still long enough to receive a signal so
this paradigm has lasted into the modern
age where thin metal antennas folded up
inside foam bodies are the norm and many
phones even use part of the exterior
medal of the phone body itself as part
of the antenna in fact having one end of
the antenna be a large flat sheet like
the metal backing of a smartphone can
give a significant boost in bandwidth
these physical innovations combined with
processing advances that make it easier
for phones to work with a weaker signal
meaning that there just isn't much
reason to stick antennas way on the
outside of the main body anymore and in
the somewhat near future
faster 5g connections that use even
higher frequency signals could mean that
antennas inside our phones would need to
take up even less room though if you're
one of those folks that really misses
the old-school antennas I do hear that
boom boxes have been making a big
comeback so you should probably look
into that speaking of things to look
into our sponsor for today mass drop
mass drops sennheiser HD 6x acts
headphones are one of their all-time
bestsellers with over 50,000 units sold
they have an unchanged driver and sound
signature compared to the HD 650
so that means nice balanced mid-range
sound and
natural-sounding base they've got a
detachable six-foot cable instead of a
10 foot cable based on community
feedback and they've got both a 1/8 inch
plug that's versatile for everyday use
and a 1/4 inch adapter for your hi-fi
equipment
it comes with Sennheiser's long-term
support included and you can click the
link below to join the drop today these
things are awesome go check them out so
thanks for watching guys like dislike
check out our other videos leave a
comment if you have a suggestion for a
future fast as possible and don't forget
to subscribe because it would be truly
tragic if we actually made the video you
asked us to make and then you didn't
watch it who is benefitting from a
situation like that so you got to
subscribe and hit the bell I think it's
not what bells sound like it's fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
