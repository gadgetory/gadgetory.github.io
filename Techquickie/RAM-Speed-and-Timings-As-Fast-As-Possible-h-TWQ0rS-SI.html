lots of things whether you're trying to
find your way to a restaurant sing-along
to that song at a karaoke bar or
remember who won the presidential
election in 1880 because you've got 50
bucks on the line at a trivia game
something anyway but what about having
quick memory in your computer although
knowing how much memory to put in your
PC is usually pretty straightforward the
topic of memory speed is more of a
mystery so how much then does it
actually matter well it helps to know
what those numbers on your memory
modules mean similarly to your CPU all
RAM or random access memory has a clock
speed which corresponds to how much data
throughput it can handle each second but
in addition to clock speed memory also
has timings which are typically
expressed as a string of numbers like 9
9 9 24 these numbers are measures of
latency which in this case is the number
of those clock cycles per second that it
takes for your RAM to do things like
access certain pieces of data so shorter
timings will mean faster performance so
together the clock speed and the timings
will determine exactly how fast your RAM
will operate and like with a CPU or a
video card you can also overclock your
RAM by cranking up the megahertz and
giving it a little bit more voltage what
unlike processor overclocking which
typically gives small but noticeable
performance gains getting the fastest
memory possible for your system is often
dismissed as a waste of money by many
enthusiasts but why would that be then I
mean isn't faster always better when it
comes to computer components the short
answer is yes but in the real world
faster RAM typically will only give you
very small performance boosts that you
probably won't be able to notice unless
you're using very specialized
benchmarking software you see modern
memory has lots of bandwidth and can
often handle
more data flowing in and out then many
programs are anywhere near capable of
using so similarly to how you usually
won't get more FPS in your games by
plugging your graphics card into a
faster PCI Express slot spending more
money on top end memory won't usually
translate to noticeable improvements in
your programs but as with most things in
the computer world there are exceptions
to the rule and faster memory can be
very useful in certain situations on the
server side of things you can use it as
a cache so you can take data that's on
your main storage and make it so it can
be accessed much much faster you can
learn more about that here or you can
use it for many many virtual computers
all at the same time so even if each of
them only requires a fraction of the
bandwidth between them all they can use
nearly limitless amounts of memory
bandwidth that's called virtualization
and you can learn more about that here
on the desktop side of things though the
examples are fewer and further between
but there definitely are some like for
example if you're running one of AMD's
APU processors because onboard graphics
use your main system memory as video RAM
unlike a discrete graphics card which
has its own separate RAM on the board
there's a lot more information going to
and from your system memory when you're
gaming so faster memory can give a real
boost in your frame rates with that said
if you aren't running an APU it's
usually a better idea to focus your
money on things other than raw speed
when buying memory such as buying from a
reputable brand with a good warranty
because lower quality Ram can cause lots
of inexplicable errors that can leave
you tearing your hair out when you're
trying to figure out what the heck is
wrong with your rig even buying
aesthetically pleasing Ram modules that
fit in well with the rest of your
computer is in my opinion a better idea
than going for the highest possible
speed so then unless you're buying the
slowest most bargain-basement memory you
can find you probably won't have to
worry too much about RAM speeds that is
to say unless you're trying to shoot for
some kind of an overclocking record in
which case your bigger worry might be
trying not to freeze your hands off
with all the liquid nitrogen speaking of
freezing hands if your hands are so
frozen that you can't tunnel to another
country to access the Internet as though
you're in it then tunnel bear could be
the solution for you there bears have
claws
not to mention fur that make it easy for
them to take your internet connection
and make it so that the sites that you
access and the services that you access
online think that you're in up to one of
20 different countries they've got
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac not to mention they have a Chrome
extension and it is so simple to use
that like my family could do it once
you've got tunnel bear installed which
is like double click to install Boop
awesome all you do is click the dial
choose the country and boom a couple of
things happen number one your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and number two your public IP
address gets switched so you can show up
as if you're in a completely different
country and toggle barrier bypasses all
that annoying port forwarding nonsense
making it so that anybody can do it it
also got a top rated privacy policy and
they do not log user activity and the
best thing about it is you don't have to
commit you can try out tunnel bear for
free with 500 Meg's of data for nothing
and no credit card required and then if
you want to upgrade to an unlimited plan
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear
