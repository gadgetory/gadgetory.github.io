birdbath a computer like maybe your own
freaking house because you're live in
Vancouver and you're sick of a ten
thousand percent markup on real estate
sorry I got distracted there anyway you
wouldn't build any of that stuff
without the proper tools right I mean
you can't exactly stack a bunch of
lumber together and hope to live in it
well the same concept is true in
software development I mean sure it is
possible to completely write your own
code from scratch but it would be an
incredibly tedious and time-consuming
process for developers to do this every
time they came up with a new idea I mean
imagine having to plant grow and harvest
your own wheat every time you wanted a
delicious slice of raisin toast so in a
previous episode we covered api's which
are pieces of software that one program
uses to interface with another making
programming a heck of a lot easier but
what about the front-end interface the
tools that developers actually sit down
and use will these often come in the
form of a software development kit or
SDK think of it as a virtual toolbox but
instead of pliers and a hammer you'll
typically find files called
libraries which are essentially pieces
of code that help a program play nicely
with whatever platform it's on such as
the libraries in the Windows SDK which
allow programs to make calls to the
operating system to get it to perform
certain functions easily without having
to tediously code them manually other
common SDK tools include visual editors
so that a developer can design and
layout graphical elements like buttons
and text boxes easily with tutorials and
sample code so that a developer can
become familiar with the platform that
they're coding on and debuggers that
help developers find errors and
omissions in their code but SDKs aren't
limited to just making programs on
Windows or smartphone apps an individual
SDK is often a heavily customized
or their platform such as the Cosmo SDK
from the robotics company Anki which can
be used to harness the robots camera for
facial recognition and spatial awareness
animate the robot to make it say or do
certain things or plan out a movement
path to make it easy for the robot to
avoid obstacles all with just a few
lines of code instead of having to
create from scratch and become an expert
in artificial intelligence and even on
other platforms you aren't limited to
just using one SDK and only one SDK if
you're looking to create something like
the next whatsapp or Instagram for
example there are lots of different iOS
and Android SDKs that specialize in
different types of apps there are chat
focused SDKs but make it easy to create
notifications or speech balloons image
editing SDKs that allow you to make
certain photo effects and filters
available without having to code them
yourself and video chat SDKs that make
it easy for the app to talk to your
phone's camera indeed the wide
availability of different kinds of SDKs
today means that you don't need to have
graduated with honors from a computer
science program in order to create your
own software though some knowledge of
programming languages is often necessary
specifically Java for Android
objective-c or Swift for iOS and c-sharp
for Windows are great places to start
but if you take the time to learn how to
code SDKs could make it possible for you
to land a gig as a developer somewhere
or even hit the top of the Play Store as
an indie app developer though if you
don't hit the top of the Play Store
maybe it's that your idea was wrong so
here's a free suggestion how about a
Linus's wise words of the day app so my
wisdom can follow you and all of your
downloaders everywhere you go ever
wanted a smart happy companion without
having to deal with refilling a food
bowl cleaning a litter box or putting
down the toilet seat when you're done
then check out the Cosmo bianchi the
coolest robot ever invented TM not only
is cosmo intelligent but he also has a
personality that grows and changes based
on how you interact with them and he can
do all kinds
of cool tricks including act happy to
see you and act sad or frustrated if you
can't be too in a game Cosmo even has
his own software development kit so if
you're interested in development you can
use the Cosmo SDK to tap into advanced
features like face detection and path
planning or to connect with social media
or smart home services on keys
python-based SDK is simple to use yet
powerful enough to open up a world of
possibilities with Cosmo you just need a
phone Android or iOS and a laptop and
you are ready to rock out of the box so
to learn more head over to on keep calm
Cosmo is only available in the United
States so if that's where you live then
great you can pick up your own Cosmo for
just one $79.99 and remember that Anki
is now offering free standard shipping
on all orders so thanks for watching
