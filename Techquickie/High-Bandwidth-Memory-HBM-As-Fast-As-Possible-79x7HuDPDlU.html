release there's always like a feeding
frenzy as gamers try to get their hands
on it and if they can blow away dudes in
crisper detail and at higher resolutions
than ever before but while the
performance of the graphics processor or
GPU itself is often the most
talked-about aspect of a new card the
amount of video memory or vram on a card
can have a big effect on just how high
you can crank up your settings
but while GPUs or graphics processors
have been updated and re updated pretty
regularly over the last few years not
much has happened with vram recently
we've had the same old gddr5 memory
hanging out on our cards for over seven
years but the next big thing in vram is
finally here I'm talking of course about
high bandwidth memory or HBM so what
exactly is it how is it better than
older vram technology and most
importantly is it actually going to make
a difference in your games well just
like any other type of VRAM HBM performs
functions like keeping rendered frames
in storage in a frame buffer not that
kind holding textures to make everything
on screen look realistic and storing
crucial information for lighting and
other effects in short it holds the
information that your GPU needs to act
upon to push an image to your monitor
but although HBM serves the same basic
function as other types of VRAM the way
that it's actually implemented on your
graphics card is very different for
starters gddr5 and its predecessors
require DRAM chips attached to the PCB
spread out around the processor and the
more memory you want and the higher
speeds you want the more chips you need
to plunk on there which combined with
the traces for data and power to all
those chips take up a lot of space on
the card and increase manufacturing
complexity and therefore cost
HBM solves these problems two ways
number one the viren is now directly
attached to the GPU package meaning that
HBM require
there's no more space than what's
already normally taken up by the GPU to
HBM uses 3d Ram dyes that are stacked on
top of each other and that communicate
using tiny interconnects called
through-silicon vias or TSVs
which are called that since they
physically go through all the stacked
layers at once kind of like a toothpick
through a giant club sandwich and while
you can't eat eh bien like you would a
Monte Cristo these changes have the
potential to give you some positively
delicious results while gaming so the
chips themselves have a much wider data
interface that combined with stacking
the chips gives you these little well
stacks that can move up to 256 gigabytes
of data per second which means that a
graphics card with just four stacks of
HBM could have memory throughput of a
full terabyte of data per second which
will become increasingly important in
the future as more and more non gaming
applications like Adobe Premiere for
example start leveraging the graphics
card for compute and as the resolutions
that typical gamers want to run at
increase not to mention that there's
things like multi 4k monitor setups that
are becoming cheaper and more popular
all of which will be easier with more
memory bandwidth
okay then Linus so how do I hop onboard
this hype train well hbn is only
currently available on AMD's top-end
Radeon r9 Fury series but the rumor mill
figures that invidious upcoming Pascal
graphics cards will feature the
technology and as we all know the high
end today is the mainstream of tomorrow
so within a couple of years we should
all be able to have enough memory
bandwidth to choke a horse
speaking of choking horses or nope not
related to that at all Dollar Shave Club
you can get razors and other bathroom
supplies shipped directly to your door
for only a few bucks a month they've got
their razor handles and blade combos all
the way up to that like six blade
executive but with that said they don't
go overboard and kind of go yeah well
this one's got like a rear view mirror
and a vibrating handle that you can use
for all kinds of all
they also have other products like their
one wipe Charlies peppermint scented
butt wipes for men their post-shave
moisturizer and their dr. Carver's shave
water which goes on clear so you can
actually see what you're doing I mean I
guess it's pretty straightforward isn't
it
high-quality razors and bathroom
supplies directly to your door once a
month for a few bucks a month visit
dollarshaveclub.com slash Lynas to join
the club now it's available in the US
canada and australia alright so thanks
for watching guys if you like the video
do that thing if you just like to do the
other thing don't forget to check out
our other channels we've got a great
video up on channel super fun it's like
a pimp my ride type thing with my car
which as you guys all know should be
hilarious as always leave comments under
the video if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible so don't forget
to subscribe and following all that good
stuff and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
