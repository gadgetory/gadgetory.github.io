won't miss any future videos so aren't
credit cards great the rewards programs
are fantastic you can buy things now and
pay for them later and the reasonable
interest rates me that I'm just kidding
about that last one but obviously
there's a huge difference between you
using your own credit card irresponsibly
and someone else deciding to commit
credit card fraud and running up a bunch
of charges on your account and these
days is often much easier for criminals
to forget about stealing hard currency
like the Highwaymen of yesteryear and
instead focus on ripping off credit card
numbers so they can charge as much as
they want well up to the victims credit
limit anyway but that leads us into
another big advantage that credit cards
have over cash if your car number gets
stolen your credit card company has
technological measures in place to
detect and put a stop to fraud but how
in the world do they do this well
perhaps unsurprisingly major payment
processors mine huge amounts of data
from their card holders and they know a
great deal about their spending habits
and while that might sound a little
creepy in this age where it feels like
every smartphone and computer is trying
to learn about us it's also a key way
that companies like Visa and MasterCard
detect fraud
you see odds are that you mostly swipe
and tap your card in and around the
areas where you live work or frequently
visit now as you do this your credit
card company builds a picture not only
of where you spend your money but how
much and how frequently so over time
they get an idea of whether you're a
high roller with money to burn or if you
follow grandma's advice and only use
plastic in emergencies so if a
transaction goes through for far more
money than you usually spend or from
some faraway locale this will
automatically trigger the car company's
payment processing system to flag that
transaction and market as potentially
fraudulent as the odds are that it
wasn't you making the purchase however
if you've ever done something unusual
like drive down to Tijuana one weekend
for some dental work you might have had
your credit card work just fine well it
turns out that your credit card
carrier's computers look for patterns
that wouldn't be obvious to us mere
mortal humans now oftentimes thieves
will use stolen credit card numbers to
buy something small at first to test
the card before moving on to grand theft
so a stick of gum followed by a brand
new kitchen is going to raise some
eyebrows in American Express and some
more advanced methods can track the IP
addresses of our transactions originated
from so if they see a charge tied to an
IP address that's been used in the past
for fraud you might get a fraud alert on
your phone or PC so that you can contact
your card issuer and tell them whether
you've been scammed and many banks
employ similar technologies to protect
money that you already have in your bank
account in fact if someone drains a ton
of money out of your account
fraudulently the Bakke generally has to
give you that money back as long as you
report it quickly enough and since banks
don't want to have to foot the bill for
theft they definitely have an interest
and keep your cash as safe as possible
but remember that these systems aren't
perfect in fact it's their errors that
allow them to continue to improve so
keep an eye on your statements and
sometimes they can even work too well if
you've got a vacation in some exotic
place and started using your card
without telling the company first it may
have ended up accidentally flagging your
card when you try to use it to buy a mai
tai at some bar in the Caribbean so it's
generally considered a good idea to give
them a ring before heading out on a big
trip now of course with huge credit card
companies and banks using machine
learning and artificial neural networks
to more effectively identify fraud
patterns and develop new algorithms for
catching it there's a lot of secret
sauce that goes into protecting
consumers that's kept away from the
general public to keep it out of the
hands of would-be fraudsters after all I
don't think Kevin McAllister left the
plans for his booby traps in plain sight
for the Wet Bandits to find and speaking
of machine learning or just learning in
general are you looking to pick up some
practical skills then check out
Skillshare an online learning community

technology design and more a premium
membership will give you unlimited
access to high-quality classes on
must-know topics so you can improve your
