shrinking transistor sizes will make our
CPUs perform better and consume less
power and this has generally been true
but if you were to talk to someone with
an AMD based computer who's been waiting
to upgrade you might not know it as team
red hasn't given us a noteworthy update
of their flagship CPU line since twenty
freaking twelve meanwhile Intel has been
giving us new architectures and dye
shrinks fairly regularly leading to
decreased market share for AMD who I
guess you could say hadn't risen to the
challenge but all of that presumably is
about to change yes my friends that bad
pun in the topic of today's video andy's
all new rise in cpus is here and AMD is
hoping that it'll give intel some real
competition and consumers some actual
choice in the processor market for the
first time in a long time but what makes
Rison special and how does it stack up
against the best from team blue well
although AMD hasn't backed down on their
philosophy of cramming eight processor
cores onto a single consumer level chip
this time around it looks like there's a
much greater focus on single threaded
performance big news for both gamers and
huh people who use their computers for
all the other common tasks that don't
often leverage multiple CPU cores AMD
claims that its top-end Rison chip the
1,800 X beats Intel's latest enthusiast
chips Broadwell e in single threaded
tasks while legging a few percentage
points behind kb lake which we found to
be generally the truth in our
independent testing which you can check
out for yourself
right here but how did they do that well
aside from shrinking their transistors
to 14 nanometers so on par with Intel
now AMD has baked in a lot of my
features such as neural network like
branch prediction functionality in which
the CPU examines data patterns to read
ahead on the page so to speak better
links between the course and the CPU
cache allowing the course to decode
things concurrently and thus turn
instructions around much more quickly
faster and more granular switching
between clock speeds which AMD calls
precision boost individual voltage
curves assigned for each chip at the
factory and AMD's new infinity fabric
interconnects for faster communication
between the CPU and components like
memory graphics and down the line on
their server platform other cpus and
gone are the days of course sharing
crucial resources a design choice that
hobbled AMD's old FX series chips that
shared a single floating-point unit
between two cores
Rison has truly discrete course and
what's more they've got simultaneous
multi-threading which is similar to
Intel hyper-threading technology hmm add
in greater power efficiency overclocking
enabled on every chip as long as you
pair it with a B or X Series chipset
motherboard and native support for
modern features like USB 3.1 10 gigabit
PCI Express 3.0 ddr4 memory and nvme for
fast solid-state storage and risin looks
like a winner but wait how can it be a
winner if it still isn't consistently
outperforming and i7 7700 K on
surprisingly the answer to this question
comes down to price the structure of the
risin line up on creatively borrows from
Intel at the high end instead of an i7
you get a rise in 7 which at this time
is an 8 core 16 thread product targeting
high-end gamers streamers and creative
professionals stepping down to take on
the i-5 you get
you guessed it rise in five but instead
of being limited to four course with no
SMT and these line up in this price
range will include four and six core
solutions with SMT whoa
moving down the SAC rise in three looks
poised to deliver core i5 light
performance at a core i3 like price
so no SMT but with 4 physical cores it
should be very competitive
given that unconfirmed pricing leaks
indicators will be starting about 129 us
so then is rising right for you well
that depends do you like spending less
money ok but seriously it's not that
simple do keep in mind that on the other
side Intel still edges ahead in
performance in many applications and
offer some platform exclusive features
not found on Rison such as Thunderbolt 3
octane memory technology and a maximum
of 40 PCI Express Lanes compared to
Rises 24 but if your workloads benefit
from more course and you don't want to
spend an arm and a leg to get the
absolute highest benchmark scores or
render times
Rison just might be appealing enough to
find a home in your next PC especially
if developers who have been
understandably focused on Intel for the
last five years or so really start
optimizing games and programs for AMD's
all new architecture and regardless of
who you alternately buy your cpu from a
quality tip from AMD probably means
Intel will be forced to get more
aggressive a good thing for everyone
unless of course you're the type of
person who eats big plate small food
dinners six nights a week do you ever
find yourself running out of time as a
freelancer or a small business owner
well you're not alone because thanks to
the internet there have never been more
opportunities for the self-employed and
FreshBooks accounting software is all
about making it easier for you to work
the way you want without getting solved
tied up in little none
worse things here and you know little
accounting details there it's all about
making it easy to be more productive be
more organized and perhaps most
importantly get paid more quickly you
can create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
get paid on your schedule so with online
payments with just a couple clicks you
can get paid up to four days faster you
can take deposits you can see when your
client has seen your invoice and put an
end to that hey did you get that oh no I
didn't can you send it again hey do you
have it now that sucks
so FreshBooks is offering a 30-day
unrestricted free trial to our viewers
to try it out and find out just how much
