an experience for whomever was playing
the game and maybe one or two other
people looking over his or her shoulder
but nowadays people are not only looking
for powerful rigs to play their games
but also the ability to show off their
minecraft creations and ill-conceived
SimCity's to the world with this in mind
NVIDIA recently rolled out ansel a new
platform to give users greater
flexibility when taking screenshots now
I know that those of you who are regular
game streamers are saying come on -
actually I can just take screenshots by
screen capping my twitch stream or I
don't know pressing print screen or
whatever what's the big deal with this
and sole business well traditional
screenshot capture is often limited by
whatever frame your GPU is pushing out
to your monitor or to your stream at any
given time I mean that's what you
capture so if you want to show a precise
moment in a particular game you have to
hope that the in-game camera has things
that just the angle that you want one of
the key features of Ansel is removal of
this limit by placing a freely moveable
virtual camera into the game that you
can actually reposition to anywhere that
you'd like to get your screenshots just
the way you want them in addition to a
time freezing option for finer levels of
control kind of like bullet time in the
matrix
and speaking of bullet time there's also
a 360 degree option that allows gamers
to take a shot of the entire in-game
environment which gets stored as an
image that's properly viewable on a VR
headset like the rift vive or Google
cardboard if you want your gaming
accomplishments or memories to have that
extra level of immersion another cool
thing is it gives you an idea of what it
might be like to step into your favorite
game but if you'd like to show finer
details instead of concerning yourself
with VR
such as if you like posting game
walkthroughs online for example you
might like Ansel super-resolution feat
sure that will actually re-render the
frame that you want with super sampling
for a clean looking image at up to 61
k's yes a lot higher than 4k and pretty
freakin cool if you want a massive wall
print of your favorite shot of your
favorite title such as the interesting
scenery in games like no man's sky
built-in HDR and post-processing effects
mean effectively like instagram looking
stuff will help you customize the look
of your screenshots further without
having to use a program like Photoshop
but if you're a pro at image editing you
can actually also get the images in RAW
format so you can play with them to your
heart's content later on but there's a
caveat there always isn't there as good
as all this sounds exactly which Ansel
features you'll be able to use depends
on the game so keep that in mind before
you rush to try it out the good news
though is that Ansel is supported on
quite a large number of recent GPUs
actually anything on the Nvidia side
that is a GTX 670 Dan expensive upgrade
to start taking these fancy screenshots
and as the popularity of sharing game
accomplishments as well as home virtual
reality continues to grow I hope to see
something like this coming from AMD as
well I mean after all if you want to
show your friends what it might be like
to stand in the middle of the world of
The Witcher 3 it shouldn't matter which
teams card is proudly sitting inside
your rig get razors and other bathroom
supplies shipped directly to your door

friends you no longer need to leave the
house in order to look like you leave
the house or look good enough to leave
the house they've got razors dr.
Carver's shave butter there one wipe
Charlies peppermint scented bot wipes

got a variety of razors all the way up
to the six blade executive with no need
for vibrating handles or other nonsense

categorically unhelpful just
