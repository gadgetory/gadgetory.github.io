a shiny new set of headphones he plunked
down a bunch of money on but walked away
feeling like the sound just wasn't quite
what you expected
maybe you got drawn in by an expensive
marketing campaign for a pair of
headphones that could possibly live up
to all the hype but you may have also
overlooked their frequency response one
of the key things that separates one set
of headphones from another but often
only gets one little line on a spec
sheet usually a headphone manufacturer
will describe frequency response as a
range of tones that a headphone can
reproduce you might see something like
20 to 20,000 Hertz for example which
also happens to be the range of human
hearing since most people can't hear
lower than 20 Hertz or higher than
20,000 Hertz it might at first look like
a cheap pair of headphones that lists
this as its frequency response can
reproduce every sound you could ever
want to hear unfortunately though those
numbers are only a pretty small part of
the story because different headphones
are constructed in different ways there
are pretty significant differences
between how various models will
reproduce sounds within the low mid and
high ranges even if a headphone promises
a frequency response well beyond your
range of hearing every frequency might
not be reproduced with the same loudness
or clarity the result could make you end
up feeling like you're listening to
something through a pretty bad equalizer
even if you're not using one at all so
how can you know whether a particular
pair of headphones will sound the way
you expect well this can be pretty
tricky until you actually try them out
many popular headphone models have been
tested by various independent websites
and even individual hobbyists with the
actual frequency response being plotted
on graphs that show how loud the
headphones get at each frequency many
less expensive headphones have what's
called a v-shaped sound signature
meaning that they have emphasis on the
bass and the treble instead of the
mid-range forming a v-shape on a
frequency response graph other kinds of
headphones are more bass heavy and are
louder in the low range or are bright
and have more emphasis on the treble but
if you want a very true to the recording
sound that isn't skewed in any
particular direction it's a good idea to
find a set of headphones with a flat
more neutral sound signature that can
reproduce lows mids and highs more or
less equally and although many audio
files go for neutral sounding headphones
this doesn't necessarily that they're
the best for everyone for example many
people who like electronic music or
hip-hop go for bass ear headphones that
let them feel the lows a little bit more
ultimately of course beauty is in the
eye of the beholder and that includes
sound too so at the end of the day
what's most important is buying
something that you think sounds good
just don't let yourself be swayed too
much by you know celebrity endorsements
or your buddy who primarily uses his
headphones as a fashion statement
