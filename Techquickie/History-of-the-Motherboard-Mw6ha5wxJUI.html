just adding a CPU a stick of RAM a
storage device and a power supply to a
mini ITX motherboard will give you a
small and fully functional computer in a
matter of minutes and this is possible
because of how many different functions
the average motherboard combines into
one little slab of like fiberglass metal
and silicon but it wasn't always like
this
in fact early electronics didn't have
anything resembling the lovely green
boards with black integrated circuits
that were used to today instead it was
common to see individual full sized
wires linking every capacitor resistor
and other component necessary to make up
a full computer system unsurprisingly
this approach took up tons of space
added a bunch of weight and was
relatively fragile meaning that the
printed circuit board took off in
popularity pretty quickly starting in
the 1950s it should be noted however
that these early PCBs were still a far
cry from the RGB motherboard that you
might have sitting in your computer
right now while back then a simple
device like a radio might have gotten
away with using just one PCB
full-fledged computers needed many
circuit boards to handle different
functions connected by a backplane that
you might consider to be a forerunner of
the modern motherboard unlike true
motherboards though these back planes
tended to be dumb connections with no
actual logic that consisted of little
more than a bunch of slots lined up in a
row so that other expansion cards could
be plugged in for example the Altair
8800 used one slot to insert a processor
another for memory and so on
it wasn't until 1981 that we got a big
upgrade the planar board in the original
IBM PC featured an Intel 8088 CPU built
in memory and actual external IO so it
was far more than just a glorified
bundle of wire
like smooshed together all you could
connect directly to it was a keyboard
and a cassette drive but it also
included a handful of expansion slots
that didn't look too different from what
we're used to today and those slots were
important because motherboards were
still so simple that they didn't have
features that we consider basic now like
drive headers for example so if you
wanted to load up your copy of flight
simulator 1.0 you would need a
standalone disk interface card and we
didn't see modern memory modules that
fit into RAM slots until the mid-1980s
either by the late 80s though engineers
had fully embraced the goal of
integrating more and more functions onto
the motherboard and so little ICS called
super i/o chips were becoming more
common these functioned like rudimentary
versions of a modern chipset they
provided drive controllers ports for
printers mice keyboards and other
devices and the systems bios now that
all doesn't sound like a huge deal today
but super i/o chips took up less space
and they were much more cost effective
than expansion cards setting the stage
for full-featured modern motherboards
around the same time in 1987
specifically we've got the first ever
integrated VGA graphics chips when IBM
released model 50 of their almost famous
personal system - unlike modern
integrated GPUs though this was a chip
that was affixed to the motherboard
instead of being built into the CPU
itself a paradigm that we saw again
starting in the mid-1990s as 3d GPUs
like the s3 trio and the ati rage series
appeared on motherboards obviating the
need for a separate card for basic use
though GPUs that were soldered onto
motherboards began to disappear in favor
of ones built into CPUs by the mid 2010
speaking of CPUs let's jump back again
to 1989 when the first CPU socket with a
vaguely modern look socket 1 appeared
alongside Intel's wildly popular 486
processor
while earlier designs involved soldering
the CPU directly to the board or
significant force on the part of the
user to insert or remove them socket one
had a simple mechanism based around a
pin grid array very similar to modern
AMD sockets though with a mere 169 pins
but it wasn't just CPU sockets that were
getting a facelift expansion slots were
also changing at that time and it was
about time as the ancient is a standard
had been used since the days of the
original IBM PC in 1994 PCI started
becoming popular in consumer pcs
followed by the short-lived AGP for
graphics cards in 1997 and PCI Express
which is still with us today in 2004 but
what about onboard networking in audio
well in the mid 1980s there were a
number of proprietary networking
protocols but since the now-familiar
Ethernet was a relatively simple
standard with easy physical construction
it became the go-to for networking in
the late 80s and again its simplicity
meant that it quickly spread to PC
motherboards in the early 1990s and
although sound cards also started
appearing on the market in the late 80s
and early 90s and we had little internal
speakers that could emit beeps and
bleeps for a while we didn't see true
fully functional onboard digital sound
hit the mainstream until 1999 when Intel
included the AC 97 standard in its 810
chipset which incidentally was also the
first Intel chipset to include
integrated graphics meaning it was no
longer necessary to have a separate chip
for video processing be it on the
motherboard or on an adapter card so now
that all of these innovations had a
clear home on the PC motherboard the
stage was set for refinements made
possible by decreasing costs and the
continued miniaturization of components
not to mention an increase in processing
capacity to handle lots of different
features meaning that these days even
small form-factor motherboards feature
RGB headers premium power delivery and
Wi-Fi and of course by lear the 2010
manufacturers also realized that all
those bells and whistles are meaningless
without some vaguely threatening
heatsinks to show all comers that you
mean business
speaking of meaning business do you mean
business when it comes to keeping prying
eyes away from your online activity then
check out private Internet access VPN
not only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once hiding your true IP
address it allows you to bypass to your
restrictions and censorship by making
you appear as though you are connecting
from somewhere else and it's got all
kinds of other great functionality too
it blocks unwanted connections to help
prevent attacks it Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects it keeps
your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other snoops who are
tracking your activity it prevents DNS
leaks and even includes mace P is
built-in malware blocker it supports
multiple VPN protocols and they've got
apps for Windows Mac Android iOS Linux
and even a Chrome extension with support
for more platforms coming soon
P ia has over 3,000 servers in 28
countries and doesn't log user activity
so what are you waiting for check them
out today at the link below so thanks
for watching guys you can just like like
you can check out other channels you can
leave a comment if you have a suggestion
for a future fast as possible and you
