super well known in the Anglosphere
until the mid 1980s their history
actually goes back a whole century
before Mario became a worldwide
phenomenon
Nintendo started as a small Kyoto based
business in 1989 where it made Hana Fuda
a type of Japanese playing cards they
quickly found success and in fact the
business did so well that Nintendo
pretty much only made playing cards
until the mid 1960s when the company
diversified into fields like toys taxis
instant noodles and even hourly rate
hotels hmm but these ventures didn't go
so well for Nintendo and by this time
folks in Japan weren't really buying
playing cards much anymore so the
company was suddenly in dire financial
straits until employee gunpei Yokoi used
his engineering background to develop a
popular line of electronic toys
including light guns in the early 1970s
that could be considered the forerunners
of the nest zapper that's responsible
for the deaths of millions of digital
ducks you can learn more about light
guns in this episode but why make light
guns if you don't make a game console
well some of Nintendo's early light guns
were used in game systems from other
manufacturers because Nintendo wouldn't
release its own console until 1977 the
simply titled color TV game that was
only marketed in Japan unlike most later
systems the color TV game didn't use
cartridges but instead came in several
variations that featured different games
built in and that wasn't the only
primitive thing about it the first
version didn't even have true
controllers instead players controlled
the game by fiddling with dials on the
console itself making gameplay a little
awkward but in spite of these
limitations the color tv-game did fairly
well though Nintendo's first real hit in
the video game world
came after Yokoi sat beside a passenger
on a train who was fiddling with a
calculator to pass the time suddenly he
thought hey why can't people cure their
boredom with handheld games instead with
that the game and watch was born in 1980
a line of simple LCD games with clocks
built in hence the name although each
game and watch model only included one
game due to their use of segment
displays that could only show a limited
number of images it sold over 43 million
units worldwide before it was
discontinued in 1991 Nintendo was also
developing arcade games during this time
including the original Donkey Kong and
Mario Brothers released in 1981 and 83
respectively but home consoles continued
to gain popularity during the early 80s
so Nintendo came out with the family
computer or Famicom in 1983 this was
their first console that resembles what
we're used to today with wired
controllers and a cartridge system that
allowed it to play lots of different
games the Famicom sold very well leading
Nintendo to look at releasing it in the
United States but by this time the
infamous video game crash of 1983 had
happened a huge downturn in the video
game industry that was caused in large
part by the market being flooded with
very poor quality games and consumer
confusion that stemmed from dishonest
boxart
and inconsistencies in the game
experience between consoles even when
playing the same game so Nintendo
redesigned the Famicom into the Nintendo
Entertainment System or NES envisioning
it as a single ecosystem using
proprietary terms like control deck and
game pack instead of console or video
game cartridge Nintendo also introduced
the feel of quality at this time to show
that nest games had
Nintendo quality control in an attempt
to convince consumers they were only
licensing worthwhile games for their
console
unlike competitors like Atari the nest
finally made it to market in 1986 and
was a runaway hit trouncing its
competitors with games like Super Mario
Brothers Metroid and The Legend of Zelda
which became such enduring franchises
that they continued to this very day so
successful was the nest that the company
rolled out Nintendo Power magazine two
years later which served to hype
upcoming titles and hardware but
Nintendo didn't forget about the
handheld market and Yokoi took his
handheld game ideas to the next level
when he designed the gameboy released in
1989 although it was rather simple
featuring a black and white non backlit
screen with a low 160 by 144 resolution
it was inexpensive and durable allowing
it to beat out more advanced rival
handhelds like the Sega Game Gear with
that the stage was set for a console war
that would rage on for many more years
but right now we're out of time so stay
tuned for part 2 of our history of
Nintendo where we have a look at the
Nintendo Sega conflict of the 1990s
