now and the things they offer generally
make a lot of sense for especially
people who want to cut the cord that is
get rid of their expensive cable TV or
satellite subscription and only watch
the cheaper or sometimes even free
content that's available online and
while this functionality won't seem like
anything groundbreaking to Windows Media
Center or XBMC aficionados not everyone
wants a full-blown PC clunking up their
living room so Smart TVs great
underlying concept so why exactly is it
that commercial Smart TVs never caught
on on their own and manufacturers ended
up cramming them down our throats by
eventually phasing out dumb TVs
altogether well if you've ever used one
you probably know weird remotes and
control schemes that never work useless
voice-recognition anemic hardware and
software that ranged from 1/2 asks to
were these games being by a bunch of
kindergartners in comas but there's hope
Google wants to give the Smart TV a real
boost in popularity with an OS that
they're calling android TV which is
pretty much exactly what it sounds like
Android on your television whoa Linus
bro doesn't Google already have the
chromecast how's this new well yes they
do but while they're $30 hdmi dongle
that smart ins up your TV a little by
using a small Wi-Fi antenna to receive
online video content from your wireless
devices and your router was very
successful
Android TV builds on it in a number of
ways the new OS is built around voice
searching and can answer complicated
queries from the user for example you
can ask your TV to show you all the
movies that won an Oscar in 2010 and
then pick one from that list seconds
later Android TV also delivers the best
of both worlds in terms of control you
can thankfully use a full size TV remote
instead of having to fumble around for
your smart phone to control it like the
chromecast you can download and use
Google Play apps directly on the device
instead of having to beam them from a
mobile device with the latency that
comes along with that and there's no
need to abandon the ability to flick
whatever you're watching on your tablet
or phone to your TV
if you so desire but what about the
folks who aren't content to sit and
watch
Landro TV has another big-ticket feature
its potential as a gaming platform
now although Android devices can't match
the raw power of a desktop or gaming
laptop they still have a wide variety of
less graphically demanding titles to
offer and the idea of Android gaming in
the living room has gained enough
traction that multiplayer games and the
consoles with accompanying premium-grade
controllers to go with them are emerging
on the platform not to mention that some
of these devices can even link up with a
gaming PC elsewhere in your house for a
low latency big-screen PC gaming
experience using local network streaming
which leads really well into the next
point - I don't care about any of that I
just want to watch orange is the new
black and all of your awesome videos on
YouTube without checking out my old dumb
TV do I really have to go and buy a
brand-new TV with Android TV on board to
do it not at all with even premium
gaming options like the ones we just
showed from companies like Razer and
NVIDIA coming in at a hundred to two
hundred dollars you can bet your crystal
balls that more affordable almost as
good choices will be cheap as chips in
the coming years or even months and
thanks to androids
increasingly unified experience crummy
apps and interfaces should be pretty
much a thing of the past as long as you
don't mind Big Brother knowing you spent
all of last weekend been watching reruns
of Vampire Diaries
