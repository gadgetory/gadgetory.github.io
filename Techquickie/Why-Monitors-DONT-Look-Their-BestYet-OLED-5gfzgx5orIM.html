1950s we were paying the equivalent of
over 2000 modern-day US dollars for
relatively small black-and-white TVs
that required you to fight with a
finicky antenna and just 60 years later
you can have an incredibly high res
lightweight device that sits on your
desk for a tenth of that price so given
how quickly the industry has progressed
it's kind of surprising that one of the
best display technologies out there
today hasn't yet made its way to our
gaming battle stations I'm talking of
course about LED screens which are
common in both televisions and
smartphones
thanks to their incredibly good color
reproduction deep blacks and high
contrast so consider this there are
plenty of big TVs and tiny phones with
LED screens so why can't we figure out
how to put them into medium sized
computer monitors I mean you could argue
that having accurate contrast is even
more important for PCs than it is for
TVs and smartphones because a
professional color work is done on PCs
and be led has extremely fast response
times which is super important for
competitive gamers who've got a frag
lots of noobs in a small amount of time
so the challenge is actually twofold one
aspect of the issue has to do with how
the technology itself would be used on
desktops and the other has to do with
how OLEDs are actually put together
although Oh Ellie D delivers a picture
that's generally far superior to the LED
backlit displays commonly built for
desktop and laptop PCs they tend to have
a much shorter lifespan the organic
materials that allow the pixels in an
LED display to generate their own light
simply don't last as long as the back
lights in a more run-of-the-mill
LED screen more specifically blue sub
pixels tend to burn out much more
quickly than red or green ones due to
their chemical makeup so after about
fourteen thousand hours blue o LED sub
pixels will only be about half as bright
as they originally were the red and
green sub pixels degrade much more
slowly leading to your monitor
displaying some very funky looking
colors and not the good kind of fun
and while this is also true for phone
displays in TVs consumers tend to not
leave those gadgets on all the time most
phones shut their screens off
automatically when not in use for more
than about a minute and unless you're
running a bar or hotel where the TV is
perma tuned to a news or sports channel
you typically turn it off after a few
hours at most
hopefully this isn't the case with
computer monitors as they tend to be
just left on for much longer periods of
time which would hasten the death of
those o LED pixels the fact that we
leave our monitors on for such a long
time also leads straight to the other
practical challenge burning o LEDs are
much more susceptible to residual image
burnin than standard LED backlit
displays and on a computer screen which
often shows the same desktop wallpaper
and UI elements such as a taskbar users
could be left with some very ugly visual
artifacts whenever they want to play a
game or simply fire up a web browser for
goodness sake but even if consumers were
careful to use screen savers and turn
off their monitors as soon as they're
done using them it isn't just user
behavior that's kept LED screens off of
our desktops the manufacturing process
has also kept led primarily in the realm
of TVs instead of PCs because
manufacturing defects are much more
common in LED screens compared to other
types of displays making them more
expensive to produce o LED technology is
still common on phones because
manufacturers can stomach the cost of a
small screen being defective and even on
large TVs Oh le d-- makers can still
make a sizable profit because sales of
TVs tend to dwarf sales of monitors that
has left o LED computer monitors in a
bit of a weird space it doesn't make
much sense for companies to start
cranking them out in huge numbers just
for them not to sell as well as TVs in
addition to having to deal with
widespread consumer dissatisfaction
because people just decided to leave
their monitors turned on all the time
but this doesn't mean those of you who
want a nice looking o LED monitor should
lose hope
not only are there now a few o LED
monitors and laptops on the market al be
it at higher prices but the industry is
working on finding ways to increase
manufacturing efficiency and Oh le d--
longevity
including everything from printing the
pixels onto a substrate inkjet style to
using slightly different molecules to
produce light and color hopefully in the
near future this great piece of tech
will find its way onto desktops around
the globe but if it doesn't happen
nothing stopping you from just plugging
your 60 inch o LED TV into your computer
and kicking back except maybe your desk
sighs today's video is brought to you by
the drop and Sennheiser HD 6 xx
headphones these cans are one of drops
best sellers with over 60,000 sold with
the same driver as the HD 650 the HD 6
xx delivers balanced meds and natural
sounding bass community feedback LED
