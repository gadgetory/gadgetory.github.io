nothing to do with film aside from the
fact that they were all accidental
inventions in 1727 a German doctor named
Johann Heinrich Schultz was working with
silver nitrate that would change color
when exposed to light to figure out it
was light and not heat which caused this
discoloration Schultz tried baking these
nitrates he started placing cutouts over
the solution and exposed it to light
creating a permanent shadow of the
cutout unlocking the keys to photography
about 100 years later the wet plate
which used liquid iodine on a silver
copper plate allowed for more detailed
images other than just shadows this
method was used to the first true
photographs unfortunately the original
wet plate made only one photo per
exposure until 1841 when William Henry
Fox Talbot created a process that would
make a negative image just like a mold
for vinyl record this negative image is
used to make multiple positive copies
from a single negative image the dry
plate was later invented and used in
combination with a paper base to create
the first flexible roll of film these
rolls made photography portable simple
and consumer friendly the downside
however was that nitrate film is
dangerous the biggest issues were seen
in movie theaters nitrate film reels had
to pass over an extremely hot light bulb
to project an image it even caused a
fire in Paris in 1897 which claimed 126
lives to make matters worse nitrate film
produces its own oxygen so a film reel
catches on fire it must burn itself out
until the 1950s special fireproof booths
had to be built in theaters so what
changed in the 1950s that Daoists the
need for fireproof booths
cellulose acetate film happened or
safety film for short so why is it
called safety film
well most obviously because it didn't
create freakin self fuelling unstoppable
fires of course there was a downside
however about 10 years after safety film
became popular reports began popping up
of the film starting to degrade
releasing acidic ass
and unpleasant smells this became known
as vinegar syndrome and brought a great
deal of focus to the overall quality and
shelf life of film unfortunately while
this process has been slowed to about
fifty years in ideal conditions it's
still an issue with modern film so why
haven't we fixed this yet
well development of film technology has
slowed significantly due to the masses
mostly using digital photography methods
around the mid 2000s their ability to
quickly preview shots and store
thousands of images made digital cameras
much easier and more convenient than
film so a photography overtook the
market so much that consumer film sales
dropped to less than one percent of what
they were during film speakers so does
film still have ground to stand on where
is it headed well there's still some
advantages to film the main being detail
film doesn't have pixels like a digital
camera
therefore films resolution is calculated
through angular resolution the general
ability to distinguish small details of
an object standard 35 millimeter film
resolution falls between 4 and 16
megapixels with larger film sizes
reaching as high as 400 megapixels film
also excels in shutter lag increased
control over exposure levels improved
color saturation accuracy quality and
greater dynamic range lenses and and
camera equipment for film cameras are
also considerably cheaper in comparison
to their digital counterparts making
entry much more affordable so while
digital video and photography have taken
quite a toll on film it still clings to
life with many analog purists and even
social media photographers using it
exclusively ASA Graham has over 11.5
million photos tagged with hashtag film
hashtag film is not dead and hashtag
35-millimeter so for now film is still
alive but I wouldn't recommend using
nitrate film for your next home movie in
