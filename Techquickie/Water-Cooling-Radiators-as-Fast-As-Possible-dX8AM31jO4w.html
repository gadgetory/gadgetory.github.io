shaped scar on my forehead might
indicate water cooling is not magic it
makes your pc's temperatures lower but
it doesn't make your components output
less heat that means that an air-cooled
CPU that runs at 80 degrees or a
water-cooled CPU that runs at 60 degrees
are both actually kicking the same
amount of heat out into the room the
temperature improvement on them comes
from water's ability to move heat away
from the CPU to a large heat exchanger
much faster than air this heat exchanger
is called a radiator and its job is to
dissipate the heat that your liquid
coolant brings to it to the surrounding
air sounds great right so now you want
water cooling question number one I get
from prospective water cooling owners is
what sized radiator should I use and the
answer is usually the biggest one you
can with modern pumps and CPU blocks as
close and performance as they are the
size and type of radiator will often
have the largest impact on the system's
overall ability to dissipate heat
now most case manufacturers are actually
listing radiator compatibility on their
websites these days so life has gotten a
little simpler here but you've still got
some work to do as they don't suggest
exactly which product to use because
there are just so many choices let's
break them down a little bit
most prefilled liquid cooling systems
use either 120 millimeter or 140
millimeter fans and are available in
either single or dual fan configurations
now just to make sure you were paying
attention which of those four options do
you think is best yes the dual 140
millimeter fan radiator will outperform
the other solutions for a couple of
reasons by presenting the fans on your
radiator a much larger surface area to
cool you're allowing them to spin slower
and deliver the same performance giving
you a quieter system or spin at the same
speed that means more airflow through
the fins of the radiator giving you a
cooler system but let's say your case
doesn't support 140 millimeter fans and
you still want
more surface area and more heat
dissipation good news you can make your
radiator thicker or you can increase the
density of the fins that are folded
between the water tubes and the rad by
folding them tighter and closer to each
other
this approach does have a disadvantage
though making the radiator thicker may
cause interference with other nearby
components in some cases and both of
these things will require you to use
very high static pressure fans
I mean it's generally better to use
static pressure optimized fans on
radiators and heat sinks it as a whole
but for dense ones it can have an
enormous impact on performance now most
of what we talked about so far is for
folks who are buying prefilled liquid
coolers or custom ones but these last
considerations are mostly for the DIY
folks or anyone who bought an expandable
prefilled like the cooler master Glazer
240 l some custom builds are going to
require you to find a radiator that has
fitting ports on the top or on you know
opposing sides or even on opposing ends
those are out there but they're more of
a specialty item for people who are
trying to achieve a very specific tubing
layout in their build another thing to
watch out for though it's much less
common these days is the material the
radiator is made out of in a water
cooling loop if you're not using anti
corrosive additives you want to avoid
mixing metals unnecessarily wherever the
water makes contact with them brass and
copper in the same loop so copper in
your block and brass in your radiator
tubes are okay and most radiators are
made of these materials but I do suggest
using an appropriate additive if you
want to use an aluminum radiator with
that said if the fins in between are
made of aluminum that's just fine
speaking of appropriate additives I
guess I'll add the sponsor message huge
props to coolermaster for sponsoring
this episode of fast as possible
Coolermaster has a wide range of liquid
cooling solutions from the compact side
and 120 v all the way up to the
enthusiast grade and a totally
expandable glacier 240 L that I
mentioned before which I'm trying to
pick up right here there you go you guys
can check out the full details at
