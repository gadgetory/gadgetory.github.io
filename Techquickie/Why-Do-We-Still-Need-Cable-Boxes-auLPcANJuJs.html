old-school TVs used to have this knob on
the front that you used to change the
channels then when more than like four
channels or whatever came about you
needed what was called an analog cable
box so that you could finally ditch the
foil covered rabbit ears then they had a
brilliant idea and started building
decluttering our living rooms once and
for all for a little while until digital
cable hit the scene in the mid 2000s now
I'm sure at the time I wasn't the only
one who felt a little bit ridiculous
going back to prehistoric looking clunky
cable boxes to get these crispy new
high-def shows and movies so why did
they do it well at first there was
actually a real technological reason for
those set-top boxes just because a TV
could accept an analog cable signal with
its built-in tuner didn't necessarily
mean that it could accept a digital one
hence the need for a separate box then
fast-forward to 2018 and not only do
most TVs have digital tuners built in
but they have like smart features that
can handle use cases all the way from
video conferencing to casting YouTube
videos to streaming other paid services
like Netflix so what gives now
unsurprisingly a big part of the answer
has to do with the cable company's
long-running battle against piracy back
in the analog cable days the cable
industry had an uphill battle on its
hands unless a technician showed up on
site it was very hard if not impossible
to guarantee that a user hadn't spliced
together some wires to piggyback on a
neighbor's TV signal and the courts
ruled that yes users are allowed to have
VCRs and they are allowed to record
their favorite shows for their own
consumption so digital content was an
opportunity to take control of the
situation using digital rights
management or DRM in the form of these
physical boxes that decrypted the signal
and had to be bought or leased directly
from the provider wait hold on a second
- I can access plenty of my copy
protected programs with a smartphone and
this doesn't need a big clunky box on it
ok so it's true then that you don't need
powerful hardware to decrypt a scrambled
or a copy protected Desperate Housewives
signal in fact around ten years ago
there was a push to get a technology
called cable card into more TVs these
were small devices that used the old PC
card form factor that you could insert
into a supported TV or even computer
with a digital tuner that would
authorize you and let you start watching
no set-top box required well gee that
sounds great doesn't it the major issue
was that cable cards only supported
one-way communication meaning that
consumers would miss out on program
guides on demand and pay-per-view
options
and DVR functionality and although
American cable providers have been
required to offer cable cards since 2011
by that time the technology had already
basically failed due to its technical
limitations and reluctance from the
cable companies to support it earlier as
they wanted to instead hang on to their
own proprietary content protection
schemes these days finding a new TV with
a cable card slot built in is virtually
impossible and successors that allowed
two-way communication never really took
off due to weak industry support from
both cable providers and groups like the
MPAA who were fearful of a government
mandated one-size-fits-all approach
although the industry maintains that it
simply wants to be able to keep its own
systems to protect content creators and
continue innovating many skeptical
consumers have opined that the suite
revenue they get from those monthly box
rental fees doesn't hurt matters either
whatever the reason the industry fought
hard against a 2016 FCC proposal to
allow consumers more choice when it came
to set-top boxes such as buying them
from third parties and to this day in
the u.s. anyway there's no practical way
to get digital cable without renting a
box from your provider a source of
frustration for many as even though many
cable company
now allow you to stream most channels
online through a smart TV app this
method is more prone to buffering and
slowdowns which you can learn more about
up here that and cord cutting just still
isn't viable for those who want to watch
networks that require a cable
subscription in order to stream them so
bottom line if you want to get a legit
full fat digital cable stream to your
sleek OLED TV you'll probably still have
to put up with giving up a pound of
flesh every month for our clunky cable
box but I don't know maybe there's
something they could do to make them
more tolerable like like how about RGB
