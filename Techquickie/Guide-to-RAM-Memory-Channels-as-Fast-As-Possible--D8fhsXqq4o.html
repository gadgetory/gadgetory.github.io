with more than one stick in a kit
what are these channels everyone's
always talking about find out everything
you need to know about Ram channels as
fast as possible by watching this video
when shopping for computer memory
there's all kinds of specs to pay
attention to including the frequency the
timings the voltage and how many sticks
actually come in the kit and how many
channels they're rated for you can
usually tell by the little number on the
memory itself or on the box showing you
how many pieces are intended to be in
the kit that's normally how many
channels its intended to be operated in
before you buy your memory you need to
check your motherboard or computer
system to find out how many channels it
supports the easiest way to do this is
the manual or the manufacturer website
but failing that you can check the
labels on the motherboard itself or you
can usually tell by checking for color
coded memory slots so they are normally
coded with all the same colors for how
many sticks
you're supposed to populate at a time
with one kit this particular board is a
quad channel board which means it has
four slots that are one color and four
slots that are another color that
doesn't mean that you have to run quad
channel kits in it it just means that
that's what will yield the best
performance now a memory kit is just a
bunch of individual memory sticks that
are validated to work with each other
flawlessly in however many channel
operation it's rated for so in this case
a quad channel kit could be reduced to a
triple channel kit or a dual channel kit
just by taking memory sticks away
because all those sticks are still
validated to work with each other
normally that is to say that you could
normally take a quad channel kit install
all four sticks in a dual channel
motherboard and it would operate in dual
channel with your full capacity full
performance and everything normally I
said normally an awful lot of times in
that last shot there there's a reason
for that this is a quad channel kit
could I install it in a dual channel
board sure yes
would it work probably there are primary
timings which the manufacturer tells you
so if it doesn't detect correctly in
your dual channel board you could easily
change them around but there are
actually more timings in fact some
boards will give you access to secondary
and even tertiary timings on the memory
that can be optimized to work with a
particular
platform if the manufacturer sells you a
quad-channel kit they're expecting you
to use it in an LGA 2011 board not at
11:56 1155 or am-3 board if you want to
run in dual channel generally speaking
by a dual channel kit if you want to run
in quad channel don't buy two dual
channel kits because they might work but
you're better off to buy a quad channel
kit because sometimes those
optimizations even though there's
nothing wrong with the memory and
nothing wrong with the board can cause
stability issues and they can be
difficult to override and to diagnose
now I'm not going to try and convince
you that if you mix and match your
memory your system is going to explode
it's not going to work at all because
there's a good chance it actually will
however if you're populating your memory
with unmatched Stix there is a chance
that they won't operate in dual channel
or triple channel or quad channel or
whatever your motherboard is rated for
which can negatively impact your
performance in fact in this board right
here I've got a triple channel kit
installed in a dual channel motherboard
which can on some boards actually reduce
the entire memory bank to single channel
performance so if you need the extra RAM
capacity more than you need the
bandwidth there can still be a benefit
to doing this but in most cases it's not
ideal you're better off to take one
stick out or add another matching stick
another example would be a quad channel
motherboard with a single stick
installed this example gives you one
quarter of the total bandwidth that that
CPU might need or that that motherboard
is capable of delivering so it's just
not an optimal configuration whoa hey
