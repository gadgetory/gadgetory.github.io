the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos it doesn't
get much better than dunking an Oreo
into milk it just adds a little
something extra namely milk so maybe
that's why Google went with the name
Android Oreo for the eighth version of
its mobile OS that it's rolling out
dunking your smartphone into some
exciting new features so then let's pull
the newest version of Android apart and
have a taste of what's inside I'll stop
that now starting out is the
significantly revamped notification
system which you can now organize into
channels the basic idea here is to group
notifications by category and customize
how your phone gets your attention on a
per category basis for example if you're
using a messaging app like Google
Hangouts you can choose to only show
some chatter from an unimportant group
silently while telling your phone to
vibrate light up and even override do
not disturb when you get an angry ping
from your boss asking where that next
tech quickie script is and while we're
on the subject of notifications Oreo
offers iOS style notification badges
that appear on app icons if they want
your attention although you won't get a
number showing how many notifications
you have they will be drawn in different
colors to match the app icon instead of
that jarring lurid red that you always
get on the iPhone here's another one
if you've been using a Google pixel
you've probably noticed how it uses
round icons as opposed to the variety of
shapes you might see on other Android
devices with Oreo app developers can now
create adaptive icons that your device
will automatically adjust into a circle
square or rounded circular square
looking thing depending on your system
settings
another big visual change is
picture-in-picture that's right the
feature that was once a huge selling
point for sports fans looking to invest
big-screen TV for the living room is now
coming to your pocket the goal is to
enable users to carry on let's say a
voice chat for example while looking up
something pertinent in the background
sadly but maybe unsurprisingly though
you'll need to shellow for YouTube read
if you want to watch youtube videos with
the feature but the changes to Oreo
aren't all visual one of the most
notable under the hood improvements is
to battery life management Google is
promising again but no really it's a lot
better this time
but although the effectiveness of these
power improvements remains to be seen
one thing we are sure of is Oreos
ability to automatically re-enable your
Wi-Fi if you're close to an own network
keeping you from burning through your
data if you turned it off to avoid
stupid pop-ups about joining cat lady
house Wi-Fi when you were out and about
last but not least if you're an instant
messaging aficionado Android stock
emojis don't look like weird blobs
anymore so there's that though at the
same time Google also apparently decided
to use a blob like octopus as a version
mascot anyway Android Oreo is available
for these pixel and Nexus devices and
non-google phones and tablets we'll be
getting it in the coming months no word
yet though on whether we'll be getting a
double stuffed revision that has twice
the features and twice the regret do you
ever find yourself needing to control
two computers at once
well synergy is the solution for you
it's a software tool that lets you use
one keyboard and mouse with multiple
computers and the craziest thing about

different operating systems including
Windows Mac OS and Linux features
include clipboard sharing and dragging
and dropping files between the computers
custom hotkeys and more it's available
in both basic and pro versions with the
latter including SSL encryption to
secure the data sent between computers
and synergy is offering a 50% discount
