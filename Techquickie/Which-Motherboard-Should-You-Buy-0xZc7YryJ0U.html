was a major decision that could have a
real impact on your computer's
performance with bus speeds and built-in
graphics varying significantly between
models but these days with more and more
things being standardized or integrated
into CPUs your choice of motherboard
will have virtually zero impact on raw
performance so what's the point of this
video then isn't the solution just to
pick the cheapest compatible motherboard
and put more money into the rest of the
build well not necessarily even though
the days of fretting over a motherboards
beed are all but gone motherboards still
vary wildly in their feature sets and
build quality so what kinds of things
should you look out for and are they
worth the premium well since one of the
main functions of a motherboard is to
connect everything in your system
together we'll start by talking about
connectivity these days it's absurdly
easy to find things like ddr4 and USB 3
support on even budget boards but moving
up to a higher tier can get you MDOT to
support for much faster SSDs than what
you could get with SATA USB 3.1 10
Gigabit USB type-c and even Thunderbolt
for connecting monitors ultra-fast
external storage or even an external
video card it's also becoming more
common to see Wi-Fi on mid to high end
boards to give you additional
flexibility if there's no Ethernet port
nearby none of these bells and whistles
are necessities but they can be very
useful especially if you're working with
large files that could benefit from the
higher speeds but what is necessary is
the right chipset assuming you're
overclocking on the Intel side only Z
and X series chipset support
overclocking natively so you'll want to
pick up a board with one of these at the
minimum higher-end boards also tend to
have better power delivery that can
deliver more power to your CPU without
becoming unstable which can be important
for overclocking but has become less of
a priority due to Howie
modern CPUs can be and if you want to
have an A+ tower delivery a quick and
dirty way to check is to count the
number of power phases on the
motherboard with more premium boards
having eight or even more and some
models will go the extra mile to make
the experience as enthusiast friendly as
possible when it comes to thermal
management with extra water pump headers
and even support for custom water loops
thanks to hybrid heat sinks that also
function as water blocks for hot
components like the chipset and voltage
regulator modules pretty cool but not
crucial unless you're really trying to
push your system as far as it can go
another nice thing is the vastly
improved sound on better motherboards
not too long ago integrated audio was
terrible pretty much across the board
but these days you won't see too many
enthusiasts recommending separate sound
cards anymore
many nicer motherboards and even most
mid-range ones have superior onboard
audio or even electrical separation of
sound chips and traces from the rest of
the board to cut down on interference
and then toward the top end you'll start
seeing things like headphone amps for
high impedance headphones and although
many folks who are serious about audio
just get an external DAC and amp this
can still be an interesting solution if
you really want to keep everything in
one box of course this is yet another
nice to have not a need to have and at
the end of the day you need your
motherboard to be reliable and last
longer than your Pokemon goal obsession
did so beyond the usual advice of
picking a reputable manufacturer and
looking for a nice long warranty keep an
eye out for features like solid
capacitors which tend to last much
longer than cheaper electrolytic ones
which can leak reinforced PCI Express
slots might be a decent idea if you're
using a heavy graphics card and there
are even boards with special back plates
that reduce the amount of torque on them
when you're installing them or mounting
a cooler and
checked the traces from incidental
scratches finally I'd be remiss in 2017
if I didn't say anything about
aesthetics gone are the days of plain
green PC DS and now Arctic camouflage
dragon heat sinks and RGB lighting are
the norm some boards notably asus models
even have an RGB sync header so that any
LED strips you put in your case will
sync up with your motherboards lighting
effects you just blew my mind man but
coming back to the main point of the
video obviously if you're not
overclocking or water cooling or using
bleeding edge storage or you're color
blind or whatever you can pretty much
ignore everything that I just said by a
$40.00 motherboard that just has the
basics and you won't really see a dip in
performance speaking of not seeing a
different performance why shouldn't you
be able to browse the Internet
quickly and securely at the same time
tunnel Bayer VPN lets you tunnel to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as though you are in a
different country they have easy-to-use
apps for iOS Android PC and Mac they
also have a Chrome extension and all you
got to do is press one button and your
bear tunnels to the other country and
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched it is so easy to
use that my mom can do it and they also
have a top rated privacy policy with no
user activity logging so try out tunnel
bear VPN with 500 Meg's of free data and
no credit card required at the link in
the video description and if you choose
to get an unlimited plan you can save
10% by going to tunnel bear comm slash
