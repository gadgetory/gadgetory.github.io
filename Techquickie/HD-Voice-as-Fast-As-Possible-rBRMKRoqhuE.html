remember this but there was a time when
every house had a landline phone with
almost no features at all not even a
slot to hold extra answering machine
tapes but while modern smartphones have
literally thousands of uses for all the
ways they've improved on traditional
phones there's one thing that for a long
time they haven't done any better
actually making phone calls so you
chumps who shelled out over $500 for a
flagship smartphone are gonna sound like
but when you call your dad to wish him a
happy birthday son so what's the deal
with that thanks for asking Jerry here's
what happened reason number one for
shoddy voice quality is interoperability
which no it isn't which means the powers
that be that is phone manufacturers and
mobile service providers wanted to make
sure that your shiny new handset could
communicate with your sisters old low
bandwidth brick over the network
regardless of how they were connected
number two and I bet you
college-educated viewers saw this one
coming is cost to put it simply
upgrading for a clearer voice experience
was a lower priority than focusing on
faster data speeds for watching
high-definition video fewer dead zones
in their service areas and of course
massive profits to report to the
shareholders although arguably a lot of
people would agree with at least the
first two of those things but you feed
people gruel for breakfast and Kobe
steak dinner for long enough and they
start to ask why they can't have a
whipped cream and strawberry crepe in
the morning once in a while so while LTE
networks were developed primarily for
the purpose of delivering faster data
speeds as they've become more common
carriers and handset makers have finally
begun making serious progress on a new
standard called HD voice what's that you
ask well HD voice is a protocol that
improves audio quality by capturing more
of what you're saying you know I don't
mean that your phone had a short
attention span before what I mean to say
is that it can capture a wider range of
frequencies than was possible before
older phones were good for somewhere in
the range of 300 to 3400
Hertz but the human voice can actually
make sounds from between 75 Hertz and
1,400 Hertz a huge range that covers the
sensual crooning of Barry White all the
way to that horrible squealing noise I
make whatever new gadget arrives in the
mail so HD Voice uses the greater
bandwidth of modern cell phone networks
to catch everything you say between 50
and 7,000 Hertz making calls sound much
more realistic so much fun this concept
is similar to what you see in digital
music recording so if you're creating a
you know WAV file for example taking
more samples of the singer or instrument
as it's playing per second results in
more information ending up in the audio
file which up to a point means higher
perceived quality so if you're having a
conversation over HD Voice your phone
will actually sample your voice 16,000
times per second slightly more than FM
radio here's where it gets funny though
remember those smug pants landline
phones from before with their superior
audio quality well to use HD voice both
you and whomever you're chatting with
need to be on devices and networks
so usually LTE that support HD voice so
that call to your dad might sound crappy
unless he's got a spanking new
smartphone in a great mobile network
anyway but all of this is normal growing
pains for new technology and while HD
voice isn't Universal yet as more users
switch to new phones and networks the
day may eventually come when your
incoming calls don't sound like they're
from Alexander Graham Bell himself and
no you didn't sir speaking of history
