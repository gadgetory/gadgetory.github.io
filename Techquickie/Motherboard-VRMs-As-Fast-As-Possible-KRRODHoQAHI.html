wants something different for their PC
some people are like yeah bring on the
USB ports others want support for like
multiple graphics cards and others just
want like sweet dragon graphics on the
heatsinks but there's one important
aspect of motherboard design that you'd
be hard-pressed to find in a spec sheet
from your favorite retailer but is
extremely important the voltage
regulator modules or VRM so why are they
important and how do you know what to
look for when choosing your motherboard
great question and it might help to
think of the vrm as kind of like a mini
power supply just like your actual main
computer power supply takes 120 or 240
volts from the wall and steps it down to
12 volts not to mention DC currents the
motherboard vrm does this a second time
to provide your cpu with the you know
like one to one and a half volts or
whatever it needs to operate without
cooking like a lobster but unlike your
power supply the vrm isn't one big bulky
thing in a box that's easy to spot it's
actually made up of a few different
components number one is MOSFETs which
are often located under those big heat
sinks that surround your CPU socket
indicating that they do give off some
heat so the processor tells the MOSFETs
yo dog I need 1.2 volts or whatever and
the MOSFETs then deliver exactly that
much power to the CPU you also have your
chokes those blocky things next to the
MOSFETs that stabilize the current as
well as capacitors which both serve as
temporary storage for electricity and
protect against sudden voltage spikes
now admittedly these things aren't as
exciting as putting in a new $400
graphics card or whatever but the
quality of your VRMs can make a huge
difference for your PC for starters
cheaply made VR end can lead to system
instability and crashes even at stock
speed and very poor quality VRMs can
even mess up the power delivery to the
point where they'll damage your other
expensive components and if you're
overclocking you won't get very
a far with a poorly engineered vrm since
the correct voltages are so important to
system stability when you're pushing
your components beyond their rated
speeds
okay Linus then so how do I know what to
look for I've never even heard of people
talking about VRMs before well a couple
of simple tips can help you make sure
you don't end up having to make a long
trip to the tashi station to pick up a
replacement power converter one of the
easiest things to do is just count up
the number of chokes on the motherboard
you see motherboards split up power
delivery to the CPU into a number of
phases and more phases means the power
split more ways lightening the load on
each phase which in turn can lead to
greater stability each choke on your
motherboard corresponds to one power
phase and usually all but one or two of
these around the CPU socket are reserved
for your CPU cores entry level boards
will usually have three or four phase
CPU power but higher quality boards can
have six eight or even more it's also a
good idea to pick up a board with solid
state capacitors cheaper capacitors
contain a conducting liquid which can
cause problems if they're not made
correctly and even if they are made
correctly they're very likely to bulge
and rupture or even explode over time
which is what happened to a lot of
people during the infamous capacitor
plague of the mid 2000s solid capacitors
not only largely eliminate these risks
but they also have wider temperature
tolerances and a longer life span what
are these things even going to be a big
deal forever I mean CPUs are getting to
the point where they can do so much more
with so much less power mean for example
until skylake CPUs don't need as many
power phases for a solid overclock as
previous generations and AMD's upcoming
Zen architecture looks to be much more
power efficient as well nevertheless you
obviously want to make sure that
whatever board you drop your hard-earned
cash on won't fail more quickly than
your attempt to go pro in StarCraft and
on the subject of going pro why have a
shoddy website anymore it's not that
expensive on Squarespace
you can pick yourself up a website the
hosting service behind it if you pay for
a year at a time you can even get your
domain thrown in for free and you can
get the support via live chat and email
24 hours a day to help you build a
website that functions and looks great
whether it's on people's phones or their
tablets or their computers or whatever
else the case may be whatever kind of
website you want to build a you know
company profile website with neat little
pictures of all your employees or like a
blog or like a little a little store
where you sell arts and crafts
Squarespace will have a template for you
and it's easy to use so you start your
trial with no credit card required by
heading over to Squarespace calm then
when you decide to sign up for
Squarespace in the long term use offer
code Lynas to get 10% off your first
purchase
so that's Squarespace calm and go there
and do that thing so thanks for watching
guys if you like the video do that thing
if you didn't then do the other thing
leave a comment with video suggestions
if you have comments with video
suggestions don't forget to subscribe
and follow and if you're looking for
something else to watch we had a great
video over on our Linus tech tips
channel taking a bunch of different
graphics cards and finding out what the
actual difference in performance from
one card to another in spite of them
being identical can be very interesting
