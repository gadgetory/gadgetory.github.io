are excellent you're using one of these
to cool your CPU on today's fast as
possible we're going to tell you all you
need to know about the basic aftermarket
CPU cooling options that are available
to you now to be clear if you're not
overclocking that is turning up the
speed of your CPU the stock cooler is
very functional it's inexpensive in fact
it comes free with most CPUs it's easy
to install it's relatively quiet as long
as again you're not trying to do
anything crazy with it and it'll fit in
pretty much any case and will not
interfere with other components on the
motherboard such as high profile memory
sticks that stick up high like this the
problem with stock coolers is the
performance isn't very good look at the
size of this an aftermarket air cooler
can have way more surface area and use
much larger fans than a stock cooler
it's also inherently very reliable
because there's almost nothing to fail
on it it's great for overclocking and in
terms of quiet operation being able to
use large highly optimized high
performance fans such as this one or
even taking all the fans off it and just
using the case fans to passively draw
air through the large heatsink like this
can make your system not only look great
but be incredibly silent now the
disadvantages of large aftermarket air
cooling heat sinks can be mostly
compatibility I can fit it on this way
but I'm only going to be able to put a
fan in the middle because my high
performance high profile memory gets in
the way on this side and my mosfet gets
in the way on this side also if I
oriented it this way and I had seven PCI
slots and my top slot was for my
graphics card I wouldn't be able to
install that graphics card and you can
clearly see it's not going to fit on
this way at all if you buy a small you
know non cooling optimized case you can
even run into issues where the heatsink
is so high profile off the motherboard
that you can no longer close your case
side panel you do have to do some
planning and put some thought into it
when you're using aftermarket air these
prefilled liquid cooling units can offer
some advantages versus other solutions
they're very low profile on the CPU
socket usually the pump and the cooler
are mounted on the CPU with tons of room
around it for high profile memory or
MOSFET heat sinks or anything else you'd
want while the bulk of the cooling is
actually done away
from the CPU socket using a large
radiator you get that performance that
comes with having options available that
even use dual 120 millimeter or dual 140
millimeter fans and you get great looks
the only disadvantage for stuff like
liquid coolers is it does add a second
point of failure to your system so if
either the pump or the fan fails on your
liquid cooler then your CPU won't be
very cool and your system will probably
automatically shut down and they can be
a touch difficult to install so while
they come in a variety of configurations
thick radiators thin radiators 120 mil
140 ml single radiator dual radiator ah
you're going to have to plan for it if
you don't have a large gaming oriented
chassis there's a chance that a liquid
cooler like this won't even fit in your
system thanks for watching this episode
