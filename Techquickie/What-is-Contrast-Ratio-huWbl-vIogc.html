lately if so you've probably noticed
that the TV manufacturers and big-box
stores use a number of tricks to lure
you in they mostly focus their
advertising on the same stuff high
resolutions huge screen sizes and
rock-bottom prices all designed to
convince you to punch and elbow your way
past a bunch of strangers on Black
Friday like some sort of electronics
piranha but there's a crucial often
ignored element one that is arguably the
biggest determinant of overall picture
quality contrast ratio but what the heck
is that well although it's not something
that's always easy to find if you're
buying a TV or a monitor off the shelf
at a brick-and-mortar store you should
have encountered contrast ratio at some
point on a spec page if you're shopping
online but what do those values one
thousand to one 1 billion to one even
mean well you see contrast ratio is
essentially the difference between the
brightest white that a screen can
produce and the darkest black which is
very important because having the
correct brightness on different areas on
screen is critical for making dark areas
look sufficiently dark without losing
detail and for optimal visibility in
bright areas think of a shot of a city
at night a TV with good contrast will
clearly show you a dark night sky while
making the detail of the city lights
stand out if your screens contrast ratio
is too low the entire scene will be less
detailed and more washed out with dull
stars on a charcoal backdrop typically
modern IPS displays as well as better
made TN panels will offer contrast
ratios in the neighborhood of a thousand
to one meaning the brightest pixel will
be a thousand times brighter than the
dimmest if you opt for a more
unusual VA type display you'll generally
see better performance at least by this
particular metric with contrast ratios
between two and five thousand to one but
what about those spec sheets you see
that advertised insane contrast ratios
of like ten million to one
well if you look closely you'll see that
these numbers indicate a dynamic
contrast ratio which is a number that a
manufacturer claims a display can
achieve with backlight trickery so on
lower-end sets the entire backlight will
be turned up or down depending on the
brightness of the scene while on
high-end ones this is done more
granularly with certain parts of the
scene being boosted or dimmed these
dimming techniques are quite useful and
can result in better picture quality but
the experience definitely isn't the same
as having a panel that can achieve
natively an absurdly high contrast ratio
like an OLED one whose pixels
individually emit their own light
without any backlight allowing them to
perform this dimming functionality on a
per pixel level they can even be turned
off so long story short then unless
we're talking about OLED you should take
those 10 million to one numbers with a
huge grain of salt and for that matter
even OLED that might really have 10
million to 1 contrast ratios are
sometimes advertised as having infinite
contrast that should really be undefined
if you don't like / 0 error so you guys
speaking of / 0 and math errors do you
find a counting complicated do you wish
as a small business owner or freelancer
that you could just spend your time
doing your work and you could just like
carry your accounting solution around in
