computer that's so full of dust that
it's practically hairy
actually that's gross
dust is made up of any number of super
nasty things including dead skin cells
insect droppings tar from cigarette
smoke that one's really bad and any
other random junk that's just flying
around in your house and it's going to
gunk up your cooling making it less
effective and causing temperatures to
rise over time this applies to PCs yes
but also to other electronics such as
game consoles your hardware then goes
into thermal throttling mode that this
protects it from damage but it can also
dramatically reduce performance and
honestly there's only so much it can do
to protect itself eventually the high
temperatures will cause your stuff to
fail faster than if you just took care
of it properly in the first place so
what can I do about this - well there
are many ways that you can clean out
your junk but some of them can do more
harm than good
blowing on things might remove dust but
it can also introduce moisture which can
cause electrical shorts which are very
very bad by contrast can bear from your
local PC store is safe for use on
electronics and is great for clearing
out dust but use short bursts guys you
don't rather than just long blasts and
hold your fans in place while you're
cleaning them because if they spin up
they can actually damage the components
that they're connected to another option
is to use a vacuum cleaner but only if
you have one that can blow air out
sucking dust up from your system causes
static to build up at the tip that can
zap your components making them die
speaking of dying I'm dying to tell you
guys about audible.com all you got to do
is head over to audible.com slash tech
quickie and sign up to get a free audio
book with over a hundred thousand
audiobooks to choose from you could
spend every waking minute from now until
you die listening to audiobooks not that
I'd recommend that maybe what you want
to do is get a subscription that gives
you a few per month something like that
maybe you can check out World War Z if
you enjoyed the movie or maybe you can

War Z movie you could check out World
War Z because it has nothing to do with
the movie um so yeah audible.com slash
