this because I'm not really into the
whole instigating holy wars thing but
today we'll be tackling one of the
things that comes up almost every time
people are talking about their iPhones
and their Android phones customizability
now iOS operates one way the way Lord
Jobs and high priest kook intend for it
to with home button functionality
gestures app organization and animations
all pre designed to deliver a uniform
experience to each and every iPhone user
on the planet but that's not necessarily
a bad thing if they all work the same
way it's simple to search for a solution
to a problem you're having and in the
case of Apple specifically so much
research gets done to make the process
intuitive that for many people it likely
ends up working away they'd want it to
anyway
but that's not always the case and one
of the biggest complaints I hear about
Android even from diehard fans is that
while they might like the hardware of a
given phone they absolutely hate the
skin that's running on it software
layers like Samsung's TouchWiz HTC Sense
and Sony's Xperia UI one of the ways to
get around these often bloated
unintuitive and limited interfaces is to
route your phone and install a custom
ROM but if your issues are not related
to performance unremovable bloatware or
base functionality of the device but
rather just the look and feel of the
home screens and app tray then it might
not be worth the effort and potential
warranty concerns associated with that
because there is another option for
pretty much overwriting the stock
interface of your phone it's called a
launcher and unlike custom roms
launchers don't involve any command line
tomfoolery or risk of breaking your
phone just find the one you like on the
Google Play Store select it and tell
your phone to always use it the next
time you hit the home button jiggery
poof you're done now while launchers
come in many shapes and sizes with
widely varying capabilities and there's
a fair number that are kind of difficult
to categorize cleanly they mainly
consist of two types the first is style
launchers ones that are mostly designed
to change the visual appearance of your
phone without really innovative
the core functionality a great example
of this is one that changes your desktop
background to an always-on view from the
phone's camera that makes the screen
appear to be transparent but most of
them are focused on allowing you to
customize your phone's appearance the
second type is functionality launchers
similarly to style launchers these
usually introduce their own visual
design to your phone but with aesthetic
customization options somewhere between
your default skin and a style launcher
these launchers attempt to change the
way you interact with your device to
make it faster and or more intuitive to
get the information you need and the
apps that you're trying to reach by
rearranging icons adding new gestures
and even proactively providing you with
contextually relevant information as you
go about your day which I guess leads
pretty well into our sponsor spot for
today's episode if you've got an Android
phone and have never tried a custom
launcher before maybe consider giving
yahoos a v8 a shot it's a functionality
oriented launcher that's all about
organizing your phone and information so
you don't have to do it the regular app
tray is replaced by one that can be
scrolled much more quickly and includes
a search button your home screen stays
completely clean other than your bottom
shortcut row in any widgets you might
decide to add to it your most frequently
used apps are all automatically
organized into their main categories
when you swipe to the right and if you
swipe to the left a v8 provides you with
all kinds of contextually relevant
information depending on where you are
and what you're doing at work I've got
shortcuts for sending emails and Quick
Links to my productivity apps at home
I've got widgets for news and weather
and if I plug in headphones it'll be
like sup hears music apps it's free the
link in the video description

looking for something a little bit
different for your Android experience
