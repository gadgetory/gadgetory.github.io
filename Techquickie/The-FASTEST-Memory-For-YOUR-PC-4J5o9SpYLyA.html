something you don't give a whole lot of
thought to even if you're an enthusiast
as long as you have enough of a
compatible type things will probably run
the way you want them to but making sure
that folks do have enough is one of the
key goals of the next revision of PC
memory ddr5 so named because five is one
higher than four and the jtech folks
didn't go to the same elementary school
as Microsoft's Xbox team
seriously though the next revision of
DDR memory does bring the expected
increases in speed and the decreases in
power consumption but the big draw is
just how much capacity manufacturer
should be able to squeeze onto one chip
ddr5 aims to have twice the density of
ddr4 which is no mean feat because
packing that much memory into such a
small space makes it more difficult to
keep things stable due to like weird
interactions that can happen between
atoms but it seems they found a way to
do it meaning that an individual ddr5
chip could contain up to 32 gigabits of
data but wait hold on a second I mean
most of us with desktop computers have
more memory slots than we actually need
I mean it isn't exactly difficult to put
16 gigs of RAM on a standard board so
why do we need another revision of DDR
well although ddr5 will undoubtedly be
relatively expensive when it hits the
market over time it will make the per
gigabyte cost of RAM cheaper and
although RAM has historically been one
of the more inexpensive components for
PCs recent DRAM shortages have resulted
in price increases that have hung around
for quite some time so even if users
find themselves needing just 8 or 16
gigs of memory once ddr5 becomes
widespread they should be able to enjoy
some savings and ddr 5s improved speed
will also bring benefits in certain
scenarios now ram was kind of overlooked
for a long time by pc enthusiasts like
me simply because it didn't give
tangible performance gains in many
applications particularly in games but
there's been a renewed interest in
having speedy system RAM as AMD's rise
in CPUs are known for being more
affected by memory speeds than their
Intel counterparts with noticeable frame
rate increases being reported in certain
titles when you pair your CPU with
faster Ram and a high performance
discrete graphics card so what kind of
performance can we expect then well ddr5
frequencies are expected to clear 6,000
megahertz which will be a huge
improvement over the thirty-two hundred
megahertz mac speed of the official ddr4
spec this could end up helping AMD users
a lot and also any folks who are gaming
on integrated graphics cards that
leverage main system memory as V RAM so
laptop users rejoice this increased
bandwidth will also come in handy and
server and cloud applications but when
exactly will we reap these benefits well
we could see ddr5 kits towards the end
of 2019 believe it or not but the first
ones that hit the market will likely be
aimed at the enterprise consumer grade
ddr5 probably won't be available until
2020 and even then we might still be in
for a year or two transition phase
before it becomes really widespread and
more affordable so in the meantime don't
feel like you can't splurge on that siak
kit of RGB ddr4 that you had your eyes
on since you can still enjoy it for a
couple of years there are frankly plenty
of much stupider things that you could
have spent more money on for much
shorter term gratification speaking of
short-term gratification if long-term
gratification is your play then use
brilliant daily problems to train your
brain each problem provides you with the
context and framework that you need to
tackle it so you'll learn the concepts
by applying them and if you like the
daily problem then there's more like it
in the quiz on the left so that you can
explore the concept in great detail and
develop your framework if you're
confused and you need more guidance you
can join the community in discussing
these problems allowing you to go from
curiosity to mastery just one day at a
time so what are you waiting
