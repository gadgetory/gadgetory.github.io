with teeth it's a wireless technology
standard for exchanging data over short
distances using short wavelength you hdf
radio waves bluetooth transmits in the
is M that's for industrial scientific
medical devices banned from 24:02 to
twenty four eighty three point five
megahertz also known as the 2.4
gigahertz short-range radio frequency
band including its guard bands and as
such it's also completely colorless so
what's the story behind the name then
well the original standard was developed
by the telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994
as a wireless alternative to rs-232 data
cables it didn't receive the name
Bluetooth until 1997 when jim kardach
who developed a communication system
between mobile phones and computers
proposed it while reading the long
shifts by france gia benson a historical
novel about Vikings and the Scandinavian
King Harald Bluetooth legend has it that
he United the Danish tribes of that
period into a single unified nation much
like what the introduction of the
Bluetooth standard did for communication
protocols ok cool story Linus but what
does bluetooth actually do great
question in short it facilitates
communication between two to eight
devices where there is one master device
and up to seven slave devices
the Vikings am i right and while it was
only intended to replace serial cables
it can do so much more you can
wirelessly control and communicate
between a mobile phone or tablet and
hands-free headset car audio system
speaker system and intercom you can
network with a PC so like transfer files
you can control printers and computer
peripherals barcode scanners and traffic
control devices and even replace
infrared scanning in some cases and that
list is not exhausted by any means so
okay does lots of stuff but how does it
work well there are two main components
at the physical level well it works
pretty much the same place any other
radio frequency standard with antennas
that can broadcast and receive signals
in the appropriate bands but at the
protocol level things get a little bit
different to achieve a robust enough
action for communication use even in
environments with very heavy
interference Bluetooth communicates with
very short transmission bursts and then
quickly does micro hops around to the
various frequencies within its range and
it allows more than one device to
transmit on the same frequency at the
same time but constant transmission of
data means higher power consumption and
for years most Bluetooth devices
suffered from lame duck battery life
that pained users and made the standard
not practical for many applications
until a few years ago bluetooth 4.0 or
Bluetooth smart came on the scene it's
basically the power efficient version of
Bluetooth that has enabled amazing stuff
like devices with one to two years of
battery life on a single button cell I
mean I wish my phone could do that to
God as to power other stuff like the
screen but one issue with Bluetooth
smart accessories is that they can only
be used with Bluetooth smart ready
primary devices smartphones notebooks
tablets a qualification given to phones
that are by definition compatible with
Bluetooth smart accessories meaning that
there is no backwards compatibility
between phones with older versions of
Bluetooth like 2.0 3.0 and devices that
are equipped with Bluetooth smart
Bluetooth smart ready primary devices
however are backwards compatible with
accessories that run older versions of
Bluetooth one other cool Bluetooth 4.0
fact is that range is no longer locked
down so while manufacturers can opt to
optimize for more traditional 10 meter
or 30 meter ranges it's possible for
devices to work at 60 meters or beyond
so that's it
Bluetooth is a low speed interference
resistant communication protocol that
allows devices to transfer data across
multiple platforms at short range and
now with great efficiency speaking of
efficiency what if there was some way
that we could read books while doing
other things like driving working or
even cleaning ourselves in the shower
seriously shower speakers exist by the
oh wait there is today's sponsor is
audible.com if you enjoy reading but
feel like your time spent reading
is not being used as efficiently as it
could be then you should give

Fire series by George RR martin also
written by the same with some help from
others it might not be as good as if he
released the next books on dive in the
next freaking decade or so but it might
be enough to keep the you know
withdrawal symptoms away speaking of
withdrawal symptoms the best thing about
