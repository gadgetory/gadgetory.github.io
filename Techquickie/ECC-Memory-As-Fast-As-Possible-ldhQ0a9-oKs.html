crashes reboots randomly or shows the
dreaded blue screen of death for the
average user though this isn't really
the end of the world but some systems
like cloud servers or supercomputers
rely on being operational for 24 hours a
day and a fatal crash could mean the
loss of data service outages or cost a
company millions of dollars but for some
IP professionals this may seem like a
catastrophic server outage is actually
the end of the world the likelihood of
it happening thanks to technologies like
ECC memory can actually be quite slim
ECC memory is a term you've probably
heard floating around our channel before
but what does it really mean ec c stands
for error correcting code and the
principle behind it using mathematical
methods to check data for errors quickly
has actually been around since about 150
BC when Jewish scribes developed a
process in which they looked at the
number of words in a page or line to
quickly determine if there were
transcription errors ECC memory works
much the same way as it can quickly
check and correct for the most common
types of data corruption which often are
the cause of crashes and data loss okay
so why is this so important well the
more that we use cloud services and
virtual machines for massive
calculations and computing means servers
are not only important to large
corporations but also to the average
consumer take your Dropbox or iCloud
account for instance the servers which
store your precious data rely on ECC
memory to prevent memory failures which
may otherwise leave your data
inaccessible or worse lost altogether
many things like electrical magnetic or
even cosmic interference can cause a
single bed whose value is either 1 or 0
to spontaneously flip to the opposite
state as you may know each byte in your
memories made up of 8 bits which in the
case of your computer's native software
language might represent a letter or a
number if a single bit is switched to
its opposite position the result might
be garbled data and if this byte is
critical to a systems operation it can
cause a crash or a failure ECC memory
corrects for this by first performing
what is called parity checking which
involves storing an extra
parody bit that represents the sum of
all the ones in an 8-bit group the
result of this is either an odd or even
number one or zero if the sum doesn't
match up with the parity bit the next
time the RAM accesses the data then the
system will know that at least one part
of the bit must have been corrupted then
in this case ECC Ram will refer back to
code it generated using a special
algorithm when the good data was first
stored in memory and used this code to
correct the error restoring the original
8-bit block of data so that's cool right
but if you're asking should I buy ECC
memory for my next build and you aren't
making some kind of server where a zero
downtime is absolutely necessary then
the answer is likely no ECC memory comes
at a higher cost with worse performance
due to the greater processing required
and isn't even compatible with most
consumer motherboards not to mention if
you're going for that flashy RGB dream
rig you might be disappointed to note
that ECC memory PCBs are usually green
and typically lack a heatsink here in
certain scenarios and stuff which might
make the next dream build of yours look
a little less special to the untrained
eye speaking of untrained eye FreshBooks
is on a mission to make freelancers less
stressed and more organised through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
creating and sending professional
invoices in seconds what what do what
does this mean by untrained eye well if
you're not an accountant and you're
trying to run some form of business this
could actually help you a lot FreshBooks
helps you track your hours so when it
comes to create an invoice you know
exactly what you did when you did it who
you did it for and you can even accept
deposits from those people that you did
it for through their platform so your
work is paid for on your schedule which
is super important they also have a tool
to manage your expense reports their
mobile app lets you take a picture of
your receipts and pretty much handles
the rest getting started on fresh books
is extremely simple even if you're not a
numbers person especially if you're not
a numbers person fresh book says you can
try fresh books for free for 30 days by
going to fresh books calm forward slash
tech quickie and entering tech quickie
into how did you hear about a sec
alright guys like the video if your
computer's stable maybe dislike it if
you crash all the time and might need
some ECC memory I don't know man
do the button thing down in the comments
down below give me suggestions for other
videos we should cover on fast as
possible there's a lot of stuff to cover
but we've done a lot of it already
slight problem also check out channel
super fun if you want to laugh at things
this is like the serious channel where
we do serious stuff and we try to like
teach people stuff that is the not
serious channel we don't do serious
things over there doesn't happen thanks
for watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
