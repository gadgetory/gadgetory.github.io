the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos at some
point or another in your life you've
probably been in the position of being
drawn to something shiny and fancy at
least until you saw the price and if
you're like me this has probably
happened to you at least once if you're
willing to admit it at an Apple Store
but why do Apple products have this
reputation for being so gosh darned
expensive I mean I could understand why
the original iPhone and Macintosh were
pricey
they were category defining devices but
nowadays plenty of other manufacturers
are rolling out do-it-all smartphones
and slick looking computers so how does
Apple still justify charging a premium
well let's go ahead and get the obvious
and slightly cynical answer out of the
way first
you are at least partially paying for
the brand similarly to other companies
that tend to charge more for their
products that aren't necessarily better
than their competitors when it comes to
performance whar features Apple has
successfully positioned itself as a
lifestyle brand that can get away with
selling their wares at higher prices
simply because people are willing to pay
more for the logo but this doesn't mean
that Apple products are just overpriced
junk part of the reason that they have
this luxury image in the minds of their
fans is that they have consistently
focused on the higher end of the market
ever since the launch of the original
iPhone they put more consideration into
design features and component quality
compared to cost and this has also been
true of products like the MacBook now
the lower end of the market is indeed
valuable just ask McDonald's or Walmart
but Apple hasn't wanted to risk
cheeping out to make lower end products
that could compromise their brand
reputation especially after the failures
of devices that they did design to be
more affordable like the iPhone 5c and
there's more to manufacturing than just
the Bill of Materials or balm cost of
the actual device Apple invests have
and the development of new technologies
and manufacturing processes so despite
the headlines regarding poor treatment
of contract workers and Asian factories
I devices generally aren't cheap to
produce combine this with the fact that
Apple is relatively picky about
component sourcing and you end up with a
situation where once they do standardize
something supply for these parts can
become constrained raising prices for
the folks in line at the Apple Store at
6:00 a.m. and in some cases even
industry-wide Apple also has to sink a
significant amount of money into
software development because it has its
own proprietary platform unlike
manufacturers of Android phones for
example which can obtain the Android OS
for free from Google and then tweak it
according to their needs
Apple built and maintains iOS Mac OS and
back-end services like iCloud and
iMessage themselves which further drives
up their costs which of course someone
has to cover and although the
proprietary more closed nature of the
Apple platform has been a lightning rod
for criticism some of it quite
legitimate it's also a value-add for
many customers who choose to buy into
the Apple ecosystem as there's a
perception among Apple fans that having
software and hardware so tightly
integrated with each other
allows for better performance and
reliability along with less
susceptibility to malware and while I
devices obviously are not crash proof or
completely secure Apple has been able to
run a tight enough ship for this
perception to endure among its loyal
customers finally of course you have to
consider how much money Apple spends on
marketing some of their initiatives are
obvious like ads on TV or the hype that
they build around their famous or
infamous launch events courage but some
of their marketing costs are less so
take apples stores for example they do
serve as a place where you can walk in
and buy an iPhone or whatever but they
also invest in costly
highly visible locations iconic designs
and an experience in the store that is
distinctly apple-like what about those
free workshops and tutorials that they
host well those aren't free for Apple to
host but they continue to run them
because they increase brand loyalty so
even though Apple has recently dipped
its toes into more affordable products
such as its sub 350 dollar iPad and
competitors do sell products that might
have more powerful components at a lower
price
Apple has used an interesting
combination of product strategy and
marketing hype to keep people coming
back for more now if only they could do
the same with my online dating profile
