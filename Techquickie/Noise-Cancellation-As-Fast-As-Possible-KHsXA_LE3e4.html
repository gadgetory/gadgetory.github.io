gaming convention a concert or a
sporting event it might be part of the
experience but the incessant sound of a
jet engine when you're on a plane or
that annoying co-worker in the next
cubicle who won't shut up about the
missing stapler can drive you out of
your mind so how do we control unwanted
environmental noise without strapping
pillows to our heads enter active noise
control a technology for reducing
irritating background noise that most
often appears in the consumer market as
noise cancelling headphones so how do
they work well surprisingly they
actually block noise with um more noise
wait what how the heck does that work
Linus are you talking about white noise
or something actually not exactly
although it might intuitively seem like
cancelling out noise with other noise
doesn't make any sense
the technology relies on what's actually
a pretty straightforward principle of
physics even if you slept through your
classes as you probably know regardless
of what kind of student you were sound
travels in waves and waves have peaks
and troughs or valleys like you'd see if
you were hanging out at the beach if two
waves combined they create a resulting
wave that is basically the sum of the
original two so if you have two waves
that meet so that the peaks of one wave
end up exactly with the peaks of another
it'll actually dramatically increase the
amplitude on the other hand if the peaks
line up exactly with the troughs of the
other then we say they are out of phase
and the waves can cancel each other out
completely so noise cancelling
headphones use this principle by
listening to the background noise with a
dedicated microphone or microphones and
producing out of phase sound or anti
noise that literally destroys incoming
sound waves before they reach your ears
combine this with special noise
absorbing material built into the
headphone cups in some models and you've
got some pretty serious sound isolation
so if you want to pick up a pair of
noise cancelling cans to help you focus
at
work or just block out the screaming kid
that lives above you what should you
consider before forking over your cash
to Bose or whoever else well one of the
biggest concerns with this kind of
headphone is battery life unlike regular
headphones which usually just run off
the power provided by your PC or
smartphone or whatever else has a
headphone jack headphones with active
noise control need a separate power
source usually a battery so pay
attention for this when you're looking
through reviews especially as some
models won't mention at all how long it
takes for the battery to die and whether
you can continue to use them
when they're not powered you should also
consider how comfortable your new noise
cancelling headphones will be because
the extra electronics needed to mask
outside sound does add extra weight and
bulk and a poorly designed pair of heavy
phones may not be comfortable for
extended use and then finally for you
audio files out there don't expect the
same kind of expansive soundstage as you
would have expected from the open backed
headphone as noise cancelling sets are
closed to keep out as much ambient sound
as possible still though many headphones
with active noise control do offer solid
sound quality good thing too as noise
cancelling headphones do tend to be more
expensive than their passive
counterparts so don't be completely put
off with it even if it's not the kind of
thing you would sit in your easy chair
and listen to but then what if you don't
want to have to wear headphones to block
out distracting sounds a number of
companies are actually now making
speakers that feature the same active
noise control system imagine that a
speaker embedded in your car's headrest
to drown out road noise we've even seen
large-scale noise cancellation deployed
at the Eurovision Song Contest to drown
out crowds booing performers based on
what country they're from an interesting
application for sure but I wouldn't
expect to see it at your local football
stadium anytime soon speaking of things
you won't find at a stadium any time
soon not that you would expect to find
an online learning program at a stadium
