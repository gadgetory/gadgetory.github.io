seen that message pop up a fair number
of times perhaps right when you're about
to load up one of your favorite games
web browsers or other programs but why
does Windows insist on bothering you
like this
I mean you clicked on the program you
obviously want it to run don't you well
it turns out this is actually a rather
important feature and I'm not talking
about something Microsoft wants you to
think is important
it's called user account control or UAC
and believe it or not it can save you a
ton of headaches you see back in the
days when we were running older versions
of Windows up to and including XP the
operating system would just run a
program when the user asked it to and
while this seems like the way things
should be it was actually a massive
security hole by default all programs
were given privileges by Windows and I
don't mean like a little bit of extra
RAM for being well-behaved but rather
programs could essentially run whatever
code they wanted after they were started
now often times this wouldn't cause any
problems if an innocuous program like a
word processor was behaving properly the
issue is that this also meant that a
poorly coded malfunctioning or even
malicious program could cause serious
problems by making changes to the
operating system so starting with
Windows Vista Microsoft took away
privileges from programs that weren't an
integral part of the OS and started
directly asking users if they wanted to
allow a program to make any changes
instead of just letting it happen
without any input and although many
features included in Vista were
ill-conceived and later scrapped
user account control ended up sticking
around the most obvious benefit of UAC
is that if a malicious program tries to
mess with your system you'll get a
pop-up before it can make any changes
which you can use to deny it access but
many other things can result in Windows
saying to a program just what do you
think you're doing and asking for your
approval so installing drivers altering
many system-wide settings defragmenting
a hard drive or even changing the
contents of a folder that the operating
system protects like program files will
raise the suspicion of Windows and cause
a UAC prompt to appear asking for
administrator privileges so these are
the privileges that we talked about a
few minutes ago that older versions of
Windows just gave out like candy and
another feature of UAC called
virtualization even create special
virtual folders for programs without
administrator privileges if they try to
write to an actual protected folder like
Program Files to prevent important
applications from getting corrupted so
it's not surprising that when you try to
install new software you might see a UAC
prompt or even two since program
installers often have to make changes to
files and settings that Windows
considers sensitive and if you're
setting up a new PC well it can be
annoying since you probably have a lot
of applications drivers and I mean even
hardware to install so like we get it
and it's especially irritating to deal
with UAC when you're opening or
installing programs but we definitely
recommend against disabling it doing
this could allow malware to run in the
background completely undetected and
besides many modern programs are now
written with UAC in mind and don't just
assume that Windows will give them
administrator privileges so it's
becoming more and more common to see
programs that will run just fine without
UAC approval the most important thing
though is if you do leave it enabled
make sure you're actually using it
leaving it on only to just click yes
every single time without reading the
prompt isn't going to help you much it's
kind of like getting a smart
video doorbell and then just buzzing in
the crazed looking guy with the knife
speaking of knives don't cut away from
this video before I tell you about our
sponsor if you've ever been in the need
for a quick video clip for b-roll or an
After Effects template or motion
background check out story blocks we've
used them here on tech quickie and it's
really simplified our workflow clips
aren't easy to find and you can download
as many clips as you want at a low cost
to test in your project whether it's a
YouTube video or a video background for
your website so instead of letting your
creative needs take a backseat due to
budget constraints or scrambling because
a client made a last-minute change use
story blocks is affordable high quality
footage rather than like going and
trying to find someone to shoot it for
you we're gonna have them linked in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys like dislike check out our other
videos leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future fast as possible
and don't forget to subscribe it's like
really really important the most
important thing you'll do today unless
you brush your teeth oral hygiene is
very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
