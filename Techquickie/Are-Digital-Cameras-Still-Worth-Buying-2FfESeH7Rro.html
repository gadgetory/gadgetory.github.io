launch events are all pretty much the
same these days they're like there are a
handful of things that it seems like
they're all required to have by law some
magical or game-changing features some
sticker shock a couple of lame scripted
jokes from the presenter and the
implication that no this time for real
the camera is so good that you can snap
photos just like the pros do with
minimal effort but how much truth is
there to this there's obviously a lot
more to becoming a good photographer
than just having the right gear but is a
smartphone can it be the right gear has
image quality on modern flagship phone
cameras rendered stand-alone compact
digital cameras irrelevant or obsolete
well digital camera sales have been
declining for some time now at least at
the lower end of the market so a lot of
people apparently don't feel the need to
carry them around anymore but are they
making a big mistake for a long time
pocket cameras clearly outstripped their
cell phone counterparts for a number of
reasons one of which was the size of the
image sensor and you can learn more
about image sensors up here the main
takeaway though is that larger image
sensors can capture more light which
means your camera's processor has more
information about your surroundings to
work with ultimately leading to better
looking more detailed photos with less
noise these days though image sensors
and phones are starting to catch up to
standalone cameras although there's
currently still a limit to just how
large a smartphone image sensor can get
because smartphones are small highly
integrated devices that needs space for
all the other stuff that's inside many
phones though do pack sensors close to
the size of what you'd find in a
mainstream point-and-shoot camera though
we've also come a really long way in
terms of processing power in smartphones
which not only allows you to play 3d
game
and multitask with ease but it also
helps your phone make sense of what it's
camera sees turning it into a sharp
looking image with accurate white
balance and colors instead of the smeary
mess that we were used to on the camera
phones from 15 years ago
combine these factors with the fact that
modern smartphones make it ludicrously
easy to share your pics on Twitter or
Instagram and it becomes clear that
separate compact cameras oh they are
just for suckers right wrong actually
despite the convenience of camera phones
standalone compacts still offer some
important advantages many mainstream
compacts except for some of the ones at
the very low end of the market allow you
to change critical exposure settings
like aperture and shutter speed and
although some camera apps say they can
do the same in pro mode or whatever the
truth is that smartphone cameras use
fixed lenses without mechanical parts so
these aperture and shutter speed
settings on your phone are really just
software simulations of the same
settings on a separate camera which
won't come close to giving you the same
flexibility and picture quality in
situations where you're trying to
photograph fast action fine-tune your
brightness or get your depth of field
just right for the effect that you want
and if you are trying to take a shot of
a fast-moving subject the quick
autofocus available on nicer separate
cameras can really help your shot come
out correctly something that many
smartphones lack another massive
advantage is in the optics in the same
way that phone sensors need to be shrunk
down so do their lenses bigger and
better lenses give especially DSLRs but
even consumer grade cameras the ability
to gather more light for the sensor
achieve that desirable depth of field
effect or bokeh and even optically zoom
the image so you can capture a subject
as though it were closer up without
losing any image quality most phones
lack some or all of this functionality
and what they do have often comes with
assessing artefacts or other compromises
and here's another issue if you're an
absolute video and photo taking fiend
you'll already know that your habit can
quickly cause your phone's battery level
to plummet
the average compact camera can take many
hundreds of photos before calling it
quits with all of that said if your main
concern is having a straightforward
camera experience without the need for
any fine-tuning that shiny new
smartphone in your pocket will probably
serve you just as well if not better
than $100 point-and-shoot thanks to
other creature comforts like automatic
backing up to the cloud however there
are still a number of enthusiast level
compacts on the market with much larger
image sensors powerful image processors
and lots of options to fine tune
exposure and focus preferences that
smartphones currently can't touch and
that's without even trying to compare
the camera on an iPhone or a Google
pixel to a four figure DSLR with
expensive detachable lenses let's just
put it this way I'd be pretty surprised
to see professional sports photographers
trade in their pricy telephoto lenses
for Samsung galaxys at least for now
speaking of trading in why not trade in
your unsecured Internet experience for a
tunnel Bayer VPN one tunnel bear lets
you tunnel to one of 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as
though you are in a different country
getting around pesky geo restrictions
and making it so that folks can't track
your internet usage including your isp
they've got easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac also a Chrome
extension and it is super easy to use
you just turn it on and boom your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched to an anonymous
one they've got a top rated privacy
policy and they don't log user activity
and the best part is you can try it out
see if it works for you for free with
five hundred Meg's of free data no
credit card required so head over to
tunnel bear comm slash Linus once you've
decided to sign up for an unlimited data
plan and save 10% that's tunnel bear
comm slash Linus
