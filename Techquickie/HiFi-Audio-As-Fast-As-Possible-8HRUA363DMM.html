hundreds of dollars on a pair of
headphones and then sits in the corner
of the room clutching some studio-grade
CDs and rambling about gold wires and
two bands while listening to them well
maybe not but they do exist and what
sounds like madness to the rest of us is
necessary for some to feel like they're
getting a better
HiFi experience but what is this
high-five well insured high fire high
fidelity is a term used by audio
enthusiasts referring to the high
quality reproduction of sound alright
Linus then so hi-fi's just speakers or
headphones that are good right but
actually hold on it is a bit more
complicated than that the journey
started as early as the 1930s when a
violinist wanted to make a radio that
sounded like he was listening to a live
orchestra and would achieve high
fidelity when compared to the original
recording by experimenting with the
acoustics of speaker casings in 1948
even greater innovations brought about a
revolution in high quality audio some of
the key developments being reel-to-reel
tape microgroove vinyl records and FM
radio so the point of high five n is to
get as close to the original recording
as possible so while it might be fun and
it might sound good to crank the bass up
to 11 that would no longer be high
fidelity when compared to the source
audio so the what separates hi-fi from a
consumer-grade audio system
the most obvious thing the speakers a
hi-fi speakers job is to produce sound
exactly as it was originally recorded
and received by the speaker with as
little alteration or coloration as
possible they're generally constructed
with higher quality materials and
sometimes even exotic enclosures to
reduce resonance mechanical noise and
interference this makes them more
expensive to manufacture and leaves less
room for defects a recurring theme by
the way through the components that make
up an entire high five sister amplifiers
also play an important role in
reproducing sound
accurately it's very important that
these amplifiers have high quality power
supplies capable of converting AC to DC
power with as little interference or
electrical noise as possible being an
analog set up you know audio stuff more
premium cables and wires can in some
cases make a slight difference since
they are made out of more conductive
materials and more importantly will have
better shielding which is explained in
the video linked here and of course
finally the source audio itself plays a
huge role in the quality of the finished
output so in consumer systems it's
pretty easy to tell the difference
between a high quality mp3 and a low
quality bootleg but hi-fi systems take
that one step further and really bring
out the detail with high resolution
audio and while it might be more
difficult and I would even say very
difficult to hear the difference between
a high quality mp3 and a lossless FLAC
the proof is in the pudding and the
pudding is in your speakers I guess but
wait hold on a second line is you
mentioned headphones at the beginning
how are they different from speakers
well hi-fi headphones are typically
significantly higher impedance than
normal headphones this means they
actually offer more resistance than
standard headphones this is a carryover
for when they were originally designed
for studios where multiple listeners
would be connected to a single amplifier
lowering the impedance of an individual
set of phone significantly these
headphones though quickly became the
standard for hi-fi listening because of
their compatibility with higher quality
more powerful amplifiers they also tend
to have larger lighter drivers are made
with higher quality materials and often
have an open backed design allowing for
a wider more natural soundstage well
it's all nice and dandy Linus but sounds
pretty expensive and you would be right
sort of it can be in 1991 Sennheiser
released a set of headphones called the
Orpheus that came with a dedicated tube
amplifier and they claimed that it was
the best
HiFi headphone in the world this
headphone at times has been worth up to
$30,000 on the youth market making it
the most expensive headphone
ever made until its successor came along
actually very recently 24 years later
priced at 50,000 US dollars
with this in mind though HiFi is hi not
perfect and there are high fidelity
solutions for almost any budget with
speakers ranging from 40 dollars a pair
all the way to over a million bucks a
pair a price so high that you could just
hire a band to play for you full time
everywhere you go although I guess
there's the added benefit of not having
to feed or water the speaker's although
maybe that's coming in the future
speaking of things coming in the future
