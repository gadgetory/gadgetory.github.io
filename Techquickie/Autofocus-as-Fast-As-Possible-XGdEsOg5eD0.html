of the dinosaurs when a person set out
to take a photograph specifically a not
blurry one they would actually have to
send their assistant out with one end of
a measuring rope and then adjust their
accordian lens to the proper focal
distance I mean okay that's a bit of an
exaggeration but I think you guys get it
what I'm driving at here autofocus
optical systems like all things
photography related our complex and lead
to the necessity of many highly praised
peripherals and accessories or to put it
a gentler way there are many types of
autofocus systems which can be employed
depending on the necessity or
manufacturer specifications thankfully
these multiple types can be broken down
into two very simple camps active and
passive passive systems come in several
different forms but all operate by
analyzing an image once it has been
projected onto one or more sensors then
adjusting the focus based on the
qualities which help it to determine
subject distance or clarity since they
only respond after an image has already
been captured and then make adjustments
without using environmental data all
processes they enact are considered
passive they are mostly found in two
basic varieties which are referred to as
phase or contrast detection phase
detection can be found commonly in DSLR
style cameras and works by using an item
called a beam splitter to direct the
light from an incoming source onto two
separate micro sensors which are placed
on opposing sides of the lens
effectively doubling the image doubling
the image doubling image in older
cameras the user would manually have to
adjust the focus until both images came
in line but today software is utilized
that matches up light intensity patterns
based on peaks and valleys allowing it
to make a determination about whether
the subject is back or out in front of
proper focus now while phase detection
works well on high quality cameras with
interchangeable lenses the added cost
and bulk that accompanies it does not
always make it a feasible option which
by contrast brings us to well contrast
detection that is at least this form of
focusing works by analyzing the pixel
intensity of an image on the sensor
automatically adjusting slightly past
the
point of highest contrast and then back
again this is what causes that quick
blur effect that you might have seen on
your viewfinder before snapping a shot
but Linus I thought you said that there
were two different camps of autofocus
what about that that active thing you
mentioned before well yes I did say that
but in reality it was actually a bit of
a tease since applications of active
auto focusing tend to be on the less
than practical side so far these devices
work in theory by physically measuring
the distance between it and the subject
and operate outside the normal functions
of the optics system so two
implementations of this focusing style
have been seen so far sonar which uses
audible clicks to determine the distance
to the subject yes just like dolphins do
or infrared lasers like the one found on
the LG g3 smartphone these use a
constantly measured distance to
triangulate the space between the
subject and the camera adjust to focus
quickly on demand these systems have you
know some failings though such as you
know functionality ones like the
inability to work when shooting
something underwater or through a window
and more mundane ones as well like the
annoyance of having your camera click
every time you take a picture while
active focus can still be considered in
the experimental stage it seems for the
most part the verdict is still out so
whether you're shooting you know 4k
footage of yourself performing reviews
of the latest computer components are
taking pictures of someone pushing a
hoop down a dirt road with a stick
autofocus has what it takes to keep you
in the clear speaking of annoying clicks
if you're just finding your current job
is not clicking for you and you want to
keep your future career prospects open
then maybe give lynda.com a try they
want to expand your mind on a variety of
subjects it's used by millions of people
around the world they've got more than
three thousand courses available with
topics like web development visual
design business coding software training
like an Excel WordPress and Photoshop
which leads us to oh they also have
photography courses I mean if you're
watching this video who knows you might
have a somewhat of an interest in
photography and Photoshop all their
courses are taught by industry experts
with new courses added every week so
whether
you're setting you know you know new
goals for yourself to just you know
improve for the sake of you know tie in
that measuring tape around your bicep
and seeing a bigger number okay they
don't necessarily have courses on
lynda.com for that but the point is if
you're just trying to improve yourself
or if you're specifically trying to go
and get a new job lynda.com has
something for everyone and you can get a
