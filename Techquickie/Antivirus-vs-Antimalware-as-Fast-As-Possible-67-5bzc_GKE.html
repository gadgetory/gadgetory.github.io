viruses or other diseases and no one
would ever get sick but since little
nasties that make you feel lousy do
exist
prevention seems like a pretty good idea
doesn't it now for people the solutions
are pretty well established but online
it's not always so clear computer
nasties can be hidden in links
downloaded files and even pop-ups or
other advertisements so you'll need
software to protect yourself but how do
you know which one most internet
security companies try to market their
service as one of two things
antivirus or anti-malware but wait a
second - malware is just any software
that's smell or bad so what did viruses
just be a subset of that what gives
let's think of security software as
people and viruses as music or something
an anti-virus program would be kind of
like your dad sure he's got a lot of
life experience which is great but his
taste in music ah it's pretty much
straight oldies it takes a lot of
repetition for a new song to enter his
repertoire antivirus programs in much
the same way are mostly effective on the
more classic types of malware or at
least the types that have seen the most
press things like worms Trojans and some
key loggers will be on their watch list
but often trendier types of malware like
zero day or zero hour exploits ones that
take advantage of a vulnerability almost
immediately after it's found before the
software maker has any time to patch it
are not covered anti-malware programs
are kind of like Dad's teenage daughter
they have to be up on the latest trends
the most popular new songs but they may
have never heard of Hey Jude or Yellow
Submarine the software that anti-malware
companies make in the same way is much
more you know hit poor it or with it and
this is important because without great
software like malwarebytes for example
some zero day or zero hour exploits
would exist for months before we got a
reliable fix potentially compromising
the security of thousands or even
millions of people depending on the
severity the thing about them though is
they often don't worry about keeping a
fix for viruses that are months or years
old around
because by that time antivirus programs
should have them covered so then if
antivirus and anti-malware programs
attack different types of malware how do
you determine which one you should use
the answer is both whoa whoa whoa Linus
hold on a second there
I've heard that running two security
programs simultaneously is bad for
performance that is definitely true and
if you use both a real-time scanning
antivirus and anti-malware program at
the same time that could slow down your
PC and can even cause conflicts between
the two programs scan functions know the
trick is to run an active anti virus
scanner that serves as a catch-all and
have an on-demand anti-malware program
that you can run full scans with
periodically or when you notice a change
in your computer's performance but how
should you determine which program to
use well the answer and I know this is a
bit of a cop-out but it's true is to do
your research at the time you're getting
it watch out for paid options that are
redundant or only applicable in a
setting with multiple simultaneous users
like in a small business and check out
the latest reports on the effectiveness
of the various software's out there
because they're changing relative to
each other all the time
the good news is that there are a ton of
awesome antivirus and anti-malware
services out there and though this may
surprise some of the less tech-savvy
viewers free does not equal bad when it
comes to these services by the way I
