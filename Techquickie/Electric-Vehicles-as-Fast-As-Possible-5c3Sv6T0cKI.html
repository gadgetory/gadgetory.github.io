futuristic and driving one is probably
the closest you'll ever come to being
Tony Stark but when we compare them to
the gas-powered vehicles we already have
the question is are they functional
let's start with a history lesson EVs
have actually been around for over a
century now and we're even quite popular
until the invention of the electric
starter allowed travel over much longer
distances thanks to tanks filled with
petrol and additionally gas vehicles
could be refueled quickly at service
stations instead of needing to be
charged over time a convenient feature
to be sure so then why are consumers so
amped up now compared to the early 2000s
when GM's fleet of eveyone's was
discontinued and crushed for a variety
of totally aboveboard reasons that had
nothing to do with an industry-wide
strategy to kill it a big part of it
seems to come down to sex appeal and
some of the recently released and
upcoming vehicles are actually cool like
really cool like self unlocking
near-silent running drivetrain power
restricted to keep you from spinning
violently off the road cool but for many
shoppers there are some other factors to
consider too number one is the actual
practicality and the good news is that
this is rapidly improving with ranges
between charges today above 400
kilometers and even up to 650 kilometers
depending on conditions charge times
rapidly lowering with charge stations
being deployed that are capable of
delivering 270 kilometers of range in
half an hour and further innovations
coming like battery packs for your home
that sit in your garage and allow you to
stockpile energy from roof-mounted solar
panels or even from the grid during
off-peak hours when it's both cheaper
and less environmentally impactful which
ties into our second huge purchase
consideration
ecological impact because while the
range and quick refueling of gas
vehicles is certainly handy it turns out
that they emit pollution that depletes
the ozone layer the importance of which
caused our global leadership to spring
into action with no regard for the
profits of private corporations sorry I
couldn't even make it all the way
through that because even some of the
more credible sounding arguments against
TVs like pointing
that burning coal to generate
electricity also damages the environment
have easy counter arguments like well at
least it's easier to regulate and
maintain the modernity of a few large
scale energy operations versus having
stuff like this chugging around on the
road but to be fair some government
entities do or have begun offering
incentives for electric vehicle
purchasers and have even begun mandating
public charging station allotments it's
just that these initiatives often face
resistance for more than just big oil
for example since electric vehicles
generally require much less maintenance
and are therefore cheaper to keep many
auto mechanics and parts distributors
are understandably upset that we won't
need those regular oil changes or
sparkplug replacements anymore so all
that's left for this episode given that
electric vehicles amazing right - is the
gotcha shiny new tech or at least old
but recently improved tech is expensive
and lithium-ion battery production and
recycling still has a ways to go before
we can really call that eco-friendly
either with a straight face but I hope
that most of you watching can embrace at
least the idea of continuous
improvements on electric vehicles
leading to a better tomorrow unless
that's a truth too inconvenient for you
to face
speaking of inconvenience you know
what's inconvenient being a freelance
worker or a small business and having to
keep track of on paper or with like your
separate accounting software and then
you create a bill for your customer and
your mail it to them and then who knows
when they're gonna pay it fresh books is
the easy way to manage this stuff online
you can track your hours you can track
your expenses you can send out invoices
by email you can see read confirmation
so you know that they got your bill and
then you can allow your customers to pay
online so the whole thing is easier and
faster it keeps you running your
business doing the things that you
should be doing and makes it so you're
not worried about the little details
like you know what's cash flow like well
it's all in one place you know what's
the history of my invoices what's the
you know stupid timesheet that I oh my
goodness I can't remember if I work that
day don't worry about that if you're
your own boss you should be using stuff
that makes you feel like a boss so try
out fresh books now you guys can get a
free trial so you can do all this stuff
online and focus on making more money as
a business owner head over to fresh
books comm slash tech quickie and don't
