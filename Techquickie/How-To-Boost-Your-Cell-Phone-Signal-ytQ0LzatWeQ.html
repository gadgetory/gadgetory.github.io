won't miss any future videos we've all
been there
you're on a business call you're making
plans for the evening or you're chatting
up that girl you like when suddenly Boop
the line is deader than Paris Hilton's
singing career and here we are
it's 2017 48 years after the alleged
moon landing and we still haven't
figured this out what gives well there
are actually a lot of variables in the
average cellphone connection there can
be signal handoff problems if you're on
the move and switching from one tower to
another phone antennas are now buried
inside the device rather than sticking
out like they did back in the ancient
1990's at places like sporting events or
concerts tons of people uploading
selfies at the same time can overload a
cell tower and of course the world is
full of materials like thick concrete
that don't exactly get along with phone
signals but let's say that you're like
you know kind of like an important
person that needs to like stay connected
at all times how can you give your
signal a boost surely there's a better
solution than sitting by a window or
stepping outside to take a call you bet
there is one increasingly popular method
is to bypass cell towers entirely many
cell providers have recently begun
offering Wi-Fi calling as a free add-on
this uses your home or office Wi-Fi
connection to place your call over the
Internet instead of the cell tower
network to use it
verify that your cellular plan provides
you with Wi-Fi calling then enable it on
your phone like this on iOS and like
this on Android now Wi-Fi calling can
drop out if you move away from your
hotspot during a call but because of
voice over IP or VoIP connection can
carry much more data than a standard
phone network it supports much higher
call quality including HD voice which
you can learn more about here option
number two is to use a gadget called a
femtocell or micro
or network extender this is a dedicated
box that connects to your home internet
connection but instead of providing your
phone with a signal over Wi-Fi it
instead generates the same kind of
signal that you would get directly from
the tower then it uses the Internet to
connect to your carriers Network this
can be a decent way to go if you're
using older equipment that doesn't
support Wi-Fi calling but these things
can be costly at around two hundred
dollars each and you'll need to ensure
that your model of femtocell supports
your specific carrier adding insult to
injury you may actually get charged a
monthly fee to use it and furthermore
although a phone will see a femtocell
signal the same way it would an ordinary
signal from a cell tower so there's no
special setup required on your phone
some due diligence and configuration may
be required to ensure that strangers
can't connect to it bottom line Wi-Fi
calling is a much better solution unless
you have equipment that you must use
that simply doesn't support it okay then
what if you don't have a nearby internet
connection to strengthen your signal
well then you probably need a signal
booster which can take even a week
cellular signal and amplify it into
something that's strong enough for your
phone to use the downside to these is
that you can't use them in an area that
has no service at all unlike Wi-Fi
calling or a femtocell you'll also need
something to power it such as a car
charging outlet signal boosters for
homes and businesses are also available
and if you can afford one they can be a
great option for large buildings where
there are a lot of people on many
different carriers though for the best
results you'll actually want the antenna
outside preferably on the roof which
speaking from experience can be a bit of
a hassle of course much of the
frustration of having a weak signal can
be avoided by simply ensuring that you
sign up with a carrier who provides good
service in the areas you'll be using it
in the first place and besides maybe
it's a little comforting to know that
there are still a few holes in the big
data machine of this
brave new world speaking of frustration
do you find yourself racing against the
clock as a freelancer it's challenging
but thanks to the Internet and the fact
that you can get it you know anywhere
and your cell connection whatever don't
worry about the Segway there's never
been more opportunities to be
self-employed and for you guys out there

work it's a simple easy way to be more
productive more organized and perhaps
