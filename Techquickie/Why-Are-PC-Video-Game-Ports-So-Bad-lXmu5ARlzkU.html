between gamers who prefer the power of a
PC and those who prefer the convenience
of a console one thing most of us can
agree on is that any particular title
should just plain work as advertised
regardless of the platform be it PC Xbox
Playstation / Atari 2600 but
unfortunately there's been a noticeable
trend over the years in which games
initially developed for console just
don't translate that well to the PC and
when these games drop on Steam they
might have wonky controls underwhelming
visuals or even outright game breaking
bugs so why does this happen well a huge
part of the issue is that at any given
time there are only really about three
or four major livingroom consoles and
aside from minor updates every two years
or so every single Xbox one or
Playstation 4 in existence is using the
exact same hardware inside this means
that developers writing games for these
platforms know exactly what
configurations and api's they're coding
for making it easy to optimize
performance and functionality for that
specific device especially if consoles
tend to have exclusive developer
features to make programming for them
even more straightforward pcs on the
other hand present an additional
challenge in that games must be written
to work on an enormous variety of
different computers and although the
dominant setup is a modern 64-bit
version of Windows and a CPU and GPU
from one of just two different
manufacturers each there's still tons of
variation in terms of performance driver
revisions and what other kinds of
hardware and software are installed and
remember that on a PC games are sharing
resources like memory and CPU
I'm with other programs to a far greater
extent than on a console that was built
to consistently prioritize gameplay and
because of all these factors every time
a game is installed on another PC
chances are high that it's a brand new
environment the game has never actually
seen before so the games code has to be
adjusted to work with general
technologies such as DirectX and the x86
instruction set which can be an
imperfect solution that as we know
doesn't work flawlessly on every PC
every time and even to get it as close
as possible can be very time consuming
and sometimes tens of thousands of files
have to be rewritten to play nicely with
an Nvidia or AMD desktop graphics driver
instead of some specialized API that was
specifically designed for the
PlayStation 4 meaning that PC ports also
add months to development time which by
the way costs money money that many game
studios would rather spend on making new
games marketing existing ones new dlc or
pecs
why not ice cream at that point and
since consoles are generally
underpowered compared to current gen
gaming computers games originally
developed for consoles are often
designed to be less graphically
demanding so creating more high def
visuals for you no whiny vocal minority
customers with top-of-the-line graphics
cards like GTX 1080s and rx 5 80s can
also result in months of additional work
and this combined with the translation
of visual elements so PC api's and
drivers can understand them has resulted
in more than a handful of games looking
like a mess on a computer and of course
a game being written for a certain
console means it was also written with a
specific controller scheme in mind
meaning that the experience may not map
well to a keyboard and mouse and
although the concept is simply
mapping a controller button to a
keyboard key seems very simple this
process can still involve modifying a
great deal of code under the hood the
good news is that while there are still
plenty of bad pc ports floating around
consoles have been moving towards more
PC like architectures and tools like
Microsoft's new Universal Windows
platform might make porting games at
least from xbox pc much less
labor-intensive as games written for uwp
like Gears of War 4 don't have to be
rewritten for desktop computers but with
that said at least for now underwhelming
ports are just part of the price you pay
for being a member of the PCM are do you
