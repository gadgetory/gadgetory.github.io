mainstream to have a solid-state drive
or SSD in your computer or even your
phone and why not with their fast
response times and more recently falling
costs they're often recommended as the
best single upgrade the average user can
make to an older machine but most SSDs
are based on a storage technology called
NAND flash which has actually been
around for decades now and as we demand
faster speeds and storage solutions that
can handle tons of requests at once
which is especially important for all
those cloud-based services that we love
this aging technology will become more
and more of a bottleneck enter Intel
obtain a new fundamentally different
storage tech based on what Intel is
calling 3d crosspoint although they're
treating exactly what sorts of materials
they're using in 3d crosspoint and how
they're arranged as a top secret what I
can tell you is that obtained has a few
major advantages first up is latency the
delay between an i/o request and the
drive acting on it although op gains
latency isn't as low as the cache on
your CPU or as low as your system RAM it
is much lower than any of these existing
storage technologies and yet obtains
data density is much higher than Ram
meaning that it can be deployed as
either Ram like working memory or even
as longer-term storage due to its
combination of quick access times and
high capacities on the subject of using
obtain for storage to be clear it won't
be replacing the mechanical hard drive
anytime soon but unlike Ram it's non
volatility me
that it can retain data for a relatively
long time without a constant supply of
power and it's faster than even the
fastest NAND SSDs across the board
including in the small random reads and
writes at low queue depth that account
for the bulk of the average person's
usage not just in cherry-picked
benchmarks that don't reflect the real
world
in fact octane can hit close to a
100,000 I ops at a queue depth of 1 and
over quadruple that at around queue
depth 8 not queue depth of 32 which many
SSD makers advertise but which virtually
never occur in real life octane also
provides much better quality of service
meaning that random dips in performance
are far less common and it can handle
many more transactions per second so
performance doesn't degrade nearly as
much even when the drive is getting
slammed with i/o requests this could end
up being very important on the server
and cloud side of things meaning like
video messages or controller inputs in
cloud games could go in and out work
quickly and reliably
if these enterprises started using
octane and it looks like the technology
should catch on due to its lower cost
per transaction obtains ability to be
used as high capacity Ram could also
make it a compelling solution for things
like machine learning think about
developing software for self-driving
cars for example and scientific research
we're having a large pool of working
memory is more important than having it
be as fast as possible but line is good
I'm not a scientist researching
artificial intelligence I just want to
know how I can get this stuff in my home
battle station well right now the only
octane product available on the consumer
level is an n dot to obtain cache
solution available in 16 or 32
byte capacities that places frequently
youth data like operating system files
and save games on to the cache
automatically which in some situations
is faster than running things off of an
SSD even if your main disk that it's
accelerating is a mechanical hard drive
there is a catch though you'll need a
supported platform namely a KB Lake or
newer CPU and a 200 series or newer
Intel chipset as the company didn't want
to do the validation and testing on
anything older or for that matter
anything
AMD opting instead to tell consumers we
know this hardware setup will work so
use that the good news is that this
octane cache drive looks like it's going
to be supported by nearly all major
motherboard manufacturers as well as the
big boy Oh II ends like Dell HP and
Lenovo and there's more good news
assuming you've got the dollar dollar
bills there will be a full fat obtained
storage solution that will function as a
normal drive over a PCI Express slot or
a u dot 2 port without needing a
specific motherboard though
high-capacity octane drives in an MDOT
two form factor probably won't be
available any time soon due to power and
thermal concerns so then that's today
but octane is so fast that it currently
saturates a PCI Express 3.0 x4
connection which has a theoretical max
speed of a little under 4 gigabytes per
second so at some point we should expect
to see new interconnects and protocols
that can fully harness the potential of
octane whether you're modeling the best
way to build Skynet coding a real-world
matrix or you're just worried about
Google Chrome loading a few fractions of
a second more quickly have you ever
thought to yourself gee me its 2017 why
don't I have a website about that thing
whether it's a small business you run or
their little league team you coach or
just you know cool you know facts about
dogs that you think everybody should
know well there's pretty much no excuse
because Squarespace lets you do it
inexpensively and it's super easy to use
it starts at twelve bucks a month and
you get a free domain thrown in if you
by Squarespace for the year they've got
24/7 support via live chat and email and
all you got to do is pick out one of
their gorgeous templates type any type
any type of way all the copy you want on
the site throw in the images you want
and boom you've got a functional website
that looks and feels great to use and if
our experience is anything to go by
never goes down because Squarespace is
all about ease of use and reliability so
try it out head over to Squarespace comm
we've got that linked in the video
description and give it a try they've
got a 14-day trial that costs you
nothing then when you decide to sign up
make sure you use offer code text
