you how to determine what kind of fans
are compatible with your case or cooler
and how to install them figuring out
which fan is compatible with your case
if you have an aftermarket case as a
snap check the manufacturer website look
on the side of the box or check the
manual it'll tell you which mounting
points correspond to which fan sizes if
you don't know what kind you need then
it becomes a little bit more challenging
grab a measuring tape and you can either
take an existing fan that's the same as
the one you're looking for
and simply measure across the fan not
diagonal to find out what size it is
they come in standard sizes 80
millimeter 92 millimeter 120 millimeter
and 140 millimeter are the most common
ones or if you don't have access to a
fan you can simply find the mounting
holes in the case measure from the
middle of one hole to the middle of
another hole again not diagonally and
look for a measurement that's slightly
lower than the size of a standard fan
mount so for example a 120 millimeter
fan has holes that measure from Center
to Center
about a hundred and five millimeters in
general you want the air to flow from
the bottom front of your case to the top
back this ensures adequate cooling for
all the components inside but and don't
be embarrassed if you've wondered about
this not everyone knows how to tell
which side of the fan the air comes out
of and which side is an intake so on
most fans it's actually labeled if you
look closely there's one arrow that
indicates the direction that the blades
are spinning and another one that
indicates which way the airs coming out
but don't worry about it too much if
your fan isn't labeled because all you
have to do is find the pieces of plastic
that are holding the middle hub that is
where the motors situated and in general
the fan will actually be blowing air out
away from that side so if you wanted to
use it as an exhaust fan you just have
the sticker pointed towards the outside
of the case and it would be blowing in
that direction
installing a fan is simple in most cases
you're actually just going to use for
fan specific screws they're specially
threaded so they actually cut into the
plastic of the fan you just screw those
in and they're attached to the case
however there's a slight disadvantage to
using screws or what's called a hard
mount and that is that vibrations from
the fans particularly lower quality fans
can be transferred to your case if you
don't want those vibrations you can use
rubber isolator mounts many high-quality
fans come with them already but you can
also purchase them separately that way
the spinning motor of the fan actually
is in no way in direct contact with the
metal of the case reducing the risk of
vibrations until you plug the fan into
the power supply it won't get any power
so there's a couple different ways to do
that this one right here is a 4-pin
molex it has two wires one up for
positive 1 for negative that's it you
can't monitor the fan and you can't
control it because you're usually going
to be plugging that directly into the
power supply next we have a three pin
fan connector this can be plugged into
the power supply using an adapter which
will be included with most high quality
fans or you can plug it into your
motherboard where you can use that third
wire to sense the RPM and give you a
warning if something goes wrong and you
can actually adjust the fan speed using
voltage control which is a less
sophisticated way next we have a four
pin pwm fan connector this one adds an
additional pin that is dedicated to just
controlling fan speed most newer
motherboards will use these babies
