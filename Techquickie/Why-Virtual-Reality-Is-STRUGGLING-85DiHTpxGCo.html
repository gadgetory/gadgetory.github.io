hit the market a couple of years ago the
gaming world was stoked at the
possibility of everyone being able to
strap on a headset and be instantly
immersed in a realistic virtual world
that responded to the players every move
seamlessly so hyped was the potential of
VR that Facebook famously spent two
billion dollars to acquire oculus VR in
2014 but here we are a few years later
and the VR scene is as stagnant as swamp
water with headset manufacturers
slashing their prices in a vain attempt
to boost their sales but why I mean the
graphics have certainly come a long way
since the Virtual Boy flopped well
although many folks who have tried one
of these newfangled VR headsets have
come away impressed with the experienced
VR has fallen short in areas other than
what you see in here once you put on the
headset for one the high frame rates
needed for a smooth VR experience that
won't break your immersion or make you
sick demands fairly high-end computer
hardware which when combined with an
expensive VR headset is out of reach for
many consumers Plus even if you have the
money for a VR setup they are not immune
to a criticism that is common in many
wearables people just don't particularly
want to wear a bunch of gadgets you can
learn more about that up here but many
consumers were reportedly turned off by
the weight and bulk of VR headsets as
well as the tentacle-like cables
connecting them to their PC or
Playstation as it were and on the
subject of bulk the sheer amount of
space needed to get the full room scale
VR experience is a straight-up
non-starter for folks who live in
smaller spaces especially if they
already have a large gaming tower in
battle station that's taking up a bunch
of room then there's the lack of solid V
are focused games out there developer
reception to VR platforms has been a
little lackluster due to tepid sales of
the headsets themselves creating a
chicken-and-egg problem where it's hard
for the entire ecosystem to gain
momentum you can only sell so many units
based on Robo recall and you can only
play so much Robo recall before you like
and this is a problem that is
exacerbated by the fact that VR
development is more difficult and
expensive than regular game development
due to the technological challenges
involved for one thing the game engines
that are needed to develop and refine
these VR titles are still themselves
being developed since the tech is
relatively new and there aren't that
many developers with you know deep
resumes about their all their experience
working on VR over the last 10 or 20
years because like it's new uh-huh so
are we saying then that we should just
give up any hope that VR will ever be
relevant oh no at least not in the long
term the technology does have potential
especially when you consider that
mainstream VR headsets have only been
around a few years and the wireless
adapters for them are starting to appear
on the market
additionally VR could simply prove to be
more popular for applications other than
gaming than we expected such as
education healthcare engineering for
well CDR uses but it's also pretty clear
that with the obstacles we have it may
be quite a few years before VR becomes a
fixture in our homes especially as
augmented reality experiences and this
includes everything from snapchat
filters to Pokemon go have commanded far
more attention in the immersive
entertainment space with developers
seeing it as a much more lucrative cash
cow than VR gaming but don't worry if
spending half your paycheck on a VR
setup is unrealistic for you there's
good news I hear that sitting in a real
cubicle for eight hours a day is
actually a pretty close approximation of
job simulator in VR anyway speaking of
cubicles why look at your cubicle walls
