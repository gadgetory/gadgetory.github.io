landscape photo or something and
wondered what the photographer was able
to pull out of his or her bag of tricks
to make it look so much more dramatic
than the shots you take on your
smartphone although there are plenty of
techniques that you can use to make your
shot memorable investing in a good
wide-angle lens would be near the top of
the list but what makes a wide-angle
lens
special and what can you do with the
mother than take close-up videos of
animals or better yet animals wearing
hats let's start with a quick lesson
whether a lens is considered wide-angle
or not depends on its focal length which
is just the distance between the point
in space where your lens focuses
incoming light and the digital sensor in
your camera that actually captures the
image if that distance is less then the
standard 35 millimeters then you can
refer to the lens as wide-angle well
line is thank you for sharing your
obviously vast knowledge of physics with
us the unwashed masses but I'm actually
no closer to understanding this huh yeah
you're right I should probably clarify
focal length matters because it defines
how much of your surroundings can
actually be photographed in a given shot
for example wide-angle lenses with a
very small focal length let's say 15
millimetres Bend light more strongly
than ordinary lenses which puts
everything that your camera sees into
focus very quickly exactly the opposite
of telephoto lenses which can only focus
on smaller parts of a scene but a short
focal length allows the lens to capture
up to a hundred and eighty degrees of a
scene if you're willing to put up with
that distorted fisheye effect producing
very dramatic looking glimpses of
everything from vast mountain ranges to
cityscapes to Brandeis indoor spaces
like Vegas casinos but let's say you're
interested in something else other than
just taking pictures of landscapes what
else can you do with a wide-angle lens
well let's suppose you want to capture a
close-up shot of something but set it
against a cool background wide-angle
lenses are great for making small
closeby objects look huge so we can see
a lot of their details while making
faraway
look very small and very far away indeed
and they do all of this while keeping
all of it in reasonably sharp focus so a
wide-angle lens is a great option if you
want to include details of both the
foreground and background in your
composition or if you just want to make
a picture of a bowl of fruit or
something looks super dramatic but
photos of small objects aren't the only
things wide-angle lenses excel out
either they're also great for pictures
of big stuff in small spaces photos of
hotel rooms on travel sites are often
taken with wide-angle lenses to make
them look more spacious than they really
are
there are even wide-angle webcams as
well as lenses that you can stick on
your cell phone so you don't have to
smush faces with your friend whenever
you want to take a super awesome selfie
and if any of those sound good to you or
if you just need another lens in your
photography Arsenal to experiment with
keep in mind that because wide-angle
lenses bend light differently than
traditional lenses they can also present
some special challenges for example if
you aim your camera too high or too low
either the top or bottom half of your
shot is going to look weirdly stretched
or distorted so unless you want your
photos to come out looking like a
Salvador Dali painting try to keep
things level and because they capture so
much of your surroundings wide-angle
lenses aren't good for zooming in on
faraway objects or shots where you want
some realistic blurriness in the
background so the long and short of it
is remember to be cautious
like all photography tools wide-angle
lenses can produce amazing results in
the hands of an expert but if you're not
careful all it's going to do is make
your nose look big speaking of things
that could change the shape of your face
if you're not careful Dollar Shave Club
