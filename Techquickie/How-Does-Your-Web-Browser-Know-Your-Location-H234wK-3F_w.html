smartphones were pretty great right when
you're out looking for the nearest
all-night dumpling house that
handy-dandy gadget in your pocket can
use GPS satellites to triangulate your
position and direct you to the nearest
food fix but what about the times when
you'd rather not have the powers-that-be
tracking your location maybe while
you're sitting at home on your PC you
fire up a mapping site in your web
browser and wait a minute this thing
doesn't have GPS but it knows where I am
down to a few meters what black magic is
this
well part of the way your location can
be determined is by looking at your
public IP address which every site you
visit needs so that it knows where to
send the data you request
now each isp owns a certain range of IP
addresses that correspond to different
geographic locations often the
particular city that they then assigned
the customers and since these addresses
are assigned to your isp by large
registries who make location data public
it's easy for most sites to know your
general location assuming you aren't
using a VPN or something like that but
that still doesn't explain how Google
Maps can place a blue dot directly on my
house I mean did Larry page's personal
helicopter just fly over
well no unless you're using a desktop PC
that's a few years old you're on a
device that probably supports Wi-Fi and
if your Wi-Fi router has ever connected
to or even just been in range of a
gps-enabled gadget like a smart phone
this is some next-level stuff right here
that phone will actually take note of
the MAC addresses the unique identifiers
for every network enabled device of all
the wireless access points that are
close enough for them to see
then it'll for that information along
with the phone's location to a database
maintained by Google if you're on
Android or Apple if you're on iOS whoa
so these companies know were a huge
number of the access points and routers
floating around out there or located
even if they aren't public and if a
router gets moved to a different
location these say the basis will likely
be updated the next time a phone
connects to it now obviously this is
hugely convenient for using services
that need to know you look
when you don't have a good GPS signal
not to mention that GPS alone is a
battery hog and takes a lot longer to
try you late your location than the
Wi-Fi ADA base but I can't say I'd blame
you if you weren't concerned about these
companies keeping tabs on where every
wireless router lives even the one that
sits on your countertop in your kitchen
so is there any way to opt out of this
well yes in theory it seems like every
other week we found out that oops it
turns out we were logging all that data
you told us not to you anyway lol sorry
but anyway in theory Microsoft and
Google allow you to keep your router out
of their location databases for google
you can add underscore no map to the end
of your Wi-Fi networks name or SSID
while microsoft offers a web page where
you can enter your aps MAC address which
you can usually find on an attached
sticker but there doesn't appear to be a
similar escape hatch for Apple at this
time go figure
and if you want to keep your client
devices for being tracked again in
theory disable location or location
services on Android or iOS and don't
allow your browser to send your location
to web sites if you're on a desktop PC
now they're typically configured to ask
you first anyway but it's worth
double-checking because if you do send
your location out even using a VPN may
not help ask you where you are if your
PC has a Wi-Fi connection that can see
surrounding networks even if you're only
using a wired connection at the time so
make sure that you disable your Wi-Fi
outright if you're concerned about
others knowing where you are and
speaking about others knowing where you
are this episode has been brought to you
by tunnel bear the easy to use VPN app
when people are shopping for a VPN one
of the features they look for our kill
switches before you connect to a network
your device starts to send information
about itself and what it wants to do it
tries to establish connections with all
sorts of things and there are a bunch of
other devices trying to connect to yours
kill switches stop this from happening
before you connect to your VPN all of
your traffic is unencrypted so in the
few seconds it takes to connect you've
probably already broadcast your IP maybe
a few DNS requests or even a search
query Vigilant bear from tunnel bear
stops us from happening by blocking all
inbound and outbound
traffic so nothing leaks out before you
connect this helps keep your private
throughout your entire connection time
if your connection goes down for some
reason vigil and Barrett kicks back in
and stops all outbound and inbound
traffic until the connection comes back
for a free trial of tunnel Barrett go to
