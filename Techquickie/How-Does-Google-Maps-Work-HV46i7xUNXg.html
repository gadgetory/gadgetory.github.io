won't miss any future videos it used to
be that looking something up on a map
meant unfolding a huge piece of paper
you kept in your glove box and driving
past the turnoff to Des Moines in the
time it took to find section a 53 fast
forward a few years and now thanks to
Google Maps you can zoom in so far on
nearly any Street in the world that
whether you want a bodega in the Big
Apple or just a regular Apple in
Manhattan Kansas you're not bound to
have a problem but this unprecedented
level of detail didn't happen overnight
Google managed to get a foothold in the
online mapping scene back in the mid
2000s when it acquired whereto
technologies who had the idea to let
people scroll around on a map without
having to refresh a novel concept that
helped set Google Maps apart early on
but they needed more than just a pretty
interface fortunately Google is first
and foremost a data company so they
often start by working directly with
national and local government offices to
determine not only exactly where every
road is but how lanes are spaced and
allocated on freeways to give an
accurate base experience unfortunately
oftentimes the government won't or isn't
able to provide a completely accurate
picture of how an area is laid out oh
you so this is where Google Street View
comes in you can learn more about that
up here but there hold on isn't Street
View just a way for users to virtually
sightsee the answer as it turns out is
no Google also uses Street View
internally in order to double-check and
tweak its existing mapping data as the
Street View car takes photos of its
surroundings special AI can recognise
any signs caught by the camera and send
them to be analyzed by Google servers to
determine not only Lane placement and
traffic restrictions but among other
things even the proper addresses of
local businesses all of this information
is then also used to prevent maps from
giving you bad directions by say for
example sending you the wrong way down a
one-way street that would be bad adding
another layer to maps is Google's access
to a huge amount of satellite data
partly from its acquisition of satellite
imaging service keyhole in 2004
and partly from government sources they
use top-down views of street markers to
further improve accuracy and they've
even got to the point where they can use
satellite imagery to extrapolate the
shapes and footprints of buildings not
only to give you 3d views in Google
Earth which are super cool but also to
enable you to see outlines of these
buildings in the regular Maps view so by
intelligently combining data from all of
these sources maps can construct quite
an accurate picture of any given patch
of land pretty well but even Google
can't completely automate things yet
they also use human employees in a
project called Atlas to make necessary
adjustments one of this team's common
tasks is to investigate user error
reports and tweak routes on the map
layer that clearly don't match up with a
recent satellite image or Street View
capture and this kind of user reporting
reflects how crowdsourcing is another
major piston in Google Maps engine and
I'm not just talking about the photos
you see on business listings either
Google relies partially on volunteers to
map areas it may have limited data on
something that's especially important in
less developed countries where it's
harder for Google to send vehicles or
get accurate mapping data from a
government of course Google uses other
tricks too to flesh out the experience
once upon a time they license databases
from the yellow pages to dramatically
expand how many businesses maps would
show but these days listings are pulled
from other public sources and from
business owners who are eager to take
advantage of the visibility that Google
Maps provides owners of large facilities
have even submitted floor plans and
granted Google permission to do site
surveys to help you find your way around
this is particularly useful for sports
arenas shopping malls and airports and
Google even works with a third party
service that keeps track of gas prices
by looking at credit card data and even
getting direct data feeds from major gas
station chains finally whether you
realize you've signed up for it or not
Google also uses you location services
and the GPS on your phone helps Google
understand on top of where it is how to
get there and how many square feet of
patio space is available what times of
day your favorite watering hole gets
crowded and they don't show you but they
probably know the demographic makeup of
the clientele - Wow so the real answer
to how does Google Maps work is that
Google simply has so many information
gathering tentacles that if they were
the star of a Japanese anime I probably
wouldn't watch it at work are you
interested in computer science then
