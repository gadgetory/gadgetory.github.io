important but how do you know exactly
what the right tool is I mean it might
be hard to figure out how exactly they
make those cakes with a hole in the
middle if you've never seen a bundt pan
but your computer knows exactly what
program it should use to open say a
photo or video or a document basically
every time that's thanks to today's
unsung hero of tech the file extension
not to be confused with browser
extensions which you can learn about
here file extensions are those two three
or four letters you see after the file
name when you're poking around your hard
drive so doc mp3 and Exe for example
those are all file extensions so your
operating system doesn't just analyze
the internal code of a file and and try
to figure out what it is that would be
an inefficient and in exact process
instead whichever program created the
file will slap an extension on to the
end to tell the OS exactly what kind of
data is inside for example if you've
ever saved a document in Word you've
probably seen that drop-down menu that
lets you pick exactly what format you
want the file to be saved in after you
make your choice where it will attach
the appropriate extension so that
windows will know to use word if you
saved it as a standard word document
notepad if it's plain text or adobe
reader if it's a PDF when you open the
file the OS will check the extension
against a list of file type associations
you can bring up this list easy enough
right here in Windows actually where you
can see and modify which program is
assigned to which extension now windows
will have a lot of default file type
associations pre-loaded when the OS is
first installed for example it'll
automatically know to use the built-in
photo viewer app to load up a JPEG
instead of trying to open it with like a
music player or something but when you
install new programs they'll usually ask
if they should be the default program
for opening certain file extensions
especially with popular media
applications like VLC which will present
you with a long list of extensions that
you can pick and choose from and
extensions aren't just useful for
getting your files to load up quickly
they also help you the user see exactly
what they are at a glance in the file
explorer as Windows will assign little
icons to your files solely based on what
the extension is
are also times when it's useful to
change a file extension especially if
you've downloaded a file from the
internet that you really want to get
into it's possible that the creator of
the file stuck the wrong extension on it
or the file just doesn't have one at all
so slapping at dot txt for example on
the end of a mysterious file can at
least get notepad to open it letting you
have a peek inside to see or change an
extension just disable this option in
Windows 10 unchecking this box will
cause file extensions to appear
everywhere it's not a bad idea if you
download a file you're not sure about in
fact a file extension trickery has led
to some bad malware epidemics notably
the love-letter virus of the early 2000s
the bad guy sent out an email with an
attachment that appeared to have a dot
txt extension fooling the user into
thinking it was just a harmless plain
text file but showing the extension in
Windows Explorer revealed it was
actually a VBS file in other words a
script that contained malicious code so
be sure to pay attention to file
extensions whenever you download
anything and be especially wary if it's
an unidentified exe or VBS as they have
code that will run when you open them so
be sure you know where they're coming
from so tip of the hat to file
extensions they can warn us about dodgy
files and help our pcs run more quickly
and because of that they are today's
unsung hero of tech do you have an extra
