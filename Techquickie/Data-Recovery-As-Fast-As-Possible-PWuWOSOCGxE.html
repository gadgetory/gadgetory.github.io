still happen sometimes as it did to us
when our main SSD server spectacularly
went down but you can check out in this
video up here but we were able to get
back up and running thanks to our
friends at we recover data who worked
with us on this episode which is
sponsored by them so data loss is a
little like the sword of Damocles
constantly hanging over the head of
anyone who stores anything important
electronically but after it happens is
it really gone for good often the answer
isn't clear what if you delete a file by
mistake suffer corruption due to power
loss or have physical damage like a head
crash where the read/write head of your
hard drive crashes into the platters
that store your data fortunately there's
a number of techniques that have been
developed over the years to rescue
inaccessible data before it becomes
permanently lost let's say that you've
been the victim of the all-too-common
accident where someone empties your
recycling bin and it turns out that you
had a mission-critical selfie inside of
it since the leading a file in Windows
is only actually marking the data as
free space it just sits on your drive
until something overrides it so sooner
is better if you're using simple
recovery software lest your selfie get
overwritten by something completely
irrelevant like a tax return but what if
you can't even access your drive due to
some type of serious corruption with the
file system itself in that case certain
utilities like open source test disk can
attempt to repair the underlying problem
with the drive but if that works
you could attempt a file technique
called file carving which despite its
name is the process of reassembling
files from fragments by looking at their
headers to try and figure out what kinds
of files they were whether they were
mp3s JPEGs or whatever else but if you
have a hard drive with a platter that
just won't spin or maybe bad sectors or
a bad PCB or an SSD module that somehow
came loose you'll probably want to send
that off to a data recovery specialist
as they have the correct hardware to
physically examine the disk if you don't
have that you're putting your hardware
at risk which is putting your files at
risk which is probably not a great idea
in the case of a hard drive it'll need
to go to a clean
that might look like something out of a
movie about our killer virus since any
type of dust or particulate can
potentially wreck that part of the data
on the hard drive or platter beyond
recovery some drives can be rebuilt with
new components while other drives have
to be examined by special machines that
can read data directly off of platters
pretty cool
of course however even with the most
advanced recovery methods you can't get
all of your stuff back in every case
this can be for reasons ranging from
physical damage that's too extensive
- having proprietary storage medium that
needs to be reverse engineered to the
target data being overwritten before you
can recover it it's virtually impossible
to recover overwritten data using
current methods which is why it's a
great idea to intentionally overwrite
your hard drive with something like dban
also known as Derek's boot and nuke
before you sell your PC after all who
knows what the next owner might find
hiding inside lynda.com with a lynda.com
membership you can watch and learn from
top experts we're passionate about what
they're talking about what they're
teaching you can screen thousands of
video courses on demand and learn on
your own schedule at your own pace
you can browse each course transcript to
follow along so if you missed the part
you can find it in the text-based script
and then go to that part of the video
which is pretty cool you can take notes
and refer them later on for specific
videos you can download tutorials watch
them on the go whether you're waiting in
line somewhere or it's sitting in
traffic maybe not a grater if you're the
passenger sitting in traffic you can
watch it on your mobile devices and you
can even customize your learning path
and share it with friends colleagues
team members whatever your lynda.com
membership will give you unlimited
access to training on hundreds of topics
all for a flat rate just starting at $25
a month whether you're looking to become
an industry expert you're passionate
about some random hobby or you just want
to learn something new

alright guys hopefully that was great
liked the video if you liked it you can
also dislike it if you disliked it if
you disliked it though I want you to go
down into the
comments tell me what you'd prefer me to
cover that would be cool all I want to
know what you want to see check my
channel super fun if that's what you
want to see and if you liked it and if
you liked that get subscribed to both
