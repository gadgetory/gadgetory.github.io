internet start at just a few megabits
per second and go all the way up to
gigabit speeds or even more now of
course the ISPs want you to fork over as
much of your money as possible for a
higher speed connection with vague
wording about how it's good for gaming
or multiple devices or what-have-you but
how much should you really be paying for
well here's the thing
part of the reason that Internet service
providers offer so many access tiers is
that not everyone needs the same size
pipe coming into their home you
shouldn't buy a 10 seat minivan if
you're single with no kids and in much
the same way it's probably a waste to
have an insanely fast internet
connection if you live alone with one
computer and a phone
this means the $64,000 question when
choosing an internet plan is what are
you using the service for and how many
gadgets will be accessing it at once
after that the process mostly becomes a
matter of simple addition you see it
turns out that predicting how much speed
each common task requires is fairly
straightforward suppose you want to
stream HD video and I would assume you
do otherwise you probably wouldn't be
watching this for sites like YouTube and
Netflix you'll need between a 5 and 10
megabit per second connection if you
want your experience to be reliably
smooth now of course if you want to
stream 4k or HDR your data rates are
going to be quite a bit higher most of
the popular streaming platforms
recommend anywhere from 15 to 25 megabit
per second and we would suggest going a
fair bit higher than that somewhere in
the 40 to 50 megabit range this will
account for any dips in your service
speed during heavy load times or if a
Windows Update is running in the
background somewhere the thing to keep
in mind though is that this is on a per
video basis so if you wanted to stream
on more than one screen you need to
multiply that speed times the total
number of videos that you forsee your
household playing on your connection at
once that way your tech quickie stream
won't cut out because you're
inconsiderate roommate is trying to
watch his rebooted 90 sitcoms in 4k next
we
got to consider our other data heavy
doings beside streaming video like
gaming it might surprise you though to
know that you don't need insane speeds
to have a great gaming experience in
fact typically if you can have at least
10 megabits per second free on whatever
device you're gaming on it'll probably
be enough the more important
consideration for gaming is going to be
latency now you can learn more about
latency up here but in short it's the
delay between your computer or your
phone requesting something from the
server and the server sending the data
back to you and vice versa and it's
actually possible nay common to have a
service that boasts high speeds but also
suffers from high latency which can
result in weird leggy behavior while
you're gaming and the really tricky
thing here is that as you pay more for a
higher speed tier your latency may not
improve at all so if you have several
ISPs to choose from read reviews and see
if there are any in your area where
gamers have specifically recommended it
for its lower latency also keep in mind
that low latency is equally important
for other real-time applications such as
video chatting with your long-distance
love interest one more gaming and video
chat specific consideration is that
unlike web browsing it's important to
make sure that you're getting a decent
amount of upstream speed for these
applications a solid 10 to 15 megabits
per second per device should be fine for
high quality video calls and streaming
to twitch in high definition now aside
from applications the other most common
reason that you might want a faster
connection is if you are often
transferring large files like game
installers or large video files for
example if you are trying to download a
2 gigabyte movie that would take about 2
minutes and 40 seconds on a 100 megabit
per second connection so it's a simple
matter of doing the math for how long it
takes you to prepare a bucket of popcorn
and going from there finally although I
know the title of this episode is how
much speed you need we should probably
also mention data caps
those are those nasty little limits that
some ISPs slap onto your service where
if you exceed a certain amount per month
you'll be looking at consequences like
throttling or extra charges now data
caps shouldn't be too much of a concern
for web browsing but you can quickly run
up against them if you're gaming
streaming or watching a ton of video so
have a look at this chart to see how
much data per hour these activities
usually consume and then you can use
some quick math to see how high of a cap
you might need every month the bottom
line is that there's no point overpaying
for either speed or data that is unless
you're that person that likes to leave
your Wi-Fi unsecured because you're just
feeling really generous towards your
whole neighborhood so hopefully you
found this video helpful
