the local big-box store for the express
purpose of buying just one thing and
walking out you're trying to check out
with your new TV and one of them notices
you and what happens you start
questioning yourself does it make a
difference should I spend a hundred
dollars on an HDMI cable I mean it's not
so expensive when you consider that it
helps me get the most out of my $100 TV
I just bought stop right there
that is how you fall into the trap I've
done it how about you guys don't be shy
leave a comment share your embarrassing
premium cable story we can all laugh at
ourselves together or maybe you're
sitting there thinking all right Linus
why is buying a nice cable such a big
deal I've been buying them my whole life
and they work just fine you're right
they do and honestly there was a time
not that long ago when they actually
made a difference particularly over
longer distances the gauge of the copper
or the thickness of the wires inside a
cable has a noticeable impact on the
signal quality which for analog
interfaces directly affects quality
video cables are a great example of this
I have seen my fair share of crummy
component cables result in visual
anomalies and I can easily pick out a
lousy VGA cable versus a decent one
versus a great one in a blind taste test
ten times out of ten okay so then why am
i hating on them what happened Digital
happened with digital interfaces like
HDMI DVI display port or thunderbolt
signal degradation loss occurs over
distances in exactly the same way and a
crummy cable or connector can result in
a failure to display an image on the
screen but the difference is that a
handshake process occurs to determine
the quality of the link when you hook it
up and it either is good enough or it
isn't if it is then it's as good as any
other suitable connection and if it
isn't well then you take the cable back
to the store and get a new one because
it's defective
the only real middle ground is
intermittent operation which can be a
pain to diagnose but it's the same
result as two
if just take it back and get a new one
no need to spend more lies about better
image quality aside better cables can
have a number of advantages they can
have better sheathing that is sleeved
for damage resistance or uses higher
quality plastics to prevent stiffening
over time they can have more robust
connectors that are harder to dislodge
or gold-plated to last for more
insertions they can have emi shielding
for reliable operation in environments
with a lot of electromagnetic
interference or they can even just have
better aesthetics for applications where
the wiring will be visible so while top
tier cables that make your bass response
better or whatever almost never make
sense the least expensive option isn't
always optimal either what I'm saying is
that there is a time and place for good
cables as long as you understand what it
is that you're buying for something I
talked behind my PC and never touch like
a monitor cable I'll always use the
cheapest possible thing that functions
but here at linus media group we often
buy mid tier XLR cables hdmi cables SDI
cables network cables and more when
something is going to be moved around
and subjected to the rigors of a busy
environment it's worth it especially for
professional use where an intermittent
connection is just plain not good enough
and 10 minutes of downtime costs more
than a bunch of stupid fancy cables in
the first place but with that said if a
friend starts trying to sell you exotic
silver cables are like firewire and USB
cables that claim to operate at speeds
faster than the rated specification of
the interfaces that they connect to you
will need one of these speaking of
things you might need hotspot shield is
the fast easy way to set up on VPN for
improved internet browsing privacy and
more their elite service allows you to
circumvent restrictions to get access to
sites and services that might otherwise
be blocked by something as simple as a
local firewall that disables you know
instant messaging or file transfer
services or as complicated as a
countrywide censorship that prevents you
from having access to outside new
sources all you have to do is click now
or check out the link in the video
description and try it out for 3 if you
like it don't forget to use offer code
ly this before you check out and you can
save 20% off your membership on new
activations and I think that's pretty
much it
