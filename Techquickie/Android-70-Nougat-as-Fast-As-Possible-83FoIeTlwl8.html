new Android release I mean with names
like Ice Cream Sandwich
KitKat and marshmallow I think anyone
who isn't diabetic would be excited and
now there's a new version of Android to
satisfy your craving for some sweet
sweet software nougat less excitingly
known as Android 7.0 but is it a big
enough deal to become the creamy
satisfying center of your smartphone
well unlike the smaller number dot other
number updates that are often a little
more than security patches nougat brings
a boatload of new features first off it
addresses one of the biggest limitations
of traditional mobile user interfaces
the inability to see two things at once
something we take for granted on desktop
platforms with nougat though you get a
split screen mode that's reminiscent of
the snap assist feature in Windows 10
you simply drag your thumbnails to the
side of the screen to activate the
feature this will be especially useful
on larger smartphones tablets and
tablets as you'll finally be able to
make better use of all of that screen
real estate in stock Android without the
janky limitations on some of the add-on
ways that this has been done in the past
and speaking of doing many things at
once you can double tap the recent apps
button now to switch between your two
most recent apps just like alt-tab
instead of fiddling around with the
virtual rolodex every time another
tablet and phablet friendly feature is
the new ability to natively adjust the
size of text and UI elements on your
screen older versions of Android kept
screen elements more or less the same
size regardless of how large or small
your device was but nougat resolves this
problem by making it easy to shrink
things down if you're one of the
unfortunate people who bought one of
these or enlarged them if you're rocking
a tiny screen moving on one of the most
important functions of any modern
smartphone is to push notifications for
things like email angry tweets and
reminders about your dance card of dates
that might stand you up nougats
notification system has changed a fair
bit including the iOS style ability to
reply to things directly from the
notification panel as well as easy
access to the mute button for
notifications if a newly installed app
just won't shut the heck up and if
you're getting multiple messages or
emails you can now expand notifications
to deal with each message individually
without going fullscreen on the app
continuing with the theme of doing
things quickly your quick settings for a
Wi-Fi removable storage etc now sit atop
the notifications panel and if you don't
like them there you can also customize
your quick settings so it's a little bit
easier to get to the things you use the
most but UI upgrades aren't the only
thing that you can find in nougat there
are also enhanced security features the
OS can now allow apps to access just one
directory on your device to alleviate
privacy concerns to a degree as well as
offering file level encryption instead
of whole device encryption which is
helpful because older versions of
Android would lock the entire phone on
boot until you entered a password
meaning you wouldn't get notifications
after a cold start nougats file level
encryption by contrast allows certain
things to be accessible from the lock
screen so you won't miss anything
important after a reboot so you throw in
some additional bells and whistles such
as Vulkan API support at least on phones
that ship with Android 7.0 a low latency
visual mode to help phones play more
nicely with VR headsets and a work mode
that allows you to disable your job
related apps with a single toggle so you
can unplug when it's time to go home and
nougat looks like it might add some real
deliciousness to your mobile device just
don't try to coach your phone in actual
chocolate I mean who would do that
speaking of delicious fresh books is on
a mission to make freelancers lives less
stressed and more organized and I guess
if they use the extra money they make
and the extra time that base
save more delicious because they could
go out for a really nice meal okay that
was a terrible segue anyway the point is
they're easy to use tool for managing
your accounting if you're a small
business owner like if you're a plumber
or you run a small dance studio or you
do computer repair on the side is
awesome you can track your hours you can
create invoices that look professional
very very quickly you can send the
invoices you can see when your client
has read it and they can even pay you
right through fresh books they even
allow you to accept deposits for your
work through their platform so the work
is paid for on your schedule so if all
that sounds pretty good then getting
started on fresh books is extremely
simple even if you're not a numbers
person and you can try fresh books for
free by going to fresh books calm
