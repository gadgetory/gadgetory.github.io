his wall people have been dreaming up
ways to put him together again this led
to the invention of adhesives such as
tapes glues and a wide range of
specialized polymers none of which did
very much for our friend at the base of
the wall then one of the king's men
spoke up and said why can't other things
just heal themselves the same way that
we do this is where the invention of
self or autonomic healing materials
comes in which mimic the properties of
biological systems like our own when
damage is inflicted to an autonomic
healing compound there is first a near
immediate trigger response that works to
prevent the loss of further material
somewhat similar to blood clotting that
step is followed shortly by transport of
the materials which are necessary for
the third process to take place the
actual healing this is done in a variety
of different ways and across different
time frames but there are a couple of
basic design outlines which are most
frequently used the first method aptly
named the hollow tube approach works by
utilizing a network of tiny glass or
fiber capillaries that are often used
already as a way of reinforcing the
tensile strength of plastic polymers
some of these micro channels are then
filled with either a highly attractive
bonding monomer or a slower working
hardening substance both of which are
dispersed if the healing material
receives damage such as a cut or a break
this will cause them to mix together
first allowing the monomers to create a
bond between the severed sections with
the hardening agent causing it to
solidify afterward since the two
reacting agents needed to create the
healing are continually replenished from
external sources this type of
application tends to trend towards
static structural possibilities the
second and perhaps more commonly used
design is known as the micro capsule
healing method it is similar in theory
to the previous model but instead of
using tiny channels to deliver the
bonding monomers they are encapsulated
in a substance which is designed to
rupture whenever damage is inflicted
that activates the trigger response not
unlike when a trigger response causes
your significant other to release some
hostility that they've been
encapsulating and
when these capsules do happen to become
ruptured the monomers inside the mix
with a catalyst that is freely
distributed in the healing compound
around them allowing for the
polymerization bond to take place
without the addition of extra heat or
influence while these designs are more
autonomous the lack of an externally fed
delivery system means they are less
efficient at repairing large damage and
will deplete their embedded monomers
much more quickly through use leading
them to be looked at more for their
protective qualities likely it is this
type of material that would be used on
any articles that you already own that
employ self-healing technology such as
the deflects series of phones from LG
where the function is purely aesthetic
and if you break the phone in half it's
not just going to whip itself back
together it's just to keep your phone
looking shiny but there is potential for
even cooler stuff in the future in this
design model has also been implemented
using conductive materials and monomers
as well so when engineers design an
electrical circuit that could like
repair itself after being severed I mean
think about the applications of this
this could have on the durability and
lifespan of electronic components pretty
cool stuff I mean it sounds great let's
just start making everything out of this
stuff so we can go ahead and get on with
abusing our devices the way that many of
us are habitually want to do as if any
of these videos were ever that simple
while many materials are labeled as
self-healing often times they fall short
of true autonomy as they require the use
of excess resins during manufacturing
and light or heat conditions that need
to be applied manually or through the
use of a complementing device so
currently these systems are very limited
in terms of the amount and type of
damage they can repair due to the
eventual depletion of I've of a compound
delivery channels or the embedded
monomer capsules and catalysts that I
mentioned before so for the time being
it might be best if you refrain from
doing your best jason voorhees
impression and acting like your phone is
a counselor at Camp Crystal Lake unless
of course you've got the means to
replace at a moment's notice
when your machete ends up slicing it to
bits so while we may never be able to do
anything for that pile of soup that was
once Humpty at least in the meantime we
can keep your cell phone from looking
Dumpty
well we certainly acquired some
knowledge today but if you're hungry for
