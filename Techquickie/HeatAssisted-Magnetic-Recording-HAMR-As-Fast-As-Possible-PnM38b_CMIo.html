a hard drive in the next couple years
then you're going to experience hammer
time and no I'm not talking about a hard
drive that plays rap music and wears
parachute pants today's video is about
heat assisted magnetic recording or
hammer which will greatly increase drive
capacities you might already know that
data on a hard drive is stored by tiny
magnetic grains that sit on the disk
platters a group of these grains can
store one bit that's a 0 or 1 depending
on which way it is turned when you write
something on to your hard drive the
drives head will apply a magnetic field
to turn the grain in a certain way
that's what stored data is but as hard
drives have gotten more and more
spacious over the years manufacturers
have gotten into the problem where
magnetic grains can only be made so
small before they become unstable and
start flipping randomly limiting the
amount of data that you could fit onto
one hard drive but as it turns out
heating the disk can make the bits more
stable by decreasing the platters
coercivity what this means in practical
terms is that the heat makes it easier
for the drive head to turn the grain
correctly so that data is recorded
accurately hammer drives do this by
using a tiny laser smaller than a grain
of salt on the read/write head but
because you can't focus a laser down to
the size of a bit on the platter
the laser instead is absorbed by
something called a near field transducer
or NFT a technology that's only been
around since the 1990s the MFT converts
the laser light into something called
surface plasmons which are basically
small electrical currents that travel
down the NFT and heat a small area of
the disk up to 400 to 500 degrees
Celsius however the disk cools as soon
as the write is complete so you won't
have to worry about some sort of
catastrophic Drive meltdown so this
means another thing you probably won't
have to worry about is running out of
space after hammers introduction in 2018
or 2019 its projected to provide 20
terabytes of storage on one Drive
starting at around 2020 and increase
this capacity to about 30 to 40 percent
year after year all the way up to 100
terabytes on a single Drive when it's
combined with
bit patterned media which is a
technology that allows a bit to be
stored on just one single grain rather
than a group of grains which will
increase data density all right Luke
that sounds like quite a bit of space
for all my junk but won't that hit my
wallet quite hard actually hammer drives
aren't projected to be more expensive
than current drives when you take
capacity into account as you wouldn't
need as many platters to hold the amount
of data that you would want which would
reduce the cost
since hammer is a technology for
spinning hard drives hammer disks won't
exactly be as fast as SSDs but you could
see at 10 to 15 percent performance
increase simply due to the higher data
density since the read/write head can
access more data in one rotation of the
disk so keep an eye out for hammer
drives in the next couple of years if
you keep running out of space and
although this episode was not sponsored
we'd like to thank our friends over at
Seagate for giving us some help with the
information on this edition of tech
quickie fresh books is on a mission to
make freelancers less stressed and more
organized through their easy-to-use tool
for crafting and sending professional
invoices in seconds they also do a bunch
of other stuff first books helps you
track in your hours so that when it
comes time to create set invoice you
know exactly what you did when you did
it who you did it for all that kind of
stuff you can accept deposits through
their platform so you get paid for your
swore on your schedule which is actually
quite nice and they also have a tool to
manage your expense reports their mobile
app lets you take a picture of your
receipts and pretty much handles the
rest which is nice because that can be
really annoying getting started on fresh
books is extremely simple even if you're
not a numbers person so don't worry
about it you can try fresh books for
free for 30 days by going to fresh books
