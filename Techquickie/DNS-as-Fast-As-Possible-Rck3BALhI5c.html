a night on the town and tell the driver
- his house when he asked me where we're
headed unless the driver somehow very
creepily already knows where I live
he'll probably tell me to stop being a
tool and give him an actual address
where he can actually drop me off and
although that scenario has probably
occurred in plenty of taxi cabs where
drivers have had to deal with people
that ran up way too high of a bar tab
that night your computer or phone can
have a much easier time figuring out
where to take you on the internet thanks
to the domain name system commonly
referred to as DNS you see even though
most of us get to our favorite websites
by punching in addresses like
youtube.com or vessel com your browser
actually needs to know the IP address of
the site you're trying to access so to
do this it sends a request to the DNS
which is sort of like the Internet's
version of the Yellow Pages that matches
a site URL or a Uniform Resource locator
to an IP address so the DNS request
first goes to a recursive name server
which is typically operated by your
internet service provider but you can
also use public servers managed by
Google or other organizations if your
ISP resolver is having issues a
recursive name server might have the IP
address of the website you want to
access already stored but if it doesn't
it will go to one of thirteen root
servers which manage requests for
top-level domains like com or.org
although that seems like a tiny number
of servers by the way they actually use
redundant physical Hardware all over the
globe to make sure these requests are
handled and handled quickly your request
is then sent to the appropriate top
level domain server com if you're trying
to get to YouTube for example which will
then contact authoritative name servers
that contain a well authoritative list
of IP addresses and
matching URLs which is updated whenever
someone buys and registers a domain once
the IP address you want is retrieved
it's sent back to the recursive name
server and then on to your computer to
save time in the future and make things
more efficient both the recursive name
server and your own computer will cache
DNS entries for a while so the next time
you want to visit YouTube you won't have
to go through this whole rigmarole
instead your computer will either know
the correct IP right away or it will be
able to get it directly from the
recursive server DNS usually works
fairly well for most people but if a
website changes IP addresses this can
cause problems especially if your
computer is trying to use its own cache
this will usually manifest as lots of
random 404 errors or taxi drivers taking
you to the wrong place if we were to
harken back to our original analogy so
if you're running Windows it's actually
pretty easy to clear out your DNS cache
just by opening the command prompt as an
administrator and entering this command
which hopefully will fix the problem
however you could run into more serious
problems if a piece of malware has
poisoned your DNS cache by making DNS
entries that are stored locally that
point to malicious websites for example
an attacker could tell your PC to make
irs.gov point to the IP address of a
website running a tack scan that tries
to convince you to give up your personal
information so if you're getting weird
redirects like this running a reputable
anti-malware application may be able to
help but despite its vulnerabilities DNS
has made the Internet extremely easy to
use
for many people because thanks to it we
don't have to punch in numerical IP
addresses like like phone numbers except
longer every time we want to surf the
web and given how hard it is for people
to remember phone numbers that's just
not a world I would want to live in
speaking of worlds I wouldn't want to
live in worlds without fresh books fresh

business rather than sitting in a dark
corner in front of their computer with
only the lights of the screen to
illuminate the room working on all of
their tax and accounting information
