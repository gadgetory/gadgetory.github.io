bacteria to refer to a single germ
mixing up discrete and discrete and
saying oMG my Facebook got hacked when
what they really mean is I left my
computer phone unlocked and my idiot
friends thought it would be funny to
send those messages to your sister well
one you must be a lot of fun at parties
and to me too
which is why on today's episode we're
going to be tackling a number of
commonly misused tech terms to clear up
any confusion and help you win your next
internet fight so let's start then by
talking about the venerable hard-disk
there are a lot of people who use the
term hard drive to refer to any sort of
non removable storage in a computer but
it actually only refers to mechanical
spinning drives if we break it down the
word hard refers to the rigidity of the
disks or the magnetic platters inside
the internals of floppy disks by
contrast were flexible so don't refer to
SSDs or solid-state drives as hard disks
or hard drives if you want to talk
generally about mechanical drives and
SSDs as a group you say drive speaking
with internal PC components for minutes
let's talk about your GPU or is it your
graphics card it's common to hear people
use GPU to refer to this but the GPU
actually only refers to the graphics
processing unit this chip here our
example is a GP 104 which Nvidia brands
as a gtx 1070 or 1080 depending on how
many of its processing cores are enabled
from the factory so then it's fine to
call an RX 480 a GPU
but if you're talking about a specific
model such as this gigabyte wind force 8
gig
you're better off calling the whole
assembly a video card or graphics card
and in the case of highly integrated
devices like smartphones the graphics
accelerator is usually part of the SOC
or system on a chip so stick with GPU in
that case rather than calling your
adrenal 420 a graphics card let's move
on to removable media namely optical
disks I'm bringing them up to highlight
the difference between disk with a C and
disk with a K they both sound the same
and for this reason both words are used
interchangeably quite often to refer to
CDs DVDs and blu-rays and these things
but this with a C actually specifically
refers to optical media while disk with
a K is used for magnetic media such as
floppy disk and hard disks the more you
know and coming back then to blu-rays
you might understandably be a bit
confused over how the letters HD seem to
appear on everything from cheap 1366 by
768 TVs to outrageously expensive 8k
displays well while the term HD isn't
technically incorrect as long as the
resolution is at least 720p 1280 by 720
TV manufacturers often use the term HD
without any qualifiers to mean 720p
exactly making lower end screens sound
more appealing if you want to know
unequivocally what each HD variant
really means well HD is 720 as we've
covered Full HD is 1080p q HD or quad HD
means 1440p and UHD or Ultra HD
means 2160p
and up I guess words like full and ultra
sound a lot sexier to potential buyers
than a jumble of numbers but it's
confusing nonetheless and to make things
even more baffling terms like 2k and 4k
actually refer to cinematic resolutions
used in the movie industry meaning that
true 4k is actually a little wider than
most 4k monitors or TVs on the consumer
market and if you've ever seen a 1440p
monitor advertised as 2k we'll take a
moment to shake your head and discuss as
the actual 2k resolution used in cinema
is nowhere close to 1440p real 2k is
actually just a slightly wider 1080p so
then are there any misused tech terms
that drive you guys crazy put them down
in the comments below and while you're
at it let us know if you'd like to see a
second episode of misused tech terms do
you find yourself racing against the
clock as a freelancer having so little
time at the end of the day after you've
done your work to sit down and fight
with your accounting software it's like
sparring with expenses and invoices
terrible anyway the modern world of the
internet there are so many opportunities
to be self-employed but not everybody
