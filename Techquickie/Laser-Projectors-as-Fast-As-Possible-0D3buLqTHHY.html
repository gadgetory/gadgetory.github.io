everywhere in the tech scene these days
you got your laser mice your laser
printers your beams by flow you got
those
dr. evil friction laser beam jokes we
keep making here on tech quickie in
spite of the fact that that movie was
right 15 years ago but there's a new use
for lasers that hasn't become widespread
in the consumer market just yet but one
that is already being deployed in
commercial settings and may find its way
into your home in the near future laser
sex doll just kidding projectors which
have some advantages that make them a
cut above existing technology
you see most modern projectors be they
LCD or DLP use a bright light source
usually a bulb to create white light
which is then separated to create red
green and blue pixels which are
ultimately blasted at your screen and
although this arrangement functions well
enough a lot of the light from the
projector bulb has to be filtered out to
produce only the red blue and green that
is needed at any given time in fact less
than one-fifth of the light generated by
the projector actually makes it onto the
screen a higher-end laser projector on
the other hand uses separate red blue
and green lasers instead of white light
which are combined by a lens into an
image not only does this cut down
tremendously on power consumption but
the greater efficiency means that laser
projectors can be made to be much
brighter than their bulb based
counterparts without needing more
electricity than your standard wall
outlet can safely deliver lasers are
also typically made to knit light at one
or don't leave on precise wavelength
corresponding to a specific color of
light meaning that it's much easier for
to build projectors with arrangements of
lasers at the correct wavelengths to
enable wider color gamut for more
realistic and vibrant colors you can
learn more about different RGB setups
and how they produce color right about
here and even moving beyond picture
quality and efficiency laser projectors
are a lot more convenient not only do
laser light sources last much much
longer than bulbs Epson for example is
saying that one of its whole models will
last 30,000 hours which is long enough
to watch every episode of The Simpsons
over a hundred and thirty times they
also don't need tons of time to achieve
peak brightness when you turn them on so
no more waiting around for your
projector to warm up oh and they turn
off nearly instantly - of course at this
time as with any new technology you'll
be paying the dreaded early adopter tax
absence home model that I just mentioned
is going for eight thousand US dollars
at the time of filming me what kind of
homes are they putting these things in
with higher-end commercial models going
for many times that additionally
consumer focused laser projectors often
a cheat a little bit by only having two
blue lasers one of which hits a phosphor
that separates the light into red and
green another concern is an effect known
as Beckel and if you've ever used a
laser pointer
you'll probably be familiar with this
speckle refers to how the dot on the
wall kind of shimmers if you look at it
really close though well-made projectors
should be able to minimize this effect
which is a good thing too because the
last thing you'd want then watching tech
quickie on your fancy new projector is
for me to look even more ridiculous than
I usually do
wait what John
Tunnel ver VPN lets you tunnel through
one of twenty different countries
letting you browse the internet and use
online services as though you are some
anonymous due to dudette from some other
country they have easy-to-use apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac and also a Chrome
extension and all you have to do when I
say easy I really do mean easy you
download it install it and you like hit
a button and then two things happen your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so you show up as
though you are in a different country
this lets you bypass all the annoying
details that typically come with using a
VPN for personal use though DNS no
router settings no port configurations
nothing like that they've got a top
rated privacy policy and they don't wild
user activity and the best part is you
can not take my word for it you can try
it for free with five hundred Meg's of
data with no credit card required then
when you decide to get a year of
unlimited data you can say ten percent
by going to tunnel ver comm slash Linus
so thanks for watching guys like dislike
leave a comment with a suggestion for a
future video and I'm emotive I'm out of
hands but you'll have to subscribe
anyway even though I can't point at the
button I mean it's cut over there like
kind of point it both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
