rates the prettiest textures in the most
karma in the pcmasterrace subreddit you
decided to go with a multi GPU setup for
your new gaming rig but when you fire up
your games you notice that the sick
games you're getting aren't really what
you expected especially after dropping
so much money on your system so what's
the deal with that well this problem has
plagued PC gamers for over a decade
why don't you usually get double the
performance from a dual card
configuration or triple if you have
three video cards I mean since graphics
rendering benefits from having more
computing units in parallel which you
can learn more about in this video by
the way wouldn't it make sense then for
multi card setups like SLI and crossfire
to scale pretty easily unfortunately
it's not quite that simple
for starters using two separate graphics
cards means they have to talk to each
other somehow
you see most modern multi-gpu setups use
something called alternate frame
rendering where each card renders every
other frame separately sounds efficient
but for them to be pushed to your
monitor in the right order the cards
have to sync up properly
creating a surprising amount of overhead
for both the GPUs and the electrical
communication paths or buses that link
them this overhead not only gets worse
as you add more cards to your rig but
can even result in a very unpleasant
phenomenon called micro stuttering which
often shows up even if you're getting
lots of frames per second you see for
smooth gameplay you need not only high
FPS but good and consistent frame times
which is the amount of time that a given
frame will remain on your screen poor
synchronization between the cards can
leave certain frames on your monitor for
way longer than they
and be even if the total number of
frames each second is very high this can
render certain games unplayable even
though your setup is more than powerful
enough to run it on paper and as if that
wasn't enough an even bigger problem is
that it's very difficult for your GPUs
to know what frame to render next since
it depends heavily on what the player
chooses to do the real-time nature of
game rendering makes it tough to
parallel eyes in certain games among
multiple GPUs even with alternate frame
rendering as there isn't always a second
frame or even part of a predicted one
for your second card to work on of
course it isn't all about the inherent
limitations of your hardware on the
software side some game developers have
been able to code their games in a
manner that makes it easier for multiple
GPUs to split the workload while others
simply don't bother with the difficulty
in coding for a very small subset of
customers many devs don't see the point
in sinking tons of time into making sure
that their games will play nice with
multi card systems some games even
managed to have worse performance in
these situations and finally you
definitely shouldn't run out and buy
multiple GPUs if you're rocking a
multiple monitor setup and you want
extra video memory or vram to store all
of your textures with SLI and crossfire
you are limited only to however much
vram is on one card because both GPUs
need to be able to access the same
information in memory in order to work
properly in tandem whatever it might say
on the packaging so does this mean then
that SLI and crossfire are useless
gimmicks and a complete waste of money
well no multi card setups will give you
the best possible performance in certain
use cases and can even make some games
playable at very high settings and
resolutions where they wouldn't
otherwise be you
even with the best single card on the
market not to mention that multi-gpu
rendering may improve with new AP is
like Vulcan and directx12 which by the
way you can learn more about here just
do your research before you buy as to
what game see the greatest benefit and
remember to keep your expectations
realistic after all you wouldn't expect
to be able to drive twice as fast just
because you bought two cars would you
unless you're trying to do like a fan
remake of Tokyo Drift you guys know that
I love Dollar Shave Club we've been
working with them for years good quality
razors good pricing the shave is
fantastic
but what you probably don't know is that
they have other products too well though
if you watch our ad integrations we talk
a lot about their butt lights so you
probably are aware of those but the
point is it's good stuff they've got
their doctor Carver shave butter they've
got their aftershave and they've got
their one wipe Charlies which make
everything from your face all the way to
not your face look and smell like a
million bucks trust me guys once you're
in the club you'll see they've got the
best grooming products and they're
affordable and even more importantly for
nerds like me it's easy you don't have
to go out of the house in order to look
like you go out of the house and you can
even save money while doing it I mean it
really is mind-boggling isn't it the
economics of being able to afford to
have someone walk to your door and bring
you these for less money than what you
would pay to go out yourself and get
them I mean that's how much margin those
guys are taking for anyway that's
besides the point right now is your
chance to see for yourself why so many
of us love Dollar Shave Club if you've
never been a member before and you've
never joined now's the time you'll get
your first month of razors for free just
pay the shipping and after that it's
only a few bucks a month it's a limited
time offer so join today go to
