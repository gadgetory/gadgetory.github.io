of modern life you just plug it into any
one of the similar looking ports and
things just work well most of the time
anyway
but whatever happened to those
old-school massive things we used to use
to connect printers and hard drives well
older standards like OEE 1284 and IDE
cables had so many pins and took up so
much physical space because they
communicated in parallel meaning that
they could send and/or receive multiple
bits of information simultaneously by
contrast new-school interfaces like USB
SAS SATA and individual PCI Express
Lanes are serial which fun fact is
actually what the s in each acronym
stands for these ones can only send or
receive one bit at a time but wait a
minute
why on earth would that be better I mean
when they closed all but one lane on the
freeway that's a bad thing
well popular parallel standards had a
number of limitations that slowed down
their real-world speed these ports
depended on all of the data lines
sending the correct data simultaneously
so trying to push more and more data
through a parallel port per second means
that it's harder and harder for those
lines to stay synchronized meaning that
as you increase the data rate the port
actually had to slow things down and
wait for all of the signals to match up
another phenomenon called cross talk
also complicated matters cross talk is
basically electrical interference
between data lines that are close
together and it becomes more pronounced
when you add more lines than again when
you try to make them faster because a
serial connection like USB only has one
data line in each direction
cross talk isn't
nearly as much of an issue this means
that although serial connections can
only fire off one bit at a time the rate
of fire can be made much higher
especially as electronics manufacturing
in general has improved so think of an
automatic machine gun shooting tons of
bullets per second one at a time versus
a brake barrel shotgun that can fire
lots of pellets at once but has a much
longer reload delay parallel connections
also had the disadvantage of using lots
of pins to support transmitting multiple
bits at once and that meant that the
connectors themselves were more prone to
damage think about how easy it was to
bend printer pins or an IDE header on an
old motherboard modern serial links
typically don't use protruding pins
making standards like USB and SATA
suitable for many more insertions as
they say but Linus hold on a minute what
about my fancy new graphics card that
uses 16 PCI Express Lanes at once isn't
that parallel well not really
each PCI Express Lane has its own clock
signal so they're not synchronized with
each other the data is simply
transmitted down each lane in a more
independent fashion leaving the card
itself to sort out the information which
doesn't take very long
meaning that PCI Express speeds scale
very well as you add more lanes which
you can see in high-speed PCI Express
devices like solid-state drives and
video cards pretty incredible right well
that may be but as far as one bit at a
time serial technology has come I
wouldn't bother trying to eat your bowl
of frosted flakes one at a time do you
really want your isp keeping an eye on
what it is that you're doing online use
tunnel their tunnel their VPN is be
simple to use VPN that lets you tunnel
through one of 20 different
country's allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as
though you are in that country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they've also got a Chrome extension
that one was upside down there you go I
fixed it and it is so easy to use that
your mom can do it you just press one
button and boom your connection gets
encrypted and there's no messing around
they've got a top rated privacy policy
and they don't log user activity and you
can try out for free with five hundred
Meg's of data and no credit card
required at the link below

our other channels and I guess that's
pretty much it I will see you again at
the next fast as possible as soon as
possible it's going to be as great as
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
