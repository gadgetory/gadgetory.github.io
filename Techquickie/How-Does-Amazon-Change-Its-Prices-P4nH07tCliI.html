did you ever set up a lemonade stand
during the summer and come to the
realization that you might sell more
lemonade if you knock a bit off the
price in the evening when it isn't quite
so sweltering hot assuming that is that
the cops didn't shut you down for the
heinous crime of selling flavored water
without a permit
well if so congratulations you
essentially did the same thing that
amazon does every day obvious they do it
on a much bigger scale now the exact
formulas are treated as closely guarded
trade secrets so we're gonna be relying
on some pretty good third-party analysis
of the sophisticated mechanisms that
Amazon uses to make millions of changes
per day to the pricing of the items on
its site and some individual items even
get more than one price change in a
single day first up obviously Amazon
sometimes raises prices when items are
in high demand that's simple enough to
track through orders and pageviews but
their whole strategy is far more nuanced
on super popular items that sell like
hotcakes
Amazon's algorithms keep an eye on what
they're selling for on other sites and
then tweak the price to undercut the
competition not only does this lead to
more sales of that specific item but it
has some great ancillary benefits for
Amazon as well one is because Amazon has
used this tactic for such a long time
they've cemented themselves in the minds
of many consumers as the place to go for
the best deals dramatically increasing
site traffic and once the customer has
been trained to not bother to look
elsewhere Amazon can then strategically
increase the price of items that a
customer might want to order together
for example if it's summer you might
find a great deal on a grill but things
like spatulas and brushes and cheesy
novelty aprons might actually be more
expensive on Amazon as the algorithm
figures that people would rather
simplify their lives by shopping in one
place rather than spend time looking
around to save a few bucks on their
propane and propane accessories it's
Amazon's mostly online presence that
allows them the flexibility to make
these kinds of changes on the fly stores
that have both online shops and
brick-and-mortar retail locations like
Best Buy or Walmart simply don't have
the resources to adjust prices so
aggressively can you imagine being the
guy who has to change all those little
price stickers every hour all day Amazon
also uses complex algorithms to
determine which price you'll see when
there are multiple sellers for an item
through Amazon Marketplace their service
that allows third parties to list items
on their site now as you can imagine
Amazon generally gives preference to
products its selling directly but the
algorithm also considers how much more
expensive one seller is than another how
highly rated and popular the seller is
how often the seller generates returns
and whether Amazon itself handles the
shipping they consider all that before
showing you a price which attempts to
draw you in by offering a cheap deal
from a reputable seller of course as
much computing muscle as Amazon has to
crunch all these numbers that doesn't
mean that they've totally mastered the
art of perfect pricing on over a half
billion items for example they famously
listed a used textbook for 23 million
dollars back in 2011 although come to
think of it looking at the prices at the
campus bookstore lately that might not
actually be that far off what are you
looking for something that isn't
overpriced then checkout private
Internet access VPN not only does p.i a
working up to five devices at once by
hiding your true IP address and allowing
you to bypass geo restrictions and
censorship by making you appear that
you're connecting from somewhere else it
also blocks unwanted connections to help
prevent attacks Auto blocks all traffic
if the VPN disconnects keep to your data
out of the hands of advertisers and
other snoops or tracking your activity
prevents DNS leaks and even includes
mace P is built-in malware blocker PIAA
supports multiple VPN protocols and
encryption levels allowing you to dial
in the exact level of protection that
you need they have apps for Windows Mac
Android iOS Linux
and even a Chrome extension with support
for more platforms coming soon
incredibly and P ia has over 3000
service in 28 countries and does not log
user activity so what are you waiting
for check them out today at the link
below so thanks for watching guys if you
have an idea for an upcoming episode or
subject you want us to cover let us know
in the comments hit the bell icon
wherever that does like dislike whatever
come back and watch again next time
