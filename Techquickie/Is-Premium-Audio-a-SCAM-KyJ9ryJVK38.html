what are you listening to t-swift buddy
converted a YouTube rip to lossless and
it sounds amazing it's like there's a
tiny tailor playing in my braid actually
that's not how lossless music works at
all but it's high bitrate that's more
realistic the only reality is that
you're taking up way more space in your
mobile device for no reason you have any
idea what happens when music is
converted from one file format to
another no okay
so when Taylor Swift is in the studio
cutting your new album her voice
actually does get recorded as lossless
audio which means that the computer
stores as much of her song as
practically possible in digital form
that essentially is what lossless audio
is it means that the song was originally
recorded at a high bitrate and hasn't
been compressed since but whenever a
record label puts their music on YouTube
or on a service like Spotify it gets
compressed and not just a little bit
lots of streaming services compress
music down to about a tenth of what it
originally was to save space and they do
this by discarding a lot of the data in
the original file so you can't truly
convert back up to lossless it's a bit
like trying to take a well-done steak
and get all the medium-rare juices back
into it besides like good steak most
people can't tell the difference anyway
well I'm a golden era audiophile I even
got a certificate from the appropriate
subreddit look did you take a test for
that yeah I did I have to listen to a
bunch of sample tracks and then blindly
say which ones were the high bitrate
ones took me like at least five minutes
and I got them all right please don't
tell me you used those headphones yeah
so dude you got lucky beyond a pretty
low threshold maybe around 128 kilobits
a second it's pretty hard to hear
quality differences using low end
equipment low end these cost me like
twenty two dollars ah alright look the
reason cheap speakers and headphones
don't let you fully enjoy high bitrate
audio is because at higher bit rates you
might be able to hear more
parts of the track that would get
discarded if it were compressed any
further lower end hardware just simply
can't replicate sounds like that
correctly so I have to like buy
expensive headphones and then subscribe
to title or a spotify premium well it
depends as berates get higher and higher
many people can't hear the differences
between them if you have a good pair of
headphones or speakers you might be able
to hear the difference between a regular
and a premium stream on Spotify but it's
less likely that you'll be able to hear
the difference between a 320 kilobits
spotify premium song and a lossless
track on title and even if you can hear
the difference think about your typical
day are you really the guy with a
dedicated listening chair or are you
walking down the street and joying some
tunes without really focusing on every
nuance of every note of the song so what
you're saying is lossless music is like
pretty pointless no what I'm saying is
before plunking down tons of money on
expensive equipment and subscriptions
maybe try out some solid mid-range gear
with free high bitrate or lossless music
you can find online if it's easy for you
to tell the difference between that and
a standard stream it might be worth
exploring some higher-end options but
there's also no shame and just rocking
out to low quality mp3s of your favorite
Weird Al parodies if that's what makes
you happy thanks man I don't want to
contribute to jay-z's gaudy fun anyway
