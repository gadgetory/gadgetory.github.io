chat and communication apps for your
smart phone or tablet I mean it only
takes a couple of seconds to open up the
App Store or the Play Store and find
literally dozens of offerings that all
promise to be the best most fun and most
intuitive way to do essentially the same
thing send messages photos or short
videos to your friends or enemies as it
were but all of the modern programs we
use to stay in touch that are more or
less carbon copies of each other are the
product of decades of evolution from
predecessors that were dramatically
different
so while email is often considered to
predate modern instant messaging by a
fair margin they actually didn't first
appear all that far apart from each
other the modern form of email that uses
the familiar at sign was invented back
in 1971 on the old ARPANET a US military
network that was one of the forerunners
of the internet and real time online
chat became a reality just two years
later in 1973 when the archetypical II
retro-sounding taco Matic was created at
the University of Illinois
although taco Matic only featured six
rooms of up to five users each the
functionality was similar to modern chat
rooms including the IRC system with its
large number of channels that appeared a
decade and a half later in 1988 and
there have been other improvements like
typewriters taco Matic punished users
for typos because it transmitted
individual keystrokes as they were input
meaning that all your elite hacker
buddies would know instantly if you
didn't know how to correctly spell
diarrhea fun fact to taco Matic is
actually still available as a modern
website if you'd like to check out a
piece of internet history but online
chat quickly outgrew small groups
communicating directly and many we're
more interested in seeing what larger
groups of people were discussing more
generally that's we're using a phone
modem to
next to a bulletin board system or BBS
comes in it's pretty much what it sounds
like after logging in you could see what
other folks posted to a virtual bulletin
board and make your own contributions if
you wanted to weigh in much like modern
web message boards or forums the first
BBS was launched in Chicago all the way
back in 1978 providing a place for open
online discussion well before the rise
of the world wide web and they proved to
be very versatile in fact people began
using BBS's for file sharing as well
meaning they became very popular in the
early 1990s however during the web's
explosive growth soon after the BBS
scene was nearly forgotten by the late
90s though it continues to be popular in
Taiwan for some reason and speaking of
continuing to be popular the venerable
Usenet developed at Duke University all
the way back in 1980 still has a
considerable if not large following to
this day Usenet is organized into
topical sections called news groups that
allow users to post both articles and
replies kind of similar to how read it
works today except instead of being
hosted on one server Usenet is much more
distributed with articles and replies
pushed out to many different news
servers and special Usenet clients
required for access this is because use
net isn't part of the web like BBS is
Usenet later came to be used for file
transfers which is the most popular
reason people access the network today
as actual discussion is much more common
on web-based services though many ISPs
no longer offer access to Usenet due to
concerns about illegal file sharing of
course things really changed in the
mid-90s with the rise of instant
messaging programs for modern graphical
operating systems like ICQ and more
notably AOL Instant Messenger or aim
which took the world by storm with its
buddy icons and thanks to user bios
replete with in
side jokes thanks in no small part to
all of those promotional discs that AOL
sent out via snail mail aim had plenty
of rivals on the Instant Messaging scene
but remain very popular until the late
2000s when Gmail became widespread and
offered integrated gchat helping to set
a trend that saw a myriad of websites
and smartphone apps implement instant
messaging with everything from business
oriented video conferencing software to
dating websites like OkCupid getting
into the swing of things and with
standard internet speeds becoming faster
and faster from both cell phone
providers and traditional ISPs it didn't
take long for picture and video
messaging to become common in ion
applications with some programs like
apples FaceTime for video and snapchat
initially pictures but now video as well
focusing almost exclusively on it no
word yet though on when we'll have
support for holographic messaging so you
can give your friends a 360 degree view
of whatever trendy food you just spent
way too much money on for the sole
purpose of sending a picture of it to
them
speaking of sending to them tunnel their
VPN allows you to send out your internet
traffic and have the websites and
services you use not know exactly where
it came from there that was quite
belabored but we eventually got their
title Bayer VPN is easy to use and lets
you tunnel through up to 20 different
countries letting you browse the
Internet and use online services as
though you're in a different country
they have easy news apps for iOS Android
PC and Mac also a Chrome extension you
just turn the switch and boom you are
tunneled your connection is encrypted
and you appear to those web sites as
though you are from somewhere else
entirely
total bear lets you bypass all the
annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal use no
messing around with port configurations
or DNS or anything like that and they
have a top rated privacy policy so try
out tunnel bear for free with five
hundred megabytes thrown in for nothing
and no credit card required and if you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can say ten percent by going to
