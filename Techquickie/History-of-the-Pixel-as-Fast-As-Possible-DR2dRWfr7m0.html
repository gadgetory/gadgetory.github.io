picture element and today's video is all
about the history of the pixel it begins
all the way back in 1839 when the first
practical commercially available process
of photography was introduced it was
called the daguerreotype and it involves
all of this stuff but photography only
continued to improve from there and soon
the daguerreotype was obsolete
photography was pretty much
black-and-white until the first
permanent color photograph was taken in
1861 by a man named James Clerk Maxwell
what he did was capture three
black-and-white images each through a
different filter red blue and green by
projecting each of these images back
through their respective colored filters
and onto a screen
the final colored image was able to be
reconstructed and here it is it's a
tartan ribbon tartan is also what spell
check always tries to change my name to
anyway this process of capturing just
the primary colors of red green and blue
light works so well that we still use it
to this day because red green and blue
are primary additive colors you can mix
them together in different proportions
to achieve any color you like
continuing along the timeline in 1926 a
man named John Logie Baird demonstrated
the first televised moving images using
a mechanical television set that used a
rapidly rotating nib qov scanning disk
it was grayscale and limited to 12.5
frames a second and just thirty lines of
resolution but it was very impressive
for the time notice how we're measuring
the resolution in lines not pixels
pixels hadn't been invented yet but
we're getting closer later in 1927 filo
T Farnsworth demonstrated the completely
electronic cathode ray tube television
set the CRT was definitely superior to
the mechanical television sets
especially since it had no moving parts
here's how it works you've got a sealed
glass tube with a vacuum inside at one
end you've got an electron gun which is
exactly what it sounds like
this gun shoots out a varied stream of
electrons which are then steered by the
magnets such that they land upon the
phosphoric covered screen at the
the end of the tube forming a picture
and it's done so quickly that you can't
even see it happening color television
was first introduced in the 1950s and
they worked in a very similar way
instead of just one electron gun now you
had three one for each of the primary
colors of red green and blue the beams
would hit an array of colored phosphorus
called triads these triads are still not
quite pixels the color TV standard at
the time was five hundred and twelve
distinct horizontal lines it wasn't
until the digital age that those video
lines were further sliced into
rectangles which made digital
representation of an image possible and
thus the pixel was finally born today
pixels come in a variety of shapes and
sizes on a variety of screens like
plasma Oh le d-- and LCD displays which
have rendered CRTs mostly obsolete
pixels have continued to get smaller and
smaller with better frame rates and
better color depth we've already made
videos about all these topics which you
