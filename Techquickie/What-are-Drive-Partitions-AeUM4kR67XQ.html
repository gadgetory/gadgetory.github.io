was pretty much a necessity to partition
or divide up your drives especially if
you were running a higher capacity drive
on an old operating system such as
Windows 95 and believe me having to deal
with like twelve partitions because of
filesystem limitations was kind of a
drag nowadays though with everyone on a
Windows based PC anyway using NTFS
partitioning is no longer necessary but
it can be a valuable tool so what
exactly then is partitioning and why is
it still relevant when we can just dump
everything onto one giant 8 terabyte
drive and be done with it well
partitioning means splitting one
physical hard drive or SSD into several
different logical drives or volumes that
your operating system will treat as if
they were completely separate physical
drives each volume on a partitioned disk
has its own drive letter you know like C
or D or Z and folder structure and can
also be formatted even with different
file systems without affecting your
other partitions at all
so if you're just rocking one Drive in
your system partitioning allows you some
pretty cool functionality you could set
up a hidden partition with no drive
letter assigned so non tech-savvy
roommates won't be able to find a
particular virtual drive many PC
manufacturers include recovery
partitions that are hidden away and have
all of your operating system and drivers
and pre installed applications they're
ready for you to say hey I'm ready to
restore my PC or if you wanted to dual
boot your system very useful if you
wanted to try out Linux or run a
previous version of Windows for improved
compatibility without installing a whole
new physical disk or getting rid of your
more modern operating system multiple
partitions can also help keep your data
safe if something happens to your OS
installation one popular way to do this
is to put your personal files and data
on a separate partition so if your OS
gets corrupted or infected with certain
types of malware you can just wipe it
and do a clean reinstall without also
nuking your important stuff though it
should be noted this does nothing to
protect that data from a physical drive
failure partitions can also help though
with a slow mechanical drive through a
technique called short stroking you see
because of the way that hard drive
platters spin the read or write head and
your hard drive actually accesses data
near the outer portion of the disk more
quickly short stroking involves creating
a partition that only takes up the
faster outer portion of the platter not
a bad place to install programs that you
need to access quickly if you don't have
room or you can't afford an SSD upgrade
so how do you create a partition then
well there's a wide variety of ways you
can actually specify multiple partition
sizes when you're installing operating
systems such as Windows from within
Windows you can use Disk Management to
actually shrink and expand volumes which
allows you to partition the space that
is no longer being taken up by a volume
you can buy dedicated tools such as
Paragon hard disk manager that's the one
that we use around here at the office
whenever we have to work with partitions
or I'm sure that the comments are going
to be full and everyone's favorite open
source partition management software and
you can check out the most up voted ones
there as well but there are downsides to
partitioning for one because of
filesystem overhead
splitting your disk into multiple
partitions results in lower overall
capacity than if you just had one big
partition you also have to configure
Windows to store your data intelligently
on a secondary partition unless you want
to just be manually moving things around
and the same goes for programs because
installing programs and one volume and
then trying to move them over to another
one is pretty much not a thing meaning
that even if the idea was to save
yourself from OS corruption if you're
installing a bunch of programs to that
other drive you're actually going to
have to go clean them out manually and
reinstall them anyway
but if you're the type of person that
appreciates fine-tuning and tinkering
and you you know want your data backups
there and you want to put your managed
files there then don't be afraid of
partitions I mean after all we're we
being without partitions and public
bathrooms I don't even want to imagine
that kind of world you know what other
kind of world I don't want to imagine
one without Squarespace Squarespace lets
