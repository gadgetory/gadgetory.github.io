approach to protecting your login
credentials that requires the
presentation of two or more of the three
independent authentication factors a
knowledge factor something only the user
knows a possession factor something only
the user has and an inherence factor
something only the user is the most
popular form of multi-factor
authentication is two-factor
authentication which is used by online
services like Gmail and steam the three
factors are pretty clearly defined
knowledge factors include pin codes
personal questions like your mother's
maiden name
passwords and swipe tap or knock
patterns like those on smartphone lock
screens possession factors are physical
items like an identification card that
you would swipe to access secure areas
of a building or a USB Drive with an
encryption key on it that decrypts the
protected folder on a computer but for
the most part possession factors are
being eliminated and replaced by
smartphone features and apps making your
smartphone your possession factor
inherence factors are also known as
biometric identifiers there are
relatively new form of authentication
and include face recognition fingerprint
scans voice prints and the ever popular
sci-fi friendly iris and retinal scans
now there's no doubt that biometric
authentication factors are super cool
and while they're quickly being pushed
into the mainstream they're also meeting
a fair bit of resistance and for good
reason one issue is that biometric
information can be easily repeated once
compromised and a second is that many
individuals object to having their
biometric information tracked and stored
in a database somewhere which seems like
a fairly valid concern given the amount
of secure data that gets compromised on
a daily basis and that unlike a password
you can't run around changing your
fingerprints or retinas at least not yet
so that's what it is
but what is it for well better security
logging in by combining a knowledge
factor like your password with a
possession factor like a physical key or
a code sent to your smartphone makes
your account much more difficult to
target for online attacks
let's think Gmail's two-factor
authentication as an example even if I
want to be a count
a cure obtains your password with a key
logger or a security question exploit
Google will require the entry of a six
digit code that they send to you that
must be entered within a couple minutes
something that hijacker can't get
without your smartphone and on top of
that and we're continuing the Gmail
example here once someone tries to log
in with the correct password that
notification will go straight to you and
you'll immediately know that someone is
trying to access your account without
your permission and also that it's
probably time to re-evaluate your
extremely secure password of gaben is
love gaben is life now there are a few
reasons why people don't use
multi-factor authentication some
services don't support it some people
share accounts with a couple or a
business partner so they can't both have
the same smartphone at the same time to
use it and then some people just plain
can't be arsed to add another step to
their login process but if you truly
care about keeping your personal data
private from prying eyes aside from
those with a warrant that is then the
message here is that it's worth the
effort if the service doesn't support it
maybe you should find one that does if
you share an email account with your
significant other or business partner
just get your own email they aren't
exactly expensive and if you simply
don't care well then I think you're
under estimating what someone with
access to your accounts can do to you
I've been ki logged before and
multi-factor authentication on one of my
accounts was the only thing that kept me
from losing other ones speaking of
things that you should use multi-factor
authentication on your lynda.com account
because knowledge is the most valuable
of all resources and you need to protect
it well maybe I'm being a little bit
melodramatic but Linda calm is an
amazing resource with thousands of great
courses available in their library you
can learn Adobe programs pick up some
new photography skills learn about web
design business or music production or
essentially whatever you want to do
online head over to lynda.com and check
it out their courses are taught by
industry experts and they add new ones
every week so no matter how much you may
know already or learn from lynda.com
there's always something new to check
out and best of all their service is
very affordable with plans starting at
only 25 bucks a month
