days but convenient as it may be it's
still limited by a number of things how
fast your internet connection is whether
you're subject to the more and more
common data caps on your service and
whether you're willing to deal with
recurring billing from someone like
Netflix so maybe it isn't too surprising
that blu-ray discs have found popularity
among people who are serious about
movies and home theater enthusiasts
despite the fact that optical media as a
whole is in decline which you can learn
more about up here it might seem like a
shame that the optical disc is seen as a
technology that's becoming obsolete
since blu-ray has only been on the
market for about 10 years back in the
early mid 2000s it became clear that
HDTV would be as commonplace as
old-school TVs in the near future so
there was a lot of interest in
developing a disc format that had high
enough capacities to hold full 1080p
movies especially as standard DVDs
generally can't even hold an hour of HD
video so the solution was to develop a
disc that used blue lasers instead of
the traditional red lasers you see blue
light has a shorter wavelength than red
meaning that the little pits on an
optical disc that store the information
could be made smaller the result was
that many more of these little pits
could be burnt into a blu-ray than a DVD
in fact standard blu-ray discs can hold
over five times as much data as their
DVD counterparts and although blu-ray
had to compete against a rival format
called HD DVD for a few years that use
similar technology blu-ray ended up
winning this new VHS versus Betamax
style format war due to major movie
studios supporting blu-ray the
incorporation of blu-ray drives into the
PlayStation 3 and consumer confusion
over the difference between HD DVD and
normal DVD so with that blu-ray stands
alone as the one format of choice for HD
video but what does it offer that
streaming services can't other than the
obvious ability to function even if your
router cuts out or because your roommate
had to microwave his freakin burrito one
of the biggest draws isn't the video but
the audio blu-ray discs have enough
capacity to support lossless audio
formats like Dolby true HD and
ts HD master audio which offer up to 8
discrete channels and incredibly
detailed sound as long as your speakers
and receiver are up to par we're also
seeing movie studios release extras like
deleted scenes exclusively on blu-ray
meaning they often aren't available on
streaming services the tech isn't
resting on its laurels either as higher
capacity blu-rays holding full-length 4k
movies are set to hit the market this
year along with support for new digital
audio standards like Dolby Atmos and DTS
X which offer much more precise spatial
orientation of sound than traditional
multi-channel setups by contrast
streaming services don't yet offer
lossless audio even 4k video alone is
too much for the internet speeds that
many average users have and can chew
through 300 gigabytes of a monthly data
cap quite quickly so if you're a real
movie buff you might not want to start
thinking of optical discs as coasters
