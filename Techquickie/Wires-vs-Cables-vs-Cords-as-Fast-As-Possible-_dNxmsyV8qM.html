not the cable not the cord the wire huh
what do you mean you thought they were
the same thing I guess it's not that
surprising since most people don't know
the difference between them since cable
and cord can often be used
interchangeably and then a wire is a
component of either of them
so we'll start with wires a wire is a
single conductor usually made of one
strand but sometimes more of a
conductive metal like copper or aluminum
since it's made of a conductor it can
carry electricity either to power
something on the other end or deliver
some type of signal often for
telecommunication but the important
thing here is that a wire even if it's
got multiple strands acts as a single
conductor a cable is a group of two or
more wires glass fibers or other
materials often twisted and running
together to the same place just like
with wires most cables can carry either
electricity or electrical signals but
there's a lot more variety in their
design depending on the intended
application copper cables come in all
kinds of sizes and shapes simple three
conductor AC power cables the type
you'll have all around your house
twisted pair the type you'll find in an
Ethernet network cable coaxial where the
two conductors carry different signal
and the list goes on and on sometimes
they're all working together like how
the two wires in a DC power cable are
just insulated positive and negative
power for one device but in other cases
like a Thunderbolt cable a sweet
technology that we covered in this video
here they might actually carry power and
multiple types of signaling along the
same cable at the same time to be broken
out at the other end the definition does
trikha phi a little though where
materials other than metal are involved
a fiber-optic cable is still a cable
even when it's a single strand because a
wire must be made of a conductive metal
and while outside of electronics a cable
is still usually made of metal like on a
suspension bridge in some cases only
when it's very heavy and strong it can
refer to a rope a cord is very similar
to a cable multiple strands of either a
conductor or rope all insulated or
twisted together and going to the same
place
with the main difference being the
flexibility and ruggedness
so for non-conductors the thick ropes
from before would be cables but not
cords and for a thin rope that would be
a cord but not a cable for electrical
stuff most of what you find in your
house could be called either a cord or a
cable interchangeably but any thicker
industrial grade gear is automatically a
cable so now you know while all of these
things are related and there is some
overlap they are actually different
after all and now that you know the next
time someone confuse a wire with a cable
you can be a decent human being and say
nothing because in the grand scheme of
things it really doesn't matter or you
can stop them in their tracks and drop
your knowledge on them like a ton of
bricks by sharing this video
speaking of dropping knowledge one of
the best ways to expand your knowledge
is through reading and oh what's that
you don't have time to read well I guess
it's a good thing that today's video
