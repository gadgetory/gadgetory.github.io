the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos it's
happened to all of us you're reading a
fascinating article about how printer
companies are ripping you off or
whatever and suddenly the web page is
screaming at you like a banshee out on
the moors
my name is will and I am a 2-person
that's right it's another Auto playing
video and not only did it hurt your
eardrums or wake your roommate but it
probably wasn't even related to whatever
you're reading about so what's the point
of having these things all over the
Internet if you've ever asked this
question you're definitely not alone
surveys indicate that the vast majority
of Internet users dislike videos that
automatically play without permission
but we're seeing more and more of them
for a very simple reason more money cash
dollar dollar bills y'all
you see back in the day some of the
biggest irritants the web users were
pop-up and banner ads that you see
inside your browser they try to get your
attention by flashing at you or trying
to entice you to play some kind of
hastily conceived game that concealed
you guessed it even more advertising but
although banner ads are still around the
super attention-grabbing interactive
ones have been disappearing along with
support for Adobe Flash and those
ever-popular ad blocking extensions for
web browsers have made eradicating these
ads a piece of cake
fortunately for online marketers though
internet speed has grown tremendously
over the last couple of decades making
video an option videos are not only more
engaging than the banner ads of
yesteryear they can be auto played with
sound to immediately capture a viewers
attention and what really helped
autoplay in videos proliferate is how
often we use apps to access services
like Twitter and Facebook now instead of
web browsers standalone apps like these
allow developers to control the user
experience much more tightly than a
browser browsers can be customized with
ad blockers and other extensions because
their general purpose tools for viewing
any web page but specific apps are
highly customized by developers for just
one service so good luck trying to find
a way to disable timeline ads on your
phone some of your favorite foods
combine this with the fact that it can
be tricky for ad blockers to tell the
difference between a spam video and one
that the user actually wants to watch
and it's not surprising that autoplay
video has become the go-to conduit for
ads much to the chagrin of every
smartphone user trying to fight data
caps but hold on a second Colton there
are also plenty of Auto playing videos
that aren't advertising why are these
such a big thing now well even though
these videos contain actual non
advertising content and these are
especially common on news and commentary
sites there's still a pretty strong
monetary incentive to have these videos
play as soon as you click on a link -
tennis max
as the largest display ever as many
sites rely on advertising revenue to
keep themselves afloat autoplay and
videos can pump up analytics numbers so
they can tell advertisers hey we get 10
million video plays per day on our
website to entice marketers to buy
advertising space due to a site's
perceived popularity even if most users
are stopping the video right away and
cursing at the screen this could also
very well be part of why YouTube changes
algorithm recently to put more emphasis
on watch time rather than raw view count
when deciding which videos will appear
at the top of search results or what
will get recommended to you on that note
on that note if you're still watching
this video we'd really appreciate you
sticking around until the end it helps
us keep the lights on just like this
