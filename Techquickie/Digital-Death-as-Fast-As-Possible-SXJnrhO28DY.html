certain to happen in your life as
finding trolls in the comments under a
YouTube video but while doing your taxes
might only keep you away from your petty
online arguments with complete strangers
for a few hours
death obviously means nothing else ever
no more taking pictures no more google
hangouts and no more tweets about your
epic half-mile jog that frankly nobody
cares about so when you finally do kick
the bucket and head off to the great
Apple Store in the sky what happens to
all that stuff does it just sit there
until the end of the world is there a
digital tombstone you can leave a witty
meme engraved in or does your digital
life just get cremated and disappear
from the internet altogether great
question email didn't really start
taking off until the mid 1990s with
social media coming about ten years
later so all of this stuff is still
fairly new with much of it having been
designed or at least primarily used by
the younger crowd so it hasn't been much
of a concern yet but at some point the
billions of people using these services
are going to grow old and die with dead
people eventually having far more
accounts than the living which might
sound like a great setup for some sort
of zombie take over the internet but
that movie hasn't been made yet so I'll
focus instead on what actually happens
we can't cover every site and scenario
so let's just walk through a couple of
the common ones starting with Facebook
cleverly Facebook allows a person's
profile to be turned into a memorial
page upon receipt of some sort of proof
of death from a family member such as an
obituary your page will become a place
for loved ones to post memories if they
so wish and you can also designate a
legacy contact to maintain your page in
a limited way but don't worry they can't
rifle through your embarrassing personal
messages or if you're not particularly
proud of the random junk you've posted
over the years you can actually tell
Facebook to just delete your account
entirely when you buy the proverbial
farm bill for folks who are more into
twitting a family member can ask to take
down your twitter page after you pass
away in much the same way but they don't
offer the same memorialization service
that facebook does so all the social
media sites are going to differ a little
bit but moving on from so
to media you probably also have a
treasure trove of old email gems like
that offer for viagra so what happens to
those well some email services like
Gmail will allow a user you designate to
access your account while other services
like Yahoo don't allow anyone to get
into your stash of offers to enlarge
your penis and just end up deleting all
of it after they receive a death
certificate so if your plan then is to
preserve your digital life for posterity
it's good to set things in order before
you make your journey to the great
beyond
there actually are websites that have
begun popping up that will send your
account passwords to people you choose
after your death and if you want to go
the legal route you can likely also
express your last wishes regarding all
of your internet accounts in a will just
remember that wills often become public
records after you die so think carefully
about whether you want people to know
that you used to log into Twitter with
the password I like big butts 69 before
you put your last wishes on paper
speaking of paper that's what I used to
use whenever I didn't have Dollar Shave
Club
razors and I cut myself all over the I
know how to use a razor blade I mean
there's no excuse for just like cutting
yourself all over the place but there's
no denying that a high quality sharp
razor makes it easier to do a good job
of cutting your face
Shoal hair not your face just your
facial hair so Dollar Shave Club is the
online service that's available in the
US Canada New Zealand and Australia that
sends you new razors and shaving
supplies once every month for just a few
bucks they've got razor blades all the
way up to the six blade executive
they've got their aftershave they've got
their shave butter they've got their one
wipe Charlies which are peppermint
scented butt wipes for men what those
have to do with all the other shaving
supplies in their repertoire I mean you
can shave your butt so I guess they're
sort of related in that way the point is
guys visit dollarshaveclub.com we've got
a link in the video description to learn
more and join the club now start shaving
time and shaving money I gotta throw
that in so that's pretty much it guys
