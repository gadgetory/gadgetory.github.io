days is the graphics card I mean there's
plenty of other cool components that you
can throw in your rig but nothing quite
matches the experience of unboxing and
slotting in a new GPU to turn a
run-of-the-mill computer into a gaming
battle station but hold on a minute have
you ever wondered why we need a separate
GPU at all I mean instead of the whole
PCI Express card paradigm why haven't we
seen something like a dual CPU board
where you can tell your computer to use
one CPU for CPU things and then the
other CPU can be just for graphics I
mean are those big clunky cards really
necessary
great question on the surface CPUs and
GPUs appear to be very similar they are
both silicon based micro processors
mounted to a PCB with heat sinks
attached to them but when you look at
their microarchitecture they have some
fundamental differences that make them
suited for different roles inside your
PC think of it like this many people go
around carrying Swiss Army knives
everywhere they go because they're very
useful multi-purpose tools they can cut
things they can open wide bottles even
pick last night's broccoli out of your
teeth but suppose you're unlucky enough
to need an operation
because you met with an unfortunate land
party accident you probably don't want
the surgeon just flick and open a Swiss
Army knife and going to town instead he
or she will use a surgical knife or even
a laser cutter they can't do all the
things a Swiss Army knife can but
they're specialized devices that can do
one thing very very well similarly your
computer's main CPU is good at doing
lots of different things quickly modern
pcs are very general purpose machines
that can do you know spreadsheets or
write horrible fanfiction or illustrate
aforementioned horrible fanfiction make
Skype calls listening to deeply
embarrassing music please
and edit audio/video the list goes on
because of this your CPU needs to be
able to handle lots of random and
diverse instructions efficiently so that
you can multitask without wanting to
pull your hair out
GPUs however are really only there for
one purpose with an asterisk to render
graphics which involves doing millions
of very similar calculations at the same
time in parallel because of this GPUs
are focused more on raw throughput than
a CPU which is designed to be much more
versatile and and balanced all these
different workloads like a waiter with
you know 18 plates stacked up on top of
each other
GPU architecture usually features lots
and lots of identical compute units that
deal with solving the similar
mathematical functions that determine
how a bullets trajectory or waving
Braille aids of glass or whatever show
up on your screen
in fact the highly parallelized nature
of a GPU has led to a growth in
popularity of general-purpose computing
on graphics cards as well commonly known
as GPGPU certain applications aside from
games this is where the asterisk comes
in can take advantage of higher-end GPUs
things like Bitcoin mining or Stanford
University's folding at-home project
which calculates the way that proteins
fold for Disease Research both of these
require the type of heavy
number-crunching that GPUs excel at
but while GPUs are finding uses other
than just gaming you probably won't want
to try and run your operating system on
a graphics card as the differences
between your GPU and CPU are still very
significant so don't expect the idea of
using a separate graphics card to go
away any time soon
and after all there's nothing quite like
showing off your high-end card through
the side panel window to be the envy of
all your friends without having to hide
it under a CPU heatsink speaking of
hiding
I'm sure if you run a small business
you're
not hiding that accounting is like the
worst part like I would rather take out
the garbage then sit and go through all
of that paperwork and fresh books is on
a mission to make freelancers and small
business owners less stressed out and
more organized through their easy-to-use
online tool for crafting and sending
professional invoices in seconds
tracking their hours so when it comes
time to create the invoice you know
exactly what you did when you did it and
who did it for and even enabling new and
better functionality like the ability
now to accept deposits through their
platform so your work is paid for on
your schedule they've even got a tool to
manage your expense report so their
mobile app lets you take a picture of
your receipts and pretty much handles
the rest getting started on fresh books
is super easy even if you're not a
numbers person all you got to do to try
fresh books for free for 30 days is go
to fresh books comm forward slash tech
quickie and enter tech quickie in the
how did you hear about a section so
thanks for watching guys if you liked
this video hit that like button
put it come on if you disliked it hit
this like maybe leave a comment letting
us know what we can fix for it for next
time you can also leave a comment if you
have suggestions for future fast as
possible and if you're done doing all
that stuff make sure you subscribe and
follow on Twitter I think we've Twitter
handles and the video script I don't
know we still put them there anyway
don't worry too much about that and
check out our other channels we've got
some great videos over on channel super
fun lately that you're definitely going
to want to check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
