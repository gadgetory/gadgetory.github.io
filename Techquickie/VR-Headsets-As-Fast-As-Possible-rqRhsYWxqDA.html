to escape the sometimes underwhelming
reality of everyday life going to the
movies visiting the local watering hole
or just sleeping until noon but there's
been a lot of buzz recently about the
idea of actually immersing yourself in a
virtual world with a virtual reality
headset such as the oculus rift or HTC
vive but even though the concept of
plugging a general-purpose VR headset
into a gaming PC is just starting to
take off
people have been sticking their heads
into virtual environments for quite some
time all the way back to 1962 when the
world was introduced to the sensorama a
contraption that not only played 3d
movies but could tilt the viewer seat
and even simulate wind and different
odors a few years later a headset called
the sword of Damocles came out man they
had better names back then rift vive I
want a sword of Damocles the name was
because it was so heavy though that it
had to be suspended from the ceiling
although it could only display simple
wireframe graphics it was considered the
first true VR headset virtual reality in
video games didn't really start
appearing until the 1980s when we
started seeing arcade games like
battlezone that used a periscope
viewfinder to immerse players in the
action and 3d glasses that were
available for consoles like the Sega
Master System 1995 brought us the
Nintendo Virtual Boy the first mass
marketed VR console but although that
one was marketed as being a totally
immersive experience its underwhelming
monochrome graphics and difficulty of
use made it one of the worst flops in
Nintendo history however other companies
were working on PC compatible headsets
during this time and the evolution of
technology over the years ultimately
gave us the hi-spec VR headsets of today
but then how do they work
modern VR headsets show slightly
different images to each of your eyes to
fool your brain into thinking the 2d
image on the screen is actually 3d this
principle is called stereoscopy and is
actually similar to how the screen on a
Nintendo 3ds works to achieve a higher
level of immersion VR headsets use
special lenses to increase the users
field of view as well as pixels with
very quick response times to reduce
motion blur meaning OLED screens have
become popular for headsets which you
can learn more about here by the way
unlike a monitor which can deliver a
perfectly enjoyable gaming experience at
60 frames per second headsets have
higher refresh rates typically around 90
Hertz and the high quality ones today
which is important because lower frame
rates lower refresh rates can be
disorienting in a VR context and cause
motion sickness not what you want after
you've dropped several hundred bucks on
a rift or a vibe because though of the
high frame rate requirement and the
headset resolutions that are well beyond
1080p a high-end PC system is basically
a necessity but beyond just graphics VR
headsets have sensors like gyroscopes
and accelerometers to allow for head
tracking so that what you see will
change depending on where you're looking
some headsets like the HTC vive even use
separate external base stations and
lasers to enable whole room tracking so
the system can detect the motion of your
hands as well so as you can imagine
these headsets don't exactly come cheap
fortunately other lower-cost VR
solutions are becoming increasingly
popular such as Google cardboard which
isn't much more than a couple of lenses
inside a cardboard box with a slot where
you can insert a smartphone developers
have already written quite a few apps
for cardboard making it a way to enjoy
VR on the cheap if you don't have the
coin for a gaming rig and a fancier
headset and although this new generation
of VR headsets is just now hitting the
market there's already quite a bit of
industry support meaning that VR has the
potential to really
make up how we experience games on both
PCs and consoles maybe one day we'll
even have VR tech quickie I mean after
all don't you want the experience of
feeling like you're in the same room as
me yeah it's really not that exciting
