thinking all that much about electronics
disposal but nowadays there's a
veritable glut of inexpensive portable
electronics available around the globe
in fact they're so common that some
countries are starting to treat Internet
access as a human right and like
anything else our electronics wear out
over time or at the very least become
embarrassing when something better comes
along which can take a surprisingly
short amount of time I mean think about
how often smartphones get updated so
what happens to all this stuff when
we're done using it does it all go to
some retro tech museum in the sky when
we throw it away
unfortunately no much of it simply gets
buried in landfills when people throw
out their old modems or whatever else
along with banana peels and that clown
toy that Sally never wanted to play with
for some reason but as you might guess
most electronic waste or e-waste is it
biodegradable and even contains toxic
metals like mercury and cadmium as well
as other not-so-good chemicals that can
leach through landfills and end up in
groundwater not a great situation I mean
even if you don't think of yourself as a
tree hugger you're probably not a big
fan of mercury flavored coffee so lots
of folks then opt to recycle their waste
instead of just tossing it in the trash
but how exactly does electronics
recycling work well sorry to bust your
happy carbon neutral bubble but the
inconvenient truth is that it often
doesn't although there are lots of
places that advertise electronic waste
disposal much of it doesn't actually end
up disposed of properly at all instead
much of it is shipped off to poorer
countries for reclamation where things
like circuit boards are literally set on
fire or dunked into acid so the workers
can go dig through it afterwards and
recover useful materials such as copper
and gold so as you might be able to
guess then there are lots of talk
SiC fumes that get released when
electronics are burned which has created
serious health problems in impoverished
areas that are economically dependent on
this kind of dangerous manual labor
nevertheless it continues to happen
because shipping a waste to a less
fortunate part of the globe is cheaper
than processing it at home of course
this isn't meant to be a socio-political
lecture so let's talk then about how
reputable electronics recycling and
disposable services deal with your
unwanted ghosts from Black Friday's past
some places like free geek Vancouver
rely on manual volunteer labor to
separate plastics and metals and the
different kinds of plastics and the
different kinds of metals so they can be
reused and/or recycled but there are
higher tech facilities that actually
automate this process by using automatic
shredders that will shred your old
processors motherboards and electric
toothbrushes without releasing the same
kinds of harsh chemicals into the air
that burning does after shredding the
bits of e-waste are sorted sometimes
using optical sensing for increased
accuracy according to the types of
materials which are then sold to other
companies that use these reclaimed
metals and plastics in other products
everything from car batteries to
furniture of course if you have
something that's outdated but still
functional it's usually better to find a
way to reuse it rather than recycling it
so you can sell or donate it to an
organization again like free geek here
in Vancouver that specializes in
refurbishing old electronics and
computer hardware with that said
sometimes it's just broken so if you do
have to recycle it make sure you're
taking it to your reputable recycler and
not a place that will just ship it
offshore or you could just sell it to
the script Kitty down the street in
exchange for your very own botnet yes
speaking of selling things do you have a
small business are you racing against
the clock as a freelancer doing like
computer work
or like running a dance studio out of
your garage or whatever it is that
you're doing it's challenging but thanks
to the power of the Internet and fresh
books you can spend more time doing your
work and less time figuring out how
complicated accounting software works

way you work and it's the simplest and
