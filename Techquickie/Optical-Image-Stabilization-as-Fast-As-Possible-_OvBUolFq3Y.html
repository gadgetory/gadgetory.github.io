cameras on today's hottest cellphones
one starts running into an awful lot of
photography specific terminology being
thrown around and the term that seems to
have been all the rage lately is optical
image stabilization or oh is if you
happen to be into the whole brevity
thing now many phones offer today such
as the iPhone six-plus are touting OIS
as the next great thing and cell phone
camera technology and well it's not
exactly new in this form of
stabilization has been readily available
in ordinary cameras for some years now
but it's not all marketing fluff and
unnecessary fanfare either because what
makes it special is not how new the idea
is but how small and efficient these
systems have become now in the past the
only image stabilization readily offered
on cell phone cameras was that of the
digital variety which worked alright for
minimizing that annoying bobbing effect
in video footage but did squat in the
way of reducing shakiness or motion blur
that is caused by camera movement and
this is where optical image stabilizer
come in they helped to produce
higher-quality images by reacting to
stimulus in real time ensuring that the
path between the lens and the sensor is
perfectly aligned before the subject is
captured thus allowing you the user or
an end software to more easily focus the
image so to accomplish this
manufacturers utilize highly sensitive
gyroscopic sensors in any range of - too
many which provide data as to the angle
and movement of the camera and some even
exist specifically to provide extra
functionalities such as improved
vertical stability while taking
panoramic shots these directional
sensors work in combination with tiny
electromagnets that affect the angle of
either the lens or the image sensor
depending on the type of OIS employed so
the first type will be looking at lens
based applications are found in high-end
cameras and works by affecting the axis
of the lens in response to movement
keeping the image tracked on the sensor
as squarely as possible the main
advantage to this style is that the
image seen by the user is as stable and
clear as possible but it failed
in applications where no distance can be
created between the lens and the sensor
so you're pretty much hooped if you want
to jam this kind of tech into a
cellphone which brings us to the second
type sensor based or in body stabilizers
which by contrast effect the angle of
the image sensor in response to stimulus
and have the added benefit of being able
to adjust the focal length between it
and the lens as well this type of
stabilization can be compact enough to
fit into small things like cell phones
while also being a much more affordable
and practical option as it prevents the
user from having to haul around a bunch
of really heavy not to mention expensive
camera lenses of course that's not to
say that sensor based options are
without their disadvantages since the
image projected onto the sensor is not
already stabilized negative qualities
such as reduced low-light autofocus
performance can be an issue especially
in instances where there is noticeable
lag in the electronic viewfinder or
screen image also these types of
stabilizers are greatly dependent on
their movement speed and the size of the
lens in front of them meaning to improve
long distance and motion performance at
some point the lens must get bigger and
as many of us know getting bigger to
improve performance is simply not always
an option
speaking of improving performance
coolermaster thanks to great partners
like them fast as possible has evolved
from this to the quality that you see
today and they do more to support
grassroots efforts than you might
realize right now in addition to having
their high quality cases power supplies
and cooling products for your next
custom-built PC they're running their
case mod World Series entries close
February 7th and anybody can enter you
do not have to be a professional case
mater in order to have a shot at a prize
because it's a multi tiered competition
so you know you will actually be facing
off against modders of your own caliber
there's around $25,000 u.s. value and
potential prizes which in Canada now is
like lots of more than 25 thousand
because our dollars like yeah and for
the first time they're partnering up
with Dremel to give away some really
cool tools to the winners so check it
