course RH 110 an extreme performance
liquid cooler that uses two 140
millimeter cooling fans on a massive 280
millimeter radiator we're going to tell
you what you need to know about it and
show you how to install it in your
gaming system your CPU needs cooling and
as the transistors get smaller and
smaller and the die sizes shrink we need
even more efficient ways to move the
heat away from the CPU and dissipate it
to the surrounding air modern systems
won't run at all without some kind of
cooling so odds are if your computer is
working you have a cooler in it but it's
probably a stock cooler these are
designed to be compact for maximum
compatibility and low cost so that it
can easily be mass-produced and that my
friends is where high performance liquid
coolers come in you can use a small
compact CPU cooler and pump combo unit
to move the heat away with the
efficiency of water to a large radiator
where it can then be dissipated to the
air molar liquid coolers using 120
millimeter fans already leave many
aftermarket air coolers in the dust
preventing CPU overheating and aiding an
overclocking just like that however what
if you could have 36 percent more
surface area by using 140 millimeter
fans instead of 120 millimeter fans the
H 110 is easy to install if you have a
Phillips head screwdriver and you're
comfortable opening up the side panel of
your case it comes with not only the
cooler but also to 140 millimeter fans
and all of the mounting hardware that
you need to mount it on an Intel or an
AMD system the first step is to remove
your stock cooler either by removing the
clips on AMD or turning each of the 4
pins on your Intel system
counterclockwise
then remove the CPU fan header from the
motherboard and clean off the CPU using
a lint-free cloth and 99% isopropyl
alcohol last but not least if your case
has any fans pre-installed in the holes
that you intend to install the H 110 in
you'll have to remove those as well but
the C 70 does not since this is an Intel
platform we're using the universal Intel
back plate which has mounting holes for
775 1155 1156 and 1366 2011 is done
without a backplate so all we do is put
the mounting pegs through the back apply
the adhesive strips then remove the
covers then position it on the back of
the motherboard so that the pegs stick
through the holes in the board the
adhesive keeps it in place while you're
installing the CPU cooler from the other
side now installing the fans can be a
little bit tricky but I'm going to show
you guys the way that I find is best so
rather than having the case right-side
up I've moved it either on to its side
or on to its back so that I can support
all of the screws in place and all of
the fans in place at the same time
because this case has rubber grommets in
the 140 millimeter mounting holes I
don't need to use the optional washers
that are included with the H 110 once I
have the fans in place it'll be less
difficult to position the H 110
correctly up against the fans then all I
have to do is fine tune it until the
screws go into the holes on the radiator
itself
I recommend hand tightening them at
first in order to avoid cross threading
the mounting holes once a few of them
are threaded in it becomes much simpler
to go ahead and use your screwdriver to
tighten everything up I've opted to
install the included fans as exhaust
fans because the C 70 is quite a well
ventilated chassis however if I had a
tighter chassis that's not as open
inside I might use them as intakes to
get better temperatures for my CPU
the flexible tubing on the h 110 allows
the CPU cooling unit to be easily
positioned over the CPU socket I
recommend hand tightening the thumb
screws first after carefully aligning
them over the backplate and then using
the screwdriver this helps you avoid
damaging your motherboard by
accidentally driving a screw into the
PCB once it's time to tighten with the
screwdriver tighten in a cross pattern
to avoid putting excess pressure on one
side of your processor Corsairs mounting
mechanism is designed to screw in until
it stops that's when you're putting the
right amount of pressure on the mounting
mechanism
you're almost there the system looks
great compared to having that stock
cooler in there
however these loose wires are probably
going to be an issue plug the three pin
fan connector coming out of the pump
unit into the CPU fan header on your
motherboard each of the radiator fans
then need to be plugged into available
headers on the motherboard or on a fan
controller if you don't have any
available headers then you can plug them
directly into your power supply using
adapters as well
if you've been following along with our
installation guide then congratulations
your CPU is now water-cooled if you
haven't been following along then try a
coarser Hydra series cooler today to
find out why coarser is the number one
seller of CPU liquid cooling systems
worldwide this has been another tech
quickie I'm Lynas and I'll see you again
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
