the wall all night you wake up with it
fully charged and ready for a full day
of selfies catching Pokemon and selfies
of catching pok√©mon but just a few
hours in you get the dreaded low battery
warning and there's nary an outlet in
sight this is where portable battery
banks can save the day you just whip it
out of your pocket and bam no solar
panel or flashbacks to playing with a
scary jack-in-the-box to get the juice
you so desperately need but with all the
options out there how do you know which
one to pick well aside from the usual
reading reviews and checking
manufacturer reputations just as you
would do with a graphics card a webcam
or an extra-large hamster wheel the most
obvious place to start is with the
batteries capacity it's typically
expressed in milliamp hours which
despite the name is actually not a unit
of time so I just must hate us right but
rather a unit that describes the amount
of electrical energy a device can hold
so you can think of a device whose
battery is rated for fewer milliamp
hours like an iPhone has a cup of water
and a battery bank rated for more
milliamp hours as a bucket of water so a
battery pack with off high milliamp hour
rating can hold enough energy that it
can power up your devices multiple times
or powerup devices like tablets with a
higher battery capacity themselves so
consumer grade battery banks start
around 2,000 milliamp hours and go all
the way up to over 9000 these devices at
the higher end of that range are capable
of charging your average smartphone
eight times or even more but if you've
had a few of them you might have noticed
that battery banks with the same
milliamp hour rating can vary quite a
lot in terms of performance so what
gives for one thing not all batteries
discharged at the same rate all the time
this is especially true if you're
charging devices that draw a lot of
curve
such as high-end tablets this lowers the
effective capacity to below what it
would be if you were just charging low
current electronics there's also more to
life than just battery size there are
features to consider in this video here
we compared five rugged battery banks
that advertised everything from built-in
LED flashlights to shock and water
resistance though it should be noted
that some of these claims didn't end up
panning out in the real world and while
we're on that subject there's more to
life than manufacturer's ratings for
capacity to line has published a video
that's me
comparing how many times six different
brands of battery banks could recharge
an iPhone se and while most reputable
brands were within fifteen percent of
each other the worst one tested was less
than one third as effective as some of
the others and it doesn't get easier
charging rate going back to our water
analogy is how quickly you can pour from
your bucket to your cup and is a huge
factor for folks who want to plug in for
20 minutes while getting ready for that
big date and not have to carry their
charger around for the rest of the night
typically battery banks have either one
amp or two amp outputs both of which are
running at the standard USB 5 volts if
you have a device that can accept two
amps of current as many newer ones can
then a 2 amp output on your battery bank
will not only charge your device faster
but it will also keep it running if you
need to use it while it's charging keep
in mind though that chargers labeled as
4.8 amp or some other high number are
usually referring to total current
across all of the port's which is great
if you're going to be plugging in
multiple power-hungry devices at once if
the regular USB spec isn't enough for
you though there are even some battery
banks that support rapid charging
technologies like Qualcomm quick charge
and Samsung fast charge that can power
up your devices even more quickly by
increasing from 5 volts up to as high as
20 volts but those require both a device
and a charger that's
in it now go forth with this knowledge
and find yourself a battery bank that
gives you all the power you've ever
wanted just don't use it to try and
invade Russia in the wintertime we all
know how that works out speaking of
working out that's yet another fantastic
use for audiobooks from audible.com
while you're driving while you're trying
