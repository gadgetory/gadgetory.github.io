became a thing we've seen efforts to
make shirt movies video games and tacky
music videos with people in parachute
pants aren't passed around illegally
from ominous-looking piracy warnings on
films to songs telling us not to copy
that floppy it's no secret that the
companies who produce content see the
folks who consume it passing around
their stuff as a serious problem and not
too long ago well they stopped asking us
nicely but somewhat nicely and decided
to take matters into their own hands by
limiting what users could and could not
do with their copies of madmen by
implementing a technology called digital
rights management or DRM but how does it
work and why does it bother people so
much
now most early DRM existed in the form
of encryption and decryption keys so
your DVD would have all the content on
it but it would be scrambled and then
your DVD player would have a key that
allows it to descramble it but the
problem with having all these keys out
there is eventually someone's going to
figure out how to hijack the key and use
it in a way that it wasn't intended so
we've got a lot more stuff available in
the DRM Arsenal today one very common
type that you should be familiar with if
you buy music on iTunes or games using a
service like Steam is online
authentication many games and programs
control the way that they're used by
binding purchases to a specific account
then requiring the program to check with
a remote server that the device or
account in use is authenticated before
letting the media be played back or in
some cases even installed so even if
you've got all the files you're more out
of luck than Sonic the Hedgehog at the
bottom of the lake
thanks to well also much more advanced
encryption schemes that exists today
some particularly obnoxious online
protection schemes require constant
phoning home during use which offers
greater copy protection but also means
that you can't play at all if something
happens to your connection some
only legitimate users will have to
contend with since Pirates will have
figured out a way to disable the feature
but what if you're watching me these are
listening to music
many streaming services such as Spotify
and Netflix use some form of DRM to
prevent people from downloading things
to their hard drive to use without a
subscription and although some people
have found workarounds many of them
don't offer the same level of quality as
you'd have with a legit copy and then of
course there's physical media physical
media like blu-rays and DVDs is still
mostly stuck in the encryption and
decryption key paradigm since they're
intended to be played back on players
that might not actually have an internet
connection
but there are other schemes like region
locking that's been around for many
years that prevent discs from being
played in other parts of the world so at
least if piracy is rampant here these
guys over here won't be able to playback
that content unless of course it's
ripped in a more sophisticated manner of
course people usually don't like it when
they're told what they are or are not
allowed to do with stuff that they
bought and this has set off a furious
debate as to just how much DRM is
appropriate and even the ongoing arms
race between coders trying to defeat the
RM locks and music movie and game
studios trying to develop more hacks or
proof versions of copy protection and
this was partially responsible for a
famous law in the United States called
the DMCA which made it illegal to break
any sort of DRM a huge eff due to users
who feel like they should be able to do
what they want with the things they've
paid for especially when it's not for
infringing purposes like creating
digital backups in the event of a fire
or to be played back on alternate
devices like their phones if they only
own a DVD which obviously isn't going to
fit in a phone or accessing titles
without an internet connection and then
of course they're butting heads with the
content distributors who say that making
things available without DRM will lead
to rampant piracy in an era where people
can torrent an entire season my little
in just a few minutes so who's right
here well as more and more of what we
enjoy goes digital there's no doubt that
both new technologies and new policies
that try to strike the right balance
will continue to be tested and I hope a
happy medium can be found but if not
don't worry I don't plan on encrypting
tech quickie anytime soon speaking of a
happy medium
Linda calm is the medium online we're
with a membership there's a form of DRM
right there buddies access to the page
