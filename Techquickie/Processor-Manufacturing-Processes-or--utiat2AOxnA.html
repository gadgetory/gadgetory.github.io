ago when the Pentium 4 processor extreme
edition 3.46 gigahertz first launched it
debuted around $1000 with the rest of
the top tier products falling around six
hundred four hundred and 275 dollars and
that now in 2014 pricing is still very
similar perhaps not on the surface but
consider this in the last 10 years
average gas prices in the US have gone
from under $2 per gallon to around 3.50
cents per gallon with general inflation
in the twenty to twenty-five percent
range how is it then that has the
requisite tools and microprocessor
manufacturing facilities also known as
fabs continue to increase in cost the
processors we use in our devices be they
laptops tablets phones or even a hundred
other things you wouldn't think of
perform better consume less power and
are available at when we adjust for
inflation the same or lower prices year
after year I mean they're still
basically layered metal circuits on a
peer silicon wafer that's had
transistors formed in it so simple right
actually no even though many of the raw
materials being used are similar the
actual device fabrication process has
changed dramatically every two years or
so truly it's almost like clockwork
intel has debuted a new way to test the
laws of physics and begin mass
production of processors running smaller
and smaller transistors every time they
shrink things down another notch we say
they've moved to a new process node when
this happens there are a couple of
things that usually occur transistors
switch faster this translates to
potentially higher clock speeds and
performance less current is required for
transistor switching which translates
into reduced power consumption and the
physical area taken up per transistor
goes down significantly allowing either
what is fundamentally the same processor
to be manufactured with less raw
material and B therefore lower cost or a
better processor to be manufactured with
the same raw material at a similar cost
so that's all the fuss being made right
now about Intel's Core M processor
codename Broadwell why the first CPU to
be produced using Intel's latest 14
nanometer manufacturing process
now architectural II it's not a huge
change compared to has well the last
generation one which is based on Intel's
22 nanometer manufacturing process but
shrinking the size of the transistors
allows the quorum to do some pretty
amazing stuff including deliver
dual-core turbo boost capable CPUs with
beefy onboard graphics that have a TDP
of four to four and a half Watts low
enough for use in two and ones and other
ultra-thin mobile devices in the future
with felt requiring a cooling fan not to
mention better performance better
battery life etc and there's more as
Intel's capacity at 40 nanometer ramps
up we will see this technology deployed
in the desktop and server until it's
everywhere and then it's time to start
the whole process all over again and
that is how we keep getting better
processors at the same or even lower
prices sometimes speaking of better
performance is your site slow do your
online stores customers or blogs
visitors complain that it's ugly people
on the Internet sure nice sometimes hey
anyway don't worry too much about that
because there is an easy solution
Squarespace is today's sponsor and these
guys kind of kick ass first of all
they're just cool guys but I guess
that's not really enough reason to give
