Pascal consumer GPUs wouldn't be using
HBM to video memory some folks were left
feeling a little confused however that
isn't to say that they didn't change
anything about their vram as these cards
are using the also newly released gddr5
X so what's special about it other than
the fact that it has an X in its name
which might be trying to remind people
of words like exciting extreme or
expensive
well that might depend on who you buy
your components from so instead let's
talk about what gddr5 X actually is it's
a type of video RAM which does things
like hold textures store images in frame
buffers provide the GPU with lighting
information in short it holds the data
that your GPU actually has to process so
that your computer will display your
game properly but the arisen question is
what's special about gd-r 5x in
particular and is it going to make your
games look any better or run faster
well usually vram tends to matter more
the higher the resolution your games are
running at making it especially
important for multi-monitor setups or if
you're trying to run things with
aggressive anti-aliasing or high res
texture settings as these things require
more stuff to be held in memory and with
games becoming ever more detailed than
higher resolution monitor is becoming
more common and cheaper quicker memory
is also becoming more important graphics
memory has placed an emphasis on wide
bandwidth for a long time but gddr5 X
improves upon the existing gddr5
standard by allowing twice as much data
to be accessed at one time 64 bytes
instead of 32 and while this may not
sound like much we should see overall
transfer rates of around 10 gigabits per
second or even higher per pen and nearly
450 gigabytes per second of overall
bandwidth while drawing less power than
its predecessor pretty sweet but slow
down just a minute what about that fancy
new HBM that AMD came out
with why is GDR 5x a big deal then while
it's true that HB M which you can learn
more about here has higher throughput
and has a smaller footprint which are
both great things on your graphics card
specifically than GD r 5x GD r 5x should
be quite a bit easier not to mention
cheaper to implement than HBM since it's
still quite similar to the ubiquitous
gddr5 and although both Nvidia and AMD
are heavily rumored to be moving towards
HBM 2.0 for some of their upcoming
architectures gddr5 x might appear on
more mid-range future graphics cards as
well as the greater accessibility of
high-res displays and be growing
interest in virtual reality headsets
will make high throughput vram
increasingly important
currently GD r 5x is only available on
Nvidia's new flagship the geforce gtx
1080 but don't be surprised to see it
paired with more GPUs down the road and
whether you're going for gddr5 X or HBM
pay attention to what kind of VRAM is in
your next card if you want to get into
surround gaming hook up an oculus rift
or HTC vive or just really really like
things with X's in them the might ODS a
sci-fi key cap set is available over on
mass drop it's a customizable key cap
set that is set in the theme of the
first-person shooter game that you've
never heard of Counter Strike global
Offensive you'll have to pick whatever
like kit and build you want to fit the
layout and theme and schematic and
whatnot of your keyboard but that is
very easy to do on their website and it
supports tons of different layouts even
non-standard ones from various companies
so you should be covered
you're also fine even if you have liked
Nordic German uk-us layouts all that
kind of stuff and additionally blizzards
overwatch inspired novelties will be
available as well the braces 39.99 but
varies widely based on different options
that are selected in the check out as we
just discussed and we'll be launching
the morning of June 13th so go to draw
dots slash tech quickie - MIT Oh
and you can check all that kind of stuff
out thank you guys for watching don't
forget to like it dislike it subscribe
all those common things that you're used
to by now if you have ideas for future
tech quickie episodes put them in the
bottom and if you like X's go over to
channel super fun cuz I don't know why
annex has anything to do with that name
but just you know whatever don't forget
to subscribe I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
