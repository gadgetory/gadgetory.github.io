Thunderbolt is only for max myth it was
co-developed by Apple and Intel but the
full rights were eventually transferred
to Intel and now anyone can implement it
and since I've got my history lesson hat
on I might as well give you guys another
little factoid the original prototype
codenamed light peak was actually an
optical technology which would have
enabled higher transfer speeds and
longer cables but since copper can carry
power in addition to data and Intel saw
better than expected results when
testing with copper all of the
Thunderbolt cables you see today will
have connectors on each end that look
exactly like mini DisplayPort but with
little lightning bolt symbols on them
and with only copper wires inside them
but what do those wires do then - well
they carry a combination of PCI Express
and DisplayPort on one serial signal as
well as a DC connection for power all
wrapped up in one cable this means that
the Thunderbolt interface can be used to
connect and power display audio and
storage devices as well as USB firewire
and game Editha net via adapters I mean
this guy is pretty much the limit to top
that off you can run up to six total
devices at a time off of a single
connector by daisy chaining them all
together or by connecting to a hub cool
stuff and while I don't think it's fair
to say that Thunderbolt 1 took the
market by storm
compared to USB 3 it was very expensive
it was certainly a standard unlike
anything that we had seen before and it
continues to evolve in 2013 Thunderbolt
2 arrived with some big changes
bandwidth was doubled to 20 gigabit
bi-directional enough to watch 4k video
while simultaneously running a
high-speed storage device over one cable
and maximum transfer speeds were raised
to 1500 megabytes per second though
overhead and PCI Express limits keep you
from hitting speeds even close to that
Mac spec in the real world on top of
that it maintained the same connector
which means V 1 and B 2 are inter
compatible the link will simply operate
at the speed of the slower device all
right well that's it then right 20
gigabit per second simultaneously with
4k video and you get your high-speed
storage through one cable
I mean that's enough right no we need
more power ah excuse me not really sure
what happened there anyway we need more
power and by that I mean we need higher
speeds and greater capabilities with
less actual power consumption 50% less
if we can rely on a leak slide of
Thunderbolt three specs from April 2014
this new format is rumored to come with
a doubling of the current Thunderbolt
bandwidth from 20 to 40 gigabit per
second and it will be capable of 4 modes
including hdmi 2.0 cool it should have
support for PCI Express gen3 and is
rumored to be capable of charging
devices that require up to a hundred
watts of power the bad news is that it's
also rumored to require a new connector
so adapters will be needed for backwards
compatibility now while we haven't yet
reached the hundred gigabit per second
maximum speeds over thunderbolt and
until promised when they released the
protocol I've seen unofficial statements
projecting the speed by around 2020
nothing confirmed yet we're still very
early in the life cycle and at the rate
thunderbolts been moving I'd be
surprised if it takes that long and I'm
very excited to see the future of this
very promising but still very expensive
technology speaking of things that are
very expensive going to the store and
buying razor refills for I mean for some
reason why do they cost so much they're
pieces of metal and they're in like
plastic not a little plastic not that
expensive well I don't think they should
be that expensive and neither does
today's episode sponsor Dollar Shave
Club dollarshaveclub.com is the place to
go if you want to join the club and stop
