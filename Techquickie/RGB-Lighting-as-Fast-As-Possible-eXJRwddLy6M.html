enthusiast space that people love to
argue about AMD vs. Nvidia AMD versus
Intel AMD versus the 1980 US Olympic
hockey team okay but seriously aside
from these more practical concerns
aesthetics are just as important to many
people with there being no real
consensus as to what looks good after
all what's tacky to one user might be
Michelangelo's David to another so in
the past few years many component
manufacturers have decided hey why not
just give people the ability to
customize the look of their battle
station on a whim by adding RGB lighting
the RGB craze mostly started out on
keyboards and mice but these days you
can pick up motherboards CPU coolers and
even Ram sticks that claim to offer
millions of colors but how does all of
this work and what features should you
be looking for if you're going to trick
out your rig like the Griswolds
christmas tree well if you think back to
kindergarten you might remember that the
three primary colors that combine to
form all the other colors are red yellow
and blue but this is true only for
pigments light works a little
differently with the three primary
colors of light being red green and blue
hence the name RGB so when you fire up
your favorite RGB device what's
happening is that separate red green and
blue LEDs are lighting up at different
intensities to produce different colors
as there currently isn't a single LED
bulb that can cycle through different
colors on its own so there are a couple
of different ways that you can see this
principle in action if you set your
favorite RGB device to white you might
be able to see all three colored LEDs
lit up if you look closely enough this
is the same reason that when you get a
drop of water on your phone screen
you can see a rainbow like effect on
white spots neat huh but how do these
devices adjust the brightness of each
LED to produce the color you want
well usually RGB gadgets work with a
technique called pulse width modulation
or PWM which you can learn more about
here although you might be more familiar
with PWM as a way to control your fan
speed in your computer the same concept
can control colored LEDs so when you
want to tell your control software boom
I want yellow it sends a signal to your
device that tells both the red and green
LEDs to light up and blue to sit down
and shut up
and PWM also control something called
the duty cycle essentially how long the
light is on during each refresh a
shorter duty cycle means that specific
color of LED will be dimmer so if you
want your keyboard to be a highlighter
yellow sort of color your green and red
LEDs will have longer duty cycles while
your blue LEDs will have very short
cycles or just be turned off completely
but depending on its implementation
especially if the LEDs are refreshing
too slowly using PWM control with equal
parts of red green and blue to achieve
white can result in a distracting
rainbow effect similar to what some
people experienced when watching a
single tip DLP projector to comp at this
some manufacturers are introducing RGB W
strips that have entirely separate white
LEDs but enough about the nuts and bolts
what should you actually look for when
buying RGB gear well perhaps
unsurprisingly this depends almost
entirely on your personal preference as
long as you buy something of good
quality an important thing to research
is what kinds of customization a certain
RGB product offers as many manufacturers
bundle software that can control RGB
effects which may or may not be to your
liking
hardware solutions also exist such as
NZXT hue plus which serves as a central
hub for your systems LED strips and the
RGB headers on certain motherboards
which provide similar functionality
through software to take things a step
further unified RGB ecosystems like Asus
aura and Razer chroma are starting to
become popular allowing you to sync up
RGB effects on your lighting strips your
motherboard your memory your fans or
even supported peripherals and room
lighting and considering that our GB
LEDs can often be configured to change
colors depending on important variables
such as system temperatures your
perfectly harmonious RGB setup can
actually be functional as well just make
sure you don't go too crazy want to
browse a more open Internet and use
online services as though you are in a
different country anonymously
check out tunnel there they've got
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they also have a Chrome extension
and turning it on is as simple as
clicking a button boom there you go your
bear tunnels your internet connection to
a new location which means two things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
show up as though you're in a different
country and it lets you bypass all the
annoying bullcrap that usually comes
with using a VPN for personal use no
port configurations DNS or other router
settings tunnel bear handles all of that
stuff in the background they've got a
top rated privacy policy and the best
thing is you can try tonal bear with 500
Meg's of free data and no credit card
required check it out at the link in the
video description and if you choose to
get a year of unlimited you can save 10%
by going to tunnel bear comm slash Linus
so thanks for watching guys dislike or
like get subscribed and maybe leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible videos just like
this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
