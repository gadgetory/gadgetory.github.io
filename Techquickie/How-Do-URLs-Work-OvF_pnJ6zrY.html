internet which you've probably done
considering you're watching this video
you've almost certainly typed in a
Uniform Resource locator or URL to get
where you're going online but while some
are simple like LAN effective ska more
whitehouse.gov full-length URLs can look
awfully confusing why do we need HTTP in
there and what are all those amber sands
question marks and pounder excuse me
hash signs doing it's a good question
let's demystify the ingredients of your
typical web address starting with the
beginning of the scheme the most
familiar will probably be HTTP which
stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol
the set of commands that handles the
transmission of webpages but there are
other schemes as well
if you've ever clicked on an email
address you might notice that the link
starts with mail to a scheme that tells
the browser to open up your email
clients you can fire off a message
there's also FTP or File Transfer
Protocol which is used to send well
files as you probably guess to and from
remote servers and even IRC which allows
you to connect directly to a chatroom
the next part of a typical URL is
usually a domain name the name of a web
site like amazon.com or Microsoft calm
v.com net or org at the end is called a
top-level domain or TLD which you can
think of as the main categories that
sort every web site on the Internet and
help route requests through a certain
group of servers to get you to the
correct website typically com will
indicate a commercial web site of some
sort org indicates a nonprofit
organization and there are plenty of
TLDs that indicate sites associated with
a certain country like US or UK more
recently country based TLDs have been
used in so-called domain hacks like
YouTube dot B II which allows links to
YouTube videos to be shorter this
doesn't mean however that these site has
anything to do with the kingdom of
Belgium much of the rest of the URL the
part that is separated by slashes
indicates the past or the specific
location of
page or other piece of content on the
specific website each flash indicates
another subfolder kind of like how files
on your computer storage drive are
organized as for question marks these
make a URL hard to read but their
existence actually makes a lot of sense
they indicate a query defined by the
user for example if you type a search
into Google you'll see your string in
the results page URL after the question
mark symbol which tells the server to
execute that search if a URL has
multiple queries these will be separated
by Ambersons showing that the browser is
relaying multiple pieces of information
to the website such as what kind of
browser you're using or whether you were
referred to a page from a certain site
as you've ever clicked a link just to
have it send you somewhere else on the
same page that was probably done through
a fragment indicated by a pound sign
fragments can mark specific spots on a
web page but can also indicate other
things like the folder you're looking at
in Gmail URLs can also incorporate a few
rarely seen variations for example if
you're trying to access a website that
requires a login and password some sites
will allow you to just enter the
username and password in the URL
directly logging you in automatically
convenient if you need to quickly share
a link to a protected site but not the
best thing for security as your browser
history will show your password in plain
text and if you've ever visited a site
based in a country that doesn't use
Latin characters like Greece or China
you might see a really weird domain name
that includes X n dot this means that
the original characters were converted
into a domain name compatible with the
DNS so computers worldwide can view
these pages but if the path after the
domain name contains special characters
you'll probably see these displayed with
percent-encoding which is also sometimes
used for other symbols for example % 24
corresponds to a dollar sign so I hope
this helped unpack the mystifying stuff
you see in web addresses now if you'll
excuse me I've got to get back to my IRC
discussion on whether dot ninja or dot
meme are actually good top-level domains
I think they are but some other
unscrupulous people disagree total Bayer
VPN lets you tunnel to up to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as if you are in that other
country they have easy-to-use apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac they also have a
Chrome extension just choose a country
in the app turn title bear on and watch
as your bear tunnels your internet
connection to your new location when you
do turn tunnel there on two things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
show up as if you're in that country
they also have a top rated privacy
policy and do not log user activity you
can try out tunnel Bayer VPN with 500
megabytes of free data and no credit
card required if you choose to get a
year of unlimited data you can save 10%
by going to tunnel bear comm slash Linus
thanks for watching guys if you liked
this video like it if you just like this
video dislike it get subscribed and hit
the little bell to see all of the tech
cookie videos that we have surgical
channel super fun because they are fun
and super and I'm going to go now so
that Alex can walk walk walk by house go
ahead there we go best part of the video
10 out of 10 would do it again alright
