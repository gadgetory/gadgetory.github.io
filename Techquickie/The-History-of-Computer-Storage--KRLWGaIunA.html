storage we'd be stuck in traffic trying
to take our film to get developed at the
drugstore
and might even still be using scrolls or
something but believe it or not the long
Odyssey from the era before electricity
to storing terabytes of information on
pint-sized SSDs actually begins with
paper specifically it began with punch
cards which were quite important way
before the year 2000 when the state of
Florida suddenly decided that poking
holes in a piece of paper was too
difficult for whatever reason in fact
punch cards and punch tape go all the
way back to the early 1700 s when they
were used in looms to weave textile
patterns patterns on tape could
correspond to machine instructions as
they did in things like player pianos or
to numbers and characters as they did in
things like early computers tabulation
machines from the late 1800s use punched
tape to help count large data sets
including helping to finish the u.s.
census way ahead of schedule in 1890
of course punch cards don't exactly hold
a lot of data with a typical punch card
holding less than a tenth of a kilobyte
so you'd need about 28 billion of them
to match the capacity of a typical 2
terabyte modern hard drive as digital
computing started becoming more popular
magnetic storage came to dominate but
this doesn't mean that the hard drive
was the direct successor to the punch
card an early form of magnetic storage
was drum memory large cylinders with the
data written on the outside like modern
hard drives drum memory had read/write
heads but these were stationary instead
the drum spun around at high speeds
while the head waited for the relevant
piece of data to come around although
they could store a lot more data than
old punch cards their capacity was still
pretty tiny by modern standards only a
few kilobytes each drum memory was
actually quite popular until the 1950s
but magnetic tape which was actually
patented a few years prior to drum
memory was far more enduring as tape
drives are still widespread today for
archival storage you can learn more
about that here
tape was and still is great for cheap
data storage in bulk but with slow
access times resulting from having to
constantly wind the tape back and forth
a quicker solution was needed as
computers became more powerful work was
done in the 1940s on using cathode ray
tubes to store data the same type of
tube you can find in old-school TVs by
firing electrons to create patterns
representing ones and zeros that would
stick to the tube however core memory
quickly became much more popular
especially due to its lower cost for
working memory which we today refer to
as RAM unlike earlier forms of magnetic
storage core memory didn't have any
moving parts making it much quicker core
memory worked by changing the magnetic
polarity of small iron oxide loops which
were woven together in fact core memory
was often made by hand by garment
workers but the small capacities of core
memory led to a development of a
compromise between access speeds and
size the familiar hard drive was
introduced in 1956 on one of those
massive old-school IBM machines although
it was 50 feet tall and contained 50
platters this early drive only held five
megabytes but after IBM introduced a
model with one head per platter to speed
up access times the foundation was laid
for the modern hard drive design and
speaking of getting smaller there was
still no solution for portable data
until the venerable floppy disk appeared
on the scene in 1971 although it did use
magnetic storage technology like hard
drives their small size and light weight
made them very useful for relatively
small programs and files that were
common in that day the first discs were
those giant 8-inch ones that only held
80 kilobytes but gradually floppy
capacity grew and we got the ubiquitous
1.44 megabyte 3.5 inch disks that aren't
really useful anymore for anything other
than making pen holders and cool artsy
crafts or throwing them at your friends
once you get tired of playing Oregon
Trail although floppy drives tried to
stave off their demise with release of
soup
floppy products such as the almost
famous zip drive of the mid-1990s the
writable CD and later flash memory
nailed the floppies coffin shut with
much higher capacities at lower prices
although flash memory was first
developed in 1980 and took a while to be
widely used for long-term storage
it ultimately pushed optical media into
increasing irrelevance as well as the
ever-popular USB thumb drives and SD
cards came to dominate the market
because flash tech doesn't rely on
moving parts like optical drives access
times are much shorter and as tiny
transistors that store data on flash
drives keep getting smaller and smaller
we now have multiple terabyte SSDs and
SD cards that can store 512 gigabytes
you need over seven billion of those
standard punch cards we talked about in
the beginning of this episode to match
just that SD card which would stack 800
miles high no word yet though on when
we're going to build a real-life
holocron vault so I'll get back to you
on that
