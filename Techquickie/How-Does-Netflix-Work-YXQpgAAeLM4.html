laugh but there wasn't quite anything
like popping over to one of the 9,000
locations they had globally renting a
gently used copy of home alone on VHS
and settling down in the glow of your
CRT tube television with a big bucket of
popcorn of course once the internet came
along and Netflix with it
blockbuster stores became all but a
memory as there are now only a dozen of
them left in the United States mostly in
Alaska due to outrageous broadband
prices so intuitively you'd think that
it would take a rather massive
enterprise to pull the rug out from
under literally thousands of
brick-and-mortar stores and you'd be
right during periods of peak usage
Netflix accounts for over a third of all
downstream Internet traffic in the
United States a third but exactly how do
they sling videos to so many people at
once do they just have one giant server
farm that constantly pours episodes of
house of cards and Family Guy onto the
Internet backbone not exactly like many
other large sites focused on media
delivery Netflix uses a content delivery
network or CDN to store and transmit
movies and TV shows you see although
Netflix's entire library could certainly
fit on a few servers housed in a single
building there are some problems with
this approach one locations far from
that facility would suffer from high
latency not what you want for streaming
video - this architecture would be
basically the definition of a bottleneck
since a single connection that fast
doesn't exist if it did it would be
astronomically expensive and three it
would need a single point of failure
that could cause Netflix
entire service to go down if something
happened at that one location a CDN
solves these problems by utilizing
redundant servers in multiple locations
to serve many geographic areas more
quickly to balance server load between
them so they don't get overworked and to
ensure that there will be backups in
case of an incident or outage at one or
even several locations but Netflix in
particular takes this concept a step
further because they are so big they
actually work directly with a number of
ISPs to install their own hardware these
boxes called
open connect appliances at either
exchange points or even within the ISPs
facilities themselves holding up to 280
terabytes of video each these come
preloaded with close to the entire
Netflix library so what this means for
you the consumer is that instead of
connecting to some super far away land
server to watch a movie you're
connecting to an appliance at your own
ISP that's much closer cutting down on
latency and making it so that your
Netflix data packets don't have to fight
with all the other internet traffic that
is upstream from your ISP and when it's
time for catalog updates Netflix pushes
them to these appliances during the
morning when there's typically less
Internet traffic overall meaning that by
the time everyone gets home from work
ready for a night of binge watching the
repository of content at their ISP has
already been updated and is ready to go
and if lots of people fire up their
computers at once the appliances are
equipped to push out data at over 90
gigabits per second the equivalent of
over 13,000 people watching an HD movie
at once then if that's not enough
bandwidth Netflix can just install more
boxes for larger ISPs that serve greater
numbers of people but to keep speeds
high the open
boxes only handle storing and
transmitting video for everything else
keeping track of what shows you like
recommendations billing logins and the
search feature Netflix uses Amazon Web
Services or AWS a massive cloud
processing service that Netflix can
quickly buy more time on in the form of
virtualized servers as their customer
base and traffic volume grows and it's
also very failure tolerant due to high
amounts of redundancy but wait a second
Amazon has that prime video thing that
they're trying to get everyone to buy
why in the world would they let Netflix
a huge competitor use their servers well
Amazon does make quite a bit of money
from their deal with Netflix possibly
into the range of hundreds of millions
of dollars and may not want to start
pushing out certain customers just
because they might compete in a
different market segment let me think of
how Samsung manufacturers chips that
Apple puts in their phones because if
Amazon wants to be the go-to company for
cloud processing they can't behave in
that way it's kind of like how Comcast
won't stop you from watching a Disney
movie through their internet service yet
do you find yourself racing against the
clock as a freelancer or small business
owner do you have trouble keeping track
