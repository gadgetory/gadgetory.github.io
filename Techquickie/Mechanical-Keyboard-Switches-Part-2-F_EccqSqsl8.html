like walking into a high-end buffet you
know it's going to be better than
whatever slop you usually eat but you
don't recognize half of the dishes and
those little labels written in French
aren't helping unless you're actually
French so how the heck do you know what
to pick
well the key differentiator is the type
of key switch that is being used some
take lots of force to press down some
are noisy some actuate that basically a
hair-trigger and we've covered a small
handful of switch types in this video
but that was four years ago so it's
definitely time for a second episode to
cover other important switch types and
since switches from German keyboard
concern cherry are very common in
keyboards from major manufacturers like
Corsair and Coolermaster we'll start
with them so aside from the standard
cherry MX red brown blue and black which
haven't changed since the last video a
few more of their switch types have
risen to prominence let's start out with
MX speeds which is which as the name
implies are geared towards more
competitive gamers that want ultra quick
responses from their keyboards for that
fraction of a second advantage over
their opponents in practice they feel a
lot like reds meaning that their linear
switches without a tactile bump or click
but with a actuation distance almost
twice as short at a mere one point two
millimeters great if you're serious
about getting every advantage in your
game but speed switches can also make it
easier to miss key things while you're
typing as they actually so quickly even
from bumps on perhaps the other end of
the cherry spectrum we have the MX green
switches which are a very interesting
typing experience like blues they have a
tactile and loud click but they also
have a much higher actuation force
meaning they're heavy keys that are
noticeably harder to push down and some
folks really like that robust old-school
feelings that while not the same is a
little reminiscent of those buckling
spring keyboards people used to use back
in the day
but if you're not interested in either
of those extremes the MX clear is an
interesting option they're similar to
blues but without the loud click enos
while still giving a strong tactile bump
to confirm that you've actuated the key
they're also slightly heavier although
if you're interested they might be a
little bit difficult to track down but
they could be worth looking into if
you've given the other common cherry
switches a try and are yet to find that
sweet spot but on the subject of
sweetness cherries aren't the only fruit
in the bowl when it comes to key
switches even if companies like razer
are actually using cherry clones and
their keyboards as you can see on this
chart one notable alternative is the
topper switch which contains both a
spring and a rubber dome making the
action very smooth and cushion like but
with a tactile bump you feel pretty soon
after pressing down
they also bottomed out with a
distinctive thunk in a lower pitch than
a cherry switch which some people find
very pleasing myself included
moving right along let's look at the
omron b3k better known as the Romer G
switch that's found most frequently in
Logitech Keyboard these were initially
developed to compete with Cherry MX
browns and they do feel fairly similar
except the Romer G has a higher
actuation point which Logitech bills as
a responsiveness advantage and although
Cherry fired back with their MX speed
switches Romer G's are still a solid
choice now obviously there are a lot of
other key switch types that we don't
have time to thoroughly discuss from
kale switches which are named for the
company that produces cheaper Cherry MX
clones and supplies some of razor's
gaming switches not all of them but some
to alp switches that one came in many
flavors like cherries but have become
quite difficult to find on modern
keyboards if you want to really
experience how some of these switches
feel before shelling out your
hard-earned cash on something you might
not even like it is possible to order
individual switches and in the case of
some popular cherry varieties you can
even order a sampler of sorts for just a
few bucks although it isn't actually
a very equatable experience to a full
keyboard you can still get some amount
of reference for how it will feel in
general making a decision here can be
hard the huge array of switch types
means that there's something out there
for everyone unless of course nothing
feels better for you than good old
SwiftKey 10 out there VPN lets you
tunnel into up to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the internet and
use online services as if you are in
that country it is easy to use apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
have a Chrome extension just choose a
country in the app turn tile they're on
and watches your tunnel bare tunnels
your internet connection to a new
location when you turn tunnel they're on
two things happen your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
so you show up as if you're in that
country they also have a top rated
privacy policy and do not log user
activity you can try out tunnel Bayer

no credit card required and if you do
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear

we do some cool stuff over there watch
this video which is hopefully on the
screen somewhere I don't remember all
the call-outs because I'm walking around
the mic so I can't see the prompter but
