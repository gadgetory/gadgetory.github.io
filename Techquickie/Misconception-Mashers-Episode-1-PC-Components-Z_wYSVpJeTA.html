having a conversation with someone that
turns into a heated debate because the
other person is clinging fast to a
misconception you know isn't true I mean
how many times can you tell someone that
General Tso's chicken didn't actually
come from China before you're ready to
just give up and walk away maybe to a
nearby Panda Express
so then today's tech quickie where we
discuss some of these common
misunderstandings about PC hardware will
be right up your alley this is the debut
episode of misconception mashers where
we well we mash common misconceptions we
actually had another name in mind but
our legal team advised us that some
other guys already took it
bastards first up let's look at this
statement non reference graphics cards
have better cooling than reference
designs now this one isn't completely
untrue as many of these open style beefy
looking cooling solutions are capable of
dissipating more heat from your GPU
however they aren't always the best
choice for your system you see reference
cards and some board partner designs
often come with blower style coolers in
which air is forced out the back of the
card and out of your case instead of
circulating it around and in smaller
builds such as mini ITX systems a blower
style cooler can be a superior choice as
a card with an open cooler can dump so
much heat back into the case that it
could cause thermal issues with your
other components like your motherboard
and CPU another one I hear a lot is it's
dangerous to set your motherboard down
on the bag it came in some folks do this
as they're installing core components
like a CPU or RAM and are promptly
warned against it by enthusiasts
have heard that the outside of a
motherboard bag is electrically
conductive which increases the chance of
static discharge frying your whole board
now there is some truth to this once
again
older ESD bags in particular were
metallized and could be conductive
enough to cause an electrical short or
other problems but generally speaking a
motherboard you buy today will come in a
bag with very high electrical impedance
meaning that you could build on it if
you really wanted to or if you want to
be on the safe side you could just use
the motherboard box as I don't see many
people lining up to tell me that
cardboard conducts electricity while
we're on the subject of electrical power
let's tackle this next one you need a
high wattage power supply if you have
multiple graphics cards this
generalization actually used to be true
but the three-way and four-way graphics
configurations that did require a
thousand plus watts of power have fallen
out of favor due to compatibility issues
and you also need to understand that
what's considered high wattage today is
more than double what would have been
available in the very early days of SLI
and crossfire and while power supplies
have become more powerful the actual
power consumption of graphics cards and
especially CPUs has plateaued this means
that it's unlikely that you'll even
crack eight hundred Watts under full
load with a pair of GTX 1080p is a
high-end overclocked processor multiple
hard drives and RGB case lighting on the
subject of overclocking another common
misconception is that you need lots of
power phases on your motherboard to
overclock you can tell how many your
motherboard has by the way by counting
the chokes around your CPU socket don't
try it it's fun this one is another case
of used to be more true than it is today
not too long ago there was typically a
correlation between more power faces and
or stability while overclocking but CPU
power efficiency and motherboard build
quality have improved by leaps and
bounds over the past seven years or so
to the point where you're unlikely to
experience any difference between a
low-end board with four phases and one
with 32 unless you're one of these guys
so I guess the overall theme of this
inaugural episode of misconception
mashers has been more expensive
solutions don't always make more sense
instead save your money for some nice
RGB peripherals steam games or a trip to
the Chinese buffet down the street and
don't forget to leave a comment below
telling us about some of the technical
sessions that drive you crazy maybe
you'll see them in our next episode you
know what else you might see in our next
episode
trettel Bayer VPN SS sponsor they are
such great supporters of this channel
and they're just awesome guys in general
tunnel bear is an easy-to-use VPN that
lets you tunnel through one of 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as though you're in that
country and it's available for like
everything they've got iOS then you've
got Android beef gut does you really
have PC and Mac in his pocket no he
doesn't but they've got that too and
they've even got a Chrome extension just
press the button watch as your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and all your traffic
gets anonymized so your isp can't see
exactly what you're doing and you are
off to the races they have a top rated
privacy policy and they don't log user
activity so try it out with the first
500 Meg's of data free at the link in
the video description and then save 10%
