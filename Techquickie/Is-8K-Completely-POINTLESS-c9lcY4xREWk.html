appealing to the TV and display industry
right now than K the labels to K 4 K 5 K
and now a K gets thrown around so much
but you might think you're in an online
chat that's going nowhere and while the
benefits and drawbacks of 4k TVs and
monitors are pretty well understood by
this point there hasn't been nearly as
much discussion about 8k technology even
though we're seeing it start to be
pushed as the next big thing after 4k so
what exactly is it well as you can
probably guess it's a higher resolution
picture than 4k with an actual
resolution of 76 80 by 40 320 pixels
that makes it four times as sharp at the
same size as the already super sharp 4k
giving it sixteen times as much detail
as a standard full HD display and the
nice thing is that this isn't some
experimental technology that isn't going
to show up on the market until far away
in the future you can go down to your
local big box store and pick up an 8k TV
right now assuming of course that you
can afford the investment but like a
solid gold toilet just because you can
doesn't mean that you should but why so
at some point it turns out that your
eyes really do hit a limit as to how
much detail they can make out and if
you've ever seen a 4k TV or monitor you
might have noticed that you have to get
quite close to the screen in order to
discern the individual pixels well with
an 8k TV this effect is multiplied
several times over so once you get far
enough away it will be very hard for you
to tell the difference between 4k and 8k
unless you're in the market for a
super-huge 85 or 100 plus inch display
but even if you have a wall and a living
room cavernous enough to justify an 8k
display we actually
don't recommend that you go out and buy
one right now there simply isn't enough
8k content out there there are a few 8k
youtube videos that have mostly been
uploaded as novelties and finding bigger
name shows movies and sporting events in
8k is exceedingly difficult now there
are a limited number of 8k programs
available in Japan including the
upcoming 2020 Olympics but finding 8k on
the Reg is going to be tough for years
to come I mean there are still only a
few hundred titles on Netflix that are
in 4k and just about everything on cable
and satellite is still in 1080i and the
thing is that even though lots of 8k TV
manufacturers are pushing the fact that
their TVs can upscale lower resolution
content to 8k quite well the quality
still won't come close it's a video that
is natively shot in a que and certainly
won't justify the huge price difference
over a 4k model and then of course even
if you've got your 8k content there is
the issue of how much bandwidth 8k video
takes for each 8k stream in your house
you'll need a bare minimum connection
speed of around 50 megabits per second
and of course if you want any other
devices in the house connected and if
you want to watch HDR content you will
need even more so our take is that a Kay
will take quite a few years to become
truly useful simply because the main
benefit is not as large of a difference
in image quality over the last gen
compared to last time around and even
then it might only be useful at all in
spaces where large large format displays
make sense not necessarily in the
average home or apartment unless you're
into sitting really really close to your
TV though we have seen prototype TVs
that are meant to take up most of your
wall isn't that a scary thought I mean
imagine my face plastered across you
know a quarter of your entire house
shouting tech facts at you while you
enjoy your sugared cereal speaking of
facts
here's a fact every day brilliant
publishes several daily challenges that
provide a quick and fascinating view
into the world of math logic science
engineering or computer science
brilliance daily challenges are fun
bite-sized way to master concepts by
applying them each challenge comes with
illustrations animations or interactive
visualizations as well as all the
context that you need to solve the
problem yourself if you like the
challenge and you want to learn more
there's a related course that explores
the same concept in greater detail so if
you want to actively learn new
fascinating concepts each day watch tech
quickie oh and also head over to
brilliant org slash tech quickie and
finish your day a little bit smarter
than you started the first 200 of you to
do so will get 20% off brilliants annual
premium subscription what a brilliant
idea
haha so thanks for watching guys like
