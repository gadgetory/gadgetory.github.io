records is those giant black discs that
their parents listen to way back before
computers and those people are somewhat
right in a cultural sense but if you
scratch the surface you'll see that
vinyl records are much more than they
appear to be it was all the way back in
1877 when Thomas Edison made the
phonograph a device capable of both
recording and playing back sounds by
etching small vibrations into wax then
using a needle that could follow the
path of the edge vibration and amplify
it into an audible spectrum and while
the phonograph was considered too crude
for practical use a decade later Edison
refined the creation by laying the
groundwork for the recording industry at
the end of the 1880s based on the same
technology the gramophone would play
rotating five-inch discs off a spring
wound motor
unfortunately these discs couldn't hold
up to the sound quality of wax and were
really only good enough for toys and
experiments so how did these scratchy
little discs become the modern records
we know of today well Eldridge R Johnson
whose company later became part of RCA
developed a method of itching records
with a much greater level of detail and
then later released ten and twelve inch
versions of these records they started
to edge out wax cylinders in both
quality and more importantly for this
time playback lengths this started a
back-and-forth war between Edison and
Johnson on playback time which
eventually led to the development of
plastic records these were far less
fragile and quickly won over the wax
phonograph consequently leading to the
development of the LP or long play
record many years later in the 1940s it
took a long time partially because of
the great great depression but they did
allow for more than twenty-two minutes
of sound per side vinyl however has its
disadvantages and while significantly
more durable than wax it would still
degrade very slightly with each playback
not to mention having to wind up a
record player to keep the Rickon spring
motor spinning these problems were
solved soon enough original recordings
would later be made into moulds that
could cast many many more records from
them lowering the issues
record degradation and as time went on
wind up spring motors were replaced
logically with electric motors needle
started converting vibrations into
electrical signals using electromagnets
and the large horn used to amplify sound
was replaced with amplifiers and
loudspeakers these advancements brought
records into a more modern era and
helped them to survive to the present
where they're still being produced but
wait why are they still being made
aren't there better digital media
formats available that are way more
convenient
well while vinyl might not be as
convenient like something like an mp3 it
does have its advantages over digital
vinyl has a sound signature that many
audio files consider to be warm engaging
and pure than the ones and zeros you
find elsewhere vinyl also has a tendency
to produce more natural less harsh
sounds reducing fatigue from long
listening sessions and even with the
cost of producing a physical record
vinyl is super cheap you can actually
find many modern artists releasing
albums on vinyl at both mainstream
retailers and independent shops so if
you're an audio enthusiasts you may want
to give vinyl a chance it might just
spin your world right round like a
record baby round round round round
