things up in RL like the US military
does with their unmanned aircraft but if
simply flying things around for the fun
of it sounds good to you you may just
want to look into picking up a consumer
drone a product category that has
enjoyed a huge surge in popularity
recently but what exactly is a drone how
exactly do drones work and what do you
need to know before taking off
we'll start by fixing your terminology
although the words are often used
interchangeably most of the drones that
you see on the market are actually just
quad copters and as that name suggests
that means that they have for spinning
rotors arranged in a square or diamond
pattern now quad copters work by varying
how fast each individual rotor is
spinning so if all the blades are
spinning at the same speed then it'll
either go straight up or down or just
hang in the air in one spot but when
some of the blades are told by an
on-board controller to rotate faster
than others it can cause the drone or
quad to dive bank strafe or even do
stunts like flips but while most drones
function fairly similarly due to the
actual physics of the usual four rotor
arrangement they certainly aren't all
created equal and you can get anything
from tiny low powered quads for
beginners for under $50 to heavy-duty
drones with powerful batteries and
crystal-clear cameras that will run you
over $1,000 and could probably take over
Luxembourg if you had enough of them but
let's say that that's not your goal or I
mean who knows maybe it is how do you
shop for a drone what exactly should you
be looking for that all depends on what
capabilities you require your flying and
technical skills and of course your
budget there are plenty of ready to fly
or RTF drones that come fully assembled
and include a handheld remote
transmitter just charge up the battery
and you're pretty much ready to rock
cheaper models will typically not fly as
long on a single charge thanks to their
little capacity batteries with some
lasting as little as five minutes or so
and usually feature very low quality
cameras if they have one at all as you
go up the price ladder you'll find
drones that can fly around half
an hour on just a single charge with
cameras that can capture great looking
stabilized HD video other features might
include longer range the ability to
mount your own camera with GoPros being
a popular choice but some even accepting
popular DSLR cameras the ability to
livestream video directly to a
smartphone or tablet for first-person
control or even the ability to use the
aforementioned tablet or other device to
control the drones flight but pre-built
sarn't for everyone and if you're a
tinkerer the drone hobbyist community
might be what you are after there are a
number of build at yourself drone kits
available in many different price ranges
as well as individual parts that you can
buy such as high-capacity batteries
advanced remote transmitters and even
auto pilots that turn a quadcopter into
an actual bona fide self piloting drone
also as we become more and more
experienced you may even want to try out
different flight controllers these are
the PCBs that control the rotors kind of
like a drones motherboard that responds
differently to control inputs with some
sort of more specialized for smooth
flying and thus capturing prettier
videos while others might be a bit more
challenging to fly but will allow you to
pull off much more impressive maneuvers
so if you're interested in going the DIY
route there's a lot of information
available on selecting parts for your
particular skill level and needs but
before you jump into it remember that
just like anything else that's fun there
are some rules you have to follow both
the American and Canadian governments
have outlined regulations for flying
drones for fun as they are technically
aircraft these include but are not
limited to not flying too close to
airports getting the proper
certifications if your drone is over a
certain weight or size limit or if
you're flying for commercial gain
keeping your drone within sight not
flying near an actual plane for what we
hope are obvious reasons and this should
go without saying not using your drone
to spy on your attractive neighbor or to
harass that troll who told you to fight
me IRL besides if drone owners start
misbehaving too much how will the drone
industry ever get to the point where we
get things like quadcopter Pizza
Delivery which be awesome drone Pizza
speaking of drone Pizza
lynda.com lynda.com is one of our
favorite partners around here because
they're like freaking awesome you learn
stuff online and that's like great in
fact there are people here at - Media
Group who learned things that they use
in their jobs on lynda.com and it's used
by millions of people around the world
