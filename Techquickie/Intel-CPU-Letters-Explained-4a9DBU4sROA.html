the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so we've
done a number of videos here on tech
quickie explaining the alphabet soup
that you have to slurp down in order to
understand exactly what it is you're
buying when you go shopping for
electronics and perhaps no company has
been more guilty of throwing seemingly
random letters at product names than
Intel so while it might not be too hard
to understand the difference between a
core i3 and a core i5 you know bigger
number is better as a general rule if
you've ever looked at a product page or
a spec sheet for a laptop or even some
desktops you've probably noticed that
sometimes there are letters attached to
the end of the CPU model numbers - what
are those for
well as it turns out these letters
aren't just random characters that Intel
threw in they actually have real
meanings that tell you something about
the processor unfortunately there are so
many of them that it can feel like
you're trying to crack the da vinci code
just to figure out what your cpu was
designed to do but fear not tech quickie
is here to demystify what they all mean
starting with the one you're probably
most familiar with already k k means
that a chips multiplier is unlocked
meaning that it can be easily
overclocked if you have a similarly
enabled motherboard non K chips have
very limited overclocking functionality
so make sure you look for that k if you
want to tweak your system by the way
Intel doesn't talk about it as much but
the K in HK CPUs that you occasionally
see in high end laptops also means the
same thing speaking of which let's move
on to H then which officially stands for
high-performance graphics and is used to
designate Intel's higher-end offerings
in the mobile segment that consume more
power and here's another mobile specific
one many of those higher power chips
also have AQ on the end this is for
odd core so that's why you'll often see
HQ on more expensive laptops it is not a
subliminal message intended to make you
think that Intel notebooks are high
quality or is it anyway the other
letters that you're likely to see on
mobile chips are you and why with you
standing for ultra-low power and why
meaning yeah extremely low power hmm why
not e4 extremely oh that's right because
II was used to designate chips that
support ECC memory so for better or for
worse you and why chips are what you'll
see in laptops and other mobile devices
where the focus is more on saving
battery life than on performance with
some Y Series CPUs having T DPS of under
5 watts now it bears noting that Intel
has an M suffix to make it clear that a
chip is mobile but currently it's only
being used on Xeon chips for mobile
workstations now let's kick things back
over to desktop land we'll start with
the letter T this feels like an episode
of Sesame Street these processors still
fit in a standard LGA Desktop socket but
they are low power so you'll often see
them in small form factor or all-in-one
computers that are designed with smaller
power supplies or less aggressive
cooling other letters can indicate some
interesting graphics options so if you
see a chip with a p on the end this
indicates a desktop processor without
integrated graphics which can save you a
few bucks if you're planning to use a
discreet video card anyway while the
newer G CPUs
feature Radeon rx Vega graphics that are
built in from none other than Intel's
biggest rival AMD sorry excuse me I mean
their total non competitor Radeon
Technologies group which is a totally
different company now of course we'd be
remiss if we didn't give a quick shout
out to R and C which we last saw on the
now several generations old Broadway
line to designate a soldered on CPU and
then an unlocked Desktop CPU
respectively I don't know what the point
of see instead of K was but you know it
doesn't matter it's over now let's
finish this up then with the most
dramatic letter of all X this indicates
a very high end unlocked consumer CPU
with the most course and the highest
prices and it's currently sitting atop
the pile in the core I nine 79 80
XE for Extreme Edition not to be
confused with E for ECC memory like I
mentioned earlier so in summary then
maybe Intel could do a better job of
making these things simpler and more
consistent for consumers but at least to
their credit someone over there
recognized the problem and spearheaded
the creation of this lengthy website to
help people decipher their ever shifting
meanings we're gonna have that link
below so you can find the latest updates
speaking of the latest updates if you're
not all about getting the latest phone
all the time you want to be able to
repair your own devices and improve
their longevity iFixit are the guys to
help you out they're all about teaching
people how to take stuff apart and fix
their electronics and they're leading
the charge in the electronics repair
industry with their iconic blue and
black Pro Tech toolkit and it's now only
fifty nine ninety five it's got their 64
bit driver kit it's got this compact
case that folds up really nicely it's
got a wide variety of plastic opening
tools spudger z' picks suction cups all
that kind of great stuff including ESD
safe tweezers and an ESD safety strap
and it's backed by I fix its lifetime
warranty so don't pay people to repair
your devices go and get an I fix it Pro
Tech tool kit so you can repair your
devices forever and check out the over
25,000 free repair guides at ifixit.com
we're gonna have that linked below
