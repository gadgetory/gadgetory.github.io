mean the word itself is fine actually
it's a fun game for kids an iconic song
from Katzen without mine I'd have a
pretty hard time making these videos but
no my problem with the word memory is
the confusion that it causes asked a
dozen big-box salespeople how much
memory you know this computer has and I
guarantee you that while some of them
will tell you it has 16 gigs of RAM
others will report the capacity of the
SSD or the hard drive instead and
therein lies the problem
you just got potentially three different
answers and worse none of them are
really quite wrong
this problem exists because most folks
aren't aware that there are so many
different types of memory inside a
single PC but don't worry we're going to
take care of all of that at the end of
this video you'll be correctly referring
to the memory types in your PC like a
champ let's start with DRAM what most
people are referring to when they talk
about computer memory dynamic random
access memory is optimized to sit in a
sweet spot where it delivers high
performance and high density or capacity
at a reasonable cost
ddr3 is an example of drm and it's all
volatile memory which means that once
you cut power to it anything stored in
DRAM quickly fades away and on top of
that this is the dynamic part of the
DRAM thing is it's unable to retain data
even while it's powered on if it's not
being constantly refreshed or rewritten
the good news is that D Ram isn't used
for long-term storage and most of it
will be set up for your CPU or graphics
processor to use as working memory that
contains only the information needed to
help them complete the task at hand and
nothing more so these characteristics
are not detrimental in any way next up
is SRAM this stands for static
random-access memory it's a volatile
storage medium
just like the RAM but the key difference
is that it is capable of delivering much
higher performance and that while it's
receiving power it doesn't need to
refresh each bit periodically just to
keep it from fading the data will wait
instead to be overwritten modern high
performance CPUs use SRAM as a way to
store the data
APU needs most right next to it for
frequent fast access but due to its cost
it's typical for this cash to have a
capacity of only a few megabytes flash
memory which is a subset of EEPROM is
the first type of memory in our rundown
that is non-volatile meaning that data
is retained even when there is no power
being provided to the chips this feature
comes with a significant performance
reduction and a limited number of
program erase or write cycles though
this is a necessary trade-off though
because NAND flash is used to store
things like the operating system
applications and other important data
that can't be erased whenever the system
is powered down in a consumer PC or
device an SSD is an example of something
that uses NAND flash but in spite of the
fact that I just said it has reduced
performance it's still much faster than
a more traditional hard drive the only
drawback here is that due to their much
higher cost compared to a hard drive
typical capacities for SSD devices are
tens or hundreds of gigabytes and you
know portable devices are up to a
thousand gigabytes or terabytes and
high-performance computers then flash is
also used in low-cost products like USB
thumb drives but the chips used for
those are much lower performance and not
capable of as many program erase cycles
our last memory type is mechanical
storage or the hard drive note the use
of the word storage they're calling it
memory is actually a bit of a stretch
even though it does store data like the
other technologies we've discussed it's
very very different hard drives use a
right head to store data as a series of
ones and zeros so it's still digital
storage in the same way that you know
anything else is storing this data
digitally but it's on a magnetic
recording layer on a disk called a
platter that is spinning anywhere from
5400 to 7200 times per minute around in
a typical hard drive now hard drives
have been a staple of personal computers
since the 60s and while they're not
nearly as fast as any of the other
memory types covered here due to the
physical movement required to access
them they are still going to be
important for a long time as a cost of
effective mass storage medium that
doesn't degrade when it's not plugged
into anything speaking of not being
plugged into anything hotspot Shield is
the easy and expensive way to set up a
VPN solution for your pcs and devices
their elite membership which you can
save 20% on by checking out the link in
the video description and using offer
code Linus works for up to five devices
including iOS and Android devices it
helps you maintain your anonymity online
by masking your IP address now the way a
VPN accomplishes this is by rerouting
all of your traffic securely through a
remote centralized server so to the
websites you're visiting the traffic
appears to be coming from hotspot
shields data center but it's actually
coming from you now while this
technology rerouting traffic isn't
likely to improve your ping times for
gaming it does have some other benefits
as well that make it worthwhile
including allowing you to access
services that you otherwise wouldn't be
able to such as us Netflix if you live
outside of the USA so once again guys
check out the link in the video
description to learn more and don't
forget to use offer code Linus to save
20 percent thanks for watching this
episode of fast as possible on tech wiki
I hope you guys enjoyed it like it if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it we do appreciate your feedback it
means a lot to us you can feel free to
leave comments on you know future
episodes that you'd like to see here on
fast as possible as well and thanks
again for watching and as always don't
forget to subscribe to tech wiki for
more fast as possible episodes just like
this and I will take a breath at some
point here Mirta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
