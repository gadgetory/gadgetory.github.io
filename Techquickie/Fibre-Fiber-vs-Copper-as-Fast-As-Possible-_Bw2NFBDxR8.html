networking communications cables copper
versus fiber which will win the ultimate
bandwidth challenge and send his
opponents ping crying home to mama let's
begin with the key characteristics those
good old reliable copper phone lines
that's right the same basic
infrastructure that we've been using
since the beginning of the 20th century
copper is highly conductive this is what
makes it so great for carrying the power
to your home that you need to do all the
things that are important that you need
to do there and copper wires use the
movement of electrons to carry signals
by modulating a waveform at one end then
demodulating it at the other end to
convert the patterns in the waveform
into an analog or a digital signal a
device that modulates and demodulates is
called a modem the problem is that
copper even higher bandwidth coaxial
cables can carry only a small number of
waveforms limiting its maximum data
capacity and these waveforms degrade
very quickly as the distance between the
communications devices increases in fact
copper only has two main advantages
today one it's much less expensive per
unit distance than fiber and two hits
already deployed basically everywhere
thanks telephone in television modern
fiber optic cable invented by Corning
Inc in the 70s changed the game
completely by allowing the use of light
bursts to carry a signal instead of
waves traveling through metal today
these cables are made up of a highly
transparent flexible glass core wrapped
in a series of layers that protect both
the integrity of the signal in the glass
and the structure of the glass inside
from the elements because this is light
traveling through a nearly transparent
medium it moves at approximately 200,000
kilometers per second actually not that
different from an electrical signal
through copper but but much more
importantly the integrity of the signal
the ease with which we can interpret the
light on vs. light off at either end is
much easier to maintain at higher
switching speeds and over longer
distances I mean we're talking thousands
of kilometers like across oceans giving
fiber-optic cables and enormous
advantage in speed and well distance
there's lots of other cool stuff too
optical signals are immune to
electromagnetic interference individual
fibers can be bundled together during
installation some for use now others
dark for expandability in the future
depending on the requirements fiber can
be used with LEDs or lasers and an
individual fiber might transmit multiple
wavelengths or colors of light at the
same time to be split out at the other
end to further increase capacity sounds
great let's use it for everything Linus
well life is rarely that simple isn't it
we're heading in that direction but
currently fiber is so much more
expensive per length than copper that
it's taking a little while to get there
the good news is that copper carries
some additional hidden costs that
increase fibers appeal even further
thicker heavier cables are more
difficult to install and may require
more clearance than is even available in
existing underground pathways in cases
where multiple connections can leverage
a single backbone the cost per capacity
argument comes into play where even if
two fibers cost a thousand times what
copper would if it can carry over a
thousand times the data the cost per
customer and ISP can serve goes down and
of course the distance thing comes into
play again the ISP will save again on
repeaters that you'll need all over the
neighborhood to maintain the integrity
of a signal that's running on copper
lines so mrs. Rochester's connection
doesn't drop out in the middle of her
Netflix marathon but that doesn't mean
that every house will be getting a
direct fiber connection anytime soon it
would certainly be nice but hybrid
deployments with a fiber backbone that
serves many customers and copper runs to
individuals for the last mile are most
common today because they deliver solid
speeds and reliability while saving a
lot of money for the Tauri ously
tight-fisted ISPs that are managing the
infrastructure speaking of whatever it
is I was just talking about our sponsor
today is fractal design and instead of
me telling you guys about their simple
Scandinavian design and great power
supply's cases and cooling products we
actually weren't sure what to do this
time so I was like spitballing ideas and
like what can we get at a dollar store
like glitter NYX like yeah sure so he
goes to a dollar store and comes
back with a tube of glitter glue not
only that a tube of glitter glue that's
actually completely hardened and dried
out so the only thing we ended up being
able to do with it at all was make me
pretty for you guys so I hope you
enjoyed it y'all you viewers and you
Josh do you find me pretty and sparkly
my sparkling excellent time sparkling
alright so thanks again to fractal
design for sponsoring today's episode of
fast as possible thanks to you guys for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible episodes
just like this one and Nick that's for
you buddy don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
