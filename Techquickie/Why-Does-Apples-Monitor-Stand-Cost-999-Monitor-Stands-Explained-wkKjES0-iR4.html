monitor of your dreams one thing you may
not have put a lot of thought into is
your monitors stand and who can blame
you right it's just something that holds
up the screen but then you set it up and
you realize that the one that came with
your monitor barely allows you to adjust
the position in there you're left having
to hunch down like Quasimodo just to see
properly or you prop your monitor up on
top of a stack of fitness books that
you've never gotten around to reading
because you're still training through
your Steam library so this is where an
aftermarket monitor stand is going to
come in handy but these run the gamut
from around thirty dollars to a thousand
if you want to buy that contraption that
Apple's trying to sell so what should
you look out for when buying them
understand and why in the world does
Apple think it can charge more than an
iPhone for one well before you even
start looking for a monitor stand you'll
want to make sure that the monitor
itself has something called a vase
amount as this will make your life much
easier this is a standard pattern of
mounting holes that are incorporated
directly into the monitors frame that
will ensure that your display is
compatible with the vast majority of
stands on the market it's not uncommon
though for monitors especially cheaper
ones to come without a vase amount so
definitely verify this before doing
anything else your next step should be
to think about what you need out of our
monitor stand do you need just something
that's sturdier than the flimsy piece of
plastic that came in the monitor box if
so you can probably get away with a
cheap freestanding stand many of these
will not only give your monitor plenty
of support but will let you adjust the
height the viewing angle and even let
you orient the monitor in portrait mode
if you need to view lots of vertically
organized information at once like like
a group chat really important group chat
but let's say that you're also concerned
about saving space maybe you have a
small desk or or a multi-monitor setup
and you just can't have one or more
freestanding solutions hogging all your
real estate in this case you have a few
alternatives one is to get a wall mount
which can either attach to your wall and
leave your monitor locked in one
position or allow your screen to
protrude off of an arm and be adjusted
as you see fit of course the downside is
that you'll need to drill holes into
your wall and depending on where you
mount your screen you don't want to have
a super-heavy monitor ripping hole in
the sheet rock that you'll have to
explain your landlord
but the upside is that you won't take up
any death space whatsoever but if you
don't want to mess around with
installing a mount on your wall you can
go with a clamp style monitor stand that
attaches to this side of your desk
minimizing your displays footprint there
are also clamps that go through your
desk for added stability though you'll
either need to have a hole already built
into your desk or of course bust out the
power drill and make one yourself but
the nice thing about these clap mounts
other than stability and making your
workspace look like your monitors are
being held up by cybernetic robot arms
is that many of them are built to hold
more than one display at a time so
instead of having half your desk taken
up by large monitor bases you can fit
three screens and take up about the same
amount of space as a coffee mug whatever
option you go with be sure to check out
how much weight each stand is rated for
and exactly how you'll be able to adjust
your displays hold on a minute because
even some of the nicest triple monitor
clap mounts on Amazon can be had for
around a hundred 150 bucks so why in the
world is Apple charging a thousand
dollars for a simple freestanding mount
with fairly standard tilt and rotation
features well there's actually nothing
special about it see yes it's being
paired with a $5,000 monitor Apple may
have thought another grand for a stand
would be small potatoes for the folks in
the market for a display like that but
regardless of whether this is an Apple
ploy to create another over-engineered
pricey to repair a product or just then
thinking their design is actually worth
that much our recommendation would be to
just go with the Oh also overpriced $200
vase amount or maybe just lean it
against something with some velcro
