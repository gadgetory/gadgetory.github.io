choosing a thermal compound you want to
find something with low thermal
resistance that is Heat easily passes
through it something non conductive and
non capacitive so you don't short out
anything on your motherboard and last
but not least something that doesn't dry
out over time so that you don't lose
performance a couple of years down the
road when your systems still running and
your thermal compounds still in there
we'll be using
icy diamond this is my personal favorite
thermal paste before you actually start
a thermal compound swap I would
definitely recommend checking your
temperatures because that way you'll be
able to more easily diagnose if anything
went wrong during the installation
procedure first up is to remove your
existing heatsink revealing the old
thermal compound underneath you'll need
isopropyl alcohol so you want to wet
that on to a nice soft piece of I use
Charmin because it's awesome and then
you want to clean the surface of the CPU
as well as the bottom of the heatsink
now you'll notice that I'm not actually
able to get it completely clean on the
first go this is because my wipe is now
too dirty to clean anything so I'm going
to find a clean spot put on some more
alcohol and do another round with the
isopropyl trying to remove the residue
that was left from the first time of
cleaning it so here we see our first
pass in our second pass for the third
pass I usually just use the toilet paper
without putting any additional alcohol
on it because we're trying to remove the
little bits that are left behind not
leave any more which is easier when
they're wet and then I usually finish
off and you're welcome to use something
else with just a quick pass with my
sleeve or a microfiber cloth to remove
any remaining residue that might be left
behind by toilet paper because those
little bits can cause cooling problems
and now you can see the surfaces are
clean and ready to apply our new thermal
compound back when CPUs didn't have
integrated heat spreaders we used to
spread the thermal compound out across
the die or the core in order to make
sure that it covered the entire thing
now that we put so much mounting
pressure onto our heat spreaders we can
just put either a pea shaped blob in the
middle or a rice grain shaped line in
the middle and we can rely on the
mounting pressure of the heat sink to
actually spread the thermal compound so
these are known as the pea and the line
method I personally find the line method
has the best consistency for me but
everyone has a different experience and
it varies depending on the thermal
compound the one thing to be aware of
with the pea in the line method is that
if you have a bigger CPU you're going to
want to apply a bigger line of thermal
compound or a bigger pea in the middle
this is a 2011 CPU whereas the one down
here is an 1155 CPU now that we have a
fresh application of thermal compound
and two nice shiny clean surfaces to put
together we should be able to observe
temperature improvements of anywhere
from three to five degrees Celsius over
the stock thermal compound when using an
appropriate high-performance thermal
compound wha hey guys thanks for
