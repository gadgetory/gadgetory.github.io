mysterious as the phrase I'm fine just
leave me alone
I mean what does that even mean if I
actually leave you alone to go play
video games will I be making a huge
mistake and will I pay for it later I
mean if you were fine wouldn't you want
to talk to me like you normally do and
if you're not fine when it blows up
later but it'd be your fault for not
communicating clearly or my fault for
not understanding please just tell me
what you want anyway
so while I'm not qualified to help you
understand women I can help you choose
the right wattage power supply for your
PC step one is finding out how much
power you actually need for the
components inside your PC this is
expressed in the total number of watts
that the unit is capable of outputting
and the best way to find all that out is
to head over to Coolermaster outer
vision comm it's linked in the video
description and enter the stuff you're
using or plan to use it's that simple if
you run into anything confusing just
posted in the Linus tech tips comm form
under power supplies and our awesome
community will help you out now that
calculator does add a bit of fudge
factor for stuff like the aging of your
components over time so it might air on
the side of a little bit too much but
it's best not to try to squeeze under
that and use something insufficient that
can result in unexpected shutdowns and
wear and tear over time now some people
will naturally go completely the other
way and see four hundred watts in the
calculator and figure well to be safe
I'll just grab a 1200 watt power supply
but that's not necessarily right either
first your wallet will be more empty
than it had to be and second your system
efficiency will actually be lower than
if you bought something more appropriate
a power supply operates optimally above
about 15 to 25% of its total capacity
that means that your system will
actually draw more power from the wall
than it has to and your power bill will
cost a bit more sounds terrible right
well sometimes it makes sense I'm one of
those people who went overkill on my
power supply but it's because it has a
fan 'less zero decibel mode for complete
silent operation when I'm not fully
utilizing my PC an example of this is
coolermaster silent pro hybrid series
which doesn't even turn on the fan until
it reaches 200 watts of load so you can
train a bit of efficiency for quiet if
you're into that
step 2 is finding a power supply that
matches the wattage your calculator spat
out there are two ways that the
capability of a power supply can be
expressed as peak wattage or continuous
wattage now I have a hint for cutting
through the BS here if a power supply is
rated in continuous then that's good
if it's rated in continuous with a
separate peak rating then that's good
too if it only has a peak rating then
don't put it anywhere near your system
because there's no real standard for
what peak means can it handle that for
an hour a minute a week I split second
before it goes nuclear we don't know if
a power supply is rated only in peak
wattage but not continuous don't even
consider buying it
which leads us to the final step picking
a power supply of sufficient quality
it's important and this isn't one of
those used car salesman moments here
guys I get asked all the time why I
don't review the latest power supply
with a hundred multicolored LEDs in an
acrylic case from Jack Tech and the
answer is that I don't care about it at
all a power supply is a serious piece of
equipment not a fashion statement and
unless it's from my trusted manufacturer
with all the appropriate safety
certifications and/or gets a seal of
approval from Johnny guru or a similarly
reputable power supply review site I'm
not gonna touch it a power supply can
fail spectacularly triggering the
premature or even immediate failure of
other components in your system and your
warranty will not cover you being a
doofus and relying on a potato to
provide safe stable power to your PC and
that's not even the worst case scenario
a fire caused by a power supply can burn
down your house on that somber note our
sponsor for this episode is cooler
master and the only power supply brand
you should ever consider buying is
cooler master because I'm just messing
with you guys
cooler master would have to pay me a lot
more than they are to pretend that
they're the only solid power supply
brand that exists in
all seriousness though this video was
brought to you by Coolermaster and they
are one of the solid power supply makers
with options ranging from value oriented
solutions like the GN series all the way
up to the V series which includes
modular cabling extremely low ripple and
uses only high quality Japanese
capacitors and I think we're done here
if you guys enjoyed this video and
you're shopping for a power supply it is
definitely worth checking out the
sponsor link in the video description to
see if they have anything that floats
