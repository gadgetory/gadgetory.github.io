a word you use when you want to confuse
the sales rep at the local Best Buy or
it's all the different kinds of wireless
you can get for your devices probably
that last one let's start with this
wireless standards are mostly backwards
compatible so while you might have a
laptop with wireless and 300 megabit and
a smartphone like the HTC One with
wireless AC your AC router or your n
router will work with both devices so if
you don't feel like watching the rest of
this video just go buy a router with
good reviews on amazon.com and you'll be
fine if you do want to learn more first
up is speed grade standards these start
with 802.11 and a suffix often a speed
number is thrown in by the manufacturer
and you might see something about
concurrent dual band which amounts to a
theoretical doubling of the speed
normally associated with that standard
however you will only realize that
performance benefit with devices that
also support concurrent dual band these
speed numbers don't really represent
what you'll see in the real world though
Wireless is subject to protocol overhead
and performance reductions caused by
distance obstacles and interference in
fact sometimes reducing these factors
can do more for performance than buying
better gear at all now with that said a
dual band router can help even if you're
not able to use concurrent dual band
because if you have five gigahertz
capable devices five gigahertz signals
are less susceptible to interference
from cordless phones microwave ovens etc
so while maximum range is actually
slightly reduced at five gigahertz
signal integrity can be better
third-party firmware compatibility is
another big selling point dd-wrt is an
example of a firmware that can unlock
additional sometimes enterprise or
pro-grade features on your router check
if your router is compatible on their
website before buying if you want to
tinker with it some router manufacturers
however will void your warranty for
flashing on official firmware so watch
out for that QoS or quality of service
systems such as W DS audio mated
fast-track class or link sis's manually
configured options can allow you to
prioritize certain pcs applications or
even types of network traffic such as
video streaming voice clients or gaming
over others which can be very handy from
Multi PC households many routers also
have USB ports so you can add a hard
drive to them for centralized file
storage or PC backups it's no substitute
for a real NASPA it's better than
nothing a lot of the time and don't
forget about the wired connections on
your router honestly this should be what
you're using for anything that isn't a
tablet smartphone or Ultrabook
find a way to get gigabit even if it
means spending a couple more bucks
unless your PC is very old it will
support gigabit which is 10 times faster
than 10 hundred for transferring files
in the real world and usually many times
faster than Wireless because of that
interference malarkey I was talking
about before last step well this is just
the first step again after you decide
what features you need go to a trusted
retailer website and read user reviews
we personally love the EA 4500 from
Linksys and we're moving to an EA 6500
soon for wireless AC support but
everyone's experience may be a bit
different and even from a trusted
company I usually won't buy a router
unless I hear a few solid testimonials
speaking of testimonials here's one for
audible.com go to audible.com slash tech
clicking get a free audio book for
signing up day I was so offended by the
Hobbit movie I thought it might be
beneficial to go through a cleanse and
read through the Hobbit book again by
JRR tolkien the unabridged version on
audible is only 11 hours long which is
about how long that one scene with the
dwarves and the dishwashing and the
singing seemed to last nah but seriously
the movie wasn't that bad but it
certainly wasn't the book head over to
audible.com slash tech quickie to get
your free audio book now and unlike my
Twilight recommendation a couple weeks
back I am pretty sure you'll enjoy this
one
