conquered all the bosses gathered every
bit of rare loot and there's no new
games coming out if only there was some
way I could breathe new life into my
older ones oh wait there is whether
you're looking to renew a well-played
game by adding content such as new
uniquely tan quests or altering game
mechanics and user interfaces to deliver
a more immersive experience or trying to
get the most out of old titles on your
new hardware by amping up the graphics
to levels never before thought possible
mods are often the way to go but since
the term mod can be applied to literally
anything that modifies a game's code
from the original or vanilla state we
thought it might be best to split up the
available mods out there into four basic
categories the first type is content
add-ons they describe any mods which add
files to the game that weren't there
before such as new areas story quests
and enemies but do not include those
which modify or remove operational code
and files from the vanilla game mods
that do perform these functions are
often referred to as gameplay mechanics
tweaks or overhauls depending on their
scale they include anything that alters
preexisting quests stats or character
abilities including those which may make
enemies harder to destroy or add new
powers such as speed running or flying
if a mod of this type attempt to correct
real or perceived mistakes in the game's
vanilla design they are often referred
to as unofficial patches which is a nice
way of implying they've done a better
job than the studios official patch the
third end possibly most popular type of
mods are known as graphical art mods
these can have a range of effects from
improving or replacing lower quality
textures with high definition ones to
modifying effects or even color balance
oftentimes if a game is popular users or
groups of users will even develop
convert
version packages which alter nearly
every aspect of the games visual design
usually while adding a small amount of
necessary content or altering the
mechanics somewhat to make sure that you
know that nutri texture doesn't allow
you to walk you know six inches into it
because it's bigger than the original
one or whatever else the case may be
sometimes though regardless of how nice
a game can be made to look or be
balanced annoying little things such as
menu navigation can limit a person's
ability to become fully immersed and
enjoy their game so this style of mod
can have certain capabilities like
getting rid of HUD clutter when it's not
in use or minimizing the time spent in
annoying inventory menus some are even
necessary for other mods to be installed
or to allow their individual settings to
be changed so while all this modding can
be great for extending a given titles
potential sometimes even into their
completely own spin-offs and franchises
it goes without saying that altering
vanilla code heavily can lead to some
interesting bugs and crashes in fact a
person usually isn't considered a you
know full you know card-carrying member
of the modding community until they have
completely erect a games code and door
you know hundreds of hours worth of
saved games at least once necessitating
a full reinstall and restart but have no
fear because programs known as mod
organizers or loaders have started to
spring up which assist careless noobs
and their efforts to mod many popular
games from minecraft to Skyrim there's
also now a bevy of people and networks
which allow potential modders to find
out everything they need to know before
taking the leap so if one now wishes to
add a special sword or armor to their
favorite character or horse or what's
more likely remove them since that seems
to be the main obsession of the modding
community at large all they must do is
follow the light and pay money or not
boy that was some quick backpedaling
speaking of following the light fresh
books fresh books is designed for
freelance workers or small biz
it's an online tool that makes invoicing
getting paid and tracking expenses
easier it's all about those little
details like cash flow actually that's a
really big deal for a small business and
a big business really anyone it shows a
full history of each invoice and allows
you to check if your client has viewed
the invoice and allows your clients to
pay by credit card online because half
of the battle with clients sometimes is
getting them while making it easy for
them to pay you because if it's a hassle
then they're just going to put it off
and put it off and put it off and that's
money that you don't have to reinvest
into your business it's really great for
freelance guys as well because you can
update your FreshBooks timesheet from
your phone and pull project hours right
into an invoice so you're constantly
logging them and keeping track so that
you don't have to go and be like oh it's
the end of the month how much time do I
work on this project if I under Bill I'm
screwing myself if I over bill they're
going to be like yo dog WTF men so
basically the long and short of it is if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff that makes you feel like a boss
and freshbooks is an easy way of doing
your billing online so that you have
more time to do the work you actually
want to be doing so head over to
FreshBooks comm slash tech quickie and
don't forget to enter tech quickie and
me how did you hear about us section
thanks for watching guys I like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment if you
have suggestions for future fast as
possible and as always don't forget to
subscribe and follow and all that good
stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
