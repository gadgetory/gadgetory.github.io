colloquial term used to describe a
service that utilizes the concept of
cloud computing I mean that's basically
it do you still have a reason for being
here okay no I'm sorry I write it right
so we're going to focus on the public
cloud or cloud services that are
available for pretty much anyone to use
through the internet a couple examples
of this include Dropbox which is cloud
storage and on live which is cloud
gaming but first the origin of the term
cloud my theory is that it exists
because it's easier to draw a cloud on a
network diagram than to draw this which
is a visual representation from Pier one
of the way many nodes are connected to
each other on the Internet no but
seriously there are a number of reasons
but the main one is that in the same way
that a normal cloud is a dense cluster
of water molecules that appears as a
single object from a distance a
computing cloud is a dense cluster of
computers working together in such a way
that to a normal observer they all
appear to be one giant computing
resource so in short that's the cloud
stuff that appears to be running on your
PC your phone or any other computing
device even a basic one like a
Chromebook but is actually running over
the Internet on an array of computers
that are sharing resources with each
other so let's make cloud storage our
first example you start out for free
with two gigs of storage you can access
anywhere so there's no upfront cost then
when you need more resources Dropbox's
cheapest paid account gets you 100 gigs
of storage you can't actually buy a 100
gig hard drive these days let alone a 2
gig one but that's where the shared
resources come in you are renting some
of a hard drive some bandwidth cost for
the data center and some of the power
cost for the PC it's sitting in and
that's how the cloud works but what
about a DIY solution I could buy two
cheapo hard drives for the same as one
year of that hundred gig account plug it
into my SATA ports fromand raid one set
up an FTP server forward the appropriate
ports on my router and then I'd have 500
gigs of reliable storage I can access
anywhere that actually belongs to me and
I don't
have to pay for it monthly well yes I
could so cloud storage is stupid then
well no hold on maybe not first of all I
had to pay all my money upfront instead
of spreading it out and scaling as my
needs change and if you weren't sure
what I was talking about for a moment
there with raids and FTPS you're not
alone most people don't know how to do
that stuff and even the ones that do
often can't be arsed the convenience of
having zero hassle sink folders and
solid mobile support to quickly do
things like backup photos on my phone is
very appealing on top of that with cloud
services you won't be limited by the
slow speeds or bandwidth caps if
applicable of your home connection and
you'll get data protection that is much
more robust than raid 1 with copies of
your files spread across the globe so
that even a natural disaster that wipes
out an entire data center wouldn't
theoretically cause you to lose anything
my next example is an emerging
technology cloud gaming instead of
buying a gaming PC up front with a
powerful graphics card a casual gamer
could just get a basic plan for most of
the time then increase it temporarily to
get more horsepower when a hot game
comes out for example he or she wouldn't
need to worry about updating drivers or
waitin for game installs even because
the applications themselves could run
from the cloud this running software
that's not even installed on your PC
concept is actually a third excellent
example of cloud computing by the way
sounds great right well latency is going
to be a major obstacle for cloud gaming
for a long time but how about other
stuff like video editing you could use
this concept to sit at your laptop and
leverage processing power in a server
farm somewhere that's orders of
magnitude faster than what you have
available to you if it's something that
you only use on a project-by-project
basis it could be much more economical
than investing heavily in hardware for
yourself pretty cool way my last example
is both my sponsor for today's fast as
possible and another example of the
ease-of-use reliability low upfront cost
and nearly unlimited performance
scalability that comes from sharing
resources in the cloud Squarespace comms
browser-based interface allows you to
use their design suite
to build a great brand and beautiful
functional website and it's all in the
cloud their tools include a logo
designer and template based website
design tool that allows you to create an
awesome blog portfolio fully functional
website and more the templates look
great on desktop or mobile browsers and
because the web hosting is cloud-based
you can scale your plan as needed to
adapt to your changing needs in terms of
storage space power and bandwidth
finally again because it's cloud-based
you can access the tools from anywhere
and the changes you make to your site
will be live in seconds if all of that
sounds like an easier way to manage a
website check out squarespace.com slash
tech quickie and use offer code text and
and now the usual thing guys like this
video and share it if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it so we can
improve for next time and leave a
comment if you want to see another fast
as possible that focuses more on the
advantages of the private cloud or
advantages of keeping your data to
yourself versus the public cloud things
like the potential cost savings and
improved privacy that can be achieved
with a DIY solution like BitTorrent sync
or even the way you can use something
like a WD my cloud network hard drive to
achieve some of these goals anyway guys
don't forget to subscribe so you don't
miss any episodes of fast as possible
and I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
