the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos of all the
unpleasant surprises you can encounter
while computing few are more jarring
and the sudden blue screen of death and
let's not kid ourselves that cute little
frowny face they added in Windows 8
really doesn't help what's almost as
frustrating is losing your work though
is the fact that you get hardly any
information about why your computer
suddenly decided to stop working like
Dennis on a Friday afternoon all you get
is some mysterious error code thankfully
tech quickie is here to save the day
with a list of some of the most common
blue screen error codes along with their
meanings and some possible fixes
starting with irq not less or equal as
it turns out I RQ l stands for interrupt
request level which usually means that a
program tried to access a piece of
memory that was being protected by the
operating system for some sort of
important task and since device drivers
usually have to access these parts of
memory since they interface with your
operating system and the actual hardware
this error typically indicates a driver
issue so try updating or reinstalling
any drivers that might be problematic of
course this could also indicate a
problem with the hardware itself perhaps
a graphics card that's aggressively
overclocked and by the way the related
page Fault in non paged area can
indicate a similar problem but those
aren't the only messages that indicate a
hardware error if you see data bus error
it doesn't mean you have a broken
Volkswagen parked in your driveway
instead this probably means you have an
issue with your memory so run a memory
check utility like mem test 86 plus or
try simply pulling out one of your RAM
sticks and then swapping for the other
one to see if one of them has died I
mean or you can swap out both if you
have extras on hand it's entirely
possible that we are single-handedly
causing the continuation of the global
DRAM shortage so sorry about that this
may well solve the problem and if it
doesn't well it's likely that you have a
driver or Hardware issue
elsewhere in your system another memory
be saw
memory management can often be resolved
by going into your BIOS and making sure
that your RAM settings are correct this
particular error can pop up if you've
overclocked your RAM or if it's not
getting the right amount of voltage on
the subject of overclocking machine
check exception is often caused by a CPU
that is overclocked to the point of
instability so try bumping it back to
stock speed to see if the error goes
away and then if you do choose to
overclock again be a little bit more
conservative please but then suppose
your memory and your processor are fine
and you get an error that says fat file
system don't get out the exercise bike
just yet any file system error whether
it's fat or NTFS simply means that
you've got some kind of a problem with
your hard drive or SSD now this could
simply be caused by a driver issue but
there also might be a more serious
physical issue with your disk so if you
see this error backup anything important
and run a disk check utility followed by
a diagnostic utility like CTools
from the manufacturer of your drive to
ensure that it is safe to continue to
use other kinds of discs problems can
produce the inaccessible boot device
blue screen that could be caused by a
corrupt sector which can sometimes be
fixed by running Windows startup repair
or simply by choosing the wrong disc
mode in your BIOS if it's set to IDE try
changing it to AHCI and vice versa of
course there are other errors that don't
have super obvious causes such as system
thread exception not handled if you see
this common message or another error
code that you don't recognize see if
your blue screen of death gives you a
file name that you can jot down before
the PC reboots this can give you a clue
as to what driver or program is
misbehaving so that you can update
reinstall or remove it completely so
we're out of time for now but let us
know in the comments if there's another
b-side you'd like us to cover that keeps
coming back
for you like a bad case of the shingles
my roof has shingles you know what isn't
like a rash that goes away though
private Internet access
not only does P IA v pn work on up to
five devices at once --is by hiding your
true IP address and allowing you to
bypass geo restrictions and censorship
by making it appear as though you are
connecting from somewhere else it also
blocks unwanted connections to help
prevent attacks it Otto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects and it
keeps your data out of the hands of
snoops and advertisers P ia supports
multiple VPN protocols and encryption
levels allowing you to dial in the exact
level of protection you need and they've
got apps for Windows Mac Android iOS
Linux and a Chrome extension with
support for more platforms coming soon
so check out bia they've got over 3,000
servers in 28 countries and they don't
log your activity we're gonna have them
linked in the video description so
thanks for watching guys like dislike

comment if you have a suggestion for a
future video and subscribe it's a dream
