component manufacturer to mass-produce
a vapor chamber cooled graphics card
when they released the 3870 atomic
edition back in 2008 they claimed vapor
chambers would deliver significant
improvements in cooling performance
versus traditional designs that used
solid metal or heat pipes but what the
heck is a vapor chamber do we go into
one it 20 past the 16th hour of each day
or am I just completely off-base here
all right sorry with the bad joke
thankfully behind us let's kick off the
helpful part of this video with how a
heat pipe works because it's actually
pretty darn similar to a vapor chamber a
heat pipe is a vacuum sealed metal tube
hey I said the bad joke is behind us do
it right a vacuum sealed metal tube that
contains a working fluid that changes
from liquid to gas when heat is applied
at one end of the tube this heated gas
moves quickly to the other end where it
condenses or turns back into liquid then
travels via a wick material usually
sintered metal back to the end with the
heat source this design allows heat
pipes to transfer heat much more
efficiently than a solid piece of metal
and they have the added advantage of
being much lighter on top of that modern
heat pipe designs perform really well in
any orientation even upside down that's
why most high performance CPU or
graphics card coolers use heat pipe
technology in some way these days but
heat pipes do have some limitations they
only transfer heat in one direction not
even acknowledging that one and they're
thin round shape means that they are
physically difficult to get close to a
very small heat source there are a
couple of solutions such as embedding
them in a solid chunk of metal to spread
the heat out to the connected pipes but
then we're relying on the relatively
inefficient heat transfer of copper we
can get heat directly to the heat pipes
by flattening them out and putting them
right up against something but now due
to the sheer size of our heat pipes
again and the size our heat source we
can only connect a handful of heat pipes
if only we had something that could be
used in high heat flux applications like
on a CPU that could spread that thermal
energy out incredibly
so we could use traditional thins or
even heat pipes to spread the heat even
further that would enable efficient
operation of larger heat sinks than
before and oh snap the topic of this
video I'm talking of course about vapor
chambers a vapor chamber much like a
heat pipe is made of a vacuum sealed
flat metal structure that contains a
working fluid that changes from liquid
to gas when heat is applied anywhere on
its surface this heated gas moves
quickly throughout the inside of the
vapor chamber where it finds somewhere
cooler than its boiling point and
condenses then travels via Wichman back
to the heat source a couple of subtle
differences there the most important of
which is a vapor chambers phenomenal
ability to spread heat out in any
direction up to 700 watts per centimeter
squared can be spread out they use a
series of internal posts to keep them
from collapsing remember there's a
vacuum inside and they're manufactured
for everything from mundane stuff like
cooling down a PC all the way to
specialized designs that can be as huge
as they want or as thin as point five
millimeters according to Wikipedia
although the thinnest I could find was
1.5 millimeters from cell co
technologies and they can be deployed in
like outer space sounds awesome right
why not use them on everything well I
mean they are super cool okay that one
was my fault
but they're also really expensive
compared to heat pipes so you'll only
really find them on premium products
like high-end graphics cards or check
out this seamless sponsor transition
kids this is how it's done or on the
Coolermaster v8 GTS CPU heatsink which
uses a combination of dual 140
millimeter cooling fans aluminum fins
copper heat pipes and a horizontal vapor
chamber to achieve its impressive 250
watts of cooling capacity and all of
that while being almost as sexy as yours
truly which may not be a point in its
favor
now I mentioned that it uses horizontal
heat pipes which implies that there may
be vertical heat pipes and in fact there
are for some more reading on horizontal
versus vertical heat pipes check out the
link to the appropriate article on CM
University in the video description it
gives a great explanation of the
different ways vapor chambers can be
used for CPU cooling thanks Coolermaster
