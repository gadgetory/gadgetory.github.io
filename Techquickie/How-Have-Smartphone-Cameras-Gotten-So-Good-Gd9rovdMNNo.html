won't miss any future videos all cameras
big and small work on the same
fundamental principle light going
through the lens and hitting a sensor
where it gets processed and converted
into the image you see on your screen
with more light generally meaning better
image quality
that's why bulky DSLR and mirrorless
cameras with their big interchangeable
lenses and their larger sensors are the
weapon of choice for professional
photographers so given that the sensors
inside smartphone cameras haven't
actually increased much in size since
they were debuted by sharp almost two
decades ago how can their image quality
be so much better today than it was then
well one big improvement is in the
number of receptor sites on the sensor
which is typically measured in millions
of pixels or megapixels improvements in
microscale manufacturing have allowed
manufacturers to cram many times more of
these onto your camera's sensor and the
more of them you have the more light
samples can be collected giving you a
finer image there are at least two a
point as you can learn more about in
this episode adding more megapixels
stops helping and can even hinder image
quality past a certain point so there's
got to be more to it and there is from
our previous episode explaining aperture
you might know that every lens has a
rating or a range of rating in f-stops
the lower the f-stop the wider it can
open up and the more light can pass
through this will improve image quality
especially in situations where there
isn't much ambient light like in the
club but another aspect of the lens that
isn't so easy to read off of a spec
sheet is its composition in the early
days of cell phone cameras cheap plastic
or composite lenses were used not only
were they less clear and more likely to
distort the light passing through them
blurring the image they were much more
prone to scratching even against the
materials in your pocket meaning that
over time your camera's performance
would degrade modern lenses by contrast
are
engineering marvels crafted from exotic
materials like sapphire glass with
multiple carefully engineered elements
in them for much better clarity and with
some extra tricks as well back to our
club shop for a minute one of the ways
to get around low-light conditions is to
simply leave the shutter open for longer
allowing it to capture more of those
precious photons but I'm sure I'm not
the only one who's tried to quickly snap
a pic of something dark only to realize
that it's crazy blurry
well one trick of modern lenses to
compensate for handshake under darker
conditions is to use gyroscopes data
combined with electromagnets around the
lens to help your phone camera stay
still this is called optical image
stabilization of course no one would
want a crystal-clear image if it looked
like this let's talk about dynamic range
in a nutshell if your dynamic range is
poor it will cause bright areas to be
blown out and dark areas to lose detail
or crush some newer smartphones
compensate for this though by saving
multiple frames at different exposure
levels every time you press the shutter
button then they can analyze these
frames and average them in a way that
minimizes blur and noise algorithmically
a little like mixing strong and weak
coffee to make something that's
drinkable of course that leads us
perfectly into another improvement
faster processors modern phone s o C's
not only have better CPUs and GPUs in
them allowing them to quickly perform
the functions I just mentioned and
provide further assistance to optically
stabilized lenses even at high speed in
burst modes or while recording slow
motion video
but some of them even have specialized
Hardware usually branded as a neural
processor or AI processor that can be
trained to identify the subject of the
video or photo adjusting the color
processing to best capture the shooters
intent which leads us perfectly then to
focus we've all seen it
a gorgeous detailed shot of the wall
behind your friend traditional phone
cameras relied on the contrast detection
to
directly focus on the subject of a photo
which means that they used brightness
differences in the scene to determine
where to focus this is an inexact
science at best more advanced modern
phones can use the phase detection a
technique which analyzes how the left
and right sides of the lens see slightly
different images to decide on the focus
with some of them also using infrared
lasers that fire at the object of a
photo to determine the distance similar
to a police radar gap on the subject of
depth detection to an increasing number
of phones recently are using two cameras
or even more with at least one of them
being equipped with a wider lens not
only does this allow for otherwise
impossible wide-angle shots because at
this point anyway you can't change out
the lens on a smartphone but it also
enables much easier depth sensing
meaning that these phones can simulate
depth of field or bokeh effects for an
artistic and dramatic blurred background
cool then right so with all this
technology jam-packed into our phones
why even buy a separate digital camera
well because it's important to remember
that some of the awesome results that
you see with smartphone cameras are due
to approximations for example the depth
of field effect on a modern smartphone
is applied in software at the point
where the phone thinks the focus should
change that means that under anything
but ideal conditions your mileage may
vary significantly
also since the sensors inside phones are
still quite small they continue to
struggle in low-light because they
simply can't see enough photons to make
a good looking image in many cases
combine that with the inability to put
even a decent optical zoom on a phone
without making it quite a bit fatter and
it suddenly all makes sense why
professionals still use traditional
cameras even so though for things like
casual shots of your kids and drone
footage phone cameras have become an
incredibly powerful and versatile tool

your era speaking of tinder do you ever
