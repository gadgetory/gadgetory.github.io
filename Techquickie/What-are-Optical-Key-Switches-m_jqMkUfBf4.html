that delightful clickety-clack sound
that's like a Vegas craps table that
keeps your roommate awake at night
mechanical keyboards are awesome for all
of that not to mention their durability
and premium feel but what if instead of
relying solely on a mechanical actuator
you can harness the power of light to
when you type and I'm not talking about
the ever-present RGB backlighting either
we are starting to see optical keyboard
switches hit the market which are
actually sort of a fusion of existing
mechanical keyboard technology and
infrared light that determines when you
push down on a key and unlike the huge
variety of purely mechanical switches
there are only two main types of optical
switches out there right now since the
technology is rather new the first type
is called a light strikes which also
called an lk switch these work with a
more or less traditional mechanical
shaft that blocks a freaking infrared
laser beam when it's idle but when you
press down the beam is allowed to hit a
sensor on the other side of the switch
which registers a key press now although
this is a pretty simple principle of
operation it actually allows for a
faster response times when gaming
because LK switches register keystrokes
after traveling just one and a half
millimeters downward about 25% less than
most current mechanical keyboards the
manufacturer also claims that actual
response times could be as low as a
fifth of one millisecond which is useful
if you need to aim and fire quickly
before getting headshotted not that too
many people have fire bound to their
keyboard don't worry about those little
details the other kind of switch goes by
the super-intense name of flare tech and
works quite differently instead of using
a beam of infrared light the PCB has an
upward facing I or sensor that can tell
when the switch itself is being pushed
down now although this is a little more
complicated and expensive to engineer
than the L K switch
the IR sensor can actually tell how far
the switch is being pressed down
allowing keyboard manufacturers to use
them as so-called
analog switches in fact a Dutch keyboard
manufacturer called routing currently
has a keyboard with flare tech switches
on Kickstarter featuring this analog
control that they're advertising as fine
control over things like player movement
or steering and throttle in driving
games imagine being able to push down
just a little bit on a key to make your
car go more slowly around corners
instead of like spamming the key and
hoping that somewhere between here and
here is like like here-ish cool right
routing is also pushing customizability
as a feature of this keyboard as the
analog functionality can be programmed
in a number of ways to make these key
switches much more versatile than
traditional ones and I mean beyond just
gaming they also have the distinct
advantage of being replaceable since
neither type has to be soldered on to
the PCB so the light sensor used by an L
case which is housed in the switch
itself while the IR sensor of a flare
tech switch doesn't need a physical
connection to the switch making
combining like a keyboard baseplate with
any other type of mechanical actuator
that you want sound pretty versatile in
the future and all of us without giving
yourself a crash course in soldering of
course since the technology is so new
there isn't much to choose from yet
although there are a small handful of L
case which is currently available on
Amazon but given their potential to help
gamers get quicker response times and
more granular control it wouldn't be
surprising to me to see bigger name
peripheral brands try to incorporate
optical switches into their keyboards in
the near future and bring in the sweet
sweet paper that comes with cutting edge
technology speaking of being on the
cutting edge with a lynda.com membership
you can stay on the cutting edge whether
you're looking to take your career to
the next level or you just want to get

go along on a particular learning path
with a small steady group of your
friends you can even download the
tutorials and watch them on the go
including access on iOS and Android
meaning you can start to make use of
that time that you spend sitting on the
bus letting your brain rot so the call
