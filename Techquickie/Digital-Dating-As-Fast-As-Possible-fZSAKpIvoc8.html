that special guy or gal they'd have to
put on their spiffiest threads and head
down to the local fountain shop to try a
bit of personal congress but kids these
days are so hyped up on their microwave
dinners and tennis shoes that they
prefer to spend time glued to screens
indoors meeting new partners on Facebook
and dating online well at least that was
the idea and the stigma about digital
dating services all the way back in the
Year 2005 but according to the Pew
Research Center people today generally
approve of the idea with approval rates
rising from approximately 40% to 60%
between then and 2013 not only that but
we also saw a decrease from about 30% of
those surveyed to 20% for people who
believed that all my dating was only for
those extremely desperate types in fact
digital dating service has become so
popular that huge groups of celebrities
are now openly admitting to using them
but why is everyone in the grandmother
suddenly so turned on to this concept I
mean it's not as if celebrities or
attractive young people have had a hard
time finding companionship historically
a lot of why attitudes have become more
comfortable towards online relationships
seems to be tied to society's increasing
positive view of social media use which
has grown to include nearly
three-quarters of all Internet users
there's also a perception now that
digital dating services might actually
offer more benefits than traditional
courtships
about 60% of Internet users stated
online dating was a good way to meet
people and a little over half when is
far to say that they're better because
they allow users to find potentially
closer matches by opening up their
playing fields this perception that
online dating sites and apps offer more
bang for their buck mmm is not an
incidental one as many services brand
themselves on their ability to make
superior matches through algorithms
based on user questionnaires there are
also many services which specialize in
connecting people of specified societal
sex such as those seeking members of
particular religion ethnicity or a
copious range of very specified and
important criteria and of course there
are also those services which allow the
less particulars
to choose based on simply a use
image and then swipe their finger with
attitudes towards online dating services
on the rise
coupled with the facts that nearly
two-thirds of all digital romantics are
successful in landing a date and that
11% of those married in the last 10
years met online and have lower rates of
divorce it seems apparent that the
dinner dates have become an antiquated
concept like jousting or optical drives
well don't exit out and update your
dating profiles too fast there are some
downsides to consider for instance
although married couples fare better
those in casual relationships which
started online tend to do worse
also half of survey daters felt
potential partners had misrepresented
themselves online which is pretty good
when we consider that 80% of users lie
but at least one factor of age height or
weight this is not to mention things
like the study which claimed dating
algorithms are completely bogus or
services which aren't necessarily as
focused on creating interpersonal
commitments as much as they are about
letting people get around them or rather
trying to let them in the end the
decision between online and traditional
dating is best left to each individual
if a person decides that having a go
through that stereotypical initial
dating phase is better than risking
their date not turning out to be exactly
who or what they've suggested or
vice-versa
they have my blessing because regardless
of the odds a person decides to play
dating will always remain a crapshoot
spice up your dating profile by using
lynda.com to up your photoshop skills in
order to improve your headshots or
