green or blue come within 10 feet of
your PC it's hard to deny that the last
few years have been a tough time for AMD
fans
aside from very minor incremental
updates we haven't seen any truly new
high-end desktop CPUs and team red is
still getting handily beaten in the GPU
market as well but hope springs eternal
and it looks like there's going to be
plenty for AMD fans to get excited about
in 2017 but is it enough to make AMD
competitive to make them more of a
mainstay among PC gamers and perhaps
most importantly to make them more of
that sweet paper that will allow them to
continue to innovate in the future to
answer let's first take a closer look at
what AMD is up to on the GPU side of
things today we've seen their focus
shift from trying to compete directly
against Nvidia at every segment of the
market to competing on value for the
money their new RX 480 priced at two
hundred US dollars was heavily marketed
as affordable VR at a lower price point
than Nvidia was willing to offer this
resulted in AMD shipping one and a half
million more discrete desktop GPUs in
the third quarter of 2016 than they did
in the same period in 2015 nearly a 70
percent increase but can AMD continue
this momentum right now there's nothing
current-gen on the high end from AMD
but that's set to change very soon with
Vega its next iteration of its North
Star themed GPUs which AMD has already
confirmed will be aimed at the high end
and enthusiast segments while they won't
be able to undercut Nvidia on price by
very much seeing as they essentially
contract with the same third-party fabs
to actually manufacture the chips
offering performance similar to a gtx
1070 or a 1080 at a slightly lower price
could help AMD a great deal especially
as it doesn't
actually cost the company as much more
as you might think
to make a higher tier GPU than a
mid-range or a low tier one which should
improve their profitability
although Vega GPUs will be using the
same GCN fourth generation architecture
as the RX 480
they'll be beefed up with nearly twice
as many stream processors which could
make the GPU Wars very interesting come
the first half of next year but what
will the AMD fan pair his or her shiny
new Vega GPU with well AMD's new Xen CPU
line-up will be released soon marking a
dramatic shift in AMD CPU philosophy as
well you see part of the reason AMD lost
so much ground in the CPU market over
the last five years is that they focused
more on core count meaning that you
could buy a six or an eight core AMD
chip for fairly cheap but performance
per core has lagged behind Intel often
significantly with high power
consumption being yet another cross to
bear and since single threaded
performance is typically more important
for gamers and even in multi-threaded
workloads past a certain number of cores
as we discovered recently AMD chips have
been a harder sell especially
considering that the AMD desktop
platform at least their high-end FX
chipsets haven't been updated in so long
that they lack native support for USB 3
ddr4 PCI Express 3.0 and nvme SSDs and
that's ignoring Intel specific standards
that are gaining traction like
Thunderbolt 3 most of that though
changes with Zen as AMD has publicly
announced that the focus is squarely on
per core performance along with lower
power consumption and early reports seem
to indicate that Zen might be pretty
close to intel's Broadwell family
performance wise and while Broadwell is
a couple of generations old at this
point keep
mind they didn't tell single-threaded
improvements from Broadwell to the
current generation kb lake have been
quite minimal as the focus for Intel has
been more on improving the platform
overall including graphics performance
so the vast majority of users might be
hard-pressed to notice too much of a
difference between a read computer and a
blue one so with that in mind
AMD pricing the chips correctly could
mean users might choose Zen instead of
paying the Intel tax for a performance
boost they might not notice or Intel
exclusive technologies like Thunderbolt
but of course AMD isn't just a mainstay
in desktop PCs how are things looking
for their laptop and console endeavors
well the good news for AMD is that not
only did their sales of laptop GPUs grow
in 2016 but AMD GPUs were also included
in all 15-inch models of the new Apple
MacBook Pro which is flying off the
shelves
for some reason of course a small kick
in the teeth is that AMD is no longer
the only player in the console graphics
market with Nintendo switching from a
custom AMD chip to an Nvidia SOC for its
new switch hybrid console back to the
original question though why am D has
some obvious hurdles to clear 2017 looks
like it's going to be a very exciting
year if you're all about hash tag better
read just don't get all political if you
have to call Amazon support when your
shipment is late if you're not a member
of Dollar Shave Club yet join today and
