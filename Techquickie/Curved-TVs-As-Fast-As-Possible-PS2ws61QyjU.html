at least if you asked someone who
manufactures TVs as a techie with my
journalism hat on I was interested in
the technology behind it oled displays
are thin and they're light they offer
fast response times amazing black levels
better energy efficient and now they're
able to be curved this unlocks amazing
new form factors for devices with
screens you can wrap around your wrist
and bed as a heads-up display on a
windshield or helmet and so much more
unfortunately when it was time to put my
general consumer who has to actually
spend money on this stuff hat on I
concluded that at least in their current
form curve display TVs leave a lot to be
desired there are a lot of theoretical
benefits being promoted by marketing
folks including better immersion and
more natural viewing experience with
references being made to other
situations where curved screens are
already used most notably in projection
movie theaters the issue with this is
that the benefits of curved displays and
theaters that is to say pincushion
reduction improve brightness uniformity
and the ability to have an image wrap
around the viewer as it fills up a huge
portion of their field of view none of
this has anything to do with a 55 inch
non projection TV that's going to sit in
your living room there is some promotion
of curved screen technology that might
have some basis in reality that it
reduces eye fatigue by ensuring every
part of the screen is an equal distance
from the viewers eye meaning there is no
need to refocus when looking from one
part of the screen to the other but even
that claim has some serious problems
with the current product offerings in
order for the eye to be an equal
distance from every part of the panel
you would have to be sitting in exactly
the sweet spot not only dead center in
front of the TV but also at the correct
distance so you're in the middle of the
theoretical circle that would be formed
by the curvature of your TV
Dennis Berger from home tech tel looked
at one of LG's curved TVs and determined
you would have to be 11 feet from it for
the positioning to be optimal I mean I
guess you could sit there but what if
you wanted to watch a movie with a group
of friends someone is going to get the
short straw and end up with a
picture that's not only not better than
a flat TV but actually distorted and
worse and the real-world drawbacks only
start with the required exact seating
position for a non destroyed image they
they don't wall mount for now and they
are extremely expensive compared to flat
alternatives the worst part of all this
is that both LG and Samsung were already
showing off 21 by 9 aspect ratio a
hundred plus inch ultra HD curb screens
that genuinely made the technology
compelling as if to say look we know
it's pointless right now but just bear
with us for a couple of years while we
bring this to market this will curve
around you and be more immersive but
it's just too big of a change for us to
do all at once
