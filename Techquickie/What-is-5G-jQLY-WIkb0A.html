those diehards who's first in line at
the Apple store it always seems to feel
like no matter what kind of mobile
technology that you have in your pocket
it quickly becomes yesterday's news and
that may never be more evident than
right now as telecommunications
providers worldwide are working on 5g
which might be just as big of a deal as
when we marveled at being able to look
at full-fat webpages on tiny phone
screens oh come on Luke another G just
after LTE became super widespread well
while it's admittedly a bit tricky to
keep up with all the freaking different
wireless standards and the g's and what
they all mean and all that kind of stuff
which you can learn more about up here
the industry is hoping that 5g will be
good enough to end constant talk of what
the next G is good luck with that and
we'll hopefully only need incremental
improvements over time kind of how
Windows 10 does that and they plan on
updating forever see how that goes so
what the heck is supposed to be so
special about 5g anyway well it's being
centered around the idea that the
Internet of Things that is connected
devices that enable self-driving cars
automated homes and more will become
very important in the near future and
that mobile data networks will need to
be very robust to handle it all with
wearables appliances vehicles mobile AR
and VR devices and so on expected to
push so much traffic through mobile data
networks with some devices needing as
many as multiple gigabytes per second we
will need not only faster overall speeds
but also lower latency imagine if your
self-driving car took half a second too
long to make a critical turn and
suddenly you've got a huge dent in your
fender or more frightening lis in your
body
5g however is not only aiming to reduce
latency to as low as one millisecond to
allow real-time operation of important
devices it also boasts a theoretical
maximum speed of 20 gigabits per second
way faster than the quickest LTE
networks today or
in Google Fiber connections of course
this is a theoretical maximum and it
looks like the bare minimum for the
average user will be about a hundred
megabits so again this is still quite a
bit faster than real-world performance
of many LTE deployments part of this
awesomeness is due to 5 G's usage of
higher frequency waves which also gives
it a much greater capacity for theme
forming meaning signals can be focused
on to areas where there's more data
traffic compared to existing cellular
antennas many of which are just
omnidirectional and just kind of send
signals out without regard for where
usage is actually concentrated which is
not good
combine that with massive MIMO which
will allow many users to share the same
connection simultaneously with multiple
antennas on a transmitter similar to the
newer mu-mimo networks for home Wi-Fi
connections and you'll have a network
that is not only quicker but also has
better throughput so the quickly growing
number of things connected to the mobile
Internet don't become bottleneck in fact
the industry is hoping to have a million
devices supported per square kilometer
possibly meaning no more delays at
places like concerts conventions or
sporting events of course this is a very
ambitious project so it's not available
quite yet current projections have 5g
hitting the market sometime in 2019 with
it becoming widespread around 2025 since
providers not only are trying to make 5g
a more uniform standards than what
exists today to ensure better
compatibility around the world but they
also need time to build more
infrastructure that infrastructure would
include signal boosters since 5 G's
shorter wavelength means it's more prone
to signal degradation across great
distances but even though most of us
will have to wait awhile to experience
5g trials are already underway in a few
places in the United States and small
scale deployments are expected at the
2018 and 2020 Olympics to give attendees
an early look at the tech before it
reaches the mainstream
so in summary don't chunk your LTE phone
just yet but don't be surprised if in a
few years whatever you're carrying in
your pocket ends up putting your home
internet connection to shame tunnel bear
VPN lets you turn all to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as if
you are in that different country they
have easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC
and Mac and also have a Chrome extension
so that it's made for you just choose a
country in the app turn tunnel bear on
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
when you turn to all bear on 2 things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
can show up as if you're in said
different country they also have a top
rated privacy policy and do not log user
activity you can try out tunnel bear VPN
with 500 megabits of free data and with
no credit card required and if you do
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear
comm slash Linus alright guys if you
liked it like it if you just liked it
dislike it check out two channels super
fun because I soon I'm going to be on
there actually which I haven't really
been on there much lately and also don't
forget to subscribe and follow because
those are good things to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
