the internet so the constant advances
over the last few years and the ability
to collect massive amounts of personal
data about me have not really sat that
well but is the industry's favorite big
buzzword right now big data all bad or
are we painting and otherwise
potentially very useful tool for the
advancement of society in a bad light
because of one aspect of it first let's
discuss what Big Data actually is there
are many wildly different definitions of
Big Data for example while we
individuals might define it as an
intrusive threat to our society and the
overall anonymity of the Internet
corporations might see it as a
revolution in data processing and
computing but there are at least a few
things that everyone can agree on
wikipedia defines Big Data as any
collection of datasets so large and
complex that it becomes difficult to
process using on-hand database
management tools or traditional data
processing applications I mean that
doesn't sound so threatening right so
essentially Big Data is just a
collection of data so large that each
individual becomes an insignificant
number where whoever is in possession of
the data often actually can't make
meaningful conclusions about any one
person from it and many times actually
the term Big Data is misused it's turned
into a marketing buzzword with software
and IT companies stating that their
systems are running full of challenges
that Big Data provides which is a great
way to say absolutely nothing about the
product while still managing to seem
important or relevant in the current
market on top of that as much as many of
you guys might not like to hear this
privacy advocates tend to misuse the
term as well they act as though Big Data
only describes user data compiled by
sites and services when Big Data
actually encompasses many more types of
data like scientific and business
datasets for example meteorological data
from weather stations and market data
from financial exchanges all around the
world
now before you burn me at the stake for
being a secret NSA operative for
defending the idea of big data I mean
how sniffing I could afford miles of
Lambo right certainly not from that
YouTube money let's chat a little bit
about when
is an issue websites that collect and
store data about their users for
marketing purposes can keep a massive
amount of your personal information on
hand for an indefinite period of time
and most of the time the data is not as
well secured as they'd like for you to
believe her personally I'd like to
believe it was in addition to that even
deleting this information from public
view often has no impact on their
ability to store it on their servers so
yes it's possible that that one
embarrassing picture of you from 2008
will live on in the depths of Facebook
servers forever this coupled with the
massive amount of information sharing
voluntary or otherwise and data
interception that agencies like the NSA
carry out means that your regional
government or I mean really any other
types of nefarious characters could
potentially have every move you've made
online on file now for me personally
even though I don't do anything illegal
or even questionably legal on the
Internet
if someone were to go through every bit
of information from the years that I've
been using it and cherry-pick certain
things to paint me in a negative light
I'm sure I could end up looking like a
pretty bad dude so let's make a quick
connection here to solidify the ideas
that we've discussed torrenting is
something that we all know can have an
extremely positive impact on the world
it's one of me greatest forms of
information sharing but whenever we hear
anything about torrenting the topic
revolves around piracy and its other
unsightly aspects discussion about big
data is quite similar it's not in itself
a bad thing it's a driving force for a
lot of great innovations in the science
technology and medicine and yet for the
most part we only hear about the
negatives the main one being the lack of
control that we have over our online
data and the amount of control that
large corporate entities do have over it
so don't blame Big Data for creating the
need to protect your privacy online
blame the companies who collect store
and most importantly use it
inappropriately speaking of blame you
know whose fault it is that we have the
resources to make this great episode of
fast as possible Coolermaster so a big
thanks to them for sponsoring us and if
you guys have a PC that isn't run
as well as it could maybe because of
overheating or maybe it doesn't have

coolers cases power supplies and even
mobile accessories they're good guys and
we really appreciate their support up in
here anyway guys that's it thanks for
