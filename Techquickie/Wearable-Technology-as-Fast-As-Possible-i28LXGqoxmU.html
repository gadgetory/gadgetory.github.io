hearing lately about wearable technology
are just wearables do wearable devices
have real potential to be
paradigm-shifting gadgets or is it just
the same stuff we've seen before
strapped to some part of your Anatomy
well in my mind it is the paradigm
shifting one so let's take a look at
some of the key differences between this
developing product category and the
better established one that came before
it so it's not like a processor Ram a
screen and a Bluetooth module packed
into something are really anything new
so the big change here then is
form-factor wearables need to be small
enough to be worn and not get in the way
yet rugged enough to live their lives
outside the protective cushion of our
pocket or purse while providing adequate
battery life for all day operation oh
and being stylish too I mean it's not
like consumers ask for much do they so
how our manufacturer is delivering on
this whole wearable idea well two of the
most well known early wearables are the
Samsung Galaxy gear a watch and Google
glass a well blast
although these products did have some
useful features so seeing emails and
texts at a glance and even replying to
them with voice searching for
information and getting directions with
a little screen that only you can see
taking photos from your wrist or from
your head James Bond style there
admittedly hasn't been a ton of
long-term enthusiasm for either of them
and you're probably asking yourself well
gee why not surely everyone wants to
walk around looking like Geordi LaForge
or Turanga Leela right well in my mind
these devices are yet another example of
stuff that wasn't quite ready for anyone
but the early adopter enthusiasts folks
I mean remember modern smart devices are
just the latest in a long line of
attempts to get people to wear gizmos
every day all need to be foiled each
time by social pressure like the
Bluetooth headpiece of the mm that
caused passers-by to assume that mr.
3-piece executive finally had his
breakdown or a lack of compelling enough
functionality to outweigh the
inconvenience of yet another doodad to
strap on in the morning like the
calculator watches of the 80s but to me
the reason this time is different is
because the technology is mature
to almost the point where wearables can
add more convenience to your life than
they take away and because our
electronic devices do so much to improve
our lives everyday
they've become practically ubiquitous so
the use of one on the street doesn't
instantly turn you into a Dorcas these
two things open up a whole lot of new
possibilities that combined with solid
marketing for the devices might just get
wearable tech into the mainstream this
time but once it gets there what's it
gonna look like well here are some
examples Microsoft is working on taking
augmented reality to the next level with
a wearable pair of goggles that it calls
hololens which will project applications
and data onto your actual physical
surroundings in the form of a hologram
hololens goes beyond the capabilities of
other smart glasses we've seen to
actually let you interact with your 3d
canvas for design work productivity
communication and even gaming and
there's been a lot of action in the
wearable world geared towards athletics
and fitness for simple lifestyle
improvements there are comfortable bands
that monitor useful stuff like burned
calories steps taken and distance
traveled while biking jogging and
otherwise going about your day as well
as your sleep habits by the way and if
you're into more extreme stuff let's say
you're a skier for example Oakley's
recon goggles will display your current
speed as well as your position on the
trail while also connecting to your
smartphone and showing any missed
notifications on a heads-up display
pretty freaking cool stuff and it's only
just the beginning and if you guys
