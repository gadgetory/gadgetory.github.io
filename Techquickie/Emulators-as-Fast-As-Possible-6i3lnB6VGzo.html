Gameboy emulation which would allow
folks to have the Gameboy experience on
devices that range from their mobile
phones all the way to the displays on
the backs of the seats in front of them
on trains and airplanes cool right wait
hold on a minute Linus what exactly is
emulation are they going to cut open all
those seats and stuff game boys inside
where will they get so many game boys
are they going to try to take mine whoa
whoa hold on slow down there turbo they
don't need actual game boys in fact
that's exactly the point of an emulator
to use software combined with high speed
or specialized hardware to effectively
fake the functionality of another piece
of hardware for the purpose of running
or debugging programs so that Gameboy
emulator is just a software program that
runs on hardware that is nothing like an
actual Gameboy but is able to imitate
its functionality so the game software
itself never knows it's not running on a
real Gameboy need hey yeah - that sounds
super awesome so can I emulate the Titan
supercomputer on like my phone and run
complex weather simulations in my pocket
no even with intimate knowledge of how a
device and the software it runs works
the non-specialized processing power
required to fake a given functionality
purely in software especially one for
which highly specialized purpose-built
hardware has been developed is often an
order of magnitude greater than the
original or more and in many cases
especially where emulation is being used
to preserve the gaming experiences of
old games or software that wouldn't
otherwise run on modern computers a fair
bit of brute forcing it is required to
achieve sufficient performance ok Linus
sweet then so I can run like Odell Lake
on my alien we're riveting I'm glad you
made a video about this actually
emulation is not just for old stuff it's
often used in the design of future
products as well one of my favorite
examples of this is the recurring
scandal of oh my goodness the game
console maker X was using a PC to run
their demos at video game convention why
well of course they were
it's called a development kit imagine a
world where a new game console came out
and then you had to wait the typical two
to three years that a triple-a game
takes before you can actually play
anything on it programmers use dev kits
often developed internally to write code
for systems that aren't actually
finished being designed yet so that once
the hardware is finalized there's
already software for it and programmable
hardware like a modern video game
console is just one example of this it
can be even more useful in the design of
specialized hardware called an embedded
system where the hardware and software
need to work tightly together to reduce
power consumption and design complexity
keeping costs low emulation of the
hardware allows faster testing of
software which allows faster refinement
of the hardware multiple cycles of which
can occur without ever actually
physically manufacturing anything
efficient right so there you have it
emulation has the advantages of
flexibility potentially improved
functionality anti-aliasing add-ons for
PlayStation 1 games anyone and when done
well lower hardware costs but with the
drawbacks of sometimes imperfect
compatibility and usually much higher
processing power requirements speaking
of power requirements Coolermaster is
our sponsor for today they make cases
fans all-in-one liquid coolers air
coolers peripherals like that Nova Touch
tkl that people keep asking about in the
videos of RO my other channel lines tech
tips and of course great quality power
supplies if you were interested in
something like a holiday gift for the
geek in your life maybe give them a
little prod hey Dawg you know is your
CPU running a little bit too hot you
need a new power supply for that new
graphics card that you asked your
grandma for well you know maybe we could
arrange for you to you know get the
whole bundle and have linking brain
cooling master peasy yes I don't know
Nick's notes in here are terrible Nick
your notes on the the video integration
are terrible but the last couple things
that are in there is at the nekton 240m
which is a cooler that we actually
checked out recently on the Linus tech
tips Channel is a great value for
someone looking for an all-in-one liquid
cooler for their CPU and
if you're not necessarily looking to buy
something but you just enjoy learning I
mean you're watching fast as possible so
you probably do then you can check out
their Coolermaster University site which
will be linked in the video description
where they've got some cool information
about cool things like coolers thanks
for watching guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you just liked it
leave a comment if you thought that my
cool joke was not very cool just awful
or if you have suggestions for future
fast as possible episodes just like this
