video card you can't afford or how great
the last episode of tech wiki was have
you wondered what happens I mean sure we
all know that it goes out onto the
internet but much like flushing a toilet
most people don't know exactly what
happens to their chunks of data after
they post something so where exactly
does it all go well to understand the
answer to this question it might help to
keep in mind that the Internet is not
owned or even governed by any one group
of people I said not owned by any one
group of people but rather it works as a
distributed system made up of lots of
smaller computer networks owned by
various ISPs universities governments
and other organizations that are linked
together through what are called peering
agreements but Lynas hold on a second if
no one's really running the internet
then how does it stay working do we even
know where it goes
there are organizations that help
coordinate and direct Internet traffic
so that compatibility is maintained
everywhere from Ottawa to Oman probably
the most well-known of these groups is
ICANN which maps IP addresses to
Internet domain names so when you punch
in let's say Linus tech tips comm and
your web browser that actually isn't
enough information for your computer to
know what website to show you so what
happens is your ISP or Internet service
provider directs it to a DNS server
which matches what you typed to the IP
address that corresponds to it so you
can connect and keep consuming the
awesome videos we create but once you do
that then how does the content itself
get to your PC one of the Internet's
most defining features is that it is
packet-switched meaning that all data is
broken up into little well packets and
then reassembled once it arrives at your
computer and while the idea of
shattering and then reassembling
something every time you need to move it
won't make much sense for things like oh
I don't know human arms the advantage of
this approach for computer data is that
it allows each packet to take the most
efficient route possible so if everyone
in the town next to you where your
traffic would have known
been routed through start streaming Game
of Thrones and exactly the same frickin
time congesting any nearby nodes causing
some of your much more important My
Little Pony packets to slow down the
remaining ones can be easily and
dynamically rerouted via another path
even mid file so your internet speeds
stay high and because packets contain in
addition to the actual content
identification information that ensures
they are being sent to the right place
and that they can be properly recombined
later on
normally none of the data ends up as a
corrupted jumbled mess either speaking
of jumbled messes if you've ever tried
to do something as simple as copy a file
to an external hard drive on a Mac and
then carry it over to a PC and open it
you're probably wondering how users on
different operating systems on different
machines from different parts of the
world all manage to use the same
internet standards bodies come to the
rescue here again they make sure that
the same fundamental languages and
technologies are used throughout the
globe including w3c which is in charge
of things like HTML and CSS the
languages that your web browser will
interpret into something your computer
can understand so I hope this helped
give you some idea how the world pulls
together without a single guiding force
to give us this awesome tool for arguing
on Twitter and reading half-baked
political opinions speaking of things on
the internet that are way better than
arguing on Twitter fresh books it's
designed for freelance workers or small
businesses and the whole idea behind it
is that instead of spending all of your
time drawing up invoices and logging
your hours as you move about from place
to place working on jobs you spend it
doing jobs and getting paid it's an
online tool to allow you to get your
accounting done quickly while you're on
the go
versus having to sit at your computer
every night it even allows your clients
to pay you online via credit card it's
just like beep beep boop send that
invoice over to them and get paid and I
can tell you as a small business owner
half of the battle is actually getting
the invoice sent out to the client and
then the other half is getting them to
actually pay the whole other thing
anyway it shows the full history of
every
voice allows you to check at the client
is viewed the invoice which is another
really handy tool oh I didn't get that
Oh actually you did and I guess that's
pretty much it so if you're your own
boss then the idea behind FreshBooks is
you should be using stuff that makes you
feel like a boss and it's an easy way of
doing stuff online instead of doing
stuff the old traditional way so head
