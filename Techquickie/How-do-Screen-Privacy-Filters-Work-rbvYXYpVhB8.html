that their internet activity is being
constantly mind or spied on by the NSA
their employer or their Internet service
provider and while some of these
concerns might be very well founded it's
important to not forget the low-tech but
no less effective method of snooping
that is watching directly over your
shoulder and while this might sound a
little silly many of us have to deal
with this when we're using our computers
or devices in environments where we
can't get a lot of privacy roommates
nosy co-workers or that weirdly sweaty
person next to you on your economy-class
flight can all too often see what's
happening on your screen way too easily
I mean better viewing angles is like a
selling point right this is where a
privacy filter can be a great investment
the basic idea behind them is to
severely restrict viewing angles to the
point where you essentially have to be
looking at the screen dead-on
in order to see it you've probably seen
them at the bank if you've ever tried to
peek at your account balance while the
teller is off getting your cash but how
do they work well think of a window in
your house with vertical blinds if you
don't have one pretend you do if you
turn them so they're completely open you
can see outside fairly easily but if you
stand off to the side the surface area
of the blinds will obscure the windows
enough to where you can barely see past
them at all well privacy filters work
similarly just on a much much smaller
scale some manufacturers refer to their
technology as micro louver as they use
the thinness of each individual blind as
a selling point
the thinner the blinds the more light
can pass through for the intended user a
typical filter can contain thousands of
these blinds to enhance privacy while
still making the screen relatively easy
to see for whoever's right in front of
it typically the filter will start to
block out screen contents once someone
is looking at the display from an angle
of about 30 degrees now although most
people buy these filters as an after
mark
get add-on for their computer or monitor
we're actually starting to see screens
with the technology built in including
and this is pretty cool the ability to
turn the filter on or off because even
from the front a privacy filter does
make the screen a little harder to see
just like looking out a window through
completely open blinds still isn't the
same as having a window with nothing at
all on it so this is a welcome change if
you've ever wanted to watch a movie with
the I don't know not so sweaty neighbor
on the plane which is cool but what if
you're doing some super important like
James Bond level stuff on your computer
where a standard privacy filter just
won't cut it there's actually a way to
make your screen appear blank to anyone
who isn't wearing a special pair of
glasses you see modern LCD screens use
polarizing filters to orient the light
waves a certain way so that they come
out of the screen is actually useful
images or text without that filter light
would just come out of the monitor like
blood it would be this incoherent
mixture and end up appearing just plain
white so some intrepid do-it-yourselfers
have created their own privacy monitors
by opening up their displays removing
the polarizing filter and then cutting
out pieces of it small enough to fit
into eye glass frames the result is that
you have a monitor that will always look
plain white unless you're wearing the
special specs which will reveal what's
on screen we actually even have a
tutorial on how to do this on our other
channel right about here and while you
shouldn't do this on a screen that
you're using for gaming or other tasks
where visual quality really matters it's
perfect if you're working on a
super-secret business proposal have
family members that can't keep their
eyes off your monitor or just don't want
your boss knowing what you're really
doing during work hours if you've been
watching tech quickie for any reasonable
period of time you've probably heard of
Dollar Shave Club but what is possible
that you don't know is that Dollar Shave
Club not only has great razors available

products more face products I mean
technically a razor sort of a face
product but they also have their doctor
Carver shave butter as well as their
aftershave and even products for your
butt so everything all the way from the
top of your head to the it's not quite
really quite the bottom of your bottom
but it's certainly like the sort of
bottom s part of your bottom can look
and smell like a million bucks
