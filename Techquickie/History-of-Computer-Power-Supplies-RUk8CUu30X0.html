pretty straightforward unless you're
going for a really specific aesthetic
get an ATX power supply which by the way
are compatible with ATX micro ATX and
mini ITX motherboards all you gotta do
is make sure it isn't some kind of
bargain-basement no-name unit that will
explode when you try and run Crysis and
that has enough wattage to power your
rig and with high-end graphics cards
getting more and more power efficient
these days and those are usually the
most power hungry part of a computer
getting a PSU that sufficiently powerful
is becoming less and less important by
the day but it wasn't always as easy as
just slotting in the first thing you
could find and carrying on with your
computing in fact the power supply that
came with the original IBM PC only
provided 64 watts of power pushed a
whopping 5 volts through the CPU which
would fry any modern consumer grade
processor and forget about fancy
features like standby err soft reset
old-school power supplies only had a
hard power switch so everything was
either fully on or fully off all the
time with that said though the really
difficult thing about these older power
supplies was there physical layouts even
in the era of 80 power supplies the
predecessor to ATX that lasted from 1984
until the late 90s there were not only
multiple different form factors such as
baby 80 xt and some weird thing that
worked with ps2 but some systems even
had switches soldered directly to the
computer case out of the power supplies
so good luck replacing your PSU if it
suddenly fizzled out further adding to
the frustration of technicians and
tinkerers everywhere and then as if that
weren't enough there wasn't even one
uniform standard for the actual pin outs
onto the motherboard amongst these
different form factors I mean the power
supply scene was basically chaos but the
ATX standard saved us from an eternal
quagmire of proprietary form factors
when it was introduced in 1995 by Intel
especially as it actually did a lot more
than just make our power supplies mostly
the same size
in fact the ATX standard made things
much easier for home PC builders as well
as small shop owners who wanted to build
or offer something different than what
the IBM's of the world were cranking out
and not only did it make things easier
having just one standard made things
cheaper improving competition throughout
the industry and generally speaking
higher quality as well as a single
standard forced manufacturers to
innovate and improve on quality rather
than focusing their efforts on trapping
us in to proprietary vil and that's
exactly what happened assuming of course
you're buying from a reputable brand ATX
power supplies have evolved they've come
in large and small varieties with both
80 and 120 millimeter fans yet they're
still ATX compliant and can fit in a
wide variety of cases combine that with
improved efficiency in recent years as
we've seen with the 80 plus rating
system and ATX has had fantastic staying
power in spite of several companies
trying to replace it throughout the
years such as an tech with their CPX
design a few years back and even Intel
who tried to replace their own standard
with the now-defunct BT X form factor
ATX also brought us familiar things that
we now take for granted like the 20 and
then later 24 pin connector which serves
as the primary power delivery for pretty
much all modern pcs but the wires that
connect to the motherboard to enable
smart power management and a greater
emphasis on 12-volt power delivery you
see older power supplies often delivered
most of their power on the 5 volt rail
with many actual sensitive components
directly connected to it these days the
smaller transistors on parts like CPUs
and graphics cards play much more nicely
with lower voltages immediately think
about overclocking your CPU putting 2
volts
you might kill it what but on the flip
side as computer components have become
faster and more powerful they actually
need even more current that's the amount
of electricity being sent through the
chip so modern power supplies have more
power on the 12 volt rail and then it
gets converted to lower voltages for the
many different components by voltage
regulator modules or VR ends and those
will be present on the motherboard or on
the graphics card itself this way the
components can operate at a safe voltage
and still get enough current from the
higher capacity 12 volt rail ATX has
also changed with the times in other
ways introducing PCI Express power
connectors as graphics cards went from
sipping electricity to becoming the most
power hungry component in a PC a further
testament to its staying power when many
other computer standards have been put
out to pasture within its lifetime but
that doesn't mean then that all modern
power supplies use the exact ATX form
factor
there are also derivative form factors
such as SFX which is essentially
identical to ATX electrically and in
fact interoperable with ATX motherboards
but a heck of a lot smaller making them
popular for things like super small mini
ITX builds in servers you'll find power
supplies that have a couple of EPS
connectors so EPS standard power
supplies which actually is kind of funny
because that eight pin CPU power
connector ended up making its way into
desktops as well and finally there are
things like tf-x for slim tower systems
or I mean they still do exist the
dreaded proprietary power supply
fortunately for you though the PC DIY
enthusiast most of those power supplies
are nearly irrelevant unless of course
you find yourself working for a YouTube
channel where you have to solder
connectors on weird power supplies you
found in a scrap heap somewhere in order
to get a computer to boot at the last
moment in a competition
say for example speaking of getting
things done in just a moment
Braintree pane
my friends Braintree is the way to
achieve easy mobile payments maybe
you're working on the next goober Airbnb
or github well if you are why not use
