which you prefer between AMD or Intel
right wrong we do not shop by brand we
shop by what delivers us the best
performance features and quality for the
money we're spending and just to make
this crystal clear AMD and Intel both
make extremely high quality micro
processors so let's move on to that
other stuff step one if you already have
your PC and you're upgrading is to make
sure you're shopping for CPUs that
actually fit in the frakking motherboard
that you're planning to use don't feel
bad about needing to look it up Intel
for example maintains current generation
products across two different physical
sockets at any given time and often has
a trailing older socket along with more
complex electrical and compatibilities
so go ahead ask a friend next up is to
look at what delivers more bang for your
buck within your target budget
performance used to be simple the
younger viewers may be surprised to hear
that not only did AMD and Intel CPUs
used to perform the same clock for clock
but they even fit into the same
motherboards at one point comparisons
were easy whoever had the faster clock
speed was faster and the megahertz war
was born then everything started
changing because the megahertz or
gigahertz or frequency of a CPU became
no longer any more meaningful than
gauging the performance of a car by how
many rpms the engine spins at I mean
yeah it's it's a useful metric somewhat
but only if we have other information at
the same time so let's talk about this
other information number one we need to
know how much work a CPU can perform
with each of those cycles how many
instructions per clock it can perform
its CPU a run at two gigahertz and did
one instruction per cycle and CPU B ran
at one gigahertz into two instructions
per cycle then they actually do the
exact same amount of work so the only
way to measure which one is really
better is by running real-world tests
but just like putting a car on a dyno
and measuring peak horsepower running
one test or one benchmark isn't the
be-all and end-all of CPU performance
either modern CPUs have multiple
processing cores and signed them and
while some benchmarks will measure the
speed of a single-core with more power
redirected to it in a turbo mode other
benchmarks will tell us more about how
that CPU behaves with that heavier load
that's spread across all the processing
course a multi-threaded test and other
tests will tell us you know if the CPU
has enough cash to keep up with a
particular workload in a perfect world
you want to find websites that test the
exact applications you're using most
frequently so you know exactly what
you're getting and that's the only way
to figure it out but let's continue the
car analogy for some people it isn't
just about how fast you go what about
creature comforts like air conditioning
and cruise control CPU reviews from
reputable sites like tech report
hardware Cox and PC perspective we'll
give you a rundown of other important
information like power consumption heat
output security features maximum
supported memory expected overclocking
limits for tweakers and so much more and
once you've got all of that information
you are ready to make a non fanboy
tastic decision about what gives you the
best value for your money before
plunking down your hard earned cash ola
but if all that sounded like way too
much working at this point you're just
kind of sitting here going oh I can't
believe I'm watching this
not to worry head over to Linus tech
tips comm and post asking for a
recommendation in the CPU section I
personally guarantee you'll get the help
you need we've got an awesome community
over there speaking of awesome
communities audible.com is tech quickies
longest-running sponsor and without our
community members heading over to
audible.com slash tech quickie when they
get a hankering for an audio book well I
bet they wouldn't want to do that
anymore an audible membership is worth
checking out for a few reasons guys
number one is that by signing up for the
monthly service you get their great
listen guarantee for hassle-free
exchanges in case you pick up my life as
a white trash zombie by Dianne Roland
and you meant to get Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies by Jane Austen don't worry
you can exchange it and the other big
one for me is that aside from the one
audio book included per month you get a
discount on additional ones as part of
your membership what week there's more
hold on the first one is free with the
new membership so head over to
audible.com slash tech quickie and check
it out today you'll love it and if you
don't you can cancel the membership with
no hassle anyway that's yet another
benefits
I threw in that other benefit so what
have you got to lose except that
disgusting growth on your forehead Joe
don't have one that's what I thought
then I guess there's no excuse guys
thank you for checking out this episode
of fast as possible like and share it if
you liked it dislike it if you put it
just totally suck and leave a comment
suggesting future episodes of fast as
possible and don't forget to subscribe
so that you don't miss the episodes as
fast as possible that you suggest now
I'm going to just move fast wildly for a
little bit to wreak havoc on my editors
who are trying to green-screen this ha I
think we're done here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
