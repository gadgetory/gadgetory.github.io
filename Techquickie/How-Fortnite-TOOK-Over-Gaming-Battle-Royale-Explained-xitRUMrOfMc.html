chances are you've at least heard of
player unknowns battlegrounds or pub G
and fortnight even if it was just from
googling wTF is the floss dance but how
exactly did these games come from
seemingly nowhere two absolutely
dominating the gaming market is there
something that they're giving us that
other titles just aren't well as it
turns out the answer appears to be yes
or at least that was the case when these
games first hit the scene you see both
pub G and fortnight are excellent
examples of the Battle Royale game genre
which has a number of hallmarks that
distinguish them from other shooter
titles the basic premise is this a whole
bunch of players usually fifty to a
hundred right now with future games
claiming support for up to a thousand
get dropped into an arena with no or
minimal supplies or weapons items are
scattered randomly throughout the map
and over time the map shrinks forcing
the remaining players into a smaller and
smaller area with anyone caught outside
of the safe zone getting killed the last
player or squad alive is declared the
winner sounds pretty simple but many
other shooters didn't offer this kind of
open exploratory free-flowing gameplay
when pub G considered to be the genres
defining title hit the scene in 2017
which is kind of funny because the game
wasn't even built from scratch instead a
player who went by the handle player
unknown hence the name developed it as a
mod for ARMA 2 / dayz taking inspiration
from a year 2000 Japanese film called
you guessed it Battle Royale the fact
that pub G was a mod for an already
popular game gave it instant exposure
and popularity it presented a fresh
twist on the shoot-'em-up genre that had
been dominated by the Call of Duty
series and its clones for about a decade
by that point oh and it also didn't hurt
that the wildly popular Hunger Games
film series sparked interest in games
that offered a similar style of combat
but what exactly makes battle royale
games so different from other shooters
well part of it is the strong sense of
player freedom in that you're just
fighting other individual players on a
large open map which gives lots of
leeway for different players to play the
game their way so you don't all have to
go after this control point instead some
people might choose to aggressively try
to blow away the competition while
others might prefer to hide away until
everyone else is dead regardless there's
less of a feeling like you're on Rails
the randomness of item and weapon
distribution also helps the game feel
more accessible with a number of other
popular shooters there's often this
sense that you've got to be an
incredibly good crack shot in order to
enjoy the game at all but the more
random somewhat less complex nature of
pub gian fortnight have made the game
more appealing to novices yet with
strategy and skill with a weapon you're
still rewarded enough to appeal to the
more hardcore sex of the gaming
community furthermore the matches
themselves also tend to end fairly
quickly so there isn't a huge time
investment required in an age when all
of us are busy and have short attention
spans something that has actually led
popular battle royale developers to make
their games available on mobile devices
with by the way a great deal of success
on the subject of accessibility lots of
the popular shooters on the market were
expensive triple-a titles when pub G hit
the scene but pub G was significantly
cheaper with fortnight and more recently
apex Legends both adopting the
free-to-play model generating their
revenue from micro transactions also of
course we'd be remiss if we didn't
mention the social aspect of the game
the fast pace elements of surprise and
the fact that it's rather entertaining
to watch a bunch of contestants fight it
out until one is left standing makes
games like pub G &amp;amp; fortnight engaging to
watch so it's no surprise then battle
royale games are very popular with
streamers as well as in the eSports
community not to be left out in the cold
other shooter franchises like Cod have
taken note of this and added battle
royale modes to one of their games and
EA as well has recently gotten in on the
action with the
or mentioned incredibly popular apex
legends with the way things are going
though I wonder how long it's gonna take
for us to go down the same path as MOBAs
where the battle royale space become so
hopelessly crowded that we get to the
point where developers are literally
fighting it out for market share like a
bunch of kids shanking each other at the
cornucopia
