say well I made a video about in videos
SLI so go watch that this is the same
except your cards from AMD we call it
crossfire but that would be lazy and we
strive for maximum professional istic
ality around here and truthfully it's
not that simple anyway there are some
critical differences between SLI and
crossfire that I believe demonstrate a
fundamental difference in philosophy
between AMD and NVIDIA but first the
basics both technologies are pretty much
a way to utilize more than one graphics
card working in tandem in your PC to
achieve next-gen class performance that
wouldn't otherwise be available with the
current technology due to power thermal
or other limitations think of it kind of
like if you could buy two Xbox ones bolt
them together and actually run your
games at 1080p up burn anyway they both
work with anywhere from two to three or
even four compatible cards in one system
and perform their best at high
resolutions with graphically demanding
games they also both dramatically
increase the power consumption and heat
output of your computer system without
having a proportional impact on the
performance you'll get in games in fact
another thing they share in common is
that if the game doesn't have a profile
implemented they may not improve
performance at all but with that said if
you're looking for an experience that
simply isn't available today by other
means like butter smooth 4k or 1080p
surround gaming then you're likely one
of the folks that the solution was
designed for all right so a moment ago I
mentioned compatible cards this is
differentiation point number one for AMD
well NVIDIA allows mix and matching of
vendors and clock speeds you can SLI an
EVGA reference card with an asus
overclocked one they require you to use
exactly the same graphics processor with
the same memory configuration AMD on the
other hand has pretty loosey-goosey
you can mix vendors clock speeds Ram
amounts and even the graphics processor
as long as the cards are within the same
arc
textual family so for example a 79-73
gig card can cross fire with a 7950 with
three gig or even an r9 280x with six
gigs of ram because they're all based on
that same GPU differentiation point
number two for AMD is cost nvidia
requires sli certification for your
cards to recognize your system as
compatible and activate their
wonder-twin powers for that in-video
requires the qualifying PCI Express
slots to run at 8 X minimum even though
these days a 4 X PCIe gen3 slot is
plenty for pretty much any graphics card
and they require the board manufacturer
to pay a licensing fee you can find AMD
crossfire compatibility on product pages
for like business class boards basically
anything goes as long as it's got a
couple of PCI Express 16x physical slots
differentiation point number 3 is
something that's actually still a
work-in-progress for AMD since the
beginning of dual GPU solutions with
voodoo sli there's been some kind of
connector attaching the cards with AMD
r9 290 series cards and presumably
future ones as well all communication
between the cards is done over the PCI
Express bus it's a higher bandwidth
cleaner-looking solution to the problem
of how these cards can sync data with
each other at high speed when they're
working together finally differentiation
point number 4 is that AMD allows their
cards their low-end cards to run in
crossfire with the onboard graphics of
their AP use which are CPUs that have
strong onboard graphics components
although the solution still needs some
work to be something that I'd really
recommend and I guess that's it I guess
that's the philosophical difference
between AMD and NVIDIA Nvidia locks
things down which gives them tighter
control over the consistency of the
users experience but AMD offers more
flexibility and choice even if some of
these options aren't the best thing ever
at least you can pick them speaking of
things that aren't the best thing ever
searching for royalty-free images and
videos to use in your projects we used
to waste a ton of time trying to find
images
the correct usage rights for videos just
like this one and shutterstock.com ended
up being a fantastic solution for us
it's easy to use just to go over to
their site and search their entire
catalogue of over 30 million
high-quality stock photos illustrations
vectors and video clips without even
making an account and it's relatively
inexpensive once you find something you
like you can sign up for a monthly
subscription like what we have or you
can even just pick up individual images
whenever you need them with bundle
discounts available for more frequent
users the images can be sorted with
their excellent search tool by tag type
and even by color palette if you're
looking to create a particular mood and
the best thing about it is that if you
sign up now you can get 25% off a new
account by going to shutterstock.com and
using offer code technique 214 try it
out today with the link in the video
description thanks for watching guys and
just so you know I was actually kind of
serious at the beginning there the SLI
video I mentioned at the very start of
this one has some great information
about dual GPU configurations in general
and this one was more meant to augment
that one with a focus on the key
differences for AMD users anyway like
and share this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment if you have something to say to
me or the rest of the fastest possible
team and as always don't forget to
subscribe to tech cookie for more videos
just like this one or slightly different
we can change if that's what you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
