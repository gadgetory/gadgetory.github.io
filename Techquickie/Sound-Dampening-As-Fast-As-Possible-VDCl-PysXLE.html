about sound dampening but this sound
dampening really have a role in our
daily lives well if you spend any time
in a house apartment or car it
definitely does so sound travels in
waves of pressure that can both go
around and reflect off of objects and
there are three main ways that we deal
with unwanted sound the first is
distance sound waves don't travel
forever as you can observe if you're
trying to hear your friend across a
baseball field you can't quite tell
whether he wants you to throw the ball
for a double play or a permission to
date your sister the second is using
active and tiny noise generators also
known as noise cancellation which you
can learn more about here the third is
by reflecting and/or absorbing unwanted
sound using different shapes and
materials so for this example let's say
that sound is like a rubber ball if you
throw it at a concrete floor it'll
bounce and reflect off in another
direction but if you throw it at
something like a bed of pillows most of
the energy from the ball will be
absorbed a more comprehensive solution
is a combination of the two with soft
shapes designed to both reflect and
absorb sound and this is usually found
in spaces like recording studios where
sound isolation is extremely important
there are even spaces so well isolated
or soundproofed for special applications
that people have trouble spending a long
period of time in them claiming that the
sound of their own heartbeat became
frustratingly loud yikes but since most
of us probably don't live in recording
studios or soundproof chambers for
scientific research how exactly does
sound dampening really affect us in day
to day life
well soundproofing is actually used in
lots of things cars use sound dampening
in mufflers and resonators so we don't
all sound like race cars in traffic
except for that one guy who lives on my
block and they also use insulating
layers to reduce the sound made by
traveling down the interstate me Sam
actually built an electric car that was
so quiet that the
mounds of air moving over the car we're
discomforting to passengers and to solve
this they actually had to make specially
shaped headlights to deflect air around
the car reducing noise and making that a
method of sound dampening houses of
course have insulation in the walls to
help with climate control but also to
assist with keeping unwanted sounds out
many modern houses use windows made of
multiple separated layers with air space
in between to help them absorb sound and
to prevent heat transfer and if that's
not enough there are actually special
kinds of drywall and even glue that you
can buy so your living room won't sound
like an echo II cavern when someone
upstairs scoops a chair around many
businesses actually use special panels
in the ceilings to help absorb unwanted
sound which is important for privacy
reasons as well as just general
workplace comfort and speaking of the
office we can also use computer cases
with sound dampening foam built right
into them to block out the noise from
cooling fans so then what's next
remember those three main ways to dampen
sound will soon there may actually be a
fourth scientists are using quantum
mechanics to produce new materials for
sound dampening that would allow for the
redirection of sound across a material
surface without allowing any vibrations
to travel through it that means in the
future it may take much less material to
isolate a space and it could potentially
be used to reduce noise pollution in
things like busy cities airfields and
even the trains that are right next to
our studio speaking of not needing as
much mass to absorb sound mass drop has
another one of their pretty killer deals
going on today the feature deal today is
an LG 34 um ninety four very similar to
this 34 inch ultra wide flat panel that
I reviewed way back about a year ago
the cool thing though is that unlike
that one this one can be had for as
little as 649 through mass drop if it
reaches the lowest price of course this
product is available only through mass
drop at this significantly discounted
price
thanks to their group by model which
the way it works is essentially the
community is like hey there's a bunch of
us who want to buy this thing in
mousetrap goes hey that's cool they go
to authorized distributors or to the
manufacturer themselves and they
negotiate a price and then the more
people actually commit and put money
down the lower the price drops and
they've got tons of other items
everything from knives to computer
hardware to keyboards to audio equipment
filming equipment lots of great stuff so
head over to draw dumps slash tech
quickie linked in the video description
to check it out now the link doesn't
give us kickback or anything but it does
let mass drop know that we sent you over
there to shop so thanks for watching
