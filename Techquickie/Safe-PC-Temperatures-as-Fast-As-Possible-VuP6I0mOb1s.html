hundred times and based on a quick
google search it looks like there are
quite a few other folks who want the
answer how hot can my PC run before it's
not safe anymore okay well let's start
with why you would care how hot it runs
some lots of reasons high temperatures
can cause all kinds of stuff in
semiconductors it increases the
electrical resistance reducing
efficiency it can speed up the
degradation of electrical pathways
within the component allowing errors
that cause data corruption and it can
even if the proper safeguards weren't in
place caused the low-temperature solder
that is sometimes used to completely
melt all righty then that's very scary
can you give me the answer now - well
hold on let's start with some
information from the websites of a
couple of computer hardware
manufacturers you may have heard of the
T Junction temperature the point at
which it will turn down its own speed to
preserve its life for the intel core i7
4770k CPU is a hundred and five degrees
Celsius the out of the box standard
operating temperature of 95 degrees
Celsius for AMD s r9 290x graphics card
is to quote AMD perfectly safe while
powered on a WD red hard drive can
operate it anywhere from 0 to 70 degrees
which in their testing produces no
unrecoverable errors and a GTX 780 Ti
ships at an 80 degree maximum and NVIDIA
theoretically allows up to 95 degrees
but we found that they actually limit it
to around 86 degrees Celsius so those
are super scary high temperatures Linus
my friend said it should be lower are
they misinformed if it says it's okay
directly on the manufacturers website
why is there so much confusion out there
about this because it's not quite that
simple
unlike the engine in your car which uses
a thermostat to maintain itself within a
very narrow range usually with between
90 to 100 degrees Celsius most PC parts
don't have moving parts that rely on
tight manufacturing tolerances and high
performance lubricants to keep them
functioning so don't they don't really
have an optimal operating temperature
that means that while the hard drive
with moving parts specified a maximum
temperature for the other stuff a
maximum
specified in a minimum is not because
you can pretty much run it as low as you
want and it'll be happier than a pig and
split with that said lower is better if
you're taking the appropriate
precautions for most people you're not
going to want your temperatures to drop
any lower than ambient or the
temperature of the surrounding air
because below that temperature water
droplets forming on your components do
condensation becomes a major concern
water is worse for your hardware than
high temperatures so here's the summary
first check out the manufacturers
product page then take that information
with a grain of salt if you're one of
those people who believes in taking
really good care of your stuff and you
want to be sure that your hardware will
last and be reliable keep in mind that
the way manufacturers rate their
products is based on the way they expect
most people will actually use them
they're not expecting you to still be
using that CPU graphics card or hard
drive in ten years time and they
certainly aren't giving you a warranty
that lasts that long so they build some
buffer into the numbers but they don't
worry about those fringe cases too much
so for added assurance take their number
and build in your own buffer that makes
you feel comfortable speaking of fringe
cases the people who think trekking to
the store and finding the last employee
who actually still works on the sales
floor of a grocery and drug chain to
unlock a cage so you can spend $20 on a
package of freaking razors only to burn
through them and realize that now you
have to do it all over again the
preceding run-on sentence is brought to
you by Dollar Shave Club join Dollar
Shave Club today with the link below and
enjoy the convenience and savings of the
teen great razors and blades that they
deliver straight to your door once a
month with the precision of a clean-cut
machete-wielding man throwing a box that
would have presumably a net in a bear
costume but could also be a bear who ate
a person and then took over control of
the bear from the inside and applied for
a job at a pretty cool company that
ships bathroom supplies to their
thousands of customers who okay sorry I
got a little distracted there anyway
your first order contains the handle
that you'll need for the rest of your
subscription and the rates are under $10
a month for even their most luxurious
shaving experience of the executive if
that sounds great head on over there and
tell them I sent you
oh and don't forget to check out their
shave butter and one wipe Charlies as
well the shave butter is for your
face it smells really nice the one wipe
Charlies are for your butt and they
smell nice too
