restrictive element holding back the
performance that could otherwise be
achieved the name comes from the way
that fluid flows much slower through the
neck of a bottle than it would if that
neck didn't exist another word for a
bottleneck is a choke point let's start
with a couple of examples in a vehicle
the traction between the tires and the
road is important for optimal power
delivery between the engine and the road
making the car move forward now an
example of where traction would be a
bottleneck would be if your engine is so
powerful that when you go to accelerate
the wheels just spin now at high speeds
a wing can improve traction by using air
flow to force the rear of the car down
towards the road this can alleviate that
bottleneck well hey that sounds great
why don't we just all get wings and put
them on our cars no that's not the
answer this civics performance for
example was not limited by rear wheel
traction and it probably doesn't even
have sufficient power for the benefit of
the downward force to outweigh the
negative effects of the additional wind
resistance caused by this upgrade so in
this case it wasn't a bottleneck at all
so changing it doesn't help and actually
might even make things worse so this is
a tech channel so our next example is a
PC one let's say you take a very old
computer and assuming it's even
compatible you put the very latest
thousand dollar graphics card in it the
PC is not going to slow down and
honestly gaming performance will
probably be improved but that card won't
reach its potential even though the new
card might be ten times faster than the
old one you may only get a small
performance increase because the CPU and
memory and potentially other components
are so slow that they can't feed the
graphics card data at a fast enough rate
to keep it busy so it's just sitting
there most of the time in that example
of bottlenecking those funds could have
been put to better use on a more modest
all-around system upgrade which would
have achieved better performance in
gaming and in other applications at the
same time now with a little that out of
the way it's important to clarify this
whether we're talking about your PC car
air conditioner phone or even your very
own body
everything has bottlenecks you can't
just hide from them until the point
where a task can be performed perfectly
and instantly something
is always holding back or bottlenecking
the process so if they exist everywhere
what can we do about them the answer is
to reduce them avoid extreme bottlenecks
figure out what you're trying to achieve
and direct your resources towards the
things that directly affect the
performance of the things that you care
about so back to pcs as an example if
you're a gamer spending a big chunk of
your budget on a graphics card does make
sense as long as the rest of your
components are reasonably up to snuff if
you're not sure how to balance your
configuration
