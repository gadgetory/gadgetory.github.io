1990s and asked for a motion sensor
they'd probably hand you some
contraption that you hang on your garage
that automatically lights up to scare
away a novice burglar or that bloody
raccoon that keeps tipping over your
garbage can but while sensors that
detect the motion of something else are
still a mainstay of home security
systems the subject of today's video is
actually the sensors that detect their
own motion so how do those work let's
start with the kind you've probably got
a couple of in your hand or pocket right
now a micro electromechanical system or
mends for short a couple of examples of
which are accelerometers and gyroscopes
well that sounds pretty fancy line is
what the heck are those well they're
both engineering and manufacturing
marvels but the basic concepts behind
them are actually pretty simple
accelerometers are for movement of your
device and the kind you'd find in your
phone or a game console motion
controller is pretty much a very small
mass suspended by like tiny micro
Springs with some fixed electrodes
within a housing so let's say shake it
off starts playing in your forensically
going like this try to shuffle your
playlist the masses position relative to
the electrodes will change thanks to
inertia changing the capacitance between
those electrodes which your phone
interprets as a shake and suddenly
you're listening to some even more
deeply embarrassing song you've had on
your phone so long you forgot it was
there
gyroscopes serve a similar purpose but
because they are not to surrender by
Springs and therefore affected by
gravity they are more useful for
measuring rotation although a good
accelerometer can do a reasonable job of
this unless it's in freefall as well so
these bad boys have shown up alongside
accelerometers to improve input speed
and accuracy we motionplus anyone oops
red shell but consider the following
these types of devices are limited in
that they can only detect a change in
position relative to a starting point
what if you wanted to know exactly where
your smartphone was last night oh then
you'll need something that can detect
absolute position like a light detection
motion controller the place that you're
most likely to find one in your house
being on your video game console the
original we used infrared or IR light
emitters two of them on a little bar
under your TV and cameras in each of the
controllers to pinpoint the exact
location of the controller in the room
to further enhance the motion control
experience the disadvantage of a light
based system is that breaking the
line-of-sight makes them stop working
entirely and without high frame rate
cameras performance can be a little
leggy and uninspiring but fortunately
we've made a lot of progress since 2006
and newer systems like the one found on
the HTC vive head mounted VR device use
a combination of MEMS chips laser
position sensors and passive base
stations called lighthouses that work
with the camera on the headset itself to
perfectly determine the user's
orientation and position within the room
pretty freakin Smurfs but the
applications of these technologies go
way beyond gaming of course with medical
rehabilitation fitness and sport
performance tracking and even augmented
reality devices like microsoft's
hololens that overlays virtual objects
on the real world you live in unlocking
all kinds of amazing possibilities in
the future speaking of amazing futures
what if you didn't even have to read
books for yourself
I guess that's today with audible.com
the leading provider of audiobooks with
more than 180,000 downloadable titles
across all types of literature including
fiction nonfiction and periodicals
audiobooks are great to listen to when
you're driving stuck in traffic on the
subway or the bus doing chores around
the house at the gym by the way another
use for motion sensors is you know
fitness tracking doing errands shopping
whenever and for our audience members
audible is giving a free audiobook
as an incentive to try out their monthly
audiobook service which gives you an
audiobook every month and further
benefits like discounts on other
audiobooks one super hot title you might
want to check out right now is the Elon
Musk biography titled Elon Musk creative
Ashley Vance you guys are going to want
to check this out if you're into future
technologies and one gentleman who is
trying to take them to the mainstream so
to download that audio book for free or
another one of your choice go to
audible.com slash tech quickie and sign
up for the club alright guys I think
that's pretty much it like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you thought
it sucked leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future fast as possible
and as always don't forget to subscribe
and follow and all of that good biz</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
