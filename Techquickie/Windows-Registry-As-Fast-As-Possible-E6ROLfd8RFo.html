that pretty much everyone has had to
deal with at some point from the console
gamer suffering the Xbox 360s red ring
of death to Michael Bolton from office
space wondering what in the world PC
load letter actually means but if you're
a Windows user you've probably
encountered messages telling you that
there's a problem with the registry as
well as those shady banner ads and TV
commercials telling you to buy a
registry cleaning utility of some sort
so what exactly is this mysterious
registry why can issues with it cause
problems for your PC and does it really
need to be cleaned periodically like
some kind of digital kitty litter box
well unlike your cat's toilet the
registry isn't really a dumping ground
it's actually a database on your hard
drive that stores important settings for
both windows and other programs you have
installed you see back in the early days
of Windows both the OS itself and other
programs relied on small text files
called ionize to store settings but
Microsoft developed the registry as a
more robust solution that can store many
more settings than an individual I and I
helped different pieces of software
communicate with each other more easily
keep track of settings for multiple
users on the same machine and use a
hierarchical structure to keep things
organized that structure is actually
easy to view for yourself just by typing
reg edit into the run window which
launches a program called registry
editor from there you'll see a massive
array of folder like structures called
registry Keys which contain a myriad of
settings and despite the warnings from
Microsoft that editing the registry can
cause serious damage to your computer it
can actually be a very powerful way to
customize Windows so long as you don't
go around messing with things that you
are unsure of a quick web search will
yield all sorts of registry tweaks for
both Windows and other
programs that you might find useful
things like customizing the taskbar or
right-click context menu changing the
font in the command prompt window
changing the delay when you mouse over
something between when the information
pops up stopping Windows Update from
constantly interrupting what you're
doing and even adding your own logo to
the system window in control panel these
are just a few ways that you can make
Windows behave the way you want with
registry hacks simple registry
adjustments are also often good ways to
fix common PC problems in fact many hot
fixes from Microsoft come in the form of
registry entries that you can merge into
your own registry with a simple
double-click but although the registry
lets you tweak plenty of things that you
just can't do from a settings menu it
does make moving a program from one PC
to another a total pain due to just how
many settings at stores and how
scattered they can get throughout the
registry and it can indeed cause issues
with Windows if it gets corrupted
however with that said while certain
errors in the registry can cause
problems not even with Windows even but
even with specific programs you should
be wary of some of those registry
cleaning programs that try to convince
you your registry needs to be regularly
cleaned and that doing so will give you
faster performance because the truth of
the matter is that often times the
errors that these sorts of programs fix
are just entries from uninstalled
programs that kind of sit in the
registry and don't really do much of
anything so the chance is that any
individual registry error is actually
slowing down your computer are pretty
darn low however if you are actually
getting registry related error messages
or have a piece of malware on your
computer that may have put things into
the registry to make it harder to remove
running a reputable cleaner program may
not be a bad idea just make sure it's a
trustworthy popular utility and not some
random thing that you downloaded after
