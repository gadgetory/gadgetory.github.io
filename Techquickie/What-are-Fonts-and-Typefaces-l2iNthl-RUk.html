on your computer or tablet screen always
looked the same I mean there's something
cool and cyber punkish about doing
everything in a console typeface but
having a wide variety of typefaces is
important to people like designers and
developers and anyone who wants to add a
little pizazz to their documents or
webpages but hold up for a second why do
you keep on saying typeface aren't those
things called fonts all of these terms
have become virtually interchangeable if
you want to be super super proper a
typeface is an actual style of a letter
such as Cobre Arial impact etc and a
font is a specific size and variation
such as bold or italic but since most
people in the modern era are just fine
calling typefaces fonts that's what
we'll be doing for the rest of this
video now the idea of using different
fonts for different applications has
been around for centuries long before
the advent of digital word processing
although back in the day changing fonts
meant changing metallic movable-type in
a typewriter or printing press often a
much more tedious process than just
pointing and clicking it's a good thing
too that switching fonts has become so
easy since they've obviously had a ton
of variation in fonts just think about
how different times new roman and
wingdings are or how whether to use
serif or sans serif fonts has become an
important design choice by the way
seraphs are those little lines at the
edges of letters that some people
believe makes printed text easier to
read different fonts has also been
proven to have certain psychological
effects on the people that see them so
let us know in the comments down below
if you'd like to see a future video on
things like why Comic Sans is so hated
and produces anger and people that read
it and why hipsters have such an
affinity for Helvetica but trying to
work with so many different fonts wasn't
always easy like on earlier pcs unlike
old-fashioned typewriters where you knew
exactly what you were getting as soon as
the letter was printed on the paper
older computers used bitmap fonts that
essentially store the letters as small
bitmapped
images although this strategy did save
on processing power.this also made fonts
suffer from aliasing or jaggies when you
increased their size if you use an older
Macintosh you might remember how this
was particularly prevalent in the old
Chicago fonts that Apple used heavily
what as processing power grew the
industry started shifting towards vector
fonts in formats such as TrueType and
OpenType which allowed accurate scaling
not just on monitors but on printers as
well as users started to shift away from
old-school dot matrix printers towards
laser printers demand grew for being
able to see exactly what you would get
both on screen and on paper which makes
sense
you see vector fonts are defined not as
an arrangement of pixels but as how the
lines and curves in each letter relate
to one another
this means that they can be scaled to
any size without losing quality most
modern fonts are vector fonts which you
can see yourself by opening a modern web
page on a modern browser and zooming way
in you should see smooth lines and
curves instead of jaggies pretty cool
try it out for yourself later as LCD
monitors became more popular we also saw
the rise of technologies like
Microsoft's ClearType which is
essentially anti-aliasing for fonts even
though vector fonts can be scaled nicely
as I just said it can look a bit rough
on normal-sized LCDs because modern flat
panels have pixels fixed at very
specific locations on the screen meaning
that jaggies can appear when characters
have to try to fit themselves into these
pixels on a grid especially on lower
resolution displays this can be a
problem clear type and other
anti-aliasing tech alleviates the
problem by placing lighter colored
pixels around your letters and you don't
even need a Titan X or R 9 Theory to run
it pretty cool of course font technology
hasn't been the only thing changing over
the years since our tastes have evolved
as well but no matter what your style is
you're likely to find something to suit
your preferences as there are now
thousands of freely available to
download fonts I just recommend steering
clear of the after mentioned Comic Sans
unless you haven't

today hope you guys liked that video I
know it was on like fonts and typefaces
so yeah if you disliked it let me know
if you want to see us cover other stuff
in the comments down below and the
psychology of typefaces which is
something I love because I took a few
years of human-computer interaction
courses I would love to make that video
let me know if you care at all in the
comments down below if you guys are like
bored of filling your brain with
knowledge and you're like I want to just
vegetate and watch people be complete
idiots on the Internet
you can go over to channel superfund and
we will do just that
