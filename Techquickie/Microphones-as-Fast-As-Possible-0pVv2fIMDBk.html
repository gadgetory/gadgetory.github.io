living out of the smooth audible
chocolate of their voices microphones
have become a tool on which our very
ability to put food on our tables is
dependent and while your average person
might not feel the same way about them
and may never set foot anywhere near a
sound studio chances are they would
still find life a bit more challenging
have the microphone never been invented
from those found on telephones to drive
through menus to the headsets worn by
professional gamers and air traffic
controllers alike these things have
become indispensable to all but the most
rugged mountain folk among us so
microphones first came into existence
around the year of 600 BC in the form of
masks which would carry a stage
performers voice across the expanse of
the large amphitheater simple
amplification remains the general goal
behind sound wave manipulation until a
man in the mid 19th century by the name
of Antonio Meucci invented the telephone
olds try that again in English telephone
and with that the races were on to see
which inventor could innovate and
improve this device most successfully
now modern microphones or mics
tend to fall into one of two major
groups depending on what type of audio
transducer the device which transforms
sound into an electrical signal is used
the first of these transducers Stiles is
known as dynamic and is normally the
type one sees their favorite pop singer
using on stage these operate by way of a
plastic diaphragm that manipulates a
coil located at its rear which has been
wrapped around a magnet
whenever sound waves caused the
diaphragm to undulate the coil is bounce
back and forth over the magnet surface
with the movements being registered and
transformed into a signal these mics
have the advantage of being able to
record high volume sources such as
directly sell vocals without easily
distorting but the magnets which they
use also restrict their ability to be
shrunk below a certain size this coupled
with the needed input strength to move
the coil along the magnet leave them
wanting sometimes in the departments of
high-frequency detail and
volume pick up the second transducer
type is referred to as a condenser and
it also uses a diaphragm to register
incoming sound waves but instead of
bouncing a coil around a magnet the
diaphragm is placed adjacent Li to a
powered sensor plate which detects the
changing gap between these as it shrinks
and grows with stimulation which gives
them an advantage in terms of size and
sensitivity that makes my deal for
things like phones headsets and small
body-worn jobbies like the little one
that I'm wearing in here they do require
a discreet power source for operation
where magnet driven designs do not and
also the reduced size between the plate
and the diaphragm when compared to the
length of the coiled magnet means they
tend to top out and distort more easily
with loud noises now what kind of
transducer a microphone uses does it
mean a whole lot unless it actually
picks up sound from the intended source
and hopefully that only this is where
the role of pull or pick up patterns
comes in which determine where the input
is received from relative to the
microphones location now there are many
pattern styles for different uses but
the three basic families consists of
omnidirectional which pick up sound in a
sphere surrounding the mic equally
unidirectional or cardioid with its
pattern looking something like a
mushroom head and fading audio that's
not directly in front of the microphone
and bi-directional which resembles a
figure 8 and you guessed it goes both
ways
the noise canceling feature many
microphones use actually operates by
directing a pickup away from the
intended source then subtracting
anything it detects from the overall sum
of both inputs with more advanced
systems using even more than two
microphones
now although microphones come in any
transducer and pickup combination a user
could desire with many boasting
adjustable patterns on the fly it's
important to note that the mixer
processor or amplifier not to mention
file format types and the end speakers
that are used to enjoy the audio play a
role in the experience as well and while
this may seem like a bit much for those
who are uninitiated
I can assure you all that it is at least
much more simple and convenient a way of
communicating than the smoke signals
that we used to use speaking of
communication if you want to improve
your skills in a wide variety of areas
including communication you should
definitely check out Linda comment when
t15 and Linda things you know what maybe
