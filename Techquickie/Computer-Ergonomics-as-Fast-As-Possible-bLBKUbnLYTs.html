equipment and devices that properly fit
the human body it's a big topic but in
this video I'll be talking about
computer related organ on --ax if you're
a computer worker like me and you spend
your whole day sitting down in a fixed
position you should know that this can
lead to all sorts of health problems
like a repetitive strain injury and
trust me you do not want to get RSI like
I did it's really painful more info
about that and how I recovered in this
video but an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure with some economic
fixes and changes in behavior you can
keep on working or gaming or whatever
while minimizing the negative health
effects but first please note that
everyone is different at six foot three
an ergonomic solution for me might not
work for someone like Linus because he's
short did did you know that Linus has to
stand on an Apple box and some of the
videos that we make fired worth it so
anyway let's start with the monitor the
top of your monitor should be right
around your eye level the monitor should
also be arm's length away from your face
but still large enough so that you don't
have to lean forward to see things if
that makes it hard to read text you can
try increasing the text size or UI scale
you can even try using a lower than
native display resolution but that's
kind of a terrible solution you can get
special computer viewing glasses which
allow your eyes to more easily focus on
your monitor reducing eye strain it's
the same idea behind reading glasses
talk to your optician some people love
these but I don't
speaking of eye strain make sure your
monitor isn't too bright or too dark
your screen should match the brightness
of the room you're in note that if
you're doing color sensitive work you'll
still want to properly color calibrate
your monitor also be aware if your
monitor has a matte or glossy finish
glossy monitors can have more vivid
colors but they can be hard to see if
there are a lot of bright reflections in
the room now onto the chair most office
chairs already have lumbar support
wheels swivel and height adjust all of
which is great you may also want a chair
that can lean backwards especially with
tension adjust and lockable angles by
the way we've reviewed a few adjustable
chairs on Linus tech tips already you
might prefer to have a headrest and it's
also nice to have fully adjustable arm
rests but if they just get in your way
you might want to remove them completely
now your keyboard and mouse should be at
the same height as your elbows when your
shoulders are relaxed with the keyboard
tilted slightly away from you lots of
economic advice tells you to use a
rollout keyboard tray which hangs under
the desk which I completely disagree
with I prefer to move the entire desk
down to that height which allows for so
much more room I also like to scoot up
as close to my desk as possible so that
I can rest my arms on it rather than my
arm rests but again your preferred setup
will vary and speaking of desks height
adjustable desks are great especially
the ones that can go from sitting to
standing height however it's important
to note the mechanism by which this is
accomplished you should be able to make
the transition in oh I don't know like
less than a minute also when it comes to
desk space
I feel like bigger really is better so
what about keyboards well there are lots
of different organic keyboards some
terrible some amazing more like
amazingly expensive I tried the
Microsoft natural organ AMA keyboard but
then I realized that as a video editor I
need to use my right hand on the mouse
and my left hand on the whole keyboard
for keyboard shortcuts but this split
design makes that stupidly difficult a
programmer or a writer would have a much
better experience you might also find
that typing on a mechanical keyboard is
easier than a membrane keyboard but keep
in mind that there are many different
kinds of mechanical keyboard switches as
we cover in this video also you might
want to consider switching to a colemak
or Dvorak keyboard layouts more info in
that video and finally the mouse there
seem to be an endless selection of
weird-looking or economic mice some of
them are vertically oriented some of
them are at an angle some of them aren't
actually mice the Trackman marble has
great reviews but I just hated it like
scrolling requires a button toggle what
this is not good for video editing
note that some mice and keyboards have
macro buttons which can be wonderful or
they might just get in your way
wait what's a macro oh look we already
made a video about that but most
importantly with whatever
ergonomic equipment you decide to get
you need to fully test your new
equipment in the context of your current
set-up to make sure it truly works for
you for example
pedals plus a standing desk probably a
bad combination with anything you buy be
aware of the return policy and save that
receipt now listen I know that not all
of you or your employers can afford to
drop hundreds perhaps thousands of
dollars on fancy new organ a'm equipment
but some solutions can cost little to
nothing
try using boxes as monitor stands use
books or wood to raise your desk height
use software like autohotkey to turn
your numpad or function keys or whatever
into macros you're smart enough to
MacGyver up something right get creative
and beyond reaganomics you can also
adjust your behavior getting regular
exercise is obviously important for good
health but to combat the negative
effects of too much sitting you should
take frequent small breaks where you
just stand up and move around the
general consensus is to take micro
breaks of 30 to 60 seconds every 15 ish
minutes and to take longer five-minute
breaks every hour ish yeah there's
really not much consensus here there are
lots of different options for reminder
software which will alert you when it's
time for a break and if you want to be
more productive while you are working to
make up for all those little breaks you
should probably be taking check out
