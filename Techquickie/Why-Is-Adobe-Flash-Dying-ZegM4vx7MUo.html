may have heard that Adobe will be ending
its support for the venerable Flash
Player in 2020 that's only two years
left for the platform that around the
majority of the interactive web games
and animations that I used to waste my
time playing way back in high school but
what's wrong with Flash is it simply
being cast away for something newer and
flashier or is there a good reason to
get rid of it to answer this question we
need to start at the beginning with why
flash became as popular as it did in the
first place you see way back in the
1990s when in the height of cool on the
internet was having your own Geocities
page there weren't a ton of options for
interactivity or even just animation
aside from gifts yes
gifts that is until 1996 when Netscape
started offering a piece of software
called futures flash viewer for its web
browser futuresplash surprisingly was
not a chillwave band but rather a
software solution for graphic designers
that supported animations and vector
images we take these things for granted
today but at the time it was so
innovative that Microsoft decided to use
futuresplash
on the MSN homepage to help it stand out
from its web portal competitors that
gave the platform a ton of exposure in a
short amount of time once that happened
a company called Macromedia which would
later be purchased by Adobe bought
futuresplash and renamed it flash and
this was before the year was even over
as time went on so did flash development
and it gained the ability to code many
different kinds of interactive
experiences paving the way for sites
like the infamous newgrounds.com
and other massive repositories of online
games then in 2004 it got video support
fun fact YouTube even used to use flash
for many years to power its entire
library of content but just because
something is super widespread and
popular doesn't mean it's perfect and
flash had plenty of warps many of which
started to come to light in 2007 with
the release of the first iPhone even
though flash was a major component of
many webs
it's at the time iOS did not support
flash this led to a ton of frustration
for many users but Apple stood by its
decision pointing out that flash was
proprietary and resource heavy in large
part thanks to its dependence on
inefficient software video decoding and
that latter point was particularly
problematic for the battery-powered
mobile revolution that Apple was at the
process of unleashing and in retrospect
Apple's timing was actually pretty good
see in the late 2000s open standards
that provided some of the same visual
and interactive functionality as flash
were really starting to take off and
aside from using efficient hardware
video decoding that Apple claimed could
double screen time while watching videos
they were free they were afraid and if
all those reasons still weren't enough
for you flash has also been a favorite
target of attackers and black hats for
much of his existence but not only that
but Adobe has come under heavy criticism
for not doing enough to patch these
holes in fact Adobe released a public
apology at one point for taking over 16
months to fix one particular issue so
nothing happens overnight
it wasn't until 2015 that YouTube
finally transitioned away from flash in
favor of html5 but this trifecta of
major shortcomings along with enormous
improvements in open standards have
continually eroded Flash's market share
in the high quality video and
interactive web arenas arenas that used
to be nearly its domain exclusively but
with all that said when support for
flash ends in 2020 it won't disappear
completely because there will always be
ancient websites that will simply never
be updated and believe it or not offline
flash is still widely used in the
animation industry even for current TV
shows so even though flash will be
disappearing from your online life it
clearly wasn't just a flash in the pan
who writes this stuff and you know what
else isn't a flash in the pan private
