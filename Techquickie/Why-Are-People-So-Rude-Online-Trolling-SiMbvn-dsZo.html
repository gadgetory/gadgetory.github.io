to see naive sounding marketing about
how the internet was this remarkable new
tool that could connect you to people
all over the world and while that was
certainly true giving every random
person out there a keyboard a platform
visible to anyone on earth and some
degree of anonymity was also the perfect
storm for internet trolls to start
antagonizing everyone of course people
including non trolls anger each other
online on a regular basis by the way
trolling is not the same as getting into
a heated argument with someone who's
expressing a sincere opinion rather
trolling is intentionally posting
something misleading or inflammatory in
order to trick or upset people and often
to provoke some kind of response as well
but why do people even troll in the
first place especially as there's
already enough strife on the Internet
perhaps unsurprisingly there have been
psychological studies done on the
subject that have found a correlation
between trolling behavior and so-called
dark personality traits such as
narcissism and psychopathy tying in to
the idea that a commonly suggested
motive for trolling is that it makes the
troll feel important and better than the
victim as they can elicit very strong
emotional reactions from people with
just a few keystrokes wait what well ok
obviously not every internet troll is a
completely self-absorbed psychopath but
the point is more that general human
curiosity of drama combined with our
natural desire for attention makes
online gathering places a fertile ground
for people who like watching the world
burn or maybe just a message and
speaking of forums one common variation
of trolling takes the form of concern
trolling where someone goes into a forum
of something like a rival sports team or
say political candidate and pretends to
be a supporter then tries to undermine
the group in some way this could be
anything from pointing out dubious
weaknesses in other people's positions
in order to sow discord and doubt or
simply saying things to make the group
look illegitimate or unhinged some
political campaigns and core
patience have even been caught using
sponsored trolls to attack opposing
brands politicians or ideologies in fact
a Harvard study concluded that the
government of mainland China posts
nearly half a billion troll messages on
social media every year in order to sway
public opinion but assuming the trolls
you usually encounter on a day to day
basis aren't covertly backed by
government or business another proposed
motivator for trolling is something
called deindividuation which is the
tendency people have to lose their sense
of self in crowds just as people in a
large group can sometimes end up writing
or engaging in other shenanigans due to
the individuals involved thinking they
don't bear as much responsibility since
everyone else around them is also
throwing rocks or whatever
trolls often see themselves as part of
an anonymous mass of people which lowers
their inhibitions and makes it easier
for them to go at people online when
they wouldn't say the same things in a
real-life conversation one-on-one and
this type of trolling doesn't even have
to be verbal one such famous trolling
incident happened back in 2005 when a
glitch in world of warcraft allowed
trolls to spread intentionally an
in-game sickness called corrupted blood
to lots of other users creating an
in-game catastrophe for tons of
unsuspecting players at the hands of an
anonymous mob of trolls but as
widespread as trolling is because of
these psychological tendencies much of
it comes in the form of calling people
who play a certain game or buy a certain
thing fanboys or saying stuff like my
local sports team will surely defeat
yours in the upcoming athletic
competition a more directly threatening
concern comes when it's bad enough to
have more direct consequences such as
daxing where trolls publish personal
information or private details about a
target online you can learn more about
real-life effects of online abuse here
but if you're dealing with a
particularly nasty troll and what
they're doing isn't spilling into the
realm of the real world
remember that trolls are nearly always
looking to get a rise out of you so
follow the old dodge and please
not feed the trolls with as many people
as there are who get sucked in by troll
