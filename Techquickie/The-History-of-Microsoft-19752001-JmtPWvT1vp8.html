in Internet Explorer 11 just kidding but
it wasn't too long ago that Microsoft's
position in the market was so dominant
that nearly everyone was using ie
anyways along with Windows Office and
that space-cadet pinball game that was
actually awesome so just how did
Microsoft become the face of the
software industry before Google was even
a glint in Larry page's eye well it
started back in 1975 when Bill Gates and
Paul Allen wanted to get the programming
language basic working on their Altair
8800 the first successful PC blown with
the little lights and switches on the
front that was programmed directly by
toggling them they believed a basic
interpreter would make it a lot easier
for people to program on the Altair
using a keyboard what a concept this
interpreter called Altair basic was
Microsoft's first ever product and it
took up just four kilobytes on paper
tape it proved to be so popular that
Bill Gates sent a very angry letter to
hobbyists telling them to stop copying
it and passing it around for free
unfortunately for Bill product
activation was still a few decades away
but that's ok it didn't stop Microsoft
from growing and developing many more
forms of basic through the early 1980s
which served not only as programming
environments but also as proto operating
systems for home computers of the time
Microsoft also launched its first-ever
piece of hardware in 1980 called the
soft card which allowed the operating
system CPM which later evolved into das
to run on Apple computers sound familiar
anyway speaking of DOS Microsoft agreed
to produce dos for IBM in 1981 which
quickly made Microsoft a software giant
their yulie revenue raised from 16
million in 1981 to over 97 million a
mere three years later in 1984 this
number was also bolstered by the
introduction of Microsoft Word in 1983
which was notable for being one of the
first what-you-see-is-what-you-get word
processors meaning you could see
formatting like italics on screen
instead of having to type in a command
later to get the printer to print the
font that you want
and Microsoft continued to roll with the
whole idea of making things on the
monitor look nicer when they released
Windows 1.0 in 1985 and while this
initial version of Windows was really
just a graphical shell that ran on top
of ms-dos it was still ahead of its time
in some ways for example it was widely
criticized for relying too much on the
mouse since most computers in 1985
didn't even have them yet but Bill Gates
who previously announced that the
company would focus firmly on Windows
was undeterred and five years later in
1990 windows 3.0 was released and was a
smashing success thanks in no small part
to the use of real actual icons to
represent programs and files and a
support for a whopping 256 colors the
original version of Microsoft Office was
also released this year and was
similarly successful though some of
Microsoft's productivity software rivals
cried foul because Microsoft's knowledge
of Windows supposedly allowed them to
make office run better on Windows than
the competition whatever the truth was
Windows became the world's most popular
graphical OS in 1993 with office
becoming the market leader in
productivity applications a year later
so with all this success the stage was
very much set for the much-ballyhooed
Windows 95 release in you guessed it
1995 which included many enduring
features like the Start menu the modern
Windows desktop paradigm and the taskbar
this along with Microsoft's growing
portfolio of consumer products like
Encarta Internet Explorer and MSN which
is still around is a dial-up provider
and a web portal quickly turned
Microsoft into a household name and a
mainstay on both home and office pcs
worldwide they even invited our TVs
partnering with General Electric to
launch MSNBC in 1996 a cable news
channel that emphasized interactivity
and online news to complement its TV
offerings in its early days of course
Microsoft's market dominance raised some
eyebrows especially when they bundled
Internet Explorer with Windows 98 and
treated the browser as an
part of the operating system certain
elements of Windows wouldn't run
properly without ie this escalated to
the point where the US government nearly
broke Microsoft into two companies in
2000 though this was avoided through a
settlement while this litigation was
going on
Microsoft rolled out Windows ME which
was so buggy that PC world joked that
Emmy stood for mistake edition but
Redmond quickly righted itself in 2001
releasing the venerable Windows XP the
first Windows version for consumers that
ditched ms-dos which ran underneath
Windows 90 X using the much more stable
Windows NT kernel which was previously
only intended for business use that same
year Microsoft dove headfirst into the
game console wars releasing the original
Xbox is a big fu to Sony whose
PlayStation product line was driving
game developers away from windows and
although the Xbox may have been a little
big and looked a little tacky it was
ahead of its time in a number of ways
being the first causal to include an
Ethernet jack and a hard drive so by
this point it's clear that Microsoft was
trying to diversify their business in
areas other than just the traditional PC
software space but unfortunately if we
went into all of Microsoft's post 2001
successes and missteps this wouldn't
really be a tech quickie episode it'd be
like a tech long episode so let us know
in the comments what you'd like to see
us cover in a follow up modern history
of Microsoft episode tunnel Bayer VPN
lets you tunnel to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
Internet and use online services as if
you're in a different country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and they also have a Chrome
extension just choose a country turn
tunnel bear on and watch as your bear
tunnels your internet connection to a
new location when you do turn tile bear
on two things happen your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and your public IP address
gets switched so you can show up as if
you're in said different country tunnel
Bayer handles all the messy stuff in the
background and they have a top rated
privacy policy and do not log user
activity you can
tunnelled their VPN with 500 megabytes
of free data and with no credit card
required and if you choose to get a year
of unlimited data you can save 10% by
going to tunnel bear comm slash Linus
thanks for watching guys if you liked
this video like it you just like this
video dislike it check out channel
super-fun if you want to like break from
learning things and down below if you
have any ideas of stuff that we should
cover on this channel like the history
of something let us know and we'll look
into that see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
