finally decided to address a huge
bottleneck in your computer by upgrading
to an SSD for your boot drive but when
you finally get up and running something
seems a little off maybe your file
transfers are slower than you expected
underwhelming SSD performance could be
caused by a somewhat obscure setting in
your UEFI BIOS you see most modern hard
drives or SSDs can be set to operate in
either IDE mode or AHCI mode but what in
the heck does that mean well there are
multiple ways your system has of talking
to drives IDE or parallel ata is the
standard that was used for a long time
back when we were all using those huge
grey ribbon cables to connect hard
drives to motherboards drives with the
newer smaller SATA or serial ata
connectors that most of us use today can
also utilize a newer standard called
advanced host controller interface or a
HCI ahci enables cool features like hot
swapping so you don't have to turn off
your computer if you want to unplug an
external drive from an eSATA port or use
that super neato hot swap bay in the top
of your case a less obvious but also
important advantage is support for
native command queuing which affects the
way that your drives handle multiple
requests who fetch data at one time on
hard drives using NC q can mean the
drives read and write head doesn't have
to move around as much to get a certain
piece of information speeding up your
access times but how does a HCI
also help speed up SSDs well although
the benefits of NC q on SSDs are small
or negligible for home users many users
do report greatly increased performance
especially for large file transfer
in a HCI mode compared to IDE mode due
to HCI just plain being designed with
more modern drives in mind so then why
would you ever want to use IDE mode can
we just get rid of that option well if
you're running an older operating system
such as Windows XP or earlier there's a
good chance that it won't have native
HCI support meaning it won't play nicely
with your drives if your motherboard is
set to HCI mode unless you do some
software trickery when you install the
OS this might also be the case if you're
trying to run software from a bootable
USB stick or an optical disk and if you
have a boot drive that you've been using
an IDE mode but then switch over to a
HCI you might get a boot error forcing
you to switch back to IDE though
fortunately if you're using Windows
there's a registry tweak that you can
use to fix this more permanently if
you're interested we've linked
instructions in the video description
below of course ahci isn't the end game
for drive protocols and the sexy new one
nvm Express is starting to gain
popularity while you won't be able to
use it with garden-variety SATA drives
it's being implemented in
high-performance PCI Express SSDs and
since nvme was designed from the ground
up for solid-state storage it can enable
speeds several times faster than what
you'd get with a HCI on a standard SATA
interface so you might want to look into
those if you've got some money to burn
and milliseconds count when you're
