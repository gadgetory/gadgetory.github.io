hot-swap and not been sure what that
means I mean at first I thought it was
an easy way of identifying really bad
Plastic Surgeons you know swap your
heart for something else that died never
mind that joke fell flatter than a
botched breast reduction the context of
technology specifically electronics is
that a particular component is designed
to be disconnected and even reconnected
without powering down the rest of the
system okay Linus so why would we want
to do that well imagine for a second a
world where you had to power down your
cellular telephone every time you wanted
to plug in your headphones and you know
jam out to some tunes as the kids would
say and then upon completion of the jam
out session turn your phone back off
take the headphones out and then power
it back on I mean it's ridiculous right
so that's what it's for quickly changing
out peripheral devices like keyboards
mice and game controllers USB drives as
long as you do it safely displays and
network cables on personal computers for
a much more convenient user experience
or if you think much bigger than that
it's also important to achieve the
reliability that allows the servers that
host your favorite websites and online
services to provide nearly perfect
uptime in an enterprise setting hot-swap
can be used on some pretty unexpected
stuff dead or working hard drives can be
pulled out of redundant arrays and
replaced or upgraded on-the-fly
with no data loss and in the case of
redundant power supplies even a power
supply for a server can be swapped out
without ever shutting it down but not
everything can be hot swapped and there
are many things an interface designer
needs to consider to make hot swapping
safe mechanical interfaces need to
protect the user from mashing his or her
fingers or getting zapped and similarly
the electrical design of the interface
and the software needs to be resilient
enough to handle being suddenly
disconnected in the middle of operation
some things aren't designed to work for
hot-swap but might actually work like
sim cards for cell phones and older ps2
mice but others must never be hot slugs
would result in an instant software
error causing the system to shut down
and possibly hardware failure examples
of these sorts of things include system
memory graphics cards and CPUs but this
might not always even be the case
technology is always changing and some
of the early concepts for the project
are a phone for example suggests that we
might even see components like batteries
become hot swappable so who knows I sure
don't speaking of things I don't know I
don't know what could be a better
sponsor for today's episode than
audible.com there are a longtime
supporter of the show actually our very
first sponsor they've got over a hundred

on the go while you're driving taking
public transit working out or whatever
else and lets you avoid completely
unnecessary cliffhanger BS like The
Hunger Games Mockingjay movie the last
book of which has been split up into two
parts only one of which is available
because you can just listen to the whole
thing on audiobook because it's
available already and that book is by
Suzanne Collins which I'm supposed to
say otherwise I don't do all the things
I'm supposed to say so their Mockingjay
by Suzanne Collins anyway guys sign up
