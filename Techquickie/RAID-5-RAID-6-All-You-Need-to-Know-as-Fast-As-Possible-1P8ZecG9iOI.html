kinds of raid raid 0 and raid 1 we've
got a separate video for that make sure
you click the link here to check it out
this video is about raid 5 and raid 6
which are more practical for
professional applications and less
practical for home users just like raid
1 raid 5 is for protecting your data in
the event of a drive failure it requires
at least three drives to operate with
one of the drives being reserved to
rebuild the data on the array if it dies
so if you had say for example six drives
you'd have the capacity of five drives
because it stores data on multiple
drives you can read from it extremely
quickly making it great for archiving
large amounts of data however without a
complex hardware RAID controller writing
to a raid 5 can be much slower and
rebuilding the array once a drive has
failed and you replace it with a new one
can be time consuming raid 6 is kind of
like a more durable version of raid 5 it
can survive up to 2 Drive failures out
of the entire array and still be
completely rebuilt that means however
that you have to have at least four
drives and it is much slower to write
than raid 5 so pretty much unless you
have a complex hardware RAID controller
you can't really run raid 6 when you're
running 4 drives it's really impractical
compared to something like raid 10 and
is more designed for professional
applications where a large number of
drives are built into larger arrays if
you're watching this you've probably
watched our video on raid 0 &amp;amp; 1 already
for consumers RAID one's fine if you're
running only for drives raid 1 will give
you 6 terabytes of usable space using 3
terabyte drives raid 5 gives you a bit
more space but you write to it much
slower so it can be useful but raid 6
gives you only 6 terabytes of space and
it's much slower and requires one of
these bad boys the numbers start to look
very different once you move up to an 8
drive configuration however raid 1 will
give you 12 terabytes of usable space
only half of your drives are used for
redundancy read 5 gives you 21 terabytes
of space and raid 6 will give you 18
terabytes of space plus the fact that
raid 5 can sustain one failure and raid
6 can sustain 2 failures
