confusing we're going to tell you about
all the different panel types that are
out there as fast as possible twisted
nematic or TN panels are the most common
panels probably because they are the
least expensive if your monitor isn't
labeled or you're shopping and you can't
see what it is
odds are excellent it's a TN they have
the least accurate color reproduction
and the viewing angles are narrowest
especially up and down so if you look at
them from an angle the colors can appear
washed out and the details can be lost
however TN panels are faster than other
panel types which is to say the image
can switch more quickly so TN panels are
often found in premium gaming grade
monitors because they run at refresh
rates as high as a hundred and twenty or
even a hundred and forty-four Hertz
that's what allows them to be 3d vision
certified for stereo 3d gaming PVA and
MVA panels are quite similar they're
significantly better than TN both in
terms of their color reproduction and in
terms of their viewing angles but not
quite up there with the more premium
panel types making them a very
reasonable mid-range option the one real
drawback of v-a compared to the more
premium ones is the fact that when
viewed from different angles the colors
do tend to shift quite a bit in plane
switching or IPS panels are premium
panels suitable for enthusiasts
professionals graphics designers and
high-end tablets so one of the reasons
that many tablets use these panels is
because the viewing angles are fantastic
and the colors which are accurate don't
distort almost no matter where you're
looking at them from the one drawback of
an IPS panel is that it's tends to be
slower than especially a TN panel so
gamers sometimes don't like them because
the input lag can be higher and when
there's a fast-moving object going
across the screen there can be a trail
behind it called motion blur normally
plane to line switching or pls panels
wouldn't merit their own subject in a
video like this because they're very
similar to IPS but they're my personal
favorite they are contend to be brighter
than the IPS panels they have slightly
better color range and they're capable
of even better viewing angles making
them just freakin awesome I love them
however they do have the same issue as
IPS where the response times can be a
little bit slower especially than fast
panels like TN as always guys don't

anyone who you think might benefit from
