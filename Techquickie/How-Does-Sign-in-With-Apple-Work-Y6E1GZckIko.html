number of online accounts for everything
from your weird craft store to that
fitness forum that you joined to get
advice on your workout program that only
lasted for a couple of weeks and you've
probably also grown weary of having to
sign up for a new account over and over
and over again so whenever you see one
of those super convenient buttons that
says sign in with Facebook or Google or
soon sign in with Apple you eagerly
click on them but how do they work and
are you possibly giving away too much of
your personal information so these
buttons use a protocol called OAuth
which takes advantage of the fact that
services like Google and Facebook have
enormous user bases and many of those
people use them as primary services for
communication and they already store
their personal details in them like
their names and email addresses the kind
of basic stuff that many sites would
require for your account activation
regardless of how you sign up so what
Olof does is it allows whatever
third-party site you're trying to
register for to access your Google or
Facebook account but not in its entirety
instead the site is only allowed to view
certain pieces of your account typically
a name and email at the minimum and
maybe a profile picture so ooofff
manages this by first checking that you
are actually signed in to your Google or
Facebook account then assigning a
special access token and a secret which
is basically a password to the third
party site so that Google or Facebook
know only to give that site access to
certain parts of your profile now an
important note here is that oo auth
doesn't reveal your actual Facebook or
Google account password so shady sites
can't access or modify more information
than they explicitly tell you that they
will and that you authorize them to do
one key though is to double-check what
permissions you're giving the site
because many of them will allow you to
modify what parts of your profiles they
can access so that you can prevent a
situation like
you know some site that you use for
promo codes constantly posting
embarrassing coupons to your Facebook
Timeline for the most part this single
sign-in scheme works well and is quite
convenient but of course in the world of
tech someone is always trying to find a
way to do it better and Apple thinks it
indeed has something superior with its
new sign-in with Apple service so first
up is integration with face ID and touch
ID in an effort to give the sign-in
process a boost in both convenience and
security so that's pretty swell but it's
not necessarily even the main selling
point here one of Apple's big
innovations is that sign-in with Apple
will actually permanently hide your
email address from third-party services
this is important because in some ways
an email account is kind of like a
master key because it serves as a master
account with password reset capabilities
for many other accounts so you don't
want it just floating around out there
looking like a juicy target so instead
of getting it out like free candy
Apple will generate a random new
anonymized email address that is linked
to your account for every service that
you sign up for this has the benefit of
improving your anonymity online and also
making it harder for unscrupulous sites
to sell your actual email address to
third parties or to spam you
additionally Apple claims but because
they make their money selling you
iPhones and Macs and monitor stands and
whatnot your sign ins across multiple
services won't be used to track your
activity by contrast Google and Facebook
do keep track of what third-party sites
you've signed into with their single
sign-on solutions to help serve you
relevant ads so that's Apple's pitch and
it sounds pretty good honestly so
hopefully they'll stick to their promise
not to track you especially because
they're going to make sign-in with Apple
a requirement for any app on the App
Store that also uses single sign-in
options from their competitors just
Apple being Apple
