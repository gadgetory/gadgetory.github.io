aside from your internet connection
mr.right is probably it's a storage as
this drives usually function and
communicate more slowly than anything
else inside a computer so it should come
as no surprise then that many people
point out that adding an SSD is often
the single best upgrade for making your
machine feel faster because unlike a
mechanical hard drive and SSDs complete
lack of moving parts means it can both
access and write data much more quickly
but even though nearly any widely
available consumer grade SSD will be a
major upgrade over a spinning HDD there
can be a lot of noticeable variation in
how different models perform and unlike
trying to research what graphics card to
buy where it isn't really hard to look
at how many FPS is a card will give you
in popular games that you play both
advertised performance numbers and
benchmark results for SSDs can be a
little bit hard to decipher so how the
heck are you supposed to know what's
important well we cover different
interfaces and form factors in previous
videos
boop-boop but today we're going to be
talking about how to understand specs
and benchmarks it's probably no surprise
that the numbers that SSD manufacturers
trumpet the most often don't have a ton
of relevance to what real-world
performance is going to be like usually
sequential read and write performance
that's how fast an SSD can read or write
a contiguous large file all in one place
on the drive is listed right at the top
of the spec sheet with higher-end drives
commonly showing transfer rates above
500 megabytes per second but while those
numbers do matter if you're transferring
lots of data at once such as if you're a
video production company and you
transfer a lot of video files around
what often matters more for everyday use
is 4k performance this is the measure of
how quickly an SSD can deal with much
smaller chunks of data stored in whren
locations all over the drive which is
important because most things that the
average user does on a daily basis
whether it's web browsing or running a
background antivirus scan or saving a
Word document
require accessing small pieces of data
all over the place rather than large
contiguous chunks of data performance
can also be indicated in a ops instead
of megabytes per second
this stands for inputs and outputs per
second and is a measure of how quickly a
drive can deal with read or write
requests again unless you're using your
SSD mostly for playing the copy-paste
game it's a good idea to check and
compare a ops as it relates to 4k
performance another thing to watch out
for if you're looking at benchmark
results is whether the test was done
with compressible or incompressible data
typically the compressible result is
more important depending on workload
since many SSDs actually do compress
numerous types of commonly used data
from documents to operating system files
in order to keep the SSD from wearing
out too quickly and to make it perform
better incompressible data though does
occur in the real world stuff like
movies and music which have been
compressed already into formats like mp4
or mp3 so if most of what you're doing
is working with uncompressible data then
the uncompressed benchmarks will give
you a better idea of what to expect and
vice-versa but aside from pure speed
it's also a good idea to do a little bit
of research to find out what kind of
longevity to expect from an SSD unlike a
hard drive which has magnetic platters
that can be written to indefinitely need
a big asterisk here as long as the
moving parts don't wear out that's what
that'll say the memory cells and SSDs
can only be written to so many times
although most modern SSDs can handle at
least several hundred terabytes of
writes before kicking the proverbial
bucket with higher-end models being able
to last a fair bit longer it can be
relevant if you're planning to use your
drive for more than a few years
especially as performance will start to
degrade over time as the memory cells
wear out a number of websites including
tech report have done independent
testing of just how many right cycles
popular SSD models can handle so how to
look at those if you want something that
will soldier on for a long time I hope
this helps you then in your quest for
the perfect SSD whether you're building
a new system we're just trying to
breathe some life into an old one just
make sure that you temper your
expectations because an SSD will make
the system feel more responsive but it
won't make that old packard-bell in the
Attic able to handle Crysis 3 speaking
of a crisis what if you found yourself
at home with no fresh shaving supplies
and the only way to get any shaving
supplies was to go out to the store you
went to the store and they had it all
behind lock and key and then when you
finally got the razor blades you so
desperately needed they wanted like 20
bucks for them and you were like what no
Dollar Shave Club will take care of that
by joining Dollar Shave Club you can get
razors and other bathroom supplies
shipped directly to your door for only a
few bucks a month
they've got razors they've got dr.
carver shave butter they've got their
won like Charlie's peppermints scented
face wipes for men you could use them on
your face they're actually butt wipes
but you could use them on your face as
long as you don't use them on your butt
first I mean you still could but please
don't because the peppermint scent is
not going to compensate anyway they've
got pre-shave moisture postage bleached
risers and they've got travel sizes
they've got a variety of razors all the
way up to a six blade executive which
has as you might imagine six blades and
it's just high-quality razors and
bathroom supplies with no vibrating
handles or other nonsense like that all
you got to do is head over to Dollar
Shave Club comm slash Linus they ship to
the US Canada and Australia and you can
start saving your time and saving your
money speaking of saving time I'm going
to do this outro really fast if you
liked like if you disliked disliked if
you want to see our other channels boom
right there if you want to comment with
a suggestion for a future boss as
possible that's below and if you want to
subscribe I'd really appreciate it very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
