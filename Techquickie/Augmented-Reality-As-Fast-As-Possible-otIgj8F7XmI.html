where the phrase my vision is augmented
won't just mean that someone's doing
their best JC Denton impression and I'm
not talking about nanotech either I'm
talking about augmented reality or AR
that thing that overlays graphics onto
your physical surroundings to make them
more functional in some way but Linus I
mean the only thing I've ever used AR
for is like playing with those little
cards that came with my Nintendo 3ds
this thing actually going to take off
although the technology is still
relatively new and developers are still
working on rolling out applications for
it to the masses more limited examples
of AR have been with us for quite a
while back in the early 1990s AR was
mostly used in industrial settings to
help with manufacturing processes but
later became well known in the sports
world when fans were introduced to the
yellow line that marks a first down
during a football game that is American
football excuse me or much more
infamously that glowing hockey puck with
a comet tail that Fox decided was a good
idea for some reason but after the
development of open source ar code in
the late 1990s and the advent of small
powerful and highly integrated devices
such as smartphones smart glasses and
even Bionic contact lenses the AR market
well it is really opening up with
developers increasingly searching for
ways to make your everyday world a lot
more exciting so how exactly are they
doing this for no one's surprise one way
is with games now we've already seen AR
smartphone games that encourage players
to interact with the real world whether
it's with like an included
remote-controlled dude a door or ingress
would be a great example of that as well
but imagine like an AR board or tabletop
game with virtual pieces that you and
your opponent control with you know
gestures regardless of whether the other
player is right next to you or a
thousand parsecs away safely out of arm
ripping off range or if you're more of a
PC gamer what about a pair of smart
glasses that could connect to your rig
to display something like a 3d map of
the area your characters in on your desk
while the action continues on your
monitor and
but speaking of monitors I mean would
you even need one anymore we're already
seeing AR devices such as microsoft's
hololens that can throw a virtual
monitor or TV screen onto a section of
blank wall no projectors required and
that can create new ways to design 3d
objects instead of being confined to a
keyboard and mouse smart glasses could
allow you to create a 3d model of your
project in real size that you can
manipulate with your own hands let me
they've done some great demos of this
and when it's time to leave the house an
a our windshield in your car could show
you directions and street names or
assist with braking and curves and a
pair of AR glasses could analyze your
surroundings and show you things like
pictures of our room in a nearby hotel
reviews of a restaurant you walk past
the plentyoffish profile of that cute
girl over there and if you want to know
the forecast it could even alter the sky
to show you what your environment will
look like tomorrow when it's sunny
alright so how long then before this
stuff actually becomes part of our daily
lives well there are some challenges to
overcome building massive databases to
store information about real-world
locations well okay actually that's
coming along pretty nicely but
developing convenient wearable gadgets
that people actually want to wear and
making sure that mobile batteries can
handle rendering 3d AR graphics without
dying in 30 minutes without strapping a
massive power pack to your face these
things will probably take a while but I
sure hope that I live to see the day
when you can actually run around in a
forest at night playing survival horror
games speaking of running around at
night and horror can you imagine if your
website wasn't working in the middle of
the night and you didn't have
