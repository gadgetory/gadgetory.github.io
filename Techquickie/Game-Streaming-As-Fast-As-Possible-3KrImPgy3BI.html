bought into the streaming on-demand
concept for movies and TV shows to the
point where the idea of going to the
video store to rent a DVD seems so crazy
that self-park managed to turn it into
the shining parody so why then do we as
gamers have such reservations about
letting go of our dedicated gaming box
be it a PC or a console in favor of a
streaming service well let's start with
explanations of some of the ways that
games can be streamed first is local
network streaming this has existed in
the form of Sony's remote play for PS
Vita and Nvidia's game stream for PC for
a couple of years the way it works is a
powerful gaming device sits somewhere
rendering your game frame by frame then
turning the output frames into a
compressed video stream nearly instantly
before beaming them to a much less
powerful and sometimes even portable and
wirelessly connected device sounds like
science fiction right well it's not it
actually works I tested in video game
stream with a high-speed camera and
found that it actually adds less latency
then the image processor built into some
televisions so from there then what if
rendering could be done in a data center
somewhere completely remote with the
resulting gaming experience beamed to
you over the Internet well that's where
industry giants like Microsoft Sony and
Nvidia are directing their attention now
Microsoft's vision seems to be to use
the cloud for heavy lifting and a less
powerful client to do the basics
delivering a bandwidth savings but also
increasing the complexity of the process
one reason why we haven't seen them do
much with this yet while Sony
ran out and purchased online and NVIDIA
is building out data centers full of
graphics processors around the world in
an attempt to make the video beaming
paradigm viable now and there's a lot of
cool stuff about this approach it
replaces an upfront cost for a new box
every few years with a monthly
subscription that particularly for light
users could actually end up being
cheaper thanks to bulk
licensing of games being done over by
the service provider
not to mention that paying only for the
time that you spend with those games
could be cheaper than going overkill on
a GTX 15,000 TI ultra or whatever just
for the few games that demand that kind
of horsepower when you spend most of
your time playing games that would run
on your thermostat if you turned it down
far enough but there are some challenges
too for some people the future is now I
mean I'm not a hard core of a decent
gamer but I can easily enjoy third
person games and even fighters with the
nearest GeForce now data center 1,500
kilometers away but many people will
need faster speeds lower latency and
bigger data caps on their internet
connections to make this viable though
services like Google Fiber are amazing
for making that future scenario become a
reality sooner and another consideration
is that not every gaming experience is
ideal for this VR for example will
likely need to run locally forever
to keep users from becoming nauseated so
as always it's going to be horses for
courses which I guess is the conclusion
that I came to when Nvidia approached us
about doing a fastest possible video
about the shield Android TV and I
countered with well I want to talk about
game streaming in general with a
sponsored bit at the end about how the
shield Android TV occupies a unique
position inside this rapidly changing
ecosystem so that's what I did and
here's the bit about the shield Android
TV as a PC gamer with a sick gaming rig
but very little time to sit in front of
it I've been an avid Nvidia game stream
user since the launch of the shield
portable since I can take that
experience with me to the other places
that I need to be like the bedroom or
the living room but that device lacks
some of the newer features that this new
gizmo has thanks to its Android TV
integration and upgraded internals like
4k 60fps Netflix and YouTube streaming
as well as support for other streaming
apps like sling plex Kodi and sports app
with voice control with the included
controller or optional remote and offers
up all the
Vantage's especially for more casual
users or guests who come over that I
just outlined before and it can handle
it all at up to 1080p 60fps and the
really unique thing is that thanks to
his Tegra x1 processor it also delivers
a surprisingly competent local gaming
experience in the growing number of
controller friendly android games and
other natively supported games like doom
3 Talos principle and war thunder you
can even stream straight to twitch from
the shield with a quick click of the
controller
so then Linus how much for one of these
set me back well if you're looking at
the shield Android TV you're looking at
199 bucks for the 16 gig flash based
model and $2.99 for the 500 gig model
and then you can beef up the gaming
experience with GeForce now for only 8
bucks a month after a 3 month free trial
so it's kind of an exciting time then to
be any type of game or isn't it I hope
if nothing else this episode of fast as
possible has given you some food for
thought about where the technology is
heading and what the limitations are
