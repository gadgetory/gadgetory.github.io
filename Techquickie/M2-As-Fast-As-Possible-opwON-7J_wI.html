storage technology has been to make
drives as small as possible and as fast
as possible and we've gone from having
four megabyte drives that are twice as
big as your average refrigerator in the
1950s to multi terabyte SSDs that are
not much bigger than a credit card yet
can still move gigabits of data per
second but even as popular as those
speedy two and a half inch SSDs are it
became clear that with advancements in
flash storage technology we could shrink
our digital repositories down even
smaller without sacrificing speed say
hello my friends - MDOT - a new
interface for both SSDs and expansion
cards that promises higher speeds and
less bulk you see although SATA 3 SSDs
offer huge performance gains compared to
traditional mechanical hard drives that
SATA interface that cable on the back
itself has a pretty serious bottleneck
topping out at about 550 to 600
megabytes per second and while that may
seem very fast and indeed it is flash
storage has advanced very rapidly in
recent years and is now capable of
handling data much more quickly than
SATA will allow and although SATA
Express which you can learn more about
here
was designed to alleviate this
bottleneck it is pretty difficult to
find SATA Express drives on the market
even though motherboards supporting it
are out there fortunately though n dot 2
provides the same speed benefits as SATA
Express with the extra advantage of
being much much smaller and more
versatile many m2 drives actually
utilize your computer's PCI Express bus
with the fastest MDOT 2 drives currently
on the market using a PCI Express 3.0 x4
connection translating tweak theoretical
maximum of 4 gigabytes per second
ha and although you probably won't see
real-world speeds quite that high
especially not right now
current m dot 2 PCIe drives will still
be much faster than a regular set
sisty and should continue to get faster
in the future and not too is also useful
for things other than storage devices
you can get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cards
that will fit into your motherboards m2
slot and take advantage of PCI Express
speeds without having a you know large
card plugged in or a dongle hanging out
of your case and even if you're just
using them got to for storage you still
get the additional benefit of not having
to mess around with any power or signal
cables slot in the card put in a screw
and you are good to go
but before you rush out to buy a new m2
SSD or wireless adapter or whatever
remember this not all m dot 2 cards and
slots are the same
faster m dot 2 drives will utilize the
newest version of PCI Express that is
3.0 as of right now as well as the new
nvme standard for interacting with the
rest of the system so be sure to check
for these things before you buy
especially as some m dot 2 drives use
pcie 2.0 the older AHCI protocol or even
the existing SATA bus so they're
basically just an M SATA card that fits
in an m dot 2 slot so in the case of
that last one you won't see any
performance benefit at all and you also
have to pay attention to the physical
layout of the card
unlike SATA m dot 2 even though it only
has one name uses several different
connector types so most m dot 2 slots on
current motherboards use either
connectors B or M for SSDs and a or E
for wireless adapters now some cards are
actually compatible with multiple
motherboard connectors so just make sure
that whatever you're buying you are
checking before you pull the trigger and
then finally size matters with em -
every uncaught - card regardless of its
connector type will have a number
indicating its dimensions such as 22 42
which means that it's 22 millimeters by
42 millimeters just so just like how
some cases will only fit graphics cards
up to a certain length some motherboards
and notebooks aren't compatible with
longer and dot 2 devices so I guess the
final word is this
although there may be more to remember
with MDOT to the extra speed and
flexibility is probably worth having to
pay a little bit of attention that is to
say unless the thought of leaving all
ten of those drive cages in you're
unnecessarily large gaming tower unused
makes you feel sad speaking of making
people sad you wouldn't want to make
Squarespace sad would you well if you
have an ugly website they would be sad
