do-it-yourself home fear which is
awesome but how do you go about choosing
the right components well one way is to
start by thinking of one of the most
fundamental concerns for any home
theater novice or veteran which is
electrical impedance a measure of how
much a speaker or wire will resist
electrical current this is important
because too little power will make your
nice new speakers sound like garbage you
see all speakers have an impedance
rating which is measured in ohms you
might be familiar with ohms if you're
into shopping for headphones
freestanding speakers however have a
much lower impedance rating then said
headphones would since they need a lot
more current to drive them most speakers
are rated between only six and eight
ohms so additional impedance introduced
through improper wiring can impede the
performance pretty badly fortunately
though knowing what kind of speaker wire
to buy isn't terribly difficult well as
true the consumers can be bedazzled and
befuddled by marketing hype the things
that are really very important are also
very simple it's just length and width
you can think of speaker wire kind of
like a water pipe not a great analogy
but either way just as it's easier to
push lots of water through a short fat
pipe compared to a long skinny one runs
of shorter thicker wire have a lower
impedance and therefore carry current
more easily which is important for any
speaker worth its salt and especially
important for higher-end speakers with
impedances of four ohms or less thinner
wires can be passable for very short
runs but if you're trying to install
something in a larger room or want any
kind of surround setup it's important to
pay attention to the gauge of the wire
which is a standard measurement of
thickness that can be a little confusing
since a smaller gauge number indicates a
thicker wire if you're rocking 8 ohm
speakers for example readily available
16 gauge wire will give you good
performance up to 50 feet but keep in
mind that since speakers can have
variable impedance depending on what
frequency they're playing at any given
time it's not a bad idea to pick up wire
a little bit thicker than you need in
order to compensate you should also try
to stay away from wire runs longer than
50 feet
of the thickness as it can cause you to
lose a little bit of the higher
frequencies due to coppers electrical
properties so what does this mean for
the average home theater user if you
take a typical room size of about 20 by
16 feet and put your display on one end
and use conservative estimates for wire
length and thickness a 60-foot spool of
16 gauge wire would serve you just fine
for your rear speakers while you can get
away with just about 30 total feet of 22
gauge for your front Center and
subwoofer this assumes you're using a
typical six to eight ohm speaker setup
and if you went with a higher set of say
four ohm speakers you'll want to go with
fourteen gauge for their surrounds and
twenty gauge for the stuff up front and
that's an at least for all of those okay
Luke I've got it short thick wires are
good but are those the only things that
matter those the only things I have to
worry about well it makes sense to make
sure that your wires are insulated well
to protect against interference and
maybe you should try using pin or banana
connectors rather than just sticking
bare wires into your speakers that can
help ensure that you have a solid
connection however spending hundreds of
dollars on premium cables in all
likelihood will not lead to any sort of
improvements in terms of sound quality
so save the money you would have spent
on that stupid snake oil and maybe put
it towards some shiny new TV that you
can watch tech wiki on with the room
shaking sound you've always wanted
