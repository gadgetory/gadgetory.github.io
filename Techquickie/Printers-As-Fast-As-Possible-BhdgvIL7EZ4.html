handing in a freshly printed essay from
your shiny new inkjet printer made you
the coolest kid in class at least in
your own mind anyway but nowadays
printers that could have cost you a
pretty penny in the mid-1990s are handed
out like candy with new PC purchases and
it's never been easier to afford
something that will inexplicably stop
working at 2:00 a.m. the night before
your term paper is due so how exactly do
printers work and what makes them well
some of them so unreliable now you
probably already know that the two main
types of printers for home and office
use are inkjet and laser unless of
course you've still got one of those old
dot-matrix printers from the 80s because
you get a kick at it tearing off those
little strips on the edge of the paper
and both of them have advantages and
disadvantages which we actually briefly
covered in this video
but let's have a look at them in a
little bit more depth first up we've got
laser printers which use you guessed it
a frickin laser beam to create prints
laser printers also contain a rotating
cylinder coated with a photosensitive
electrically charged material and a
series of mirrors when you send a
document to a laser printer the laser
light is reflected by the mirrors onto
the cylinder which neutralizes the
electrical charge in specific areas
thanks to the rotation of both the
cylinder and the mirrors as well as the
laser turning on and off at precisely
the correct moments the areas hit by the
laser correspond to the actual print and
when toner particles hit the cylinder
they only stick to the areas exposed to
the laser light because the toner itself
has an electrical charge to cool right
then a sheet of paper is pressed against
the cylinder and the toner is
transferred through to the paper using
heat which fuses the toner to it which
is why pages fresh out of a laser
printer are always so nice and cuddly
warm due to the precision of the laser
these kinds of printers are great for
producing crisp clear
the other major player the inkjet
printer is very very different like the
name says this sort of printer uses
liquid ink instead of solid toner
particles in consumer models ink inside
of those expensive cartridges is heated
with an electrical charge causing a
small amount to vaporize and form a
bubble on the nozzle the bubble then
collapses and the pressure difference
pulls a droplet of ink out of the
cartridge and onto the paper because
their internal workings are simpler than
laser printers they tend to be
significantly cheaper and although they
can't print as quickly they give much
better print quality for photos making
them the go-to choice if you like to
print your own snapshots at home
unfortunately though many inkjet owners
have been disappointed by their printers
reliability so then why is it that they
seem to give people such a hard time
well part of it is because printers have
so many small moving parts that can
break or wear out not to mention the
small nozzles that can clog easily but
perhaps a bigger part of the reason is
the business model of inkjet
manufacturers the printers themselves
are frequently sold at a loss
so ink refills can cost more than the
actual printers themselves also many
cartridges contain smart chips that
report that they're empty even if there
is still leftover ink but fortunately
there are workarounds for this you can
find online and we're even starting to
see alternatives appear on the market
such as Epsons new system that uses
permanent high-capacity ink tanks
instead of pricey cartridges which will
hopefully assure in the day when we no
longer need to sell vital organs just to
afford some vacation photo printouts
speaking of things with small moving
parts that need to be repaired I fix it
I fix it comm is the world's free online
repair manual they've got step-by-step
repair guides and QA with their massive
community I mean we're talking they've
got 15,000 plus repair guides for
iPhones iPads Macs Android devices got
other computers etc it's all wiki based
and therefore always up to date you know
as long as the communities on the ball
which actually they do a pretty darn
good job of and ifixit.com is totally
free with no ads or annoying paywalls
so how exactly does that work Linus
great question I fix it also sells a
wide variety of tools for repairing all
that aforementioned stuff with lifetime
warranties on the tools by the way they
got everything like their pro Tech tool
kit which we use all the time with all
these little hard to find bits and all
these little adapters a little magnetic
thing so you can like grab stuff out of
hard-to-reach places they've also got
their mat that helps you keep all your
screws organized they got their whole
bag that's got the tech tool kit the mat
and a ESD straps a multimeter all that
kinds of stuff so head over to
ifixit.com slash tech wiki and check out
not only their guide so you can salvage
some formerly not working electronics
but also their tools which make the job
a heck of a lot easier and more fun if
you're into that sort of thing so thanks
