be bombarded with misinformation mostly
people aren't intentionally misleading
you mostly usually they just don't
understand what they're selling but
you're the one who ends up getting
burned the biggest misconception is this
no you cannot compare performance by
looking at specifications take these
cards in completely different price
brackets for example this 4 gig graphics
card is only about $100 but no it is not
an amazing deal compared to this 4 gig
one for $1000 sure they're both GeForce
they both have DirectX 11 their clock
speeds are similar and the RAM amount is
the same but the thousand-dollar card is
easily more than an order of magnitude
faster than the hundred-dollar one
because these cards use different design
architectures here's an analogy a modern
loaded semi can travel around 1,400
miles on a single tank of fuel in 2009
Ford Fusion Hybrid traveled around 1,400
miles on a single tank of fuel these are
similar specs and they're both
interesting facts but they have nothing
to do with each other a semi has a 200
gallon fuel tank runs on diesel and
carries an enormous load while that
Hybrid has a seventeen and a half gallon
fuel tank runs on gas and electricity
and carries around one dude another
flawed method of comparing
specifications is to compare across
different graphics processor
manufacturers this chart is interesting
sure but I also have another big word
for it that starts with AI because it
cannot conclusively tell us which of
these is better than the other it just
doesn't work that way and that's not to
say that looking at specs is always a
total waste of time when comparing
products based on the same design
architecture and with similar
specifications to each other relative
performance can sometimes be inferred
but even this should be done with great
caution so at this point you're probably
getting frustrated how do we actually
compare performance real games you want
to know how they actually run on the
card that you're looking at this
information is definitely out there we
do graphics card reviews on the Linus
tech tips YouTube channel but it's
important to find a review that covers
the games that you want to play with
gear that's realistic for you for
example if you have a 1080p monitor
by based on a review where the cards
were tested at 4k resolution but there's
great news aside from my other channel
there are literally hundreds of sites
that review graphics cards a few of my
favorites in no particular order also
linked in the video description our
hardware conducts calm and on tech calm
and PC / calm okay so now you're sitting
there saying fine Linus but what about
all the stuff besides performance
stability heat output power consumption
and other software features these are
all important to me - well there's a ton
of information out there about that
stuff too but it's a little outside the
scope of this video and I know it can be
overwhelming but the odds are excellent
that if you go charging into a typical
PC hardware community asking questions
like who do you think has the best
drivers AMD or Nvidia you're going to
start an argument so at least let me
point you in the right direction
in my mind at the time of filling this
amd's key advantages are true audio
project mental and great multi-monitor
support with their Eyefinity technology
and videos key advantages are game
stream geforce experience with shadow
play and gsync which makes undesirable
effects like leg due to vsync and
tearing due to high frame rates
disappear and I guess if you want a game
in stereo 3d than 3d vision would also
be an advantage for Nvidia now I'm going
to try to update this video with
annotated links to my own explanations
of these technologies but it might take
me a while so in the meantime you can
head over to Linus tech tips calm our
community forum is I believe friendlier
than most so you can seek additional
clarity about these features speaking of
features our featured sponsor for this
