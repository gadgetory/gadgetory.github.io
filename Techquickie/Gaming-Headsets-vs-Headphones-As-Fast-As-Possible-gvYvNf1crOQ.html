exact CPU video card and monitor combo
to get so that your games will look
exactly how you want them to it can be
very easy to forget about how they will
end up sounding but when you do remember
oh yeah I guess I need to get some
speakers or headphones for my new rig
you might be hit with a flood of ads for
gaming headsets promising detailed audio
and precise directional sound so you can
tell exactly where those gunshots are
coming from but what are those headsets
really offering you that a more
conventional set of headphones paired
with a separate microphone wouldn't
typically gaming headsets will be a
package deal of sorts not only do you
get the headphones and the attached
microphone but often some kind of remote
control for volume different audio modes
or even in game settings some kind of
virtual surround functionality whether
it be 5.1 or 7.1 noise isolation to help
you shut out external sound when gaming
and that all-important gamer aesthetic
that some of you might be into often
gaming headsets seem like a good value
because they offer lots of different
functionality in one box and appeal to
people who just want a quick solution
for all their gaming audio needs that
they can just plug in and use and in
that vein many gaming headsets use a USB
connection instead of two separate
three-and-a-half millimeter analog
connections because they have their own
built-in sound processing so they'll
work even if your sound card or
integrated motherboard audio is broken
but if gaming headsets offer all these
great features then why is it that many
people prefer regular headphones with a
separate mic instead well it's back to
that convenience thing with the
convenience and all the cool features
that are packed into that gaming headset
comes a trade-off in terms of audio
quality a lot of the time so the gaming
headset manufacturers it's not that they
don't know how to make a good sounding
product it's just that for cost reasons
all the extra stuff that they're packing
is
is going to take away from money they
could have spent on making the
headphones themselves beefier so the
thing to ask yourself is do you even
need the functions that you get with a
gaming headset bearing in mind that some
of them can be replicated on regular
headphones since much of what's
advertised is often done through
software for example many of the
headsets that advertise multi-channel
surround actually achieve this entirely
through some aural trickery because
there are only actually two drivers in
there so you can download software that
gives you the same effect on whatever
headphones you're using not to mention
that the headsets that use a USB
connection cannot be used with a
different DAC and amp combination or
sound card so good luck trying to
improve the sound quality with one of
those and then even if your headset does
use a three-and-a-half millimeter jack
many are notorious for poorly
constructed drivers and worst
soundstaging than many popular headphone
models despite the fact that positional
audio is a major selling point for
gaming headsets but that isn't to say
that all gaming headsets are all bad
some of them are actually quite
well-constructed and while they won't
give you the same performance and things
like movies or music some manufacturers
even admit this outright this thing is
tuned for gaming you do get the benefit
of that easy all-in-one experience so if
the most film watching that you do is in
cutscenes in between shooting people
then a gaming headset may be for you
after all speaking of things that may be
