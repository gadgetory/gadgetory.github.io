then there's like server computers but
how different are they exactly
well any computer actually has the same
basic components processor working
memory storage etc and you may be
surprised to hear that fundamentally
they're not that different with some of
those components even coming off the
same assembly line but that doesn't mean
that you can just grab off-the-shelf
desktop components in like fashion
yourself a server I mean sure this core
i7 runs at 3.8 gigahertz and this Xeon
runs at 3.8 gigahertz but it costs way
more well hold on in just a second hold
off on the core i7 sometimes there's
more to it than gigahertz and gigabytes
and all those gigas so let's get this
list of differences kicked off number
one we just discovered server gear is
much more expensive for specifications
that often appear similar or even worse
at times but why you get inter
compatibility with other server grade
Hardware things like ECC and registered
RAM support a bullet point that's hidden
halfway down the product page for that
CPU from before now while using memory
that is slightly more resistant to
errors might not seem like a big deal to
a typical desktop user it's absolutely
critical for a server in a desktop
environment one little tiny rammer or
caused by like cosmic rays might cost
little Sally they cute picture she made
in ms paint but in a server it could
result in the loss of patients medical
records or who knows what else
not to mention speaking of inter
compatibility that server memory is
available in much higher capacities so
you got to have support for that we find
the next difference in the little
details the characteristics of a product
that don't always find their way onto a
spec sheet for example server and
workstation grade hardware uses higher
quality components and is subjected to
much more rigorous quality testing and
validation they not only are made to
handle heavier duty cycles but also live
longer overall while doing it now on to
features silent operation a bunch of USB
3 ports and like overclocking settings
out the wazoo are not the kinds of
things that server clients will want to
spend money on which doesn't mean that
they're cheapskates
they'll pay big money for stuff like
fancy networking capabilities remote
management interfaces and hardware
redundancy so the machine won't
experience any downtime even in the
event of a hardware failure on something
like a power supply and it's great that
they buy this stuff because it drives
the costs down for us guess top folks in
the future so my next point actually
ties at least partially into most of the
others server hardware is optimized for
different workloads for example on the
desktop our applications aren't heavily
multi-threaded so higher frequency
processors with fewer cores work really
well but a server might run an operating
system and software that takes much
better advantage of multiple processing
cores so we might get much better
results with a lower clocked server CPU
that has more processing cores or even
with multiple CPUs to further spread up
the workload and then finally there are
the optimizations made for the
environment in which a server will
operate for example a consumer and
enterprise grade hard drive might share
much of the same technology it's a bit
of a recurring theme here but a server
hard drive is much more resistant to
wear and tear from vibration something
that doesn't matter for our drive
sitting in the desktop by itself but
that is critical for a drive that's
surrounded on all sides by other drives
spinning and clicking away doing their
own work and there are so many little
things like this a server won't
compromise on power consumption or
increase size unnecessarily to squeeze a
little bit more performance out of the
hardware like a gaming rig would it's
all about how much computing power can
fit in as small a space as possible
while consuming as little power as
possible the general consumer has
different priorities in a big tower that
consumes a couple more watts doesn't
really matter when you got one family PC
in the house or even two or three or
four but if you were buying 5000 of them
it would be a different story
which is exactly how I'm going to segue
awkwardly reaching for it here into our
sponsor message about razors if once per
year I had to go buy one razor the time
and money that I wasted driving to the
store and like slaying the guardian of
indifference who holds the key of
unnecessary existence that unlocks the
secret shelf of razor door just to get a
close comfortable shave on my face then
that would be an issue
problem is that you have to do it all
the time and that's where Dollar Shave
Club comes in for a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club delivers razors
straight to your door every month
without any hassle or BS the blades are
well they're that the service is prompt
and the quality is as good as or better
than the brand-name ones join the club
now dollarshaveclub.com slash lines and
check out their shaving supplies as well
as their one wipe Charlies which are
peppermint scented butt wipes for men
they're really great i've been getting
all kinds of compliments on the smell of
my butt since i started using them
thanks for checking out this episode of
fast as possible like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future episodes of fast as possible
or if you just have something to say
about you know this video or the smell
of my butter whatever else we're totally
open to your feedback actually maybe we
should avoid that last topic you know I
don't want this video to get flagged for
inappropriate content like wow that's
the most amazing butt ever and I think
we're done here don't forget to
subscribe to tech wiki for more videos
