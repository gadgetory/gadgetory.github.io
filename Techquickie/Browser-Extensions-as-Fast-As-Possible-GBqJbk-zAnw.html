functionality of a web browser to the
point where it could be an entire PC
operating system was the twinkle in
Google's eye enterprising developers
have been trying to make the internet a
little more exciting with walls of
toolbars for sweepstakes coupons asking
questions of the world's most
knowledgeable Butler and virtual pets
that would sing talk and load malicious
code onto your unsuspecting PC but as
clunky and awful as those early add-ons
were they were actually the forerunners
of modern browser extensions
that's right browser extensions don't
actually have to be slick and minimalist
like everything you see today in fact an
extension is basically just any piece of
software that adds functionality to your
browser in some way
there are huge libraries of these
extensions available for Chrome and
Firefox with Microsoft's new edge
browser finally having the possibility
of supporting those libraries in the
future so what are these extensions
actually come from well they're usually
a few that come directly from the
publisher of your web browser such as
the ever-popular Google Mail checker for
Chrome but the vast majority of them are
written by third-party programmers
checked for bugs and then published in
some sort of official store by Mozilla
Google or whoever else wrote your web
browser either for free or with a
usually small cost associated with them
ok so I know what they are I know where
they come from but why would I want them
well in much the same way that Apple
never expected anyone to use their phone
as a flashlight extensions are limited
only by some basic publication rules and
the creativity of developers so there
are plenty of reasons to love them here
are some examples of things extensions
can do automatically apply discount
codes to vote having you search for them
reveal who's tracking your online
activity through cookies block
distracting websites when you're up
really late trying to finish that term
paper in the last freaking minute
customize the look of popular websites
however you could possibly want recover
that massive reddit rant that you lost
because you accidentally hit the back
button and even show you crowd-sourced
summaries of EULA's so you don't end up
allowing someone to harvest your organs
in the middle of the night in exchange
for some free music or something
but before you go out and install every
browser extension known to man here are
some important considerations first of
all although most browser extensions are
small files that you download quickly
they can still tie up your computer's
resources especially if you try to run
too many of them at the same time and
secondly and this is much more important
poorly secured and even nefarious
browser extensions are still out there
even after the official stores have
vetted them so be sure to read reviews
along with the fine print before you
install everything some extensions can
spy on your browsing habits without
telling you and others might even funnel
other people's traffic through your
connection as was the case with the
Jolla VPN extension a while back but as
long as you're careful about what you
install extensions can enhance your
browsing experience just as much as they
can enhance your tired old look speaking
of enhancing things lynda.com allows you
