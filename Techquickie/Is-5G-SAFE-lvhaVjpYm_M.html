smartphones could actually cause cancer
from the radiation that they give off in
the form of cellular and Wi-Fi signals
you can check it out up here but the
main takeaway is no you don't have
anything to worry about but here we are
in 2019 and some of the same concerns
are getting raised yet again this time
about 5g although 5g promises to deliver
faster speeds to our phones and there
are even home-based internet solutions
that use 5g the fact that 5g travels
over higher frequency radio waves has
led to speculation that it might be
riskier to use than older generation
wireless standards so how much truth is
there to this and why are people
concerned in the first place well to
start with 5g uses what's often called
millimeter wave frequencies which are
shorter than the typical frequencies
used by 4G and Wi-Fi signals and
therefore higher in energy in fact while
LTE can use frequencies of around 2.5
gigahertz and Wi-Fi often works on the 5
gigahertz band millimeter wave
frequencies used by 5g can be up to 300
gigahertz so we're not talking about
like a small incremental leap here so
then could all this extra energy end up
being harmful in ways we haven't seen
before well some of the folks and
advocacy groups that believe it is point
to actions taken by the International
Agency for research on cancer or iar see
specifically the fact that they've
classified RF electromagnetic fields in
short radio waves as possibly
carcinogenic to humans as evidence that
it is well that sounds pretty alarming
doesn't it well it might until you
consider that many things that most of
us find innocuous like a cup of coffee
actually fall under exactly the same
category you see if you dig into what
the IAR sees definition of possibly
carcinogenic is they mean that there's
only a limited amount of evidence that
an agent might cause cancer
so there might be some kind of weak
correlation that's been observed in
studies but that is a very far cry from
there being any kind of real causal link
that's been found so IR C's approach is
to err on the safe side with anything
that it classifies a bit like how
everything that you buy has a label on
it saying the state of California thinks
this thing might cause cancer but this
hasn't stopped people from hearing the
words possibly carcinogenic and running
with it in fact a couple places in
Europe were hesitant to test new 5g
infrastructure citing health concerns
and there were even rumors that there
were widespread bird deaths in the
Netherlands due to 5g trials well turned
out those birds were just eating
poisonous plants I guess there's a
reason that bird brain is an expression
anyway the reason that we have nothing
to fear from 5g is that radiation has to
be much higher frequency to be what's
called ionizing ionizing radiation can
mess with the molecular structure of
your DNA and cause cancer the thing is
the threshold for this is around a
million gigahertz much higher than the
300 or so that can be used by 5g and at
that point you're not even dealing with
radio waves anymore you're dealing with
ultraviolet light which is why sunscreen
bottles talk about UV protection on the
label now with all of that said we're
not claiming that 5g or any other piece
of technology that we use can't cause
cancer or other health problems by some
mechanism that we haven't yet discovered
or don't fully understand yet the thing
is though my advice would be to go
forward live your life without too much
fear and pick up that hot new 5g phone
if you're into it now if you'll excuse
me I have to go pick up a large sack of
cash that the mobile phone industry left
for me out back bye oh wait no actually
the cash comes from Squarespace create a
beautiful website with Squarespace is
all-in-one platform there are word
winning templates make creating a
powerful online identity even easier
than ever before and every template is a
