really isn't all that great I mean sure
you can get from New York to LA in six
hours but unlike driving where you can
pull off the highway and hit up the
nearest Arby's when you get a hankering
when you're on a plane you're basically
crammed into a 500 mile an hour
glorified bus with wings and a bunch of
sweaty strangers and if you decided to
step out for a snack well I hope you
packed your parachute but even though
the airlines have been hitting us over
the head recently with bag fees and
disappointing food offerings they have
at least tried to make flying a little
more tolerable by offering us in-flight
wireless internet huzzah but how exactly
does Wi-Fi work when you're six miles
off the ground why is it so spotty and
is it possible to make it better in the
future
well when inflight Wi-Fi first became a
thing in the early to mid 2000s it
usually worked by beaming an internet
connection to a transponder attached to
the plane using satellites similar to
how folks in rural areas without cable
DSL or fiber infrastructure use
satellite dishes to get online today
these systems are still in use along
with another system called air-to-ground
transmission or ATG this takes the form
of towers similar to cell phone towers
which have the advantage of being a lot
cheaper than satellite internet but they
obviously only work over land I haven't
seen any floating cell phone towers on
open barges yet and there are other
disadvantages too not only do these
towers suffer from geographical
restrictions but the service they
provide can be painfully slow as anyone
who's ever tried to stream anything on a
plane probably knows in the US for
example there's only a three megahertz
slice of the radio spectrum assigned to
airline internet so you compare that to
the average home Wi-Fi connection we
can use anywhere from twenty to a
hundred and sixty megahertz so this ends
up meaning then that eighty G systems
don't provide great speeds usually
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
five megabit per second satellite
internet is faster with speeds of up to
50 megabit per second on what's called
the Ku band which is the same range of
spectrum used to be satellite TV to your
house but with how many people can fly
on an average commercial airliner like
the Boeing 737 at once even a 50 megabit
connection can mean doing something as
simple as downloading a word document
can be frustratingly slow if lots of
passengers are connected at the same
time one of the reasons aside from the
usual corporate breed that Wi-Fi costs
extra on your flight and current tech
also requires airlines to pull bulky
antennas onto their planes these are
heavy enough to have a significant
effect on the plane's weight and
aerodynamics meaning higher fuel costs
which are passed along to you the poor
sucker who's just trying to fly home for
Christmas but the days of inevitably
crappy in-flight internet may finally be
numbered as major air carriers are now
starting to install cob and ka-band
satellite antennas which have the
potential due to their higher bandwidth
to reach hundreds of megabytes per
second enough for streaming even on a
crowded plane where lots of people are
trying to connect in fact JetBlue in the
United States has already deployed the
new tech on some of its planes so keep
an eye out if you'll be using them to
get to your final destination and even
better than that actually some of the
new command antennas such as one being
developed by the kinetic corporation in
Washington State are much thinner and
less power-hungry than their
predecessors encouraging airlines to
install them on more planes without
having to worry about how they'll affect
flight performance so maybe one day soon
you'll be able to livestream your next
transcontinental flight and show your
captivated audience just how appalling
the
condition of the lavatory really is
speaking of the lavatory no I can't tie
this together at all okay are you racing
against the clock as a freelancer a
small business owner it's challenging
yes but with the growth of the Internet
there's never been more opportunities
for the self-employed and to help meet
this need of all these small
entrepreneurs everywhere freshbooks is
excited to announce an all-new version
of their cloud accounting software it's
been redesigned for the way you work
it's the simplest and easiest way to be
more productive more organized and
freaking most importantly especially
when you're starting up to get paid
quickly you can create and send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds you can set up online
payments with just a couple of clicks to
get paid up to four days faster which
light can be the freaking difference and
you can even see when your client has
seen your invoice to put an end to all
those guessing games
so FreshBooks is offering a 30-day
unrestricted free trial to our viewers
and all you got to do to claim it is
