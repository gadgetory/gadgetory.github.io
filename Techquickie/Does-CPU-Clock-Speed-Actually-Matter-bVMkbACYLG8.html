the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos it's no
secret that marketers really like
numbers whether it's horsepower on a car
screen size on a TV or the number of
items on the buffet there's this general
idea that people are drawn to large
numbers and computer processors are no
exception if you're shopping for a new
system it's pretty easy to find
retailers that prominently listed the
processors gigahertz there's just one
small problem
it's basically an utterly meaningless
metric these days and has been for at
least the last 10 years
now we touched on why you shouldn't just
go buy raw speed when you're buying a
processor in this video but we're gonna
go into it in a little more detail today
first off speed in megahertz or
gigahertz measures how many clock cycles
a CPU goes through each second and a
cycle is basically what happens when an
electrical pulse hits your CPU allowing
it to execute instructions and keep its
activity in sync with the rest of your
system so this means that a processor
rated at 4 gigahertz can handle a
billion more cycles per second than one
rated at 3 what's simple enough to
understand but things get more
complicated when you consider what
happens during a clock cycle one big
determining factor of a CPUs performance
is how many instructions that can
execute per clock cycle modern
processors can work on more than one
instruction at a time - thanks to
pipelining which you can think of as
being similar to how an electronics
factory can turn out a huge number of
smart phones per day even though it
might take a long time for one phone to
make it all the way through the assembly
line so different stages of production
are pipelined to take place
simultaneously so that the guy that
installs the screen isn't constantly
waiting around for the next phone to
work on pipelining in CPUs is similar in
principle but quite a bit more
complicated and engineers use different
methods to allow the processor to chop
up instructions into parts that can be
worked on simultaneously or even combine
smaller operation
to complete them in fewer cycles
increasing efficiency exactly how this
gets accomplished depends on the
specific microarchitecture of the
processor which can learn more about up
here but bringing things back to the
topic at hand it means that because the
number of instructions per clock cycle
and the pipelining efficiency can very
enormous ly between CPU brands and even
the individual models from a single
brand clock speed can end up being very
deceiving CPUs also need to be able to
read ahead on the page so to speak to
work efficiently modern programs aren't
all that linear and need to be able to
respond to many different user inputs
quickly I mean just think about how fast
you expect your PC to show you the right
thing after firing your weapon after
someone else throws a grenade in a high
budget video game so CPUs are designed
to examine out of order instructions and
make sure that they're executed such
that they don't interfere with other
parts of the program as well as to
anticipate what instructions might be
needed next a feature called a branch
prediction CPUs with better branch
prediction can have significantly better
performance and again this is something
you simply won't be able to determine
just from looking at the clock speed and
there are many other factors that tie
into the performance as well like the
type of RAM that is supported the types
of instructions that are supported
remember with MMX and CPUs can come with
different types and amounts of cache
memory you can learn more about it up
here but basically it's this super fast
memory that stores small pieces of data
that the CPU thinks it will need in a
hurry so a processor with a well
implemented cache can fetch things it
has to work on much more quickly finally
if you're working on CPU intensive tasks
like video encoding or file compression
having many cores to spread the workload
out and crunch more data in parallel can
speed things up more than a clock speed
boost now don't get me wrong
clock speed shouldn't be ignored
completely if it was totally irrelevant
there wouldn't be a thriving community
of overclockers trying to squeeze as
many megahertz as they can out of there
chips for dem performance gains and it
can be a useful indicator of performance
as long as you are only using it to
compare CPUs with the same
microarchitecture features and number of
course or if you are compensating
appropriately for the other differences
that exist the point is just that it
shouldn't be a huge factor in your
buying decision just like you probably
shouldn't choose a car based on how many
cupholders it has that is unless you
really like fast food speaking of fast
do you ever find the pace of work
whether you're a freelancer or a small
business owner is making it impossible
to reconcile all your accounting well
FreshBooks
is there for you it's the simplest and
easiest way to be more productive more
organized and perhaps most importantly
get paid faster you can create and send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds you can set up online
payments with just a couple of clicks to
get paid up to four days faster you can
see when your client has seen your
invoice to put an end to the guessing
games and you can take the whole
experience with you on the go my phone's
not in my pocket usually I hold up my
phone during this part with their fully
featured apps for iOS and Android you
can just imagine what kind of phone I'm
using according to your preferences so
freshbooks is offering a 30-day
unrestricted free trial to our viewers
and to claim it you just got to go to
FreshBooks comm slash tech quickie we're
gonna have that links below and enter
tech quickie and how did you hear about
us section so thanks for watching guys
like dislike check out our other videos
don't forget to comment if you have a
suggestion for a future fast as possible
and subscribe don't think of it as
subscribe that sounds like bad scribe
think of it it's like super scribe
amazing scribe there's also that Bell
