in the form of bottlenecking whether
you're stuck in traffic trying to get to
work before you get fired trying to cram
as many hot dogs as you can into your
mouth for an ill-advised eating
competition or actually building one of
those little ship-in-a-bottle things but
sometimes bottlenecks are a little bit
less obvious as they often are with SSDs
lots of common tasks on an SSD might
seem nearly instantaneous especially for
users migrating from a mechanical hard
drive but what if you're working with
larger files are hitting your drive with
lots of requests at once although SATA
SSDs will still give you much better
performance in those situations than
your old spinning hard drive did they're
actually seriously limited in a couple
of ways first SATA has an upper transfer
limit about 600 megabytes per second
flash storage tech used in SSDs has been
capable of much faster speeds for quite
a while but because of the SATA speed
limit even top-end SATA 3 drives won't
advertise or even give you speeds higher
than 600 megabytes per second max second
SATA drives communicate with the rest of
your computer using a standard called
the advanced host controller interface
or a HCI
and even though that might sound fancy
and high-performance HCI wasn't really
designed with SSDs in mind it was more
of a way to make mechanical hard drives
work a bit faster and enable features
like hot swapping these things are
useful and great but HCI was optimized
for slow read/write heads that can only
deal with so much data at a time not
SSDs that are capable of accessing tons
of their own data at once drive
manufacturers responded by rolling out
SSDs that use the much faster PCI
Express bus which has a speed limit of
nearly 4 gigabytes per second with an x4
card and connects more directly to the
CPU than SATA reducing latency but in
order to reach their potential they
needed a faster way of accessing data
than a HCI
enter non-volatile memory Express or
nvme the new access standard for PCI
Express SSDs nvme takes advantage of the
SSDs ability to read or write lots of
things at once by parallelizing
instructions kind of like a multi-core
processor can split certain workloads
over multiple cores in order to get
things done faster the biggest
difference between nvme and ahci
something called command queuing which
refers to how many requests for data a
drive can handle at one time
HCI can handle one cue at a time with up
to 32 pending commands a sensible number
for a hard drive with a slow moving head
but very inefficient for a faster SSD
nvme relieves this bottleneck by
providing over 65,000 queues that can
handle over 65,000 commands each meaning
nvme drives can stay super fast even if
you're throwing a ton of stuff at them
you can find nvme not only in SSDs that
plug into the PCI Express slot but also
m2 and SATA Express drives which use the
PCI Express bus you can learn more about
those drives here before you run an
upgrade though be sure your computer's
BIOS will support it as many biases from
just a few years ago don't actually
fully recognize nvme drives but if
you're all set a shiny new nvme drive
will make bottlenecking a thing of the
past at least until the next time you're
waiting to be subjected to the wand of
shame at the airport lynda.com with a

liked the video like it sorry we
so late on an nvme video I actually
thought we had one if you just liked it
dislike it we have a pretty cool video
coming on channel super fun very soon
where we prank the crap out of Yvonne
