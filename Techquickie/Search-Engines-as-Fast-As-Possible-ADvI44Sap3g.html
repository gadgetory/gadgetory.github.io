remember the before times the long long
ago
aka before the Internet it used to be
that when two people would argue about
something vitally important like which
bands sang a particular hit from the
1980s they would have to settle it by
asking a third party dusting off a tome
of knowledge delivered straight to their
door by a handy dandy salesman or by
simply assuming their friend was wrong
as always nowadays if we need to know
something quickly we take it for granted
that we can Bing it and find an answer
almost immediately sorry ha I couldn't
keep a straight face there we take for
granted that we can google it and find
an answer almost immediately but what
even many of our us techno files forget
is that the internet didn't magically
bring with it the ability to find
anything in this giant computer network
and that early netizens were basically
limited to browsing websites they
already knew how to access or were able
to guess that is until some clever
programmers decided that information on
the Internet would be much more useful
if it were made readily available to
people and so the concept of the modern
day search engine was born the first
generations of search engines were a bit
cruder than those that we use today and
mostly consisted of simple website
listings with little to no information
beyond their basic titles but as the
information superhighway began to fill
with more and more traffic it quickly
became clear that websites would need to
be tracked using a slew of methods
beyond titles so bought programs known
as web crawlers or spiders were created
to automatically scan websites for links
and content information such as keywords
titles synonyms Access frequency
relevancy rating authenticity
credibility stan kenton etc to be
cocooned neatly in our little web of
indexes for users to access by way of a
search bar but if all it took to create
a successful search engine was throwing
more stuff into a big database then we
might still be asking Jeeves for things
no the programmers and mathematicians
who work for top modern search providers
are constantly devising ways
they can use algorithms to find the most
important pieces of data that are
related to a user's search let's say
Linus tech tips so they deliver a bunch
of links to that website in a top-down
fashion as opposed to technology tips
about lions or something but even that
is not enough anymore and the best
search engines even use data based
information they've collected about
their users to help deliver better more
tailored results and while that level of
attentiveness is useful in minimizing
daily hassles such as search times we
have to decide at some point if a
corporation knowing we meant Apple and
not Apple is more important than the
privacy that we give up because as many
have already realized it's no
coincidence that the advertisements on
every page we visit feature the specific
new game or PC part that we've been
drooling over for some time which ooh
well um hmm this is awkward well which
normally ahem contains leave whatever it
is you've been drooling over for some
time and this entices advertisers into
purchasing ad space that directly
targets users who are interested in
their products or services at a premium
even though in this case it clearly
misfired something that helps them
charge more for the ads since the theory
does actually work in practice and
targeted ads have become so commonplace
that from my experience folks are now
not only more likely to click them but
even get bothered when they see non
targeted irrelevant website ads go
figure
speaking of ads here's one now that I
think will be relevant to many of you
