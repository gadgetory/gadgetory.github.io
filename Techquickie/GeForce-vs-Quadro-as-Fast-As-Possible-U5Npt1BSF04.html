delivers some pretty bleep hacks or FPS
is a look I don't care doesn't matter
the point is that it's the cat's pajamas
and it's got a price tag that reflects
that to what you might reply oh that's
nothing Linus there's this other six GFX
card that it's going to get so much more
FPS I think I know what you're talking
about and I do see how the logic works
this one's $500 and this one's 5,000 so
like it must get 10 times more FPS right
sorry no it won't a little bit of
Investigation about this particular card
reveals that the actual graphics core
powering it is the very same gk110 as
you would find in a regular old gtx 780
at one tenth of the price
and while pc hardware may be powered by
magic blue smoke no amount of magic
makes a chip with the same design
manufactured on the same process node
perform that much better than the same
thing on another card all right so fine
- I get it these aren't a great value
for gaming but this makes no sense if
they're basically the same thing why
does one cost $5,000 well there are a
few reasons but the biggest one is that
the target customers for this product
large content production Studios oil and
resource exploration firms and the like
have a lot more money than you and me
and these products help them make so
many more bucket loads of money that
they can easily justify the cost so in
video would be crazy not to take
advantage of that and besides a Quadro
and a geforce running the same chip
aren't quite the same thing for starters
Nvidia controls the specifications and
quality assurance on all quadrille cards
unlike geforce cards which are left to
the board partners so you're going to
get more DisplayPort outputs unique form
factors like single slot cards and
professional-grade Hardware validation
starting at its heart a Quadro is going
to get a GPU that is cherry picked for
the best reliability lowest power
consumption and lowest heat output then
it's going to get equipped with a larger
video memory frame buffer that features
error correction technology following
that it's going to get special drivers
that are validated for seamless
operation with the professional-grade
applications that these kinds of cards
work best for 3d modeling animation and
such and finally quadrille cards have
one key feature enabled in manufacturing
that lies dormant on most geforce cards
with titan be
the only current exception
double-precision floating-point
capabilities put all these things
together and you've got a card that is
less susceptible to random errors works
more reliably and for longer and can
perform calculations and draw images
with a much greater degree of precision
than its consumer grade counterpart now
this is the part where you probably want
to jump in and say well hold on a second
Linus none of that really sounds like it
justifies the extra expense it seems
like NVIDIA is actually kneecapping the
consumer cards as opposed to drizzling
special sauce on the pro ones and imma
let you finish but actually yeah I can't
really argue with that assessment what I
will say in defense of this practice is
that a the pro-grade stuff does
legitimately cost some more to make be
gamers don't really need this stuff I
mean did you ever actually sit there
going well jeez if only the position of
my character's head could have been
calculated to 15 decimal things and see
everyone does it this paintbrush is made
of the same hair from an animal's rear
end as some consumer grade one it's a
bit better and it costs a lot more at
least something positive comes out of
this practice when it comes to tech
though pros paying top dollar for gear
gives innovative companies the Rd money
that they need to deliver better
products for US consumers down the road
so even though we can't afford that card
that's suitable for complex weather
simulations today at least a year from
now our games will run faster than ever
and we can thank the folks who spend a
lot of money on Quadros and fire GL's
and other professional-grade equipment
for that
