YouTube videos one man towers above them
all sigh the guy who did that song in
Gangnam style but thanks to you the
viewers we haven't done to Bali for
ourselves here at Tech wiki either we
passed 1 million subscribers not too
long ago and are hoping to hit a million
and a half sometime this summer so let's
have a look at how our little technology
compendium all started as well as a bit
of a behind-the-scenes look as to how we
crank out new videos for you guys every
week you see back in 2013 the channel
was originally envisioned as a place for
paid content basically meaning
commercials for products from companies
like Coursera who was Linus Media
Group's first ever sponsor and those
commercials were a little interesting
but we thought our viewers might like
them sort of like how some people watch
the Superbowl just for the advertisement
but the idea for fast as possible
follows soon after and if you have a
look at some of our older videos they
were much shorter one or two minutes of
defining a term and running through some
bullet points in fact early episodes
weren't even scripted and were shot in
batches five at a time in those days
poor Edsel was editing all of them I
didn't just edit that's possible I made
fast as possible what it is as well as
all daily videos over online as tech
tips as well as sponsor projects so it
probably isn't surprising that we
started hiring more as or soon after
including Karen and Nick van Berkel
Karen really helped jazz up the channel
with higher production values that made
our videos more visually interesting and
Nick evey brought his own sense of humor
to tech with you with his silly editing
style that we've tried to continue to
maintain to this day and with this
expansion of our team textbook you've
started to become a place for more
conceptual videos instead of just
spouting off features for things like
new revisions of USB episode is
explaining topics such as
save PC temperatures and how the pickett
power supply became the norm but these
kinds of episodes took longer to write
and because Linus is writing most of
them on his own with some help from Nick
light of all people seriously the sales
guy he Howard years truly and running
the channel became basically my
full-time job Dennis are current
at cookie editor started here at linus
media group the exact same day as i did
actually and we're currently a
two-person team I contribute scripts
research and ideas for visuals while
Dennis does a fantastic job
shooting and editing so how does a tech
with the episodes go from spark and
someone's head to a finished episode
well first either I or another team
member comes up with ideas or gets
inspiration by keeping an eye on various
trends or even taking suggestions from
our viewers on the forum the comment
section or Twitter the next step is for
me to research the topic and write the
script making sure of course that
everything you say is well sourced after
reviewing the script - to make sure he
thinks is not a worthless piece of poop
and that I should just pack my things
and moved back to North Carolina then it
shoots the episodes with the host
typically Linus root on our green screen
set then after about a day of editing
and creating animations and a quick
review from me
the episode is basically finished of
course our sales team also works hard to
get ad sauce at the end of our videos so
that we can keep the lights on and
continue to crank out videos for all 1.3
million of you to enjoy and while we're
on the subject of our subscriber count
let's go check out the gold play button
YouTube centers to commemorate here's a
million subscriber mark come on let's go
you really did okay so get it out at all
oh man you only have a brief ok 1 1 2 3
hey wait a minute look at this thing
this is like way smaller than LP he's
Halon is why do you get the big play
button oh right yeah look at this what
do they not understand that I've always
got of ideas and Dennis's creativity is
stunted so he's so far from Taiwan
Ruff's top notch me yeah like really
well anyway guys my canned food if you
liked it dislike if you didn't I'll
leave a comment send me your ideas for
new faculty videos and tweet me at JM
art 604 let me know what you guys think
Solicitors immediate line if you don't
nearly human stuff yeah let's do it come
on let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
