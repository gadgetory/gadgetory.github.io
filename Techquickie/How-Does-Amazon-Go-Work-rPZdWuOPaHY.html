alright so it's Friday evening right
after work and you've run low on
provisions yet again maybe the grocery
store is packed to the gills with
customers and even the self checkout
lines are long or maybe you have to buy
something that you'd rather not anyone
see you leaving the store with hmm so
wouldn't it be nice to have a way around
the crowds the long waits the vague
sense of embarrassment you get when you
had an 18 pack of toilet paper to the
cashier so this is one of the ideas
behind Amazon go a new concept grocery
store that allows you to walk in grab
what you need or maybe some things you
don't and walk right out without any
pesky human interaction and to be clear
it isn't just a glorified place for you
to pick up things you've already ordered
like we've seen with Amazon's locker
system the only pre-visit setup is to
download the Amazon Go app on your phone
and Link it to your Amazon account when
you walk inside you'll scan your phone
against a turnstile and when you're all
done shopping you just walk out Amazon
has even put up signs everywhere saying
this exact thing turning just walked out
into a slogan to sell customers on its
simplicity but how exactly is a keeping
track of what you buy well some of the
inventory control features are fairly
obvious like weight sensors under the
products kind of like what you see in an
overpriced hotel minibar that can detect
when a box of cashews has been lifted
off of them but unlike that system
amazon's is smart enough that it won't
charge you if you put it back but much
of the real magic actually happens above
you so if you look up in the rafters
you'll see an array of hundreds of
cameras and sensors not only keeping an
eye on things but feeding information
about customers moving around the store
the servers that use machine learning to
determine exactly what you've put inside
your a shopping bag or your backpack or
whatever now aside from saying that they
don't use facial recognition into this
process and that some products are
tagged with special patterns that help
the cameras pick them out amazon has
been relatively tight-lipped about
exactly how this process works which
makes it either a little magical or a
little creepy depending on your
perspective one thing we have seen
though is that it does appear that
profiling a customer's body
shape and size is part of this special
sauce as one of the issues that Amazon
has engineered tangled with prior to
launch was the system is taking one
customer for another if they looked
physically similar now these little
imperfections mean that Amazon staffers
are sold supervising all of this
automation plus they need a surprisingly
large number of human employees of the
store to help customers prepare
ready-to-eat meals and check ideas for
those of you who want to partake in
adult libations apparently the state of
Washington hasn't decided is ready to
trust computers to keep smirnoff ice out
of the hands of unsuspecting college
pros but wait why am i specifically
calling out Washington State well the
only Amazon go store currently open to
the public is in downtown Seattle in one
of the same buildings that houses
Amazon's headquarters and Amazon has
been cagey about providing details about
his plan to expand to more locations in
the future probably because outfitting a
store like this not only requires a huge
financial commitment up front but
according to Amazon also a ton as
computing resources to function properly
so it won't happen overnight but Amazon
is betting that their new go store might
resemble the future of retail and
there's been loss of speculation that we
might see similar tech employees at
Whole Foods which Amazon now owns an
idea that's already catching criticism
for reasons from concerns about huge
amounts of data mining to automation
putting people out of work to making it
easier to overspend since there's
nothing stopping you from walking out
with perhaps more than you need however
you might feel about all that though we
tried it and if you find yourself in
Seattle any time soon I'd say it's worth
giving it a shot so let us know down in
the comments if buying some fancy
expensive cheese without the rigmarole
of going through a checkout may you feel
liberated or just kind of funny smelling
and broke but speaking of being broke or
hopefully not being broke are you racing
against the clock as a freelancer it's
challenging but with the growth of the
Internet there has never been more
opportunities for the self-employed to
