folks call it has nothing to do with
books or personal grooming implements
but rather it is a ghost file on your
computer's hard drive you can't normally
see it and you can't manually access it
but it is constantly having data written
to it temporarily then wiped when it's
not needed anymore
it acts as an overflow for your system
memory or RAM which holds the data
needed for all of your running programs
and while it's much much slower than Ram
it's better than having your system
completely lock up when you launch one
too many chrome tabs and run out of
system memory to access the settings for
your page file open up the control panel
go to system then security then system
then advanced system settings then the
Advanced tab then the settings button
under performance then the Advanced tab
and finally the Change button under
virtual memory there are lots of cool
dials and switches in here so what do
they all do well nothing until you
uncheck automatically manage paging file
size for all drives then you can add and
remove paging files on any of your
partitions set a custom minimum and
maximum size and even turn it off
entirely so let's start with the most
hotly debated topic in here that no
paging file checkbox many users feel
that Windows is under utilizing their
RAM when it pushes a minimized program
out of memory and into the paging file
causing the system to stutter a little
bit when you maximize it again some
people have so much RAM that they could
never expect to use it all at once so
they're like yeah awesome
bring it on more responsiveness now to
be clear pressing this button will do
what you think it does it will force
Windows to keep all the running programs
in your lightning-fast system memory and
while that may sound very tantalizing to
these folks and while I've personally
run my system with no paging file in the
past and not observed any ill effects
there are many reports from
knowledgeable folks of strange behavior
on systems without a paging file
including even applications that
flat-out refuse to run even though the
PC still has plenty of RAM on top of
that super fetch which was introduced
with Windows Vista uses system memory to
cache frequently used files and make
your system more responsive in other
ways well that will have
around to work with and be less
effective as well so there's a trade-off
there all right so you're telling me I
shouldn't turn it off well what about an
optimal size the general rule of thumb
on the Internet's is one and a half
times to two times the total amount of
system ram but I could make it huge
right more memory is always better right
even if it's just virtual right well no
not necessarily
if your system had so many running
applications at one time that you needed
all of your system memory and a paging
file 10 times that size then it would
probably be operating so slowly anyway
that it wouldn't really help best to
just leave this one to the system to
figure out on its own as well all right
fine then
so Linus what was the point of this
stupid video you showed me a cool
buttons and dials then you told me not
to touch them can I do anything to
optimize this thing the answer is yes
moving your paging file to a separate
Drive entirely can help performance in
much the same way that using a separate
physical disk for a scratch disk helps
performance the higher performance the
secondary drive the better beware though
in addition to your main paging file
microsoft recommends retaining one
beijing file on the boot partition for
system dumps in the event of a crash
your OS will automatically make use of
the one on the separate drive more
frequently and use the one on the boot
partition less frequently in order to
get the best performance possible but
that's all done in the background so
ultimately guys there are two takeaways
from all this number one is don't
disable your paging file unless you're
willing to run that risk and number two
is if you're determined to have fewer
pages in your life than or at least
higher-quality ones then you should head
on over to squarespace.com slash tank
