got a new console generation from
Microsoft Xbox watch TV TV TV TV and
although we've seen a couple of upgraded
Xbox one models we're finally going to
see an all-new Xbox around the 2020
holiday season that Redmond has dubbed
project scarlet and although the name is
a lot less intense than 20 17s project
Scorpio scarlet is being billed as a
major leap forward for console gaming
but in an era where high-end gaming PCs
are still running absolute circles
around consoles what can we
realistically expect so specs wise
project scarlet features a system on a
chip in this case meaning a CPU and GPU
in one package that is supposed to be
four times as powerful as the one in the
Xbox one X now the One X was actually a
pretty capable piece of hardware at
launch compared to similarly priced pcs
as you can check out in this video from
our sister channel however even though
it's selling point was 4k gaming the One
X also had some limitations on frame
rates as well as whether it could
natively render 4k in many titles some
games were too intense for the One X to
deliver true 4k the way a PC would and
so instead it used checkerboard
rendering and other upscaling tricks to
give a pseudo 4k gaming experience it
wasn't real so back to project scarlet
Microsoft is now promising that its new
console will deliver 8k capability and
it does make some sort of intuitive
sense that it could do so in four times
the power might be able to deliver four
times the resolution right that's how
math works but while we think there
might be some games that will run an 8k
especially considering how Microsoft
might be able to optimize its first
party titles it's very difficult to
imagine that we're going to be getting
native 8k at high frame rates in games
to dig a little deeper consider that 8k
is a challenge for even the highest end
PC graphics cards these
days and it's hard to imagine that four
times as powerful means the GPU will be
able to spit out four times as many
frames per second given them the top-end
GPUs on the market right now only have
about twice the raw rendering power of
the rx 580 which is probably the closest
desktop equivalent to the One X's GPU
and of course price is going to
constrain just how powerful of a chip
Microsoft can put in project scarlet the
1x is MSRP of four hundred ninety nine
US dollars is already a little high for
a console and Microsoft is hinted that
scarlet might be even more expensive but
there's a large difference between what
a PC gaming enthusiast would be willing
to pay for a GPU and what a console
gamer would tolerate before they decided
it was just too much especially
considering 8k TVs aren't exactly cheap
okay guys so all that said I wouldn't
expect native 8k in very many games and
I certainly wouldn't expect to see it at
over about 30 frames per second except
in maybe one or two highly optimized
titles although Microsoft is pitching
120 Hertz capabilities I'd only expect
that at lower resolutions but one thing
that might be more useful across the
board is Scarlets incorporation of
variable refresh rate technology which
has been around for a while now on PCs
in the form of G sync and free sync
although console games have been
notorious for being locked at relatively
low frame rates this could definitely
make quite a few titles look smoother
especially at lower resolutions provided
you have a compatible TV which aren't
common on the market yet but graphical
fidelity is only part of the story here
project scarlet is also going to feature
an SSD and Microsoft claims that the SSD
will give 40 times the performance which
suggests that it will be a PCI Express
SSD and that should significantly cut
down on loading times and other
frustrating delays
however PCI Express SSDs aren't cheap so
it's anyone's guess how spacious they'll
be or if Microsoft will also include a
traditional hard drive for spillover
storage and if the SSD tends to fill up
quickly
you may end up buying some of your games
on good old-fashioned optical discs as
Microsoft has already announced that
project Scarlett won't be all digital
and an optical drive will almost
certainly introduce more latency or
longer loading times then of course
there's the fact that it looks like
Scarlett will be tightly integrated with
Microsoft's game streaming service X
cloud
given that Microsoft has already
invested quite a bit in cross-platform
gaming with projects like its play
anywhere initiative it looks like
Scarlett is going to emphasize cloud
streaming though it isn't clear if
streamed games would partially leverage
a local consoles Hardware for some extra
power and on the topic of power
well project Scarlett have enough power
for VR based on what's under the hood it
appears that it will though we also know
that Microsoft hasn't shown a whole lot
of enthusiasm for bringing VR to the
Xbox however with the popularity of
PlayStation VR and the fact that they're
still about a year and a half to go
before Scarlett hits the shelves I would
be surprised if Microsoft does try a
little harder in the VR space to compete
with Sony's upcoming PlayStation 5 which
has many of the same specifications as
Scarlett hopefully those two consoles
find a way to differentiate themselves
from each other in a meaningful way
other than which one ends up offering
the better black friday bundle alright
