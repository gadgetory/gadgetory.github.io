you wanted to get a crisp image and
surround sound from your shiny new DVD
player it wasn't unrealistic to be using
eleven different analog cables
mercifully the HDMI cable came to our
rescue a few years back with the most
recent version 2.0 be capable of
carrying 4k at 60 Hertz with up to 32
channels of surround sound and even HDR
all on that single cable Wow
but of course with all the cool
copyrighted content flowing through that
one convenient pipe the powers that be
wanted to make sure that it couldn't be
copied without permission which is why
most HDMI source and display devices set
top boxes graphics cards TVs even the
chromecast also support a feature called
high bandwidth digital content
protection or Shi T the idea behind HDCP
is to keep devices from recording
content at its original quality which
obviously doesn't mean that you can't
capture anything off of your TV or
computer if that were the case twitch
wouldn't be raking in all that game
streaming money HDCP restrictions only
kick in with specifically encrypted
content most commonly movies and TV
shows chances are you've encountered it
if you've ever tried to create a backup
of a blu-ray you bought or if you've
tried to run a screen capture software
while watching Netflix which does use
HDCP compliant streaming now I know what
you're thinking G Linus what could
possibly go wrong with such an
overwrought anti-piracy scheme well
plenty of things there are a number of
issues with HDCP that have ended up
frustrating average users far more than
the people trying to make a quick buck
distributing pirated copies of Blade
as you might guess the fact that HDMI
and HDCP with it has gone through
several revisions means that trying to
hook up a newer device to an older
device can result in your content of
choice completely refusing to play and
even if all your equipment is relatively
new you can still run into dreaded HDCP
handshaking errors
you see handshaking is a process where
each HDMI device recognizes the other
and exchanges encryption keys although
this usually happens without a hitch
some setups especially on the bleeding
edge or due to poor after-sales support
from the manufacturers as often happens
with TVs can be finicky and if you don't
turn your devices on in the correct
order or your magic 8-ball is giving you
some bad news you'll only see snow or a
blank screen instead of getting an
actual picture this can even happen if
you're not trying to watch encrypted
content my TV at home I can't access the
BIOS yeah and on the subject of TV let's
say you're running something like a
sports bar and you want to show the big
game on lots of screens with HDMI HDCP
can cause problems here as well since
dumb splitters that you would normally
use with an analogue connection won't
work due to the digital handshaking and
encryption processes instead you're at
the mercy of your cable or satellite
provider who gets to decide how many
displays their set-top boxes will
support typically a low number so they
can cram extra set-top boxes down your
throat for a nominal fee but that isn't
to say that there aren't workarounds the
most common way to defeat some of these
HDCP frustrations is with a proper HDMI
splitter many of which ignore HDCP and
sometimes allow new and old equipment to
play together more nicely of course they
also allow you to send your age
to my signal to multiple screens but the
splitter still has to be recognized by
your source device which can be hit or
miss depending on the firmware and
exactly what version of hdcp your
gadgets and the splitter itself support
so your mileage may vary so the most
frustrating yet unsurprising thing about
all of this is that while HDCP is great
at angering normal consumers it's
actually terrible at stopping piracy as
the encryption scheme it uses is
relatively weak and has already been
cracked including the most recent
version at the time of building 2.2 so
perhaps one day we'll be able to
convince our corporate overlords to
ditch HDCP but given that these are the
same geniuses that gave us things like
rootkits on audio cds mandatory online
gameplay and product activation we may
be in for a bit of a wait speaking of
