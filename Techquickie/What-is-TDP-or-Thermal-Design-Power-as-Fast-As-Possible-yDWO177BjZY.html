it's a specification measured in watts
that is found on pretty much any
processor it's meant to tell us the
maximum amount of heat that component is
expected to output in a realistic but
heavy use scenario okay but lion is hold
on a second I'm a bit confused this is
what I measure a power consumption
I was planning out my new building my
friends told me that because the TDP my
graphics cards are 250 watts each that I
need at least a 500 watt power supply
we'll hold on a second there Charlie
contrary to what you may have heard
around the world's largest water cooler
TDP is not directly a measure of power
consumption but honestly it's not your
fault if you're a bit confused right now
a watt is a unit of measurement for
energy over time so that can refer to
electrical power being consumed or the
thermal power being output and both uses
are correct to further complicate
matters even though TDP isn't a measure
of power consumption it's actually
pretty directly related so that is to
say a processor using the same
manufacturing process and design
architecture but with a higher TDP we'll
also consume more power and besides even
if TDP was a power consumption rating
every manufacturer handles it slightly
differently anyway often entire families
of processors with significant
differences in power characteristics and
even thermal output can be assigned one
blanket rating for convenience not to
mention that while some manufacturers
are basing it on a worst-case scenario
like prolonged heavy video-editing
others are using it as more of a
guideline for what a typical user should
see in the real world and then on top of
that no one accounts for the use of
power viruses like fur mark pieces of
torture test software that are
specifically designed to cause
processors to exceed their TDP okay
Linus so now that I understand what TDP
is why exactly should I even care about
this if it doesn't help me choose my
power supply and all the manufacturers
are basically making it up as they go
anyway great question TDP is all about
choosing an appropriate cooling solution
processors need to be kept below a
maximum operating temperature called
t-junction at which point they will
either stop working suddenly or engage
advanced protection mechanisms
turn down their own performance to save
themselves from being overheated and
damaged
not to mention that new or more advanced
processors can do more than just turn
themselves down to prevent damage if you
don't cool them adequately Intel's turbo
boost as an example of something that
does just the opposite if you've got
more than adequate cooling and some
power and thermal Headroom to spare this
fascinating technology will actually
allow the processor to temporarily
exceed its normal TDP to give a small
boost in performance on demand I've
actually going to full video about this
check it out here so that is why
aftermarket coolers for hot running
chips like CPUs and graphics processors
are such a hot commodity in the old days
they could make our computers run cooler
and quieter and last longer well now
they can actually even improve
performance in some cases particularly
when you're overclocking and that
specified TDP starts to go through the
roof which I guess leads us pretty well
into our sponsor spot for today
Coolermaster has been making cooling
solutions for processors since basically
the dawn of time so if you're looking
for all that stuff I just mentioned
before especially if you're an
overclocker a great way of saying thanks
to them for sponsoring tech quick you
would be to check out their extensive
lineup of air and liquid cooling
solutions check the link in the video
description to do that thanks
Coolermaster for making this episode
possible and thanks to you guys for
watching like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you just like to leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future graphs of possible topics and as
always don't forget to subscribe if you
haven't already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
