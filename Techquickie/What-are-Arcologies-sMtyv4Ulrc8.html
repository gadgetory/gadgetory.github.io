the dire warnings about how the world
population is growing at an
unsustainable rate and we're consuming
far too many resources discussed
solutions range from the practical to be
absolutely fantastical but unless you're
an intractable nihilist that doesn't
care about the survival of the human
race you'll probably agree that we have
to figure the problem out at some point
and one of the most interesting ideas
that has been proposed as the concept of
the arcology large self-contained
communities with minimal impact on the
environment but is this just the stuff
of science fiction or might millions of
people be living in such a structure one
day and just what the heck would that
look like anyway
well our colleges have been
conceptualized many ways from tall
skyscraper like structures to
self-sufficient groups of buildings
closer to the ground but they all have
one thing in common some way to more
densely pack living working and
recreationists
along with infrastructure to improve
efficiency and cut down on pollution and
waste whoa whoa hold the phone there
Linus this sounds like some sort of
nightmare where we're all living in
little sleeping pods and eating meals in
pill form well it's not in fact there
are real-life arcology projects in the
works right now the most prominent of
these is probably Masdar City in Abu
Dhabi this is an area of six square
kilometers being developed with features
like automated driverless pods for
transportation a large solar plant water
recycling and creative use of
architecture to provide forced air
cooling without the need to suck tons of
power including a 150 foot tall wind
tower that flushes air downward pretty
cool but Masdar lacks the wow factor
superstructure appearance that has been
commonly depicted in video games like
Sims
city and Deus Ex for something like that
you'll have to go to Russia where a
project called crystal island is being
planned and yes the name is quite apt at
nearly half a kilometer tall with 27
million square feet of floor space it
would be one of the largest man-made
structures in the world with the outside
covered by a special skin whose purpose
would be to provide climate control
depending on the season and with power
provided by the Sun and the wind the
interior would be a mix of residential
commercial and educational spaces though
there's no word yet on whether
transportation will be provided by a
fleet of horses of course as you might
expect such massive undertakings tend to
run into roadblocks there are indeed
people already living and working in
Masdar city but completion has been
pushed back several times and we may not
see the finished product for more than a
decade and the developers have actually
backed off their promise of complete
carbon neutrality anyway as for Crystal
Island they haven't even broken ground
yet partly due to the late-2000s
financial crisis so it's not surprising
that it's more common to see places that
use our ecology concepts instead of
fully fledged self-sufficient highly
integrated cities the Las Vegas Strip
for example features pedestrian walkways
and bridges connecting many of the
casinos hotels and businesses so that
you're often not walking down the street
itself and in many cases don't even have
to go outside to get from point A to
point B and if we're only talking about
the idea of containing things in a
single building large new skyscrapers
like the Shanghai Tower in China are
increasingly borrowing ideas from
arcologies not only does the Shanghai
Tower feature a kind of insulating skin
similar to what was imagined for Crystal
Island it has a prominent twist in it
which helps to repel wind that could
otherwise cause the building to sway
without having to use extra construction
material
and although it's connected to the main
electrical grid wind turbines atop the
building provide around 350,000 kilowatt
hours of extra power per year for the
offices and hotel rooms underneath but
although projects like these might be
giving us a glimpse at the future of
urban living there's a debate swirling
as to whether our ecology like
structures that are ultimately built
will actually help us solve our problems
with resource consumption and
overpopulation or if they'll just turn
into enclaves for the wealthy but don't
despair if it turns out you're not
loaded enough to be on the cutting edge
of sustainable living
I hear that urban composting is actually
trendy now speaking of transit is
becoming more and more common to become
a freelance worker or small business
owner and freshbooks
takes the hassle out of one of the worst
parts of being a business owner
accounting FreshBooks is a cloud-based
platform that lets you manage all that
numbers stuff if you're not a numbers
person everything from creating invoices
in just a few seconds to sending them to
people to tracking whether they've seen
them or not to put an end to those
guessing games to getting paid through
the platform to tracking your hours and
tracking expenses FreshBooks lets you do
all of that and it's simple but don't
take my word for it check it out
head to FreshBooks comm slash tech
quickie and enter tech quickie in the
how did you hear about us section
they've got a free trial go try it out
