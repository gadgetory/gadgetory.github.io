Christopher Latham Sholes didn't know it
but his typewriter the first with a
modern layout would end up being the
forerunner to one of the most popular
communication tools of the 21st century
because even though in 1874 typing
device that assigns one letter to each
key wasn't exactly the most brilliant
idea in history that title clearly
belongs to the cinnamon bun Scholz's
typewriter was notable for introducing
the now ubiquitous QWERTY layout which
was effective supposedly because it kept
letters that were commonly used together
away from each other to prevent the
mechanical arms of the typewriter from
hitting each other and causing jams Jam
now of course E and R are placed
together in lots of words and in fact
the original design had a period where
the R key is today but whatever the
reason for this qwerty typewriters
became very popular and this keyboard
layout
sorry Dvorak fans remained the standard
for the teleprinters that became
widespread in the early 20th century so
it wasn't surprising then that when
actual computers like the 30-ton ENIAC
started popping onto the scene in the
1940s these same teleprinters often
ended up getting used for data input
with that same QWERTY layout setting the
stage for the now-familiar keyboard
layout to be integrated into later
machines that weighed less than an
entire family of elephants in the 1960s
video terminals started becoming popular
and these typically included keyboards
that allowed users to more quickly and
easily manipulate data on a screen
instead of using cards or paper tape
like those earlier teleprinters that
were adapted for use of computers
although these terminals looked like
full-fledged computers they were usually
just a monitor and keyboard combo that
had to be plugged into a larger size
system however since it was much easier
to type then operate a computer by
flipping a bunch of switches on the
front or whatever
most computers featured keyboards of
some fashion by the early 1980s and we
even started seeing some of the first
organ ama keyboards in the late 70s with
companies like mult Ron seriously
thinking about the users comfort in a
way that led to some very interesting
designs and it was a period of great
innovation under the hood to many early
keyboards used key switches that were
pretty different from what you're
probably typing on right now including
ultrasonic switches that actually
listened to the different vibration each
key would make as it was pressed and
this one was a bit more common once that
used magnets that got close to a pair of
metal pieces causing them to come into
contact with each other whenever the key
was pushed down these were called reed
switches and while this concept is
actually still in use today
in applications like switching off a
laptop when you close the lid they
proved to be too fragile and inaccurate
for keyboards so a couple of alternative
designs quickly replaced reed switches
one was the familiar membrane which
works by placing a metal layer under
each key that directly contacts traces
on the keyboard circuit board when a key
is pressed down this design is both
inexpensive and resistant to debris
making it very common on cheaper
keyboards today another was a technology
that IBM patented in 1978 a
spring-loaded key switch called a
buckling spring these puppies also
worked by direct contact in that
pressing down caused two pieces of metal
to touch but they proved to be not only
extremely durable but also a pleasure to
type on and subjectively listened to so
while not the first mechanical switch
buckling spring switch has gained
enormous popularity thanks to their
inclusion on the model s keyboard that
came with the original IBM PC in 1980
and later the model M which is still
beloved by keyboard enthusiasts today
for its high build quality and trademark
springy sound and not to be outdone in
the mechanical switch arms race German
manufacturer cherry started gaining
notoriety in the midnight
after their switches came installed on
some keyboards for the Commodore Amiga
and proved to be of better quality than
a lot of the alternatives of course
noisy heavy mechanical switches aren't
always the best solution which I'm sure
you the viewer can attest to if you've
ever had a roommate typing away on their
cherry blue keyboard while you're trying
to sleep
so rubber dome keyboards were developed
around the same time these gave the user
tactile feedback due to the rubber dome
snapping like a suction cup but they
were cheaper and quieter than their
spring-loaded counterparts rubber domes
have become common on chiclet style
keyboards as well as on laptops in the
form of the lower profile scissor switch
variant which helps to save space this
trend towards light cheap keyboards
drove much of the evolution of the
keyboard for the next decade or two with
IBM having the brilliant idea to cut
costs by putting stick on letters on key
caps in 1985 rather than having a
different manufacturing process for
every key so fast-forward to today and
basic keyboards are lightweight
commodity items that can be easily found
for less than 10 bucks but there's also
an enormous variety of other options out
there at all price points whether you
want something tricked-out with
individual RGB backlighting and macro
keys for gaming or productivity a model
with optical switches for fast response
times a trick we actually first saw in
the early 1980s or even a keyboard with
no keys at all just remember whatever
you go with there's one thing that
hasn't changed over the decades Dorito
