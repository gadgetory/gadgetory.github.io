elicit strong reactions from PC and
audio enthusiasts but few come close to
is it worth it to shell out the cash on
a sound card or external audio interface
so why does this debate stir up such
passion and emotion on both sides who
are sound cards for and what advantages
do they really provide let's start this
with an analogy think of the electrical
signals traveling through the inside of
your PC like cars on a highway if you're
out there driving around all by yourself
it's going to be pretty peaceful and
quiet unless you souped up your engine
to make some sort of statement about the
size of your junk but as more and more
cars get on that highway the ambient
noise level is going to go up well the
situation inside your computer is much
more similar to the busy highway than
the lonely one
your CPU is processing millions of
instructions per second and all that
data flowing around on the motherboard
makes it a very noisy place and if you
turn on your speakers you might actually
even be able to hear it all that extra
electrical noise from inside the
computer can manifest itself as hissing
cracking and other distortions over your
speakers or headphones when you're
trying to listen to music watch Netflix
or blow away that friggin annoying kid
that keeps headshotting you through the
wall somehow motherboard manufacturers
have a few different ways of addressing
this problem the most elegant of which
is to place the audio circuitry on a
dedicated area of the PCB away from the
other components however this solution
is quite expensive to implement so it's
mostly only straight ball and boards
that have this feature discreet sound
cards are basically a more robust
version of this and can be added to any
motherboard they put all the audio
signaling on a completely separate PCB
that attaches via PCI or PCI Express and
it comes with some additional advantages
as well such as the capability for more
inputs and outputs more powerful
application to drive those fancy-pants
headphones of yours cleaner digital to
analog conversion for more detailed
sound and of course the ability to carry
it forward to your next system when you
upgrade the rest of your hardware but
sound cards are hardly a perfect
solution they're still near the EMI
noise inside you
PC tower their software drivers can be
problematic and due to their nature as
all-in-one solutions their DAC or amp or
both are not always the best enter
external Dax these usually require no
drivers and take the audio processing
out of the noisy environment of your PC
case altogether allowing a cleaner
analog signal to be sent to an amplifier
that is either built-in to your speakers
or bought separately even though Dax
built-in to even onboard integrated
sound cards are better than ever
having a dedicated one that sits outside
the case safe for me mi is something
that many folks who are passionate about
audio absolutely swear by but Linus you
still haven't actually answered the
$64,000 question who are these products
actually for well for one sound
producers if you make music instead of
just listening to it you might need more
inputs and outputs than your onboard
sound solution can give you which is
usually just a complement of
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks in an
optical Toslink port for two if you're
super serial about getting the absolute
most out of your fancy speakers or
headphones especially high impedance or
low sensitivity ones that are difficult
to drive an onboard audio upgrade with
particular attention to the amplifier
might be necessary for hearing the
finest details of whatever you're
listening to and finally and perhaps
most obviously if you keep hearing
noticeable hissing Distortion or just
plain muddy audio quality then you'll
definitely want to look into moving away
from your onboard sound unless of course
you enjoy listening to everything as if
it was recorded on a cassette tape
that's been traveling around the cosmos
for the last 20-something years speaking
of carrying around audio recordings with
you an audible calm membership is the
perfect thing for you if you want to
have access to literally hundreds of
thousands of high-quality audio books
like gone girl by Gillian Flynn which I
absolutely kicks butt by the way I love
this book and I'm planning to go see the
movie as soon as I possibly can but have
a baby but I'll get to it as I'm boy
because I can't get enough of it
an audible membership gets you one audio
book of your choice to listen to in the
car or at work or wherever it is you do
that every month and gets you discounts
on additional audiobooks if you crave
lore and the best part is that the first
one is absolutely free so head over to
audible.com slash tech wiki to sign up
and get
started thanks for watching guys like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you thought it sucked leave a comment if
you have suggestions for future fast as
possible also leave a comment if you
have any feedback on this particular
script our new guy actually wrote it so
if you think that he sucks then make
sure you let him know in the comments
and as always guys don't forget to
subscribe for more videos like this from
tech quickie I never say that that's an
outro for a different channel that I do
forget it subscribe if you haven't
already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
