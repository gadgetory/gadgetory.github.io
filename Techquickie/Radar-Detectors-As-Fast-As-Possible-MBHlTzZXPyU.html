the experience of you know cruising down
the freeway with the windows open not
really paying attention to how fast
they're going and bam flashing lights in
the rearview mirror and five minutes
later you're holding your very own free
ticket to traffic court and a larger
insurance bill if only you'd been using
our radar detector a venerable piece of
technology that speed demons everywhere
I've been using for years to avoid such
unpleasant surprises but first a little
bit about how radar works police
commonly use what's called Doppler radar
to track how fast passing cars are going
and the low Doppler radar is usually
associated with weather reporting the
way it works makes it a pretty versatile
tool a standard police radar works by
firing a radio signal at nearby traffic
which hits whichever car is being
tracked and returns to the radar gun for
analysis the fact that the car is moving
means that the return signal will have a
different frequency from the original
this is called the Doppler effect and is
the same reason that an ambulance siren
sounds lower in pitch when it's speeding
away from you
this difference in frequency is
converted to a speed readout that the
officer can see to determine if you are
exceeding the speed limit Doppler radar
simplicity has made it the tool of
choice for traffic cops the world over
for many years so consumer grade radar
detectors work then by detecting
frequencies in the Doppler bands since
the radar signals are really just radio
waves radar detectors operate a lot like
the radio in your car that you use to
listen to music
they're just tuned to Doppler
frequencies which are much higher than
AM and FM frequencies so then whenever
your radar detector picks up a Doppler
signal it will alert you in some way so
that you can slow down before you get
slapped with a ticket of course though
radar detectors aren't perfect and
things like adaptive radar cruise
control on newer cars and even those
automatic doors that you see at the
supermarket
use frequencies in the Doppler range
meaning that false alarms are often
fact of life for people that use radar
detectors but aside from false alarm
tampering effectiveness police know how
popular radar detectors are so many
police departments are now using lidar
which uses a more focused beam of
infrared light as opposed to Doppler
radar which tends to scatter making it
easier to pick up light our detectors
exist as well but since police point
lidar guns at one smaller spot on a car
often the license plate the detectors
tend to be a lot less effective but hold
on a second I mean what if instead of
just detecting a police radar you could
actually keep it from tracking your car
well some more sophisticated radar
detectors have a jamming feature that
emits extra signals to confuse police
radar and lidar but not surprisingly
these are illegal in many places since
the cops don't exactly appreciate it
when you actively interfere with their
equipment regular detectors however are
allowed in quite a few places including
all but one u.s. state a few provinces
in Western Canada New Zealand and some
countries in Europe just make sure you
know what the laws are in your area
before you buy so you don't get snapped
down with a hammer of irony because the
device that you bought to avoid a
traffic ticket just earned you a traffic
ticket or of course I mean we could all
just slow down and you know kumbaya and
all that stuff however if my experience
rolling around out there in rush hour is
any indication I think we'd have a
better chance of seeing Ford try and
sell the Flintstone mobile speaking of
trying to sell I'm going to try and sell
