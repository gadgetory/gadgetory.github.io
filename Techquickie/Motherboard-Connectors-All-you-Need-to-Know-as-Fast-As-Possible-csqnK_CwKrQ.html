your motherboard and it just won't work
well that's why we're here with this
tech quickie fast as possible to show
you how to connect all of the different
connections on your motherboard the 24
pin connector is usually located along
the right-hand edge of the motherboard
and is notched so that it only goes in
one way
you can tell that it's completely
inserted once the clip is closed over
the latch next up is the p4 or EPS
connector sometimes it's four pins and
often your power supply can have the
connector split apart to accommodate
those four pin connectors and sometimes
it's eight pins and while it's best to
plug in all eight pins if your power
supply doesn't support it you can just
plug in before that fit make sure you're
not trying to plug a PCI Express eight
pin into your EPS eight pin though
because those aren't compatible and if
you force it it will fry your
motherboard three pin fan headers can be
installed with either three pin fans or
four pin fans but they are only
compatible with analog fan speed control
or pin fan connectors have a fourth pin
for PWM fan speed control which is more
advanced than the traditional voltage
control method 3 pin fans can still be
installed in them however they just
won't have PWM control one of the
trickiest and most intricate connectors
is the front panel headers power reset
hard drive LED as well as power LED and
this is where I do really recommend
consulting the manual sometimes they're
color coded and other times they're
labeled directly on the motherboard and
on the connectors but you'll save
yourself some hassle if you just look it
up the LED connectors require being
plugged in a specific way with positive
and negative on the corresponding
terminals however the power and reset
switches can be installed either way it
doesn't matter USB to front headers also
have to be hooked up and it should be
noted that some other boards have
special color-coded front USB 2 headers
that actually deliver more power for
doing things like charging tablets
quickly most of them however it's just a
matter of lining them up with the one
missing pin on the header on the
motherboard corresponding to the missing
pin on the plug in order to use front
USB 3 SuperSpeed both your case and your
motherboard have to support it it's
usually pretty easy to find the
connector because it's clearly labeled
they're coded otherwise it's pretty
distinctive looking if your case
supports USB 3 and your motherboard
doesn't don't worry you can use either
the included adapter that comes on the
connector or many cases also include an
adapter that means that those front USB
3 ports on your case will still function
even if it's only at USB 2 speeds the
front panel audio connector to hook up
the microphone and headphone jack on the
front of your case is usually located at
the bottom left of the board here often
cases have a lead off connector for this
one as well with one of them labeled HD
or Azalia and the other one labeled PC
97 the PC 97 1 is a very old standard so
unless you're running an old socket a or
socket 4 7 8 motherboard don't worry
about that and just plug the HD brick
into the HD header on your motherboard
and you can even cut off that old AC 97
1 this guide isn't intended to cover
expansion slots or data connections like
serial ata so the last one we'll be
showing you is auxilary power connectors
so from time to time in addition to the
24 pin in the 8 pin there might be a
molex 4 pin or even a SATA connector
somewhere on the motherboard these are
intended to be used if you're installing
a multi-way graphics card configuration
to help the board draw power from
somewhere other than the 24 pin which
can prevent it from burning out thanks
