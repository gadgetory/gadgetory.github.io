cookie cutter to make treats for your
weekly tech wiki viewing party well even
if that was for a different occasion
odds are that your cookies came out
looking slightly different no matter how
identical you tried to make them this is
the same concept behind binning a term
used by the manufacturing industry to
sort things like for instance processors
and memory modules by quality once
they're manufactured you see although
manufacturing processes for computer
chips are extremely precise there's
going to be some variation between them
due to the intricacies involved in
fabricating such tiny complicated
components for example a CPU with a
certain microarchitecture which you can
learn more about in this video up here
will have targets for performance power
management and thermal output all set by
the manufacturer if a certain sample
hits these targets it will be bend at a
higher quality and end up being sold as
a higher end product but if it falls
short it will end up being a more value
oriented product multi-core CPUs
illustrate this very well let's say you
have a core i3 from Intel sitting in
your rig right now although it's a
dual-core processor the actual die might
have actually been four cores if a chip
has a core that isn't up to par but has
others that function as intended the
defective cores can be disabled and the
chip says sold at a lower tier so that I
three in your machine could have
actually been an i5 but some small thing
went wrong in the factory on the other
hand the highest bin consumer-grade
Intel CPUs often become the unlocked K
series chips marketed to overclockers as
these are typically the ones that
perform the best without having to crank
the voltage way high or putting out an
insane amount of heat even so due to the
minut differences between individual
processors overclocking results will
vary between
even favorably Bindo unlocked chips the
so-called silicon lottery you hear
enthusiasts talking about the same
concept also appears in graphics cards
as well often times when there's a new
GPU release that isn't something on the
extremely high end you'll see a review
that says it has the same GPU as a more
expensive model but with X number of
compute units disabled this is
often due to bidding where a GP you
might have a block of compute units that
don't make the cut quality wise so
they're disabled instead and sold as a
say gtx 950 instead of 960 so hold on a
second you're telling me that i could
turn on extra cores it might be hiding
on my CPU or GPU and get some free
performance if i slap on a better cooler
or something right
unfortunately no that party has kind of
ended years ago it was more commonly
possible on certain products through
some BIOS trickery or maybe a firmware
update here or there but these days most
major manufacturers physically disabled
the connections between inactive cores
and the rest of the processing unit so
they can't be used at all by consumers
but even so don't feel bad if you bought
a lower bend chip just remember that you
saved an innocent CPU from being melted
down for gold and silicon and didn't
even have to make a monthly donation
because you saw a depressing TV
commercial
Tunnel buy or VPN lets you connect to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
services as if you're in said different
country they have an easy-to-use app for
iOS Android PC and Mac and they even
have a Chrome extension if you just want
to have like one thing going in that
country not everything just choose a
country in the app turn tunnel bear on
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to a new location
when you turn tunnel bear on two things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit which is awesome and
your public IP address gets switched so
you can show up as if you're in a
different country like I just said you
can try out tunnel Bayer VPN with five
hundred megabytes of free data with no
credit card required if you want to
upgrade to unlimited data you can save
10% by going to tunnel bear comm slash
Linus if you liked the video like it if
you dislike the video dislike it comment
down below if there's like stuff you
want us to cover someone released a
really good comment recently that had
like four different things that we
haven't covered yet that we're great
ideas we're probably going to do those
don't forget to subscribe and check out
our super fun we do like weird stuff
this probably sounds horrible in the mic
and there's like things bouncing off of
me and it's bad but if you did like that
sound you should go there don't know how
that works go
there anyways</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
