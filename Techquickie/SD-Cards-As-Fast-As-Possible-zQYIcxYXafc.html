cards are these days it wasn't too long
ago that they weren't king of the hill
if you want a digital camera back in the
late 1990s or early 2000s because you're
old like me you probably remember the
confusing selection of memory cards that
you had to choose from compact flash
smart media memory stick so how is it
then that SD ended up winning the format
war well although SD was originally
pushed by several different companies as
a removable storage format that
supported DRM for music hence the name
secure digital everyone kind of forgot
about that functionality
soon after the cards hit the market and
instead took note of they're much more
convenient size compared to compact
flash and they're greater storage
potential compared to smart media SD
also had the advantage of being a more
open standard than memory stick which
today is almost exclusively found on
Sony devices or the XD picture card
meaning that it became relatively cheap
for companies to start including on
their digital cameras computers and more
portable things like GPS devices even
though you could expect to pay about
$200 for a 128 megabyte SD card when
they first came out in 2001 prices
quickly fell as the format was
introduced into more and more gadgets so
by the mid-2000s SD had clearly started
to dominate the market but the
unyielding demand for smaller higher
capacity storage meant that the
technology was still being pushed
forward 2003 brought us the mini SD card
followed by the much more widely adopted
micro SD card in 2005 so thanks to
decreases in the size of flash
transistors that actually store the data
and an increase in how many can be
crammed onto one card we actually now
have SD cards in capacities that were
unthinkable less than two decades ago
with both standard sized and micro SD
cards now available
that can hold over half a terabyte
meaning at the highest capacity microSD
card on the market right now can hold
over 35,000 times as much data as a
standard three and a half inch floppy
while being over 50 times smaller
physically unfortunately though these
much higher capacities mean that not all
SD cards will function properly in any
slot that will physically fit them the
original SD spec only supported up to
two gigabytes while SDHC cards can hold
up to 32 gigs and the newer SDXC can
handle up to two terabytes
although cards that spacious aren't on
the market yet unlike standards like USB
or SATA SD cards aren't backwards
compatible with older readers that only
support an older spec so SDXC cards
won't work in that card reader from 2007
this matter made worse by the fact that
it requires exFAT a newer file system
that some older versions of Windows
don't support natively newer readers
though are usually fine with older cards
so aside from standard SD versus the
higher capacity versions you also need
to pay attention though to the speed
rating lower end models might have a
number two four six inside a circle
giving you an idea of the maximum write
speed in megabytes per second while
higher end cards are often classified as
UHS 1 or UHS 2 indicating both higher
bus speeds and write speeds with UHS two
cards offering write speeds of at least
30 megabytes per second which is
important if you're trying to do
something demanding like record 4k video
as the card needs to be able to support
the high data rates to keep up so while
there's still a lot to look for when
shopping for flash memory at least the
days when there were 6 or 7 different
completely different physical formats
vying for your attention are over just
try not to drop your micro SD card
between your couch cushions if you know
what I mean
was that it getting something stuck in
your butt joke
