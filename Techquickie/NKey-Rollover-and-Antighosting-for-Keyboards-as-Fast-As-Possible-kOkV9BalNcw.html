ghosting by the marketing departments of
keyboard manufacturers which by the way
is an incorrect use of the term ghosting
but we'll talk about that in a bit is a
measure of how many key presses can be
registered simultaneously by a keyboard
it's represented using the format of X
key rollover where X is the value that
represents the number of keys that can
be pressed simultaneously the max
rollover rating a keyboard can have is n
key rollover or NK ro which signifies
that every key on the keyboard can be
pressed simultaneously and every single
one of them will be registered by your
computer now let's go back to ghosting
for a second it has a few meanings
nowadays traditionally and this is the
proper definition ghosting refers to an
extra third key press being registered
on your computer as a result of two
completely unrelated keys being pressed
simultaneously on your keyboard
so you're typing away and you hit a and
L at the same time and on your screen Al
and I
there are some other third letter would
pop up this is extremely rare on any
type of modern keyboard
so when you see anti-ghosting on the
packaging for your new keyboard what the
manufacturer is often referring to is a
very weak three key roll over
implementation that sometimes doesn't
even cover the whole keyboard and offers
only partial coverage on certain keys
that users are likely to press together
like W a and G for FPS gamers typically
this kind of anti ghosting is only seen
on inexpensive rubber dome or membrane
keyboards a quick side note here though
guys is that if you want to test out
what value of key roll over your
keyboard actually has Microsoft of all
people has an awesome tool to do so
online there's a link in the video
description so be sure to check that out
now back to roll over it's not just
membrane keyboards with shoddy
implementations here even on mechanical
keyboards until recently users were
often surprised to find that full n key
roll over only worked on the dated ps/2
connector with the USB interface only
being capable of six key rollover which
can register up to six letter keys and
four modifiers at the same time which is
why when a hardcore mechanical keyboard
fans have stuck with ps2 and why some
mechanical keyboard manufacturers still
include ps2 adapters in the packaging
for their keyboards in recent years
however new developments have allowed
full and key rollover to be functional
over USB which is why companies like
ducky and Corsair can offer it on their
keyboards no matter which plug you're
using so the astute among you might be
asking yourselves by this point in the
video is any key rollover even necessary
I mean it's certainly cool you know and
for geeks like me you know more
technology is more better but outside of
some very specific cases like programs
that allow you to use your keyboard as a
piano probably not in my personal
experience including gaming word
processing web browsing and hardware
testing I've yet to really feel like I
needed to press more than 6 letter keys
and four modifiers all at the same time
but let us know in the comments if you
can think of some situations where it
would be important to you like that time
you wrote a letter with your face
speaking of your face do you ever wake
up in the morning reach for your razor
and
this has turned into a rusty dangerous
mess but you just shave with it anyway
because you don't want to go to the
trouble of going to a store finding an
employee asking them to unlock the
razors which are behind a you know an
indestructible sheet of Plexiglas
because apparently no one in the adult
world we trusted to have access to sharp
objects if so really Luke I already gave
