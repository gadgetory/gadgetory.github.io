inventions of all time allowed for easy
and rapid printing of books and
information which spread literacy and
knowledge across the world
the printing press revolutionized the
spread of information but now a new
method of printing called 3d printing is
poised to revolutionize manufacturing
the way it works is actually very simple
using a 3d model as a guide a moving 3d
printer head lays down a layer of
material that has a certain amount of
thickness to it then it does it again
and again putting down one layer at a
time until finally the completed model
has been created literally from the
ground up one slice at a time any
complex object that cannot support its
own weight during printing is printed
along with some kind of scaffolding
which can be easily removed or washed
away once the object is completely
printed 3d printing can be done with all
sorts of materials different kinds of
plastic metal sand stones ceramic
concrete wood and more and here is an
example this is a lego technic
compatible 32 tooth gear you see I like
to build robots in my spare time and
well I have a lot of parts there are
some very useful pieces that simply
don't exist so 3d printing to the rescue
once I knew what I wanted to make I
needed to decide on some 3d modeling
software to use there are a ton of
options but I ended up using Google
Sketchup which is easy to learn and use
for a really powerful 3d program I would
recommend blender but it does have a
very steep learning curve once I
finished making my 3d model I needed to
figure out how I was going to print it
you can buy or even build your own 3d
printer but because the technology is
still pretty new it's probably more
worthwhile for most people to use a 3d
printing service coincidentally as I was
writing this episode a company called
Shapeways contacted us and offered to do
some 3d printing for us I agreed and
uploaded my exported STL files to their
server I chose which pieces colors and
what kind of material I wanted I went
with strong and flexible plastic I was
also pretty surprised to see that they
can print in 14 karat gold that is one
expensive gear a few weeks later I got a
package in the mail containing all of my
pieces as you can see the plastic is a
lot different from real Lego
it's rough and kind of chalky unless you
get the polished stuff a lot of the
pieces I designed are a bit too tight
but they still fit with real Lego
overall I'm very pleased with the
results and I'll probably continue to
design and print more pieces in the
future if you'd like to print any of the
pieces I've designed you can follow the
link in the video description but being
able to print little plastic gears is
just the beginning for 3d printing
imagine 3d printing an entire product
from scratch does that remind you of
anything you know like the Replicators
from Star Trek perhaps computer tea Earl
Grey hot there you go ok so we probably
won't be able to print out a new toaster
or a cup of tea anytime soon but it's
already possible to 3d print custom
prosthetics clothing food jewelry guns
drugs even living skin cartilage and
bone scientists are currently working on
ways to print entire organs like kidneys
and livers and even with 3d printing in
its infancy there are already many legal
concerns about what people can do with
3d printing technology easy homemade
weapon manufacturing and patent and
copyright infringement among them keep
an eye on this because it's going to be
an interesting couple of decades
something else to keep your eyes on
shutterstock.com I actually made a
special request to do this ad
integration because as a video editor I
have a lot of very relevant things to
say about them I've been using
shutterstock for the past 3 months and I
love it we make a ton of videos at lines
Media Group and before we got
shutterstock it was always such a pain
to get usable images of things that I
needed I can't use Google Images because
most of those aren't licensed for reuse
and they're usually too small anyway
shutterstock is great because they have
more than 35 million images all of them
carefully labeled and easily searchable
and you don't even need an account to
see what they have to offer
also a lot of the images have their
subjects isolated on a white background
which is perfect for compositing in
Photoshop or elsewhere and most images
are available in enormous resolutions
which is very useful for video and image
creation whatever your project might be
Shutterstock has lots of different plans
to suit your unique image needs so if
you'd like to go check them out go to
shutterstock.com and use the offer code
