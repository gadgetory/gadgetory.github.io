dynamic range since it's pretty likely
that it'll be easier to understand what
a lot of it is if you know what it is in
the first place
dynamic range is much like a contrast
ratio a measurement of the difference
between the brightest part of an image
and the darkest unlike contrast ratios
which use linear numbers to represent
the luminance of the brightest whites
and darkest blacks in an easy way that
anyone can understand dynamic range is
measured in f-stops each of which
represents this difference in powers of
two okay so let's do an example
a pocket camera rated at six at stop sub
dynamic range can correctly capture an
image that has bright spots that are
sixty-four times brighter than the
darkest shadows this according to
Wikipedia anyway is about what our eyes
could perceive if they operated like a
still camera and just took snapshots as
we went about our business but they
don't instead when we look around our
eyes are adjusting constantly to achieve
an estimated maximum dynamic range of as
much as 20 stops to put that in
perspective the best cinema grade
digital cameras top out in the
neighborhood of fourteen to sixteen
stops of dynamic range today and while
that allows their operators to capture
beautiful images that have a mixture of
bright light and deep shadows without
clipping or losing so much detail that
all the camera captures in a given
region is complete lactose or blown-up
pure white it would appear that to
achieve what the I can more is basically
better and we've still got a lot of work
to do right enter HDR or high dynamic
range imaging this technique attempts to
make the image on your phone or camera
look more true to life by revealing more
details in the shadowy areas of an image
and in blown out bright areas by
exposing the image multiple times to
compensate for the limited dynamic range
of your capture equipment it's not a new
technique by any means
and basically all HDR implementations
work in pretty much the same way the
camera records an image multiple times
in rapid succession at varying exposure
or brightness levels then software
techniques are either automatically or
manually applied to blend them together
into one image borrowing the details in
the shadows from the brightest image and
the details on the bright light from the
darkest one and put
all together in an attempt to recreate
what the eye would see if you were just
looking around normally at the scene
that you're trying to capture in theory
it's great and there are certainly
situations where an experienced DSLR
user with a tripod and a very still
subject can tastefully use HDR to
produce very pleasing images but there
are some challenges
number one is motion a moving subject
will not look good with HDR because
whether you're capturing three images
the way most smartphones do or whether
you're capturing 20-plus the way a
manual DSLR user might someone moving
through the shot or even something as
subtle as leaves blowing in the wind
will usually completely ruin the image
number two is scenes with vivid colors
or interesting looking contrast while
HDR post-processing neighboring more
color into a dull image it can have the
opposite effect in an image where you've
already got vibrant color and of course
if you're looking for like artful high
or low contrast by its very nature it
will reduce that effect in fact the
situations where HDR might be
legitimately useful are pretty few and
far between a backlit skier in the
shadow of a tree with a beautiful
mountaintop lightly lit landscape behind
her might be better captured with HDR
but this is mostly only true if the
objective of taking the images to get a
more practical image where you can see
the details in the skiers face as well
as the landscape because often HDR
counter-intuitively ends up looking
surreal rather than more natural but I
think there's a place for that
while many purists may disagree with the
use of HDR entirely this is the kind of
argument that I often have with my
production crew where they might want a
super sexy shallow depth-of-field shot
on a product and I might just want to
close the aperture boost the gain to
high hell and produce an image that
allows the viewer to look at any part of
it and get a clear idea of what the heck
they're looking at as opposed to
creating something that is better art or
more natural-looking speaking of better
art and more naturally looking what in
the heck were those you may have noticed
some absolutely stunning examples of HDR
landscapes just there all of which were
downloaded from shutterstock.com using
our account which we love because
how much easier it's made finding
graphics and images for use in fast as
possible
shutters comm has over 35 million stock
images to choose from all the way from
simple little vector graphics that we
use to illustrate the points that we're
making two shots of models depicting
emotions that we want to express to
beautiful HDR images like the ones that
you just saw and the best thing about it
is that it's hassle free you grab images
a la carte or in a monthly subscription
bundle like us and you never think about
royalties or usage rights again they've
got plans designed for small groups like
us all the way up to enterprise grade
plans suitable for broadcast television
and it's absolutely free to try head
over to the website and use their
incredibly powerful search tool to start
browsing their entire image library and
pick the ones you want just make sure
when it's time to check out you use
offer code technique an save 20% and so
they'll know who Sencha thank
Shutterstock for sponsoring today's
episode thanks to you the viewer for
watching I'd also love to hear your
comments on this topic please mash those
like and share buttons if you enjoyed
the video and hit that dislike button at
least twice for each moment that bored
you it helps us improve leave a comment
on whether you use HDR what you use it
for and whether you believe in the
legitimacy of it as a piece of you know
practical photo taking or video capture
you know technique that you keep in your
arsenal and that all got awkward really
fast post requests for future tech
quickie topics to the comments or on the
line of tech tip comm forum and finally
if you haven't already click subscribe
so you don't miss any of the awesome
fast as possible episodes we're going to
keep making just like this one or if you
