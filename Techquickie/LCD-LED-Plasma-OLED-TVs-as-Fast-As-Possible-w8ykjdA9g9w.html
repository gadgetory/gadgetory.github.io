buying a TV is all these different terms
that get thrown around LED LCD plasma
CRT the BG's we're going to explain what
all those things are as fast as possible
the most common display type these days
are LCDs that stands for liquid crystal
display it involves having a back light
usually florescent with an LCD screen in
front of it the LCD screen is where the
images and the colors actually come from
one of the drawbacks of LCD is that it
can never produce true blacks because
that screen would have to become
completely opaque or solid in order to
get a true rich deep black however the
advantages of LCD are that it's
relatively inexpensive these days and
unlike traditional CRT tube TVs they are
extremely thin the next TV type LED or
light emitting diode is actually a bit
of a misnomer because an LED TV is just
an LCD TV that is a liquid crystal
display panel with an LED backlight
instead of a cathode backlight this
gives it a couple of advantages number
one is lower power consumption number
two is even thinner form factors because
they're not nearly as bulky and number
three is that with many high-end LED
arrays in the back of the TV
you can actually enable a feature called
micro dimming so that is to say that the
LCD goes black and the LED behind it in
that zone can even turn down or turn as
long as it can to make the blacks much
more true and much more rich so LED TVs
tend to be just higher-end
LCD TVs plasma TVs have turned into a
bit of a value option over time they
have excellent black levels because
instead of relying on a backlight with a
screen in front of it the plasma display
actually outputs its own light so that
means it doesn't have to output lights
very very deep blacks you also get
extremely fast response times making
plasmas great for gaming
the disadvantage of plasmas is that
compared to especially high-end LCD or
LED type TVs the colors can be a little
bit washed out if you are in daylight or
an environment where you don't have a
dark home theater to watch it on and
because the front of the display has to
be
class they tend to get a fair amount of
glare making it more difficult again
if you don't have true blackness to
watch your TV in at the last minute I
decided we should include a segment on
Oh le D so while it's not really
available in the mass market today
Oh le D addresses some of the issues
with LC D such as slow response time so
much much sharper movement it'll be
great for 3d as well as the not very
true to life deep blacks because o le D
like plasma emits its own light rather
than relying on a backlight with a panel
in front of it but it's very very
expensive right now as always guys don't
forget to subscribe to tech quickie
don't forget to like the video and share
it with anyone who you think might
benefit from this information if you
have any ideas for future fast as
possible' episodes leave them in the
