the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos wherever
you are in the world you won't have to
look hard for somebody using an iPhone
so you might think then that because the
iPhone is just about everywhere Apple
has facilities turning out iPhones all
over the world but the truth is that
most of them are assembled in just one
country China and this isn't just true
for Apple gadgets I can virtually
guarantee that if you take a closer look
at any of the mass-produced gizmos in
your home you'll find at least some
parts of it that were made or assembled
in China but why is China such a
powerhouse for electronics manufacturing
many people assume that it's because
China has a huge and inexpensive labor
force and there's definitely some truth
to this not only as China the world's
most populated country but it has lower
minimum wages than much of the Western
world in Shenzhen one of the world's
largest high-tech manufacturing hubs the
minimum wage is less than three US
dollars per hour but a large pool of
cheap labor is far from the only reason
that China is attractive to tech
companies back in the 1970s the Chinese
government became interested in moving
away from strict central planning and
toward opening up its economy to outside
investment one part of this was
designating the aforementioned Shenzhen
as a special economic zone which
encouraged foreign private businesses to
set up shop in the area through tax
breaks and relative freedom from
Beijing's regulations China was
especially interested in having these
companies manufacture exports this
strategy ended up proving very
attractive for foreign firms and today
Shenzhen is one of the world's busiest
ports as many of the companies who put
down roots there ended up building
massive factories that can very quickly
scale production if there's a huge
contract to be fulfilled like right
before a new iPhone would hit the market
and remember that in addition to
factories and laborers to work the
assembly
you also need engineers to oversee them
and China has a massive number of
Engineers that can provide middle
management way more than countries like
the u.s. furthermore because of the
sheer scope of these facilities China
can offer supply chain advantages lots
of these factories focus on custom
fabrication so everything from plastic
injection for keyboards to making sure
that a screw is the right shape and the
right size this means that because they
don't have to wait around for a part to
arrive from the other side of the world
China's manufacturers can respond
quickly to customer demands or
eleventh-hour design changes to top it
all off many Chinese manufacturers
aren't focusing just on the export
market anymore folks who live in China
are spending more on consumer goods than
they ever have before including
electronics and with 1.4 billion
potential customers right in their
backyard many of these companies are
trying to expand their capacity even
more to tap into the wallets of Chinese
citizens of course this model is largely
built on maximum efficiency which has
led to a lot of controversy over the
years about things like environmental
standards and pollution wages company
policies regarding attendance and
interactions with co-workers forced
relocation to often cramped on-campus
living quarters a need to be available
at a moment's notice and even
accusations of forced labor and these
have led many observers to call out
companies who they perceive to be using
something akin to sweatshop labor but
the fact that demand is so high for
electronics makes this a problem with no
immediately obvious answers especially
since consumers seem to be finding it
very difficult to vote with their
wallets so to speak many things that
might have been considered frivolous
gadgets 10 years ago like smartphones
are quickly becoming necessities of
modern life and last time I checked none
of those are made in the USA by
middle-class workers making Union wages
