on a report because you'd spent the
entire day screwing around and found the
incessantly white background of your
word processor in your web browser to be
unbearable
well indeed we're staying in front of
our screens later and later into the
night these days which is why today we
were honoring our first unsung hero of
tech dark mode often times it isn't
obvious whether an app or a program
features a dark mode and it's often a
little unassuming option buried in a
menu somewhere but for those of you who
are night owls you'll know that it works
by reversing the usual color scheme of
your windows putting light colored text
on a dark background but it isn't as
simple as just inverting the colors on a
webpage and calling it a day and you can
see this if you have a browser extension
that applies a dark mode as some
elements on the page often don't look as
nice while other ones such as images
won't invert or dim properly so coding a
good-looking dark mode that is specific
to a certain website often requires a
fair bit of finesse however this often
ends up being worth it as dark mode ends
up delivering quite a few benefits you
see it's pretty common these days for
phones and computers to have a built-in
night mode to reduce blue light you can
learn more about that up here but the
basic idea is that blue light from your
screens can affect your ability to
properly fall asleep so night mode
reduces blue light emissions by giving
everything a yellowish or reddish tinge
and this might not be a big deal if
you're just trying to read text but it
can result in nearly everything else
looking noticeably discolored and that's
where dark mode can be advantageous
particularly on phones many smartphones
these days use OLED screens which don't
require a backlight like a standard TV
or computer monitor would so any fully
black areas of an app in dark mode would
just have their pixels turned completely
off so much less light ends up
assaulting your eyes and although you
won't get this effect if you're using a
regular monitor as you'll still have its
entire backlight omitting blue light
dark mode can still make
much easier to look at during the night
if you don't have another way to reduce
eyestrain such as bias lighting but it
isn't just about making screens easier
on the eyes on those phones with OLED
screens that we just mentioned having
fewer pixels illuminated means that dark
mode can extend your battery life as
having your brightness turned up is a
notorious battery hog leading some
people to run their apps in dark mode
even during the daytime in fact Google
claimed a few years ago that having a
predominantly white screen can use up to
six times as much battery as a
predominantly black one on the original
pixel so it might be worth switching to
dark mode if you find yourself
consistently fighting poor battery life
Android currently offers options to
enable dark mode on frequently used apps
like phone and messages and iOS has a
smart invert colors feature that
switches Apple apps to a dark mode
pretty elegantly and also works with
third-party apps with varying degrees of
success on the desktop side of things
you can enable a dark theme in Windows
10 that can tone down the excessive
white of the settings menu and File
Explorer
so although dark modes aren't
universally present yet it's great to
see developers putting some thought into
saving our eyes and that's why it's the
first unsung hero of tech and speaking
of saving your eyes check out the
invisible shield with eye safe you
already know that bright screens that
emit blue light can both strain your
eyes and disrupt your sleep and we're
spending 10 or even more hours a day
staring at screens on average so why not
protect your eyes they're glass plus
vision guard with eye safe technology
filters harmful blue light while
maintaining the color performance of
your display so the way it does this is
that instead of blocking entire parts of
the visible spectrum vision guard will
only remove the most harmful high-energy
blue light for superior color
reproduction in fact it adheres to the
TUV Rheinland standard for maintaining
color quality glass plus vision guard is
available for both iphone and ipad so
love your eyes check it out at the link
