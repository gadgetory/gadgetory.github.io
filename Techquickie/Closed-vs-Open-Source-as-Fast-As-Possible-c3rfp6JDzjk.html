or at least a weird roommate has told
you about it at some point or another
often with the derisive snort about the
fact that you're plugging away writing
this video on the copy of Microsoft
Office that you paid for ah but don't
just bury your head in the expensive
sand maybe there's actually something to
it
we'll start by describing the opposite
of open-source software
proprietary or closed source this stuff
follows the centuries-old monetization
model of gather or make something that
people want and then sell it to them at
a given price sort of through the use of
mandatory licensing agreements that you
implicitly sign when you run it
proprietary software avoids selling you
a copy of the software that after you've
bought it then belongs to you instead
they'll sell you a license to use the
software that comes with a variety of
restrictions including limiting what you
may or may not use it for whether you
can share it whether you're allowed to
alter or reverse-engineer it or even
limiting the hardware it can be
installed on Apple famously gives away
their OS 10 operating system updates for
free as long as you meet the necessary
hardware requirements well that sounds
like rubbish I should own the things I
pay for is this how open-source works
sometimes actually the answer is a
little more complicated in that it
depends on the licensing that word again
so we'll start with a special case that
many folks confuse with open source
called source available this applies to
software that may have been published on
a blog or otherwise entered the public
domain but that the Creator has not
explicitly allowed modification or reuse
without payment or even at all open
source software by contrast is usually
free software but these terms actually
shouldn't be confused because free
software is strictly speaking more of a
philosophy and open source is just a
development model where many
collaborators contribute to a piece of
software together to make it deliver as
much value to the user as it can so
let's talk advantages number one it's
free to
and if like most open source programs
it's licensed under the GPL it can
actually be studied modified and shared
as often as you want and with whomever
you want as long as the derivative works
carry the same freedoms it's called
copyleft it's kind of a play on the
copyright thing cool right on top of
that open source advocates will point to
quick implementation of new features and
standards and these security and error
checking benefits of having a huge
community overlooking the development
but there are two sides to every coin
and detractors often people as a
bacon-flavored mouth guard and then a
user interface on top of that that's
flat-out impossible for an average user
to navigate not to mention that there's
no tech support hotline reducing its
usability once more so then why do
developers contribute their valuable
time to this movement well some do it
out of a strong moral belief that
everyone should have access to
functional and secure software others do
it just for fun or to share little
projects they created in their spare
time and see what happens to them as
others continue to modify them and
others have actually found ways to make
money by giving the software away
whether it's by charging for support
charging for optimized hardware or
charging other companies sponsorship
fees for access to their large install
base and on the subject of charging
companies sponsorship fees to access a
large user base lynda.com we're telling
