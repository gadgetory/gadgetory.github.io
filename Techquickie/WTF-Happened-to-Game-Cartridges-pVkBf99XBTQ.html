of your favorite childhood memories
maybe eating sugary cereal while
watching Saturday morning cartoons so I
can capri-sun out of a pouch or getting
weird love notes from that super awkward
kid you know who you are well if you
were like me it's blowing dust out of my
old game cartridges which would
magically make them work if they've been
misbehaving and because all of our old
consoles the NES Sega Genesis Gameboy
etcetera all these cartridges this is a
near universal rite of passage for young
gamers back in the day but fast-forward
to modern times and game cartridges have
largely disappeared Nintendo is still
using cartridge like game carts for
their 3ds and switch consoles but the
ps4 and Xbox one which are meant to stay
in the living room still use optical
discs and so did all of the predecessor
consoles it's actually been a long time
actually was the n64 was the last time
that there was a proper game console
that was based in your home that still
used cartridges see these guys they're
the future so why have they disappeared
and why were they popular in the first
place well although we usually think of
game cartridges as older tech do you
remember how quickly games used to load
compared to modern titles on optical
media I mean right now you take a game
you put it in your xbox and now that you
have to install 50 gigs to your hard
drive but you have to download another
20 gigabyte patch
whereas with Super Mario on the NES you
just put it in and you play
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do please don't use that
well not only where the cartridge is
relatively durable other than the affer
mentioned dust issues but the way they
interface with the console made them
very fast you see when you insert a
cartridge into a console this system
effectively treated its content as part
of the system's memory imagine how fast
modern PC games a load if they were just
sitting on a stick of RAM that you
insert in your motherboard instead of a
hard drive or SSD with slower loading
times of course it's not a perfect
comparison game cartridges contained
mostly read-only memory or ROM that
stored the code for the game itself
wherever you saved your progress thus a
file will be stored on either a small
amount of volatile memory that needed a
coin battery to maintain the data or a
special memory chip called an EEPROM
that doesn't need a constant supply of
power but could only hold a very small
amount of information so if cartridges
were
faster and could hold save data unlike
optical discs then why did they almost
disappear unsurprisingly as with many
great things in life a huge part of the
equation is the cost gain cartridges and
the ROM they contain is a lot more
expensive to manufacture than optical
discs which can be produced for only a
couple bucks including their packaging
and documentation although to be fair
they don't really include much
documentation these days you got to be
eco aka cheap and that gave me a cool
manual to remember how to beat the boss
or something I don't know what she
figured I don't really ever think I
found any use at all in manuals
even though data discs are much more
susceptible to things like breakage and
scratches it was a worthwhile trade-off
for the console manufacturers especially
considering there is a lot easier to
create a high-capacity optical disk and
then create a high-capacity cartridge
when games became more complex the
optical disc also allowed the likes of
Sony and Microsoft to push more games to
market prior to digital distribution
because those optical discs were so much
cheaper to produce
if you released a game that turned out
to be a giant dud in terms of sales it
didn't automatically mean that you were
going to be a completely bankrupt
company of course physical media isn't
exclusively in the form of optical discs
these days anyone who owned a Sony
discman in the 90s will know just how
much of a pain taking an optical disc on
the road can be so for portability
reasons the after mention Nintendo 3ds
and switch use game cards something that
Nintendo has been able to get away with
thanks to the following costs of
solid-state storage and their high
margins on the first party titles and I
guess third party titles too if you
think about it I don't how much Nintendo
makes for every switch game they sell I
bet it's a lot what seven dollars seven
percent seven cents okay but it should
be noted that modern game karts are
quite different from the game cartridges
of yesteryear they don't become part of
the addressable memory for the console
as instead they're much more akin to
something like a modern SD card that
means low x could still be slightly long
but there is good news nothing stopping
you from blowing the dust off of those
Nintendo cartridges and we're living the
days before your failed relationships
and crippling student loan debts but if
you want to get that self-confidence
