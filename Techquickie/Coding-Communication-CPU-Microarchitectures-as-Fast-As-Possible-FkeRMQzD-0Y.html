many of you have probably seen a few
lines of a program written in a language
like C Python or Pascal which are all
based on English and designed to be
readable by humans to some degree but
when you get right down to it the CPU
that processes all of that code is just
a hunk of silicon and the last time I
had a conversation with an inanimate
object I didn't feel like it had a whole
lot to contribute to the discussion so
how do CPUs actually take code that's
expressed in letters and numbers and put
things onto the screen that makes sense
to us carbon-based life forms well it
first helps to realize that what we call
code can actually refer to a number of
things usually when people say code
they're talking about source code which
is the English or Chinese or whatever
language you really want base set of
instructions written in whatever
programming language you like but after
a programmer finishes writing a program
in source code it needs to be further
processed so that the CPU can actually
understand it which is done by running a
source code through a special kind of
program called a compiler that will
check the code for errors and convert it
into a CPU understandable form which is
called object code or machine code the
reason that a CPU can interpret machine
code is because it's compiled in binary
the series of ones and zeros that is the
basis for all modern digital computing
but hold on a minute why can CPUs
understand ones and zeros which are just
another form of human readable
information well they can do this
because those ones and zeros are really
just representations of an electrical
signal which is on or off machine code
travels around the inside of your PC as
a series of electrical pulses that
correspond to each a 1 and 0 that the
compiler spits out and when these pulses
hit your CPU a large number of things
happen an average CPU has millions of
transistors many of which serve as logic
gates that open or shut depending if
they're receiving an electrical impulse
in other words whether they're receiving
a zero or one logic gates will open and
shut to manipulate machine code in very
complex ways until the CPU spits out
processed data that travels to other
parts of your computer all
the principles behind processor design
are immensely complicated you can think
of the transistors inside of a CPU as
beads on a really big abacus these beads
are arranged according to the processors
microarchitecture denoted by code names
such as Haswell Broadwell an Ivy Bridge
for Intel CPUs or bulldozers themed
roller and piledriver for AMD chips
however even with all these different
architectures most modern applications
will run on any of these processors
because nearly any PC CPU is going to
use the same instruction set which is
just what it sounds like the set of
binary instructions that the CPU can use
to understand and execute current
consumer CPUs for desktops and laptops
virtually all use either the x86
instruction set or the newer but
backwards compatible x86 64 instruction
set for 64-bit systems since so many
different microarchitectures make use of
the same instruction set the main
difference between them is how quickly
and efficiently different processors can
execute those set instructions although
a newer model Intel Core i7 and an older
model Core 2 Duo can understand the same
instructions the i7 is often going to be
much much faster due to its radically
different microarchitecture it's a
little bit like the difference between
accelerating in a Maserati versus a Yugo
both cars understand that pressing down
the gas pedal means go but because the
Maseratis different engine architecture
it can execute the instruction much
faster than a Yugo and suddenly you're
being pulled over don't worry though
you'll never get pulled over for
overclocking your processor you might
just void your warranty
speaking of logical systems today's
episode sponsor is FreshBooks
the cloud accounting software designed
for freelance workers and small
businesses fresh books is all about
making invoicing getting paid and
tracking expenses easier for you so you
can get back to what you actually want
to be doing they handle the whole
accounting process so input your hours
into the fresh books timesheet and
they'll export those hours directly into
an invoice
they'll send that invoice to the client
and even let you track whether or not
the client has viewed that invoice if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff
that makes you actually feel like a boss
which is exactly what FreshBooks was
designed to do if you want to give it a
shot
