won't miss any future videos remember
the days and we were all using ball mice
and we can do neat things like take the
mouse ball out and throw it at a
classmate when we got bored wait anywho
if you're old enough to have fond
memories of ball mice you probably also
remember that a mouse pad was basically
a necessity if you wanted a relatively
frustration-free mousing experience
because they provided a smooth surface
with the optimal level of friction to
prevent your cursor from getting stuck
or jumping around unpredictably causing
well cursing these days by contrast
there's a funny paradox in the mouse
industry manufacturers of modern optical
and laser mice are always going on and
on about how their latest and greatest
Mouse an eight or nine thousand can be
used on nearly any surface some of them
can even track on transparent glass
which would seem to obviate the need for
a mousepad but then you visit their
website and they're also going to be
trying to sell you on their full lineup
of you guessed it mouse pads this is
because while a good optical mouse can
track on most solid surfaces it doesn't
necessarily mean that it should not only
can they still protect the mouse's feet
from wear and dirt particles that can
affect how smooth your mouse movement is
a mousepad can keep that expensive
battlestation desk surface from being
worn down if the bottom of your mouse
isn't particularly squishy and most of
them aren't unless they're organic
in which case Wow taxidermy mouse mouse
super weird but you do you and there are
some real performance benefits as well
whether you're gaming or doing actual
work that requires precision mouse
movements maybe let's say graphic design
or something like that optical sensors
while they are less vulnerable to
surface imperfections than the ball mice
of yesteryear they can still pick up
small pits and bumps that have the
potential to wreak havoc on your
gameplay especially if you're a serious
player meaning that many gamers still
favor using a mousepad
for predictable performance especially
if they have to make really quick
movements in games like csgo or Team
Fortress and of course if you're using a
soft mousepad
there's the comfort element as well
personally I very much prefer wrestling
my wrist on a cloth pad versus a hard
desk surface though it's worth
considering that rigid mouse pads are
starting to incorporate some really cool
features like easy access USB ports that
ever pervasive RGB lighting and even
wireless charging which is really
convenient if you're using a wireless
mouse that you don't want to have to
remember to plug in every time you're
done using it so while you probably
don't need a mouse pad strictly speaking
you might find that it makes your
computing experience smoother and more
comfortable and of course it's an excuse
to buy yet another RGB product to get
your room looking that much closer to a
skittles brand disco with like a
taxidermy mouse in the middle bit weird
it's making of weird it would be weird
