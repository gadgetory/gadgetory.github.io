electric cars more than ever
and you know what why not gone are the
days when TVs were just weird concepts
that looked utterly ridiculous
now you can go down to your local
dealership and buy one just like you
would any other vehicle and I mean they
basically dominate the automotive
industry headlines courtesy of one mr.
Elon Musk but hold on a minute
despite all the hype you still don't see
them zipping around on the roads very
much in fact come to think of it we've
been hearing a ton about mainstream
electric cars for years now so why
aren't there entire fleets of them
driving around well brace yourself for
the huge shocking twist here because as
it turns out media coverage is one thing
but getting people to actually plunk
down their hard-earned money on a TV is
quite another now it is cheaper to plug
in and charge an electric car than it is
to fill a traditional vehicle with
gasoline but the higher upfront costs of
electric cars have led to some serious
cases of sticker shock now part of the
reason that electric cars continue to be
expensive is the ever pervasive early
adopter tax you see the research and
development that has gone into
roadworthy electric cars is not only
quite expensive but much of it has taken
place relatively recently meaning that
car manufacturers both large and small
are still trying to recoup their
investments plus the batteries
themselves aren't exactly cheap for an
IC e or traditional car the upfront cost
of the fuel system is what a fuel pump
and a metal cannister and some tubes by
contrast modern electric car batteries
are large and heavy and they're
manufacturer requires a number of
resources that are fairly hard to
extract this is made more difficult by
the fact that some countries with large
deposits of important materials like
lithium want to protect their rights to
those resources
not to mention that some mining
locations are in rather unstable
countries and although electric cars are
commonly billed as part of a solution to
an energy crisis that can hopefully be
adopted by a majority of consumers well
they're still positioned to a large
extent as luxury goods for example
Eevee's tend to offer much quieter rides
than their gas-powered counterparts
which is a selling point that allows
dealers to charge quite a bit more but
ok let's say you have the cash to go buy
a test lower failing that a Nissan Leaf
is there anything that would stop you
from having the automotive experience
you've always wanted well yes and I'm
not just talking about the fact that
they aren't all equipped with racing
engines a big issue with many electric
cars is the range that is how far they
can get on a single charge while pricier
Tesla's can get over 300 miles on a
single fill-up similar to some
gas-powered sports cars many of the
cheaper EVs are limited to less than 200
miles and while the vast majority of car
trips in the u.s. anyway are well under
this range limit people still get
anxious about having such a short
battery life and it's understandable
because even if you have a car that can
get 400 miles to a tank you have still
probably found yourself at least once or
twice frantically searching for a gas
station as the needle approaches the e
which leads me to the next hurdle where
exactly do you charge an electric car
obviously they aren't difficult to plug
in at home but if you're driving out on
the open road somewhere to see where
life leads you and you find your battery
running low your options might be pretty
limited
while governments and car manufacturers
are both working to build out their
infrastructure of charging stations this
is both a time consuming and expensive
endeavor and it's also much slower to
fully charge an IV than it is to fill up
a 60 to 80 litre gas tank however just
because electric cars aren't everywhere
yet doesn't mean it'll stay that way
forever not only is research still
ongoing into replacing lithium-ion
batteries with solid-state altern
that could hold more energy other
innovations like transmissions designed
for EVs could increase both the range
and performance of electric cars simply
by using gear ratios so one day in the
near future worries about running out of
juice may be a thing of the past
researchers are also working on new
power delivery mechanisms that could
reduce charge times to as little as 10
minutes by using direct current at
higher voltages and as charging stations
become more common we should see prices
start to fall
especially since governments around the
world have already begun instituting
bans on the sales of new
gasoline-powered cars which should
incentivize larger scale cheaper
production of electric alternatives at
the time we shot this video 11 countries
had such bans including France China and
the UK with them taking effect anywhere
between 2021 and 2040 so a mostly
electric future might not be too far off
but that's not to say that convincing
John to get rid of his gas guzzling
Mustang is going to be an easy task
