it's found its way into most of the
digital cameras on the planet with their
small size high capacities and
relatively low cost it's pretty easy to
see why virtually all point-and-shoot
cameras any phones that have expandable
storage and even many video cameras use
SD for storage but SD is not always the
right tool for the job and shooting
super high-res photos on a DSLR or
recording 4k video that takes up tons of
space requires flash memory with not
just high capacities but also very high
speeds and while premium models exist
low-end SD cards leave a lot to be
desired for high-end photo and video
creative professionals but to understand
the new developments we need to derail
this whole video for a moment and go
back to one of the earliest standards
for camera memory compact flash if you
owned a digicam as we used to call them
in the late 1990s or early 2000s there's
a good chance that you remember those
adorable rectangular dealies that were
thicker bigger and faster but more
expensive than SD but what you might not
know is that although SD won the
mainstream flash war compact flashed
never entirely disappeared which isn't
to say that it's aged entirely
gracefully either so when designing a
high-end SD card Buttkicker the powers
that be borrowed but didn't entirely
copy compact flash and gave us C fast a
standard that has been making its way
into higher-end photographic equipment
as the name implies C fasts main
advantage over SD and older compact
flash cards is that it actually uses the
same serial ata bus that your PC uses
whereas original compact flash used a
parallel ata connection like the one in
your Grandpa's computer that means that
C fast cards can perform data transfers
at up to 600 megabytes per second just
like a high-end SSD making them ideal
for 4k video and other bandwidth heavy
applications especially when you compare
them to
d cards which currently top out at less
than half of that speed the C fast
interface itself has also become useful
even if you don't want the cards because
C fast uses the SATA bus it's compatible
with SATA SSDs which one enterprising
kickstarter are used as the basic idea
behind the c box an adapter that
attaches to the cameras and camcorders
slots and then holds two SSDs connecting
directly to C fast so you can record 4k
video directly to your SSD drives
without having to worry about space
constraints and the horrendous cost of
the more compact flash memory cards but
hold on a second Linus should I really
be buying all of these C fast cards it
sounds useful but what if it goes the
way of Betamax or the HD DVD good
question there's currently a small but
intense format war going on in the
high-end video scene between C fast and
a competing standard called xqd which
uses the even faster PCI Express bus and
promises capacities up to two terabytes
on a single card and as if that weren't
enough SD and micro SD cards refuse to
go gently into that good night with
speed and capacity revisions showing up
every few years someone I guess there's
SATA SSDs themselves as well that even
some cameras do you so know it isn't
clear which of these rival formats are
going to end up dominating high-end
photography and video recording but at
least whichever one wins we can sleep
comfortably knowing that the camera on
the end of our next generation selfie
stick is capturing every detail of our
nose pores a glorious 4k blob broad gob
and glob bless
and bless mass drop to mass drop is the
site where you guys the community say
hey we'd sure like to get like a great
deal on whatever it happens to be what
if we all pitched in to buy one could we
get a discount and they go yeah they
work directly with manufacturers and
distributors to arrange for what is
essentially group buys and we've got a
pretty interesting one here today it's
the Ultimate Ears
eighteen pro custom in-ear monitors
these are
different from your typical in-ear
earphones basically you visit an
audiologist for ear impressions you ship
those impressions to mass drop then
ultimate ears will manufacture what is
essentially a tailor-made pair of IMS
just for you sure they're still
expensive even with a bunch of people
committing to buy them but you're going
to get six balanced armature drivers to
high to mid to low and thanks to the
molded fit a whopping minus 26 decibels
of noise isolation oh and you can
customize the covers on them too so
check out the link in the video
description if you want to learn more
about this particular drop and just to
check out mass drop in general because
they've got a wack ton of cool stuff
everything from like knives to keyboards
to well high-end audio equipment just
like this so I guess that's pretty much
it guys like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible just like
this one and check out our channel super
fun channel where we've actually got a
pretty slick video that just went up I
forget what it was
right yeah rubber band machine gun check
that out with the little I in the top
right corner and have a card there for
ya see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
