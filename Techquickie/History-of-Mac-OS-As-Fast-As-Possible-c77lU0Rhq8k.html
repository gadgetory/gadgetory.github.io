quite like what George Orwell envisioned
in his famous dystopian novel however
something did happen that year the very
first Apple Macintosh was released
giving average people the chance to own
their very own personal computer with a
graphical user interface or GUI for the
low price of just two thousand four
hundred and ninety five dollars and
while that may seem steep especially for
the dollar value back then it was a
breakthrough at the time since Apple's
previous GUI based computer the Lisa
sold for 10 grand so it was no big
surprise that it was the Mac instead
that popularized the concept of using a
mouse to click on what you want instead
of having to type everything into a DA
style command line but as innovative as
a mainstream GUI for home users was the
original Mac OS wasn't without its
shortcomings although it introduced the
now-familiar file folder the first Mac
OS file system didn't truly support
nested directories das actually did this
prior to the release of the first Mac
and while the original Mac was also
incapable of multitasking for the most
part it's more intuitive interface
compared to command line operating
systems paved the way for gooeys to
become standard in home pcs in fact
there was some pretty messy litigation
that went on after Microsoft licensed
elements of Mac OS users interface for
early versions of Windows as Apple
claimed that Microsoft borrowed beyond
the license terms but although Apple
pioneered the home PC GUI it didn't
really change a whole lot
aside from incremental performance
improvements until the release of system
7 in 1991 which made true color
rendering a standard feature for the
first time remove the old 8 megabyte RAM
limit thanks to 32-bit support added the
TrueType fonts which would make it much
easier to tell what a printer would look
like added virtual memory true
multitasking and the all-important
drag-and-drop functionality we've all
come to take for granted today system 7
was also the first mac OS to support
those PowerPC processors that remained
one of the core differentiators between
Macs and IBM pc compatibles or Wintel
machines until 2006 and although the
move to PowerPC meant an increase in
performance compared to older Macs
application support for the Mac platform
still lagged behind Wintel computers
this month that Apple was facing a
decline in profit for several years but
they started to reverse their fortunes
by rolling out Mac OS 8 in 1997 which
featured an actual color interface like
the ones were accustomed to seeing today
a customizable background and native
ability to search the web speaking of
which this was the first Mac OS to
include a default browser but no not
Safari Internet Explorer as per an
agreement with Microsoft Mac OS 9
released a couple years later featured
things like 128 bit encryption support
and better voice recognition but a
massive change came in 2001 when the now
ubiquitous OS X made its debut OS X's
underlying code was completely different
from all other Mac OS versions in order
to be more attractive to third-party
software developers of course there were
plenty different for the average user as
well including much sleeker interface
called
aqua that's sort of foreshadowed the
what microsoft would later do with XP
later that year more stable multitasking
system-wide spell-checking and of course
revisions all named after big scary cats
for whatever reason instead of releasing
all new operating systems every few
years
Apple has focused on incremental
improvements to OS X since 2001 with
features like DVD playback multi-user
switching and 64-bit support being added
over time OS X Tiger released in 2005
was a particularly important revision as
Tiger was the first version of Mac OS to
support the new 64-bit Intel chips
I started making their way into Apple
pcs the very next year Mac OS has moved
towards support for x86 64 has made it a
more popular program for software
developers meaning OS X has carved out a
nice niche for itself in several markets
particularly designers and content
creators especially the ones that are
interested in spending $3,000 on a
workstation that looks like a futuristic
wastebasket speaking of content creators
