ultra HD can i download it to my
computer like more memory short answer
no unfortunately 4k is an all new
standard also known as Ultra HD that's
3840 by 2160 pixels this makes it twice
1920 by twice 1080 for effectively four
times as many pixels and a much sharper
image compared to 1080p so how do I get
4k and what can I watch on it right now
the answer is not much 4k TVs are
prohibitively expensive except at the
time of filming there's one very low
price option under $1500 everything else
is $5,000 and up and on the computer
desktop the 4k 32 inch monitor that's
available is around $4,500 so content
wise movies aren't really being released
in 4k PC gains can be played in 4k as
long as you have the graphics horsepower
to back it up but next generation
consoles to our knowledge will not
support 4k and sony has a 4k
distribution box coming apparently the
ps4 will be able to play 4k movies but
everything's very much up in the air
right now with that said the benefit you
get with the more the increased clarity
in terms of the image quality it's up to
you the individual to decide whether
it's worth the additional price tag for
a 4k set thank you for checking out this
fast as possible on tech quickie I'll
see you again next time and as always

you this question if you think the
explanation inside this video is
adequate for your needs and junk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
