wireless technology cannot be stopped I
mean we keep flinging more and more
stuff through the airwaves at such a
rate that it's gotten to the point where
wireless routers and adapters lose their
value the same way as a new car being
driven off the lot but even so the
latest device is beginning to hit the
market feature a number of bells and
whistles that could make the long term
solutions for even the heaviest users
I'm talking of course about wireless AC
wave 2 well wait a second Linus didn't
wireless AC just come out not that long
ago yes it did and wave 1 gear isn't bad
it brought a number of improvements over
older standards like 802.11 n and G like
doing away with 2.4 gigahertz and
dramatically improving speeds but they
were stuck in the past in one very
crucial way a wave one router or access
point can only communicate with one
device at a time well hold on a second
again Linus my old router at home has
like 12 things connected to it at a time
and they all work so how can what you're
saying be true
well routers and access points prior to
wave to have to communicate with all of
those devices sequentially assuming that
it's only operating on one band you can
find out more about that in our video on
try band Wi-Fi here this can lead to
Network slowdowns and possibly wasted
bandwidth you see wave 1 devices support
up to 3 streams and what this
essentially means is that you have three
antennas coming off the router and each
one has a certain bandwidth that is 433
megabits per second if your client
device has three streams let's say a
desktop rig with a PCI Express Wi-Fi
adapter with three antennas on it then
you could actually triple that speed and
get up to 1300 megabits per second but
most people's AC devices are more likely
to be consumer electronics like smart
phones which typically only support one
stream and because wave 1 routers can
only connect
to them sequentially that means a full
two-thirds of your router's bandwidth
could be left unused at any given moment
what wave2 does instead is use a new
technology called mu-mimo and mu-mimo
this allows the router to connect to
multiple cows I mean devices all at once
so if you have a four stream router and
say to stream laptop a one stream phone
and a one stream tablet you can use all
of your routers bandwidth meaning fewer
slowdowns which is especially important
for public Wi-Fi hotspots with a ton of
devices connected at once and yeah
that's right I said for stream router
which is also a new wave to feature if
you connect to a four stream client you
can actually have a maximum theoretical
speed of nearly 3.5 gigabits per second
more than two and a half times faster
than wave one since wave 2 can now
leverage up to 160 megahertz wide
channels so that's double the bandwidth
of wave 1 effectively meaning more room
for your data to flow but hold on a
second before you rush out and buy a
shiny new wave 2 router there are a few
limitations and caveats both your router
and your device have to support wave 2
to take advantage of the faster speeds
and mu-mimo older devices will still
work as wave 2 is backwards compatible
not just with AC wave 1 but also
wireless n but you won't see the
benefits in action and keep in mind too
that while those wicked fast speeds with
a hundred and sixty megahertz wide data
superhighways might sound great for
wireless 4k video streaming which they
could do the practical limits of the
technology will actually be lower in
crowded areas with many access points
and clients like in condominiums where
users of 2.4 gigahertz are already
experiencing what it's like to have many
access points competing for airtime
where each of them takes up a full third
of the available spectrum which setting
your AP to 160 megahertz would do on 5
gigahertz I mean it wouldn't be your
problem I guess
but your neighbor wouldn't like it
very much and speaking of things that
your neighbor might like mass drop head
over to draw dots slash Linus tech tips
and check out the latest awesome stuff
going on over there they've got all
kinds of things available on mass drop
like knives or you know monitors
keyboards drones yes the feature deal
right now is a 3d our iris plus aerial
surveyor drone it offers 16 to 22
minutes of flight time a payload
capacity of 400 grams it's got a GoPro
compatible camera mount and it can
stream live from a GoPro to a wireless
monitor attached to the iris plus
controller so wait a second why would I
buy this on mass drop it's like oh right
lower prices so the way mass drop works
is the more people commit to buy the
lower the price goes and this one's
lowest drop is $100 off retail $4.99
u.s. plus shipping but if you're not
interested in a drone go check out mass
drop anyway because they got all kinds
of awesome stuff over there so thanks
for watching guys if you liked the video
hit that like button if you just liked
it well hit the other button also check
out our other channels we've got a great
video we just released with like
wirelessly controlled cars whipping
around a track that was pretty sweet and
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future videos subscribe follow
oh and last but not least a big THANK
YOU to Joel from Metta geek for helping
us out with this episode of fast as
possible those guys over there really
know their Wi-Fi and yes you can check
them out over at side well Google Metta
geek I don't remember their site off the
top of my head but yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
