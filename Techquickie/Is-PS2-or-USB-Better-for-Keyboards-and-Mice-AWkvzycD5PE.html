computing is the move towards one port
for seemingly everything and yes I know
that audio monitors and Ethernet are
major exceptions but since the
introduction of USB in 1996 we have come
a long way from the days when it seemed
like every single device had its own
specialized port but even so there's one
crucial situation where some folks still
haven't fully embraced USB I'm talking
keyboards and mice while the vast
majority of these input devices sold do
connect via USB there's actually still a
different connection that some people
still use the venerable ps2 port so why
do some people still prefer these round
green and purple 90s throw backs well
although both ps2 and USB seem to do the
same thing connect a keyboard or Mouse
to your computer there are a number of
significant differences in how they work
that make them still seem relevant even
on high-end motherboards you see a USB
keyboard or Mouse connection works by
pulling your device so in the computer
equivalent of our me there yet many
times per second your computer
essentially asks your keyboard or mouse
hey what you doing what you doing what
you doing and the keyboard or mouse will
then respond by saying for example
nothing moving to the left
having my deeky pushed down or
strangling my owner ps2 devices on the
other hand
work by sending interrupts to the system
so instead of waving around for the
computer to ask about its current state
the ps/2 protocol allows your keyboard
or mouse to actively interrupt whatever
your CPU is doing to tell the computer
what's happening and this might sound
potentially inefficient but because
modern CPUs run at millions or even
billions of cycles per second you'd
never notice a slowdown so it's for this
reason that some enthusiasts claim that
ps2 has less perceptible latency which
should theoretically make response times
quicker in games and ps2 also supports
true end key rollover meaning that the
system will register as many keys as you
can push down at once
there are USB keyboards that also
advertise this functionality but this is
usually done by emulating multiple
keyboards which can limit how many
additional input devices you can connect
by requiring special software or by
suffering from compatibility issues at
boot time because ps2 is a dedicated
interface just for keyboards and mice
ps2 devices don't have weird issues
where your computer doesn't recognize
them properly in the BIOS or before
windows loads drivers as can happen
occasionally with USB gadgets
Wow well that's a lot of benefits
long live ps2 right well hold on in
reality the virtually certain to work
level of compatibility is about it's
only real world benefit for most people
even many competitive gamers have a pint
that whatever enhanced responsiveness
they get from ps2 is basically
imperceptible with factors like key
switch type being much more important
for a competitive edge and ps2 has other
limitations as well it wasn't designed
to be electrically hot swappable and on
older hardware trying to swap out a
keyboard or mouse can
make it not work until you reboot or
even worse actually damage your
equipment and not only that since they
weren't meant to be unplugged and
plugged back in frequently it is easy to
bend or even break the little pins at
the end of the cable
so in short ps2 connectors take up more
space and simply aren't as tough as
their USB counterparts so unless you
have a very specific need for ps2 IT
technicians still love them there's
really no reason to fear missing out on
anything if you just go with a USB
keyboard assuming of course that you
don't have a classic model M keyboard
that uses it or you know maybe just a
major old-school IO fetish for like
those giant printer ports that we all
know and tolerate tunnel bear VPN lets
you tunnel to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the Internet and
use online services as though you're in
a different country but Linus VPNs are
hard to use port configurations and that
or the no it's actually super simple
tunnel bear is available for iOS Android
PC and Mac they even have a Chrome
extension and you basically just press
one button and when you press the button
a couple things happen your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption which makes it harder for
your isp to track what you're doing
online and your public IP address gets
switched so you show up as though you're
in a different country allowing you to
bypass pesky geo restrictions that limit
the video content that you can watch or
the news articles that you can read for
example Tunnel bear has a top rated
privacy policy and they do not log your
activity so try it out for free with
five hundred Meg's of data with no
credit card required at the link below
Tunnel bear calm slash Linus so thanks
for watching guys like dislike check out
our other channels leave a comment with
suggestions and subscribe make sure you
subscribe if you don't subscribe then
Bears will come tumblin to your house
and tell you to use tunnel bear and also
to subscribe too
