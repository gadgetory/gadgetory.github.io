CPUs we did an episode about what we
could expect from their new lineup and
whether team red could finally be a
serious competitor to Intel again if you
missed that one you can check it out up
here but come on back afterwards because
it's been over two years now and it's
time to have a look at how Intel has
started to struggle against a resurgent
AMD in fact from late 2017 to late 2018
AMD's market share increased by three
point eight percent on desktop three
point four percent in servers and 5.2
percent in notebooks and seeing as Intel
is the player in all of these markets
anything that AMD games reflects a loss
for Intel but why exactly is this
happening well for a long time AMD was
forced into a strategy of competing on
Raw price to performance as for a long
time that they simply couldn't make any
chips that could come close to the
performance of Intel's offerings forcing
them to cut prices Intel by contrast
could to a point anyway charge whatever
they wanted as they didn't have any real
competition at the higher end this
allowed them to make much more margin
all of this changed however with AMD's
news and architecture and although rise
in legs a bit behind Intel in some
performance metrics notably gaming AMD
having spent so many years operating on
lower margins took a fundamentally
different approach to their CPU design
that worked really well to save R&amp;amp;D they
opted for a modular design that could be
scaled up and down more easily and then
for their higher end many core products
they even used multiple smaller chip
lengths to decrease manufacturing waste
this along with aggressively low pricing
started to eat into Intel's dominance as
it turns out users are happy to give up
a small amount of performance for a
significant cost savings but AMD just
making a decent processor for a change
and pricing it competitively is only
part of the story here intel has all
had their own very public issues
transitioning to their ten nanometer
manufacturing process now according to
their original roadmap they should have
been finished years ago but they still
only have a few ten nanometer skews on
the market but why does that matter
well here's the thing whenever you hear
CPU aficionados talk about a certain
number of nanometers they're referring
to the transistor sizes on the CPU die
smaller transistors mean that more of
them can be packed onto a given area
increasing performance as well as power
efficiency that means that it's very
helpful to make your CPUs on a smaller
note and while AMD hasn't had much issue
getting their transistors down to size
intel has struggled
unlike AMD who contracts its fabrication
work to facilities that specialize in
manufacturing different kinds of
processors for a variety of clients
Intel who owns their own fabs is more or
less trying to figure everything out on
their own it also helps to remember that
for some time now Intel's transistor
density has often been higher than that
of AMD as numbers like 14 nanometer and
10 nanometer are actually just
estimations so a 10 nanometer Intel chip
might actually have a distance of closer
to 8 or so nanometers between
transistors which makes further
shrinkages even more challenging so this
means that Intel has spent about the
last four years trying to squeeze more
blood from the stone of their poor 14
nanometer or plus or plus plus process
with only small incremental performance
improvements to show for it it's been a
period of clear stagnation for Team Blue
compared to their impressive track
record for the prior 35 or so years
adding insult to injury Intel struggles
with ten nanometer have also been a
contributing factor to the ongoing
shortage of Intel CPUs particularly at
the lower end because the company has
been devoting resources to figuring out
the 10 nanometer problem it hasn't been
able to crank out enough 14 nanometer
chips to meet the ever higher demand for
entry-level devices like Chromebooks and
low-power laptops combine this with the
that intel places a higher priority on
high-end chips due to their larger
profit margins and AMD has stepped in
and sold tons of its own lower end CPUs
to fill the gap on the subject of
Chromebooks Intel has additional threats
on the horizon to Qualcomm best known
for their Snapdragon mobile processors
is trying to push a line right now of
laptop CPUs optimized for power savings
but while Intel is facing a number of
issues at the moment it's important to
remember that they are still the market
leader in CPUs by a very wide margin
with plenty of cash in the bank so
they've got time to turn it around Intel
is exploring GPU technology quite
aggressively and they're also looking at
new manufacturing techniques for both 10
and 7 nanometer chips it's just not
clear when we'll see them in large
numbers in the meantime though we will
be carefully watching to see if Intel
eventually loses all of its market share
to its competitors but my money's on
them figuring it out instead of going
the way of MySpace
