a video explaining refresh rate but a
couple of days ago a gif of me I don't
care I'll sit however I want a gif of me
pretending to rush to the bathroom to
vomit after using a monitor running at
30 Hertz front page dinger thanks to a
post on our / PC master-race by IP
Charger this alone wouldn't have
justified the creation of this video but
some of the discussion that went on
under the posts showed me that y'all
need something to point at when people
are all like Oh thirty Hertz is all we
need so here we go the refresh rate of a
display is the number of times per
second measured in Hertz that your
display will update with new information
the benefits are simple with older CRT
two monitors having a high refresh rate
was critical because it reduced
perceptible flickering and improved user
comfort but because modern LCD and OLED
displays don't work quite the same way
the big remaining benefit is that as
long as the source material is running
at a high enough framerate your eyes
will receive more updates per second
resulting in a smoother moving image
kind of like what you're looking at
right now the drawbacks are a bit more
complicated to send more images per
second we need to send more data which
means faster interconnects and higher
quality cable solutions but there's more
for video capture and creation we need
faster processors and more storage space
to work with
high frame rate content and for gaming
we need much more powerful graphics
cards to even render the scene fast
enough to get any benefit otherwise the
high refresh rate display will simply
display the same image over and over as
long as it's waiting for a new one who
cares Linus I heard that the human eye
can see a maximum of 24 frames per
second anyway otherwise how would movies
look smooth they run at 24 frames per
second movies look smooth because motion
blur gives that miraculous brain of
yours the hints it needs to fill in the
gaps not because your eyes can't perform
any better well hold on Linus my game
support motion blur - same difference
right no not at all in games motion blur
is not a natural side effect of the way
that light is captured by a camera
sensor or film strip it looks unnatural
and on
for that it adds more latency between
the input of the user and the action
showing up on screen which makes the
controls feel less responsive another
factor that affects the perceived
smoothness of an image especially an
interactive one but you don't need to
take my word for it it isn't new
information here's an article from 2001
like back when the internet was texts
that addressed this issue pretty well I
thought the way your eyes work is much
more complicated than frames per second
they're designed to perceive motion
changes in light levels and even certain
colors better than others and further
complicating matters sensitivity will
vary from person to person so really
measuring the performance of eyes in
images per second is about like
measuring the tastiness of a bowl of
Kraft Dinner in I don't know rupees okay
fine
but the point is that representing the
real world limit isn't just as simple as
one number and we plain don't know how
to quantify it in simple terms what we
do know however is that if it was a
simple number it sure as heck wouldn't
be 24 frames per second or 30 or even 60
if that were true then surely no one
would have noticed that the high frame
rate 48 FPS version of The Hobbit looked
weirdly smooth and right also this trick
where I easily picked out a 120 Hertz
monitor versus a 60 Hertz monitor 100%
of the time would have been impossible
also those nine hundred and sixty Hertz
clear motion TVs at the store would be
snake-oil than right let me pay well
those actually are kind of snake oil
they're using predictive algorithms to
make like fake Oh tweener frames and
then playing around with backlight
refresh tricks to increase the refresh
rate that you perceive but it still
reinforces my point that your eyes
aren't that simple don't fight it
while filmmakers and cinema goers still
need to work with each other to figure
out the best format for their future for
gamers we need to all be united under
one banner and ask for more until we
reach the upper limits of what we can
perceive and it sure isn't 24 or 30 FPS
because if it was this image wouldn't
offend anyone since they probably
wouldn't see it thanks for watching guys
