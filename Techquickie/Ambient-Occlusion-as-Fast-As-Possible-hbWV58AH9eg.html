thrown around a lot in 3d rendering and
to gamers but what is it and how does it
work first let's determine what
occlusion means the columns world
English dictionary defines occlusion as
to block stop or obstruct so for our
discussion today we can comfortably
describe occlusion as the amount of
obstruction there is between one point
or region of a 3d scene and a light
source now let's add the whole ambient
part into the mix from Wikipedia ambient
occlusion is a render technique used to
calculate how exposed each object or
pointed as scene is to the ambient
lighting to expand on that it's a global
method of illuminating a scene whereby
each point or object is lit by taking
all the other geometry in the scene into
account so even though a shadow is not
clearly defined or hard-coded areas that
are less exposed naturally to direct or
indirect light like corners will appear
dark and shadowy now even though it's
more comprehensive than local methods
like Phong shading an early technique
for approximating the shading of a
smooth surface in 3d graphics ambient
lighting is still a pretty crude method
of achieving global illumination more on
that later okay so it's a lighting
effect that graphic designers and game
developers use to add realistic shading
to a scene but how does it work and why
should I care
great question an amine occlusion was
first introduced to gaming in 2007 by
the developers of crisis due to hardware
limitations
Crytek implemented a scaled-down version
of ambient occlusion called screen space
ambient occlusion or SSAO SSAO works by
using pixel depth rather than scene
geometry to form an ambient occlusion
map it is a much more simple process as
it applies a somewhat realistic amount
of occlusion to each pixel in relation
to those around it rather than
evaluating the shading of an entire room
for example based on a light source or
multiple light sources SSA OS advantages
include zero load time and no
pre-processing so it works the same for
every pixel on the screen and no CPU
usage that's right it can add a huge
amount of depth and complexity to a
scene and only ends up TAC
the GPU pretty cool it does have
disadvantages though it will not
represent the scene as accurately as
true ambient occlusion would as it only
takes what you can see on screen into
account and there are some issues with
accurately blurring and smoothing out
noise without interfering with depth
discontinuities like hard edges it's
certainly not a perfect solution so in
2009 we got an upgrade to SS vo screen
space directional occlusion this allowed
game engines to calculate local indirect
illumination and cast directional
shadows without the aid of an
environmental map SSTO allowed for a
wider variety of shades by taking the
angle from which the light approaches
the object as well as the bounce of the
light off an object behind the initial
object into account this helps but it's
still a far cry from true ambient
occlusion so we covered the
approximations but what would true
ambient occlusion look like well in a
perfect world with uber computers every
aspect of the scenes geometry would be
taken into account from your character's
model to the bridge directly in front of
you all the way down to the tree 300
yards behind you light would bounce off
all of these elements to create a photo
realistic lighting model like the
groundbreaking full global illumination
method that Pixar implemented in
monsters you unfortunately
rendering all of this in real time would
be extremely taxing on your hardware
which is what makes it nearly impossible
to achieve in games with modern
technology some advances have been made
though through pre-rendering parts of
the scenes occlusion like the occlusion
caused by your character's model or
static objects and outdoor scenes or by
separating high-frequency detailed
ambient occlusion for objects close to
you from low-frequency ambient occlusion
on distant objects but we're still
unable to achieve true ambient occlusion
in real time so for now we'll have to
deal with the approximations first world
problem right speaking of first world
problems waiting for your computer to
start up with a little hard drive can be
a real pain in the butt which is why
today's video is brought to you by the
letter A data a data right featuring
their SP 910 series of SSDs their
Marvell controller offers outstanding
performance with sequential read and
write speeds of up to 560
460 megabytes per second and 4k random
read/write speeds of up to 90 1077
thousand i ops which means a massive
performance improvement over your hard
drive out-of-the-box and thanks to
support for trim and smart great
performance and reliability over time as
well they are available now in 128 256
512 gig and even one terabyte capacities
so if you like tech quickie and you like
the companies who sponsor it be sure to
give a data a look if you're in the
market for a new SSD anyway guys thanks
for watching like if you liked dislike
