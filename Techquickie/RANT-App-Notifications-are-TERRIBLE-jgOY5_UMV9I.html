app notifications I mean okay sure you
want to know when you get an angry email
from your boss or when someone on
Twitter responded to one of your hot
takes but why does it game that I hardly
ever play think that it's okay to send
me a dozen reminders every day to inform
me that I hardly ever play it I mean
weren't notifications designed to be
useful back in 2003 blackberry started
pushing out emails so that you wouldn't
have to keep checking your messages over
and over to see if you had anything
important to deal with and that was a
godsend so you would think that the
likes of Google and Apple would have
found a way to keep the original spirit
of the push notification alive but this
is 2019 we're even cat underwear can be
monetized so of course developers
decided that push notifications would be
a great way not to let us know when
something important was happening but
rather to maintain a constant presence
in our minds and therefore our wallets
and it's having a real-world impact app
and notification fatigue are real things
now did you know that according to one
survey over 70% of users said that six
or more notifications from one app in a
week would cause them to stop using that
app altogether but nevertheless
developers think it's a great idea to
keep shoving more and more notifications
down our throats I mean is there an
emptier feeling than seeing your phone
line up with a tender notification
thinking someone might finally be
interested just to find out they're
trying to sell you more crappy features
you don't need not that I would know
anything about that of course anyway not
only do ab developers keep sending you
notifications because more eyeballs on
their apps means more money but the
people running the big app marketplaces
so that's the aforementioned
Apple in Google they really have no
incentive to stop the avalanche of
garbage showing up at the top of our
screens because why would they not only
do Google and Apple take a cut when you
buy a premium app they also take 30% of
the money that you spend on in-app
purchases so more screen time increases
the likely
that you'll buy more like gold coins for
that stupid tile-matching game that you
love so much and then even if you don't
do that it makes it more likely that
you'll engage with their own paid or ad
supported services and what better way
to assure that we are all staring at our
screens like a bunch of brainless sheep
than to have our phones chirping us with
notifications all the time now to be
fair there are ways to turn off
notifications for problematic apps and
you can do it here on Android and here
on iOS but for goodness sake there has
to be a better way to do this other than
us wasting time that we could spend
doing literally anything else
digging through menus and disabling
notifications one at a time or even
worse trying to figure out androids
confusing new notification category
system now individual apps also allow
you to alter these settings but like
social media platforms for example are
notorious for having such an endless
amount of customization in their
notification menus that it is nearly
impossible to disable the spam you don't
want without accidentally missing
something important
so many users just end up leaving it on
now I really don't think it would be
that hard for Google and Apple with
their billions of dollars to realize
that people do remove irritating apps
and also to develop an algorithm to
separate out the unimportant stuff from
the good stuff I mean Google literally
did this for your Gmail inbox already
and then probably the craziest part of
all this for me
is that while I can understand the
motivation for stuffing more spam down
our throats what is up with the apps
that failed to deliver the notifications
we asked for why is it that my chat app
will neglect to send me pings for two
hours then hit me with all of them at
once when I happen to open it or what
about YouTube's brilliant strategy of
picking and choosing which channels to
bother informing me about a new video
from I mean I clicked subscribe I
actually want to hear about it
unfortunately right now other than
training in notification blocker foo I
don't have a great solution for you but
stay tuned because here at linus media
group we are hard at work on the tech
quickie freemium notification blocker at
every time a notification comes through
it'll read it send that data back
our servers then send you a notification
announcing that the notification has
been blocked and if that sounds good
you're wrong that sounds horrible and
you are part of the problem
speaking of part of the problem don't be
part of the problem with bad hair Dollar
