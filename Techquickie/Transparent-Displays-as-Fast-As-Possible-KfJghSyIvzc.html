world that screams cool quite like a
transparent display whether we're
talking robert downey jr x' warnings
about his imminent destruction in his
Iron Man suit mask the rebel base on
Hoth or Tom Cruise whipping through
evidence in Minority Report there's been
no shortage of sci-fi writers and
dreamers who love the idea of working on
a clear screen so like anything in Star
Trek they're a reality now but how do
they wake well the underlying technology
that makes clear screens possible has
actually been around for quite some time
any flat panel LCD display features a
layer of pixels the supporting color
filters and the electronics required to
power them and it's all see-through or
you'd never see the backlight through it
in fact transparent LCDs were notably
shown off by Samsung in its smart window
which works like a regular window in
your home but can display the weather
email travel information and other
useful stuff and can even act as a
digital venetian blind when you want to
darken the room but this concept only
works because the Sun provides
backlighting during the day at night it
needs to be lit from an artificial
source powered by a solar battery or
something that is why transparent
screens made from old LEDs are where a
lot of the current excitement is because
the diodes themselves generate their own
light from an electric current due to
their chemistry so they don't need to be
attached to a bulky backlight which not
only means you can use them in dark
environments but they can also be made
super thin and flexible perfect for a
transparent display Oh LEDs can even be
screen printed onto a plastic base or
late as a thin film making it a super
versatile technology
well Linus you say it's super versatile
so but what can we actually use this
stuff for well how about heads-up
displays or HUDs in both aircraft and
cars the current solutions use
projectors with poor viewing angles a
transparent display HUD could not only
provide much better image quality but
make important information like
speed and remaining fuel viewable no
matter where the pilot or drivers
looking and even use augmented reality
to overlay the names of streets or
landmarks onto a windshield or even help
with safety information like overlaying
the view from a blind spot camera or
what about this imagine if you had a
transparent smartphone display that
could work on both sides Fujitsu has
been working on just that thing allowing
users to grip an on screen object from
both sides of the phone and speaking of
smart phones researchers at Corning had
developed a way to embed tiny sensors
right in the surface of a glass display
that can keep tabs on things like health
information or the ambient temperature
without the need for additional hardware
and there are plenty of ways for
transparent screens to enhance your
shopping experience this is one of the
big ones that the manufacturers are
pushing for so one example here is for
an iPad a pair of Nikes or whatever else
is on sale to be kept inside a glass
display that doubles as a clear screen
displaying pricing information product
features and other interactive elements
a shopper can use while still being able
to look at the product itself and as a
security device and if you're not in the
market for expensive sneakers we should
be seeing this technology find its way
into much more affordable options like
vending machines to tell you how many
calories are in that bag of chips that
your eye over there there are a few
kinks to be worked out like increasing
the lifespan of OLED and improving on
the current 70% or so transparency of
the showcase technology that exists
today so it doesn't look like you're
looking at whatever it is through a
dirty window but when that happens I
mean man the sky's the limit I'm not
much of a fashionista but there's going
to be some fantastic wearable technology
when this stuff hits the mainstream and
what would make you look great with your
wearable technology a clean shave Dollar
Shave Club is the source for
high-quality razors and other bathroom
supplies and you don't even have to go
in and get them they actually are the
source and the delivery mechanism it
just shows up at your door every month
