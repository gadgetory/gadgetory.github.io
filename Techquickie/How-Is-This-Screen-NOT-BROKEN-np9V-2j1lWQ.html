gadgets trying to capture your attention
with well varying degrees of success but
every so often we see something with a
truly undeniable cool factor and devices
with foldable screens which appear to be
just around the bend
might just be the next example of this
but what sort of new-school science
fiction makes foldable screens possible
I mean from the time we were all
watching heavy tube TVs with rabbit ear
antennas to now streaming on Netflix on
our iPhones we've always used rigid
displays well it turns out that a simple
form of foldable display tech was
actually invented all the way back in
1974 when disco of all things was first
catching on that year a Xerox employee
developed the Jireh con which was
actually an early form of electronic
paper similar to what you'd find in
today's ear eaters like the Amazon
Kindle now because it worked by
suspending ink containing particles in
fluid it didn't need a rigid frame or a
backing instead the device just applied
a voltage to each particle to get it
show either black or white depending on
what text was to be displayed of course
these days flexible displays with the
low resolution of an e-ink device aren't
what most people are interested in
rather the foldable display tech we're
all expecting to see in our smartphones
in the near future is going to be based
around Oh LEDs now you can learn more
about ole Ed's here but the important
thing to know is that their chemical
makeup allows them to produce their own
light meaning that they don't need a
bulky backlight behind the color layer
this has made it possible for companies
like LG to build shockingly thin TVs but
how do we go from a thin but still rigid
screen to a screen that you can fold or
even roll up well as it turns out the O
LEDs themselves are only about one ten
thousandth of a millimeter thick that is
a thousand times thinner than your
average sheet of paper so it's not that
hard to fathom that you could fold them
like a piece of paper so while most
current phones and TVs attach o leads to
a piece of
glass which is obviously thicker and
less foldable than paper foldable
displays instead use a layer of bendable
plastic to support the O LEDs so then
that's it you swap out your glass for
plastic and Bob's your uncle
you got a foldable just I'm just kidding
so of course it's not that simple I mean
think about it
if you were to fold a piece of paper
over and over again along the same
crease it will eventually weaken and
break and this is paper it's designed to
be folded this is not the kind of
behavior you want out of an expensive
smartphone so not just any old thin
piece of plastic is gonna do the trick
instead Samsung appears to be using a
special glass plastic hybrid layer to
give its foldable phone a little more
resiliency and strength and this is
really cool it's supposed to be stronger
than Gorilla Glass but only about 50
microns thick making it easy to fold
another challenge though has been to
incorporate electronics other than the
actual ohlet's now it might not be
difficult to picture a flexible printed
circuit board I mean you can get roll-up
keyboards for 25 bucks on eBay but
manufacturing a touchscreen that can be
folded is more of a novel problem as the
layer that responds to touch on
traditional smartphones and tablets is
rigid meaning that manufacturers might
have to turn to more exotic nano
materials all of this though is really
cool but kind of raises the question
what even is the point of going to all
this trouble just for a foldable screen
I mean aren't our typical you know
Hershey bar shaped phones serving us
just fine without another gimmick
well one huge potential advantage of
foldable devices is that there'll be a
lot harder to break either from
accidental drops or just even leaving
them in your back pocket and the Android
team is already working on developer
options that should allow apps to take
full advantage of foldable screens and
change layouts or add functionality on
the fly as the user folds unfolds or
refold z-- the display so it could
result in more flexibility pun intended
but it'll probably be a while before the
software fully realizes the potential of
foldable phones
and you also might be in for a wait if
you want a foldable gadget that you can
actually afford
although the plastics that allow them to
bend may ultimately prove cheaper for
phone companies than the glass that
they're using today manufacturing
challenges and the ever-present early
adopter tax mean that you will probably
have to fork over a lot of cash if you
really want one at the beginning if
you're short on money though don't worry
guys there's plenty of cheaper
conversation pieces that you can buy

I can't even remember I actually can't
remember I just hosted it oh right
bendable screen spendable screens who
thought of that
so leave a comment and then subscribe so
