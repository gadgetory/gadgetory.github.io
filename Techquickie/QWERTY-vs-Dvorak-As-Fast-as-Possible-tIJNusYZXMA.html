the 1960s its keys were arranged like
piano keys and they were in alphabetical
order as technology advanced typewriters
improved and it was soon faster to use a
typewriter than it was to write things
out by hand typewriters are
sophisticated mechanical devices but
because each type bar hits the same
place on the device typing too quickly
causes the typebars to get stuck or jams
together which would require the typist
to have to go unjam the machine which is
annoying in response to this a fellow
named Christopher Latham Sholes invented
the QWERTY keyboard layout to slow
typists down actually that's a common
misconception the QWERTY layout was not
designed to slow typists down rather it
was primarily designed to minimize
typewriter jamming by placing the most
commonly used characters farther away
from one another this led to fewer jams
and therefore faster typing the QWERTY
layout named of course for the first six
letters that appear on the keyboard
quickly gained popularity along with the
introduction of the Remington number-2
typewriter which was also the first
typewriter to include a shift key for
easily shifting all the letters between
upper and lower case after that other
typewriter manufacturers began to use
the QWERTY layout in their products and
eventually the layout became so
widespread that it's still the most
common standard today but we don't use
typewriters anymore with the
introduction of personal computers and
Printers typewriters have become almost
entirely obsolete but the QWERTY layout
which was designed for typewriters is
not obsolete and maybe it should be
there are a number of alternative
keyboard layouts that have emerged over
the years but most notable is the Dvorak
keyboard layout which was invented in
1936 by Auguste Dvorak who named it
after himself the Dvorak layout was
carefully designed to increase typing
speed while minimizing errors and
unnecessary finger movement which can
lead to repetitive strain injuries on
Dvorak all the most commonly used
letters are on the home row with
consonants on the right and vowels on
the left and 70% of all typing is done
on the home row compare that to 32% on
the QWERTY layout Dvorak certainly looks
very logic
but it's still controversial as to
whether Dvorak is actually faster and
better than QWERTY it seems like there
hasn't really been an acceptable
rigorously scientific study on Dvorak
versus QWERTY with many of the pro
Dvorak studies coming straight from mr.
Dvorak himself but I'm just going to go
out on a limb here and say yeah I think
it is a superior keyboard layout I mean
it was carefully designed to be that way
even if Dvorak is faster and more
efficient switching to it from QWERTY is
not easy it's simple enough to rearrange
the keys on most keyboards to a Dvorak
layout and most operating systems except
iOS have built-in support for Dvorak
keyboards but there's still a lot of
hurdles to overcome it takes months
before a typist can get back to the
speed they were at on QWERTY and even
once you've learned Dvorak completely
you still have problems a lot of
software and games are designed for a
QWERTY layout with little or no thought
given to alternatives even the common
shortcuts for undo cut copy and paste
are now scattered all across the
keyboard and good luck using WASD as
directional keys in games also heaven
forbid you should ever have to share
your computer with anyone else people
get really bewildered when they see this
once you've learned Dvorak the best
solution seems to be using a QWERTY
keyboard but set-to Dvorak in software
that way you can switch back to QWERTY
whenever necessary
you see QWERTY is already so ubiquitous
by now that it's probably here to stay
forever even though I believe that
Dvorak is superior
I still haven't switched to it I tried
once and it was just too difficult for
me so I gave up and that's why QWERTY is
still king it's not optimal but it's
good enough and it's what everybody's
already used to a lot of things are that
way like our entire base 10 numerical
system which I talked about in this
video even our own alphabet is
suboptimal I mean do we really need X or
Q on that note today's episode is
brought to you by the letter L which of
course stands for lynda.com lynda.com is
