the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos remember
what a big deal cordless phones were in
the 80s and 90s well it wasn't too long
before engineers expanded this
untethering idea to other gadgets so
nowadays we've got 2.4 gigahertz gaming
headsets Bluetooth Christmas lights and
enough LTE signals flying through the
air to make any passing
extraterrestrials think that we
communicate solely through some kind of
primitive form of hieroglyphics but one
modern device has lagged behind the
others in this era of wireless keyboards
wireless mice and wireless networking
our monitors seem to be the one thing
that still needs a long clunky cable
running across the desk so what gives
well for starters this observation isn't
completely true
there are wireless display standards
that have been around for quite some
time and I'm not talking about features
like casting where your phone or your
device just sends an instruction over
Wi-Fi for your TV to access a YouTube
video or whatever I'm talking about real
ways to connect a display and have it
show anything you'd like just as you
would with the wired monitor that might
be sitting on your desk right now one
currently popular option is miracast
this is essentially an HDMI connection
over Wi-Fi that works if you're using a
computer or other device that has Wi-Fi
built in the nice thing about miracast
is that it doesn't need to go through a
router rather it forms a direct
connection from your computer to your
display so you can use it even if your
wireless network is slow or if there
isn't one available at all in Windows 10
simply click connect in the Action
Center and that will cause your system
to scan for available miracast displays
click the one you'd like to connect to
and you are all set in theory although
there are displays with miracast baked
in as well as HDMI adapters that enable
it miracast
isn't compatible with everything Android
devices dropped support for it some time
ago Mac and iOS users in
I'd have to use airplay which by the way
does require a proper Wi-Fi network and
for devices without Wi-Fi at all like a
desktop PC well no luck there either so
if you want some more flexibility you
might want to look in a standalone
wireless display kit that lets you plug
an HDMI connected transmitter into your
PC or your source device even a camera
for example and an HDMI receiver to your
display these devices often use
standards that transmit data quickly
enough to avoid the huge loss in video
quality through compression that can be
a big problem with Wi-Fi based solutions
so then with all those benefits and both
miracast and standalone kits even
supporting 5.1 surround audio just like
a physical HDMI cable why aren't we all
using them right now well it turns out
you're gonna run into issues no matter
which wireless display implementation
you choose even if you go for a low
compression non Wi-Fi solution because
wireless connections are nearly always
slower than their Wired counterparts and
wireless display techno exception it's
more difficult for these signals to
carry the higher amounts of data needed
for a high-res picture so want 4k well
get ready to spend a lot of money if you
can find something at all and of course
we haven't even gotten to the elephant
in the room the slow elephant in the
room lag because these compressed
wireless signals require extra
processing at both ends you'll probably
experience more latency with a wireless
display this means that you'll have
small delays when you do anything like
move your mouse or type a sentence which
might be fine for writing an email or
giving a PowerPoint presentation but it
can be so bad as to cause desync issues
with video playback and it's almost
guaranteed to be a killer for gaming
making matters worse many wireless hdmi
kits perform best over very short
distances and with a direct line of
sight between your source device and
your display making them once you factor
in that you have to run a power cord to
them
anyway so you're not going full wireless
actually a lot more work to setup than
you might have initially imagined
so then unless you really need a display
in a spot where you just can't run a
cord to it I wouldn't bother investing
money in extra equipment to make your
setup wireless for now besides this
gives you an opportunity to practice
good cable management which I know is
everyone's favorite part of setting up
their battle station do you find
yourself racing against the clock as a
freelancer it's challenging but thanks
to the Internet there's never been more
opportunities for the self-employed I
heard that there are even people out
there who make videos upload them online
and they get paid for it what is that
anyway fresh books is the online
accounting software that's designed for
the way you work it's the simplest and
easiest way to be more productive
