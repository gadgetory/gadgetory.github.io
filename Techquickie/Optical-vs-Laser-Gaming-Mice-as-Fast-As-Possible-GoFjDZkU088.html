mouse you make sure you pick the right
thing optical mice use one or more LEDs
to take what are essentially pictures of
the surface underneath to track the
mouse's movement across the surface this
is in stark contrast to the previous
generation ball mice which used an
actual physical ball that rolled around
under the mouse in order to detect
movement they have a much broader range
of surface compatibility compared to
older ball mice and are typically known
compared to lasers for having lower dpi
sensors usually around 200 to 800 dpi
but they can go as high as 4,000 dpi
with gaming grade optical mice which
some gamers find they prefer to laser my
laser is the newer technology and has a
few advantages compared to optical
number one is that depending on the type
of laser it can be used on a much wider
variety of surfaces optical mice can
only be used on opaque surfaces whereas
laser mice can even be used on specular
surfaces such as glass
in fact Logitech's anywhere Mouse it
uses an infrared laser in order to work
on pretty much anything they are also
more accurate they are able to achieve
DP is up to as of the time of filming
this 8200 which is significantly more
than the optical mouse on the market and
are generally regarded by gamers to be
more precise so the last thing to note
is that some people claim that depending
on the dpi sensitivity that you want to
use you may be better off buying a mouse
that is more optimized for the dpi so
for example if you want a game at 3000
dpi you may not want to buy an 8200 dpi
top-of-the-line laser mouse and turn it
down because it may skip frames or
whatever else we haven't been able to
verify this objectively so take it with
a grain of salt but that is why some
gamers do prefer optical even though
laser mice tend to as I said before be
more precise more accurate and of course
more expensive to go along with that
thanks for checking out this tech
quickie as fast as possible on laser
mice versus optical mice particularly
for gaming don't forget as always to
share subscribe like the video and I'll
see you guys again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
