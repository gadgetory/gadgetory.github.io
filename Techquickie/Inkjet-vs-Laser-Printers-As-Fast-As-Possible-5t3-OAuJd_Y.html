printer the first thing to decide is
whether you want an inkjet printer or a
laser printer and we're going to tell
you the key differences between these
two technologies as fast as possible if
you don't know what kind of printer you
have or it came with your computer or
something like that the odds are good
you have an inkjet printer one of the
advantages of them is they're extremely
inexpensive for the printer hardware up
front they have some other advantages as
well though they're very compact they
don't use much power compared to their
laser counterparts and they are
extremely versatile you can print to a
variety of media such as labels without
ruining the sticker backs because
there's no heat involved in the printing
process and because the vast majority of
inkjet printers out there do print in
color you can get reasonably good photos
out of pretty much any inkjet printer
these days laser printers are more
expensive in the short term you have to
pay more for the hardware particularly
if you want a color model but they do
tend to be more reliable so they'll last
longer and if you use them very
infrequently they don't have nozzles
that can clog unlike their inkjet
counterparts they also produce very
crisp text if you're printing out
resumes printed on laser even the
cheapest laser printer from ten years
ago will print crisper text than the
most high-end inkjet printer today last
but not least you'll save on toner in
the long run because toner with a couple
of very few exceptions is cheaper than
ink for refills so it boils down to this
if you're going to be printing a lot of
text get yourself a laser printer it'll
look much more crisp it's way more
professional and you'll actually save
money in the long run if you do enough
printing if you're going to be printing
photos and more often than just sort of
once a month or once every two months
because then you risk having your
nozzles clogged then an inexpensive
inkjet printer is not a bad idea
compared to entry-level color laser
printers an entry-level color inkjet
printer is much less expensive and will
produce much better results on a wider
variety of different types of paper
