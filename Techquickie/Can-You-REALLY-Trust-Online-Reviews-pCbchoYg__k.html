of knowing if a restaurant hotel or
decorative singing fish was any good I
don't know
other than word-of-mouth or some kind of
vague brand reputation but here in 2019
everyone is tripping over themselves to
plaster their opinions all over the
Internet
places like Amazon Google Maps and
TripAdvisor
have literally millions of reviews for
just about anything you can think of and
I mean anything however at the end of
the day you're still relying on complete
strangers while making potentially
expensive decisions like which resort to
stay at which car to buy or even which
school to attend so exactly how much
trust can you put in these reviews now a
good jumping-off point is probably the
overall rating of a product or service
so how many stars dots or eggs it has
out of five but it's going to be worth
your while to read through some of these
reviews and figure out if they're likely
to be faked you see the thing is it's
pretty simple for sites to automatically
delete reviews that are posted by BOTS
as good as artificial intelligence has
gotten these days it's still not easy
for BOTS to write convincing reviews the
problem is that doesn't stop shady
businesses from hiring small armies of
paid reviewers from places like
freelance writing sites and giving them
a small amount of money to write short
reviews for gadgets they've never used
or places they've never been in fact
it's estimated that up to 30% of online
reviews might be fabricated so then here
are some tips to help make fake reviews
easier to spot from my experience
they're typically written in either
overly formal language or at the other
end of the spectrum with atrocious
spelling and grammar not much lies in
between and for positive reviews while
they tend to either lack specific
details about what they did or didn't
like or go into far too much do
tale about features that probably
wouldn't matter much to anyone but the
person who designed the product
conversely a fake negative review these
are actually more common than you'd
think
they're often paid for by competitors
might read like straight-up bashing of a
product or they might even ignore the
product altogether and just hate on the
brand in order to try to damage it again
usually without getting into any
specifics now we're not saying that
someone with bad grammar or who had a
really bad experience and hates a brand
doesn't have a valid opinion we're just
saying that in any case you want to keep
an eagle eye out for anything that
smells fishy and then compare it against
the general consensus so once you've
made sure that the overall rating hasn't
been artificially inflated or depressed
by fake reviews what's your next step
well now we need to dig into the reviews
themselves and understand what is
driving people's rating decisions you
see many reviews tend to be either very
positive or very negative as people who
had either a really good or really bad
time are the ones who are going to be
more motivated to put the effort into
actually telling other people about it
compared to others who are like yeah
mangos alright I guess but the things
that cause people to give either a
glowing or a scathing review might be
quite different from the things that you
care about for example a hotel might
have a bunch of low ratings giving it
you know three stars out of five overall
because lots of people didn't like how
noisy it was but maybe you're just
looking for a spot to host a bachelor
party and then to your pleasant surprise
most of the five-star reviews have
nothing but good things to say about the
nightclub on the first floor so by
applying a little bit of common sense
and knowing exactly what you're looking
for in whatever you purchase it's often
not too hard to weed out the fake
reviews and to look beyond the bear star
rating except when it is you see not
only have there been controversies over
review sites promoting certain styles of
reviews selling
reviews or even extorting businesses but
some operations that pump out fake
reviews have become more sophisticated
even going as far as to try to influence
conversations on huge sites like Reddit
by taking care to maintain the
appearance of a legitimate user while
steering the conversation around a
product or a service in a certain
direction they can even manipulate the
voting system in a way that makes
detection less likely sometimes it's
also even more complicated than that and
review integrity can be damaged by
legitimate users on Steam for example
groups of gamers have been known to
review bomb titles by game developers
who have made unpopular decisions that
are completely independent of the
quality of the actual game now some of
the more reputable review sites have
tried to combat such behavior with
actual human employees that can look for
this type of subterfuge and stop it but
even if you're looking at reviews that
are entirely honest remember that less
than 2% of consumers actually take the
time to write reviews and much like the
people who show up at a city council
meeting they're not necessarily
representative of the opinions of the
general population so with that in mind
are we saying that online reviews are
worthless well of course not just
remember to keep your wits about you
when you're reading them if you wouldn't
take investment advice from you know
your bankrupt cousin over Thanksgiving
dinner then you probably shouldn't take
their advice on amazon.com either
speaking of advice here's some advice
private Internet access supports a
variety of VPN protocols and types of
encryption and authentication this
allows you to dial in the exact level of
privacy protection that you need from
your VPN they've got apps for Windows
Mac OS Android iOS Linux and Google
Chrome and they've got over 3000 bare
metal servers in 44 locations across 28
countries with p ia you can connect up
to five devices at the same time with a
single account and their apps include
DNS leak protection and IP
six league protection their IP cloaking
allows you to hide your true IP address
and geographic location to get around
pesky censorship and you can check it
