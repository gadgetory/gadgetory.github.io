computer go faster also I can download
it at www.helpndoc.com and - 90 % ram
utilization but some people are more or
less sensitive to this in this second
example there is no benefit whatsoever
to adding more memory because there's
plenty available to the system the
slowdowns that you experience when you
run out of RAM are because your PC is
swapping data out of RAM to your hard
drive which is much much slower this
other system is likely slow for some
other reasons such as a virus or other
malware or another outdated slow
component if your software is fine and
you have enough RAM try adding an SSD to
your system moving from a hard drive to
an SSD can make your PC much more
responsive even if it's several years
old if none of that works you might just
be too much of a power user for your
current PC so it might be time for a
system upgrade so guys don't forget to
