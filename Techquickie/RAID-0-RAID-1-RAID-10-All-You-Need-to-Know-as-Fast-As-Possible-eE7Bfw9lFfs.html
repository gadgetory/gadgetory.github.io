going to tell you all you need to know
about raid 0 raid 1 and raid 10 as fast
as possible you've probably seen
reference to raid somewhere but what
does it mean it stands for redundant
array of inexpensive disks and it
basically means using multiple drives or
disks to achieve better performance
and/or better reliability raid 0 is all
about speed it contributes nothing to
reliability except to actually make it
worse so it involves taking two drives
or more and actually striping the data
across all of the drives this means you
get to keep all of your capacity and you
get to have in theory with two drives
double the read and write performance
but in the event that one of the drives
undergoes a hardware failure you will
lose all of the data that was stored on
both of the drives this configuration is
only ideal if you're going to be doing
very frequent backups or if you are
going for the most extreme performance
possible such as running multiple SSDs
RAID one is all about reliability you
get the capacity of one of your drives
you get the performance of one of your
drives but you get the redundancy of two
drives that means if one of these two
drives I have here fails outright all of
the data will still be there there's no
performance overhead for running raid 1
so you're still going to get the full
performance of the drives but the more
drives you add to a raid 1 you're always
only going to get half the capacity that
you would otherwise have the advantage
of raid 1 is it's extremely safe so I
would trust most important documents to
a raid 1 array raid 10 combines what's
good about raid 0 and what's good about
raid 1 into the same thing so you're
taking 4 drives you're striping these
two and striping these 2 then you're
mirroring these 2 against these 2 so
what that means is you get about double
the performance of an individual drive
you get double the capacity of an
individual drive but you could lose up
to 2 drives in a raid 10 array without
losing any data this is great where
performance is needed space is needed
but you don't necessarily want to invest
in an expensive raid card solution like
this one there are types of raid that we
haven't covered in this episode but we
will make another one so there will be
an annotation once that's done
can go ahead and click on that to learn
about them but those are generally
reserved for more professional
applications if you are deploying some
kind of a raid configuration I would
definitely recommend posting in the
Linus tech tips comm forum and asking
for some help because raid can be a
little bit tricky to set up last but not
least rate is not a substitution for
backing up redundancy is not the same
thing as a backup even if you're running
a raid you are still susceptible to
things like viruses or accidental
deletion or other human error so make
sure that you're doing regular backups
thanks for checking out this episode of
fast as possible make sure you subscribe
to tech quickie and also like the video
it helps us out a lot share this video
with anyone who you think would benefit
from it including embedding it on your
website
consider this my go ahead - well go
ahead also if you can think of any other
fast as possible episodes that you'd
like to see click the link in the
description to post in the forum thread
we will monitor that and we will make
sure that we check it out again thanks
for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
