business security there are lots of
reasons why you would want the data on a
drive to be secure we're going to tell
you everything you need to know about
self encrypting AES 256-bit drives as
fast as possible so first of all how
secure is aes-256 encryption well it
takes your plaintext password and re
scrambles it 14 times to create an
encrypted password that would take the
equivalent of millions of years to break
through using a top 500 supercomputers
with no pre-existing knowledge of any
part of your password one of the tricky
things can be making sure that your
platform supports self encrypting drives
so many business notebooks for example
do but the only way to know for sure is
check with your hardware manufacturer
and make sure that it's supported won t
know is supported all you have to do is
take a self encrypting drive plug it
into your system set up the disk
password or hard drive password and now
all that information is stored on the
drive itself so even if someone takes
the drive out of your computer puts it
into a separate computer and tries to
read any data off of it they must enter
the password in order to get access to
your files as with any password creation
process make sure you're using a mixture
of Alpha characters numeric characters
and special characters and don't use
anything obvious like a birthday or a
spouse's name or anything that someone
with pre-existing knowledge of you would
be likely to guess so the advantage of a
self encrypting drive is it's at the
BIOS level you can't get into the disk
at all without the encryption password
however there are software based options
if you don't have a platform that
supports the unencrypted drive or you
don't have an encrypted drive using
programs such as TrueCrypt as always
