because you found this amazing free
software that will record your frame
rates anonymize your with activity and
control your smart fridge all at the
same time but then you install it and
all of a sudden your computer is
throwing more pop-ups at you than a
whack-a-mole game and try as you might
you just can't get rid of the bloody
thing you're just about to sledgehammer
your entire PC and start over fresh but
then you pause but what about safe mode
yeah what about safe mode it's your
secret weapon safe mode can be
conveniently accessed if Windows 10
keeps failing to boot or by mashing f8 a
bunch of times on older systems at
startup and selecting it from the menu
that appears but what exactly does safe
mode do well surprisingly safe mode
isn't actually safe in that it enhances
your computer's security or anything
like that rather safe mode starts your
computer with the bare minimum of
drivers services and background
processes that it needs to function it
would be a little bit like firing up
your car but the only things that work
are your engine brakes gas and steering
wheel so no a/c no satellite radio and
no romance mode the idea here is that by
only loading the essentials windows
won't load anything problematic nasty
malicious programs are often designed to
start as soon as you fire up windows so
that they can immediately begin serving
you ads or stealing your data or what
have you so preventing them from being
loaded into memory makes them much
easier to remove safe mode can also be
used to fix or delete registry entries
that are causing issues troubleshoot an
accidental settings change that's
causing you headaches or change out your
drivers if your currently installed
version is causing your graphics card or
some other piece of hardware to ditch
out safe mode is also a useful tool if
you'd like to run System Restore giving
windows a shot at getting rid of the
offending software or glitch by itself
by rolling your PCs configuration back
to be full
or the problem cropped up in the first
place in some cases the features that
you'd want to access in safe mode like
the system configuration tool are also
available while booted normally but the
difference is that in cases of a very
severe infection for example safe mode
might help to ensure that your system
will function for long enough to go in
and actually make the necessary changes
keep in mind however that safe mode does
have its limitations and you can't
really use it for regular computing if
you fail to solve whatever the
underlying problem is because it only
loads basic drivers and services you'll
notice all kinds of weird things like
the fact that your monitor won't run in
its native resolution
and that many of your peripherals might
not function properly
also you can forget about doing any
gaming aside from solitaire or
minesweeper because safe mode only loads
the default Microsoft display drivers
not whatever your GPU manufacturer
provides you actually don't even get
support for connecting to the internet
by default though you can select safe
mode with networking if you need to get
online while you're troubleshooting
furthermore unfortunately safe mode
isn't a panacea some system problems
simply cannot be solved by attempting to
fix them in safe mode such as a
hopelessly corrupted registry or a
particularly nefarious rootkit that's
embedded itself deeply into the Windows
kernel and by the way you can learn more
about those little bastards up here in
those cases your best bet may be to just
backup whatever data you can format your
drive and reinstall windows nonetheless
safe mode is a very useful escape hatch
if your PC has more bugs than the local
hourly rate hotel so keep it in mind
next time it refuses to boot and as
always practice safe PC tinkering
speaking of tinkering freshbooks is for
entrepreneurs and the self-employed who
don't want to tinker around with
complicated accounting software it's a
super simple to use invoicing tool that
does way more than just help you create
and send slick-looking invoices it
allows you to track your time with their
timesheet function manage your expenses
and keep track of who owes you what it
also has a feature that tells you when
your clients look at your invoice for
the first time and this is cool the
mobile app has all the functionality of
the desktop version so you can take
fresh ebooks with you wherever you go if
you have any questions about fresh books
