all need batteries and while thankfully
we're not stuck with the old way of
buying them using them one time and then
going to the store to buy more the
rechargeable batteries that are tightly
integrated into many modern electronic
gizmos aren't perfect and they do have a
limited number of discharge cycles so
taking good care of them is a must now
most of your devices with integrated
batteries will use lithium ion batteries
so we'll focus on those first up the
conventional wisdom about the memory
effect a tendency of older batteries to
forget their total capacity if you
didn't completely discharge them from
time to time well forget about that that
shiz is so outdated it might as well be
a portable CD player deep discharge
cycles are actually terrible for your
lithium-ion batteries and can cause them
to stop working out right the good news
is that your devices have mechanisms to
prevent them from occurring during
normal use like you know how your phone
turns off while it still seems to have
some life in it that's it so as long as
you don't go out of your way to
circumvent these safeties you don't need
to worry but what about not normal use
like when a device won't be used for a
while
great question prior to storage your
lithium-ion batteries should be at about
half capacity and then they should be
kept in a cool place while you're not
using them the basement is a good bet if
you have one otherwise some folks
recommend the fridge but don't think
that colder is always better and please
don't store them in the freezer extreme
cold can affect your battery's health
just like extreme hot can higher
temperatures can cause faster discharges
so worse immediate performance and
reduce the overall lifespan of your
battery but since you can't spend your
life in a fridge a lot of the time
higher than optimal temperature simply
can't be avoided I mean even in the
design of a product it's not unusual to
see a battery stuck right next to other
components that kick off a ton of heat
like high performance CPUs but you can
still make the best of a bad situation
by ensuring all your ventilation holes
are unobstructed and avoiding direct
sunlight or other unnecessarily toasty
environments another related nono is
assuming that you're going to preserve
your precious discharge cycles by
meaning your device plugged in all the
time modern chargers and I guess another
pro tip here is to use a compatible one
preferably the one that came with your
device may have safeties that prevent
explosive overcharging but having your
battery sit and trickle charge while
safe both increases temperature and
doesn't help the battery stay in shape a
bit of light exercise so shallow
discharges and then recharges is good
for both you and your battery okay then
so if I can't save up my cycles how do I
even keep track of how many I'm using am
i eating one up every time I plug into
the wall not at all a charge cycle is
counted each time you've used a total of
a hundred percent of the battery's
capacity even if you spread the use out
over several partial discharges this
diagram from Apple actually explains it
quite well
speaking of Apple some of their products
use lithium polymer batteries so let's
touch on those very briefly care wise
they're very similar to lithium-ion
batteries you're welcome so that's the
basics but with all that said I'm not
trying to stress you out about this
stuff and I want it to be clear that
these are just best practices to get the
most out of your battery and while they
will help bending the rules here and
there to make your life a bit easier
let's say by using a wireless charger
from time to time which causes the
battery to run hotter isn't likely to
make a difference that you'd notice
speaking of differences you're likely to
notice browsing the web with hotspot
Shield the sponsor for today's episode
of fast as possible their elite service
is easy to set up inexpensive and
especially with our 20% off coupon code
