this it's the morning after a night of
bar-hopping and you wake up alone
thankfully and reach for your phone but
not only is it not on your nightstand it
isn't anywhere in the entire house and
losing a smartphone isn't like losing a
credit card where you can just call in
and report a loss and typically they'll
send you a new one in the mail for free
like in a couple days no no no losing
your phone means suddenly being cut off
from nearly all of your communication
and in some cases even your credentials
and that assumes that your phone wasn't
stolen which could also mean a stranger
with perhaps bad intentions now has
access to everything from your super
private photos to your bank account so
if you do misplace your smartphone what
precautions can you take other than you
know going back in time and not losing
it well your first line of defense is
your phone's baked-in auto location
feature yes enabling this does mean that
Google or Apple will be able to keep
tabs on where you are and where you've
been but it's also the easiest and most
effective way to locate a lost phone so
here's how you do it we're gonna do
Android first and then iOS users can
skip to the timestamp below on Android
open up your settings tap security and
location and make sure find my device is
turned on you'll also want to setup your
location to high accuracy and enable
Google location history to maximize your
chances and minimize your privacy if
you've misplaced your phone and it's
still powered on all you have to do is
log in to the same Google account as
your phone but from a web browser do a
Google search for Find My Phone and
Google will detect your phone's location
as best it can display it on a map and
will even show you what Wi-Fi networks
it's connected to if any you can also do
this using the find my device app if you
have access to another Android gadget
you can then choose from one of several
options if your phone is far away you
can start by hopping on the bus to go
and get it but once you get close you're
gonna need to pinpoint it which you can
do by making the phone ring loudly
before you do that though make sure that
you also lock your phone so that
strangers can't easily get into it
handily lock will also display a message
of your choosing so you can throw an
alternative contact info in case a Good
Samaritan found your phone as a last
resort if you think your phone was
stolen and you
get it back you can erase the phone
remotely you're gonna lose everything
that wasn't safe to the cloud but it
sure it be it's a pickpocket being able
to drain your savings account do keep in
mind though that to use the lock and
erase features you have to enable them
on that Find My Phone page I mentioned
earlier so do this before taking your
phone out on any perilous journeys but
if you're more of an Apple fan the
process for locating a loss iPhone is
frankly pretty similar go into your
iCloud settings and make sure Find My
Phone and send last location are both
enabled then if your phone does get lost
you can use either the built in Find My
iPhone app on an iOS device or log into
the iCloud website from a browser which
will map the phone's location and give
you options to make it ring lock it with
a message or erase it all together
similar to Android and you should also
note that even if you turned location
services off on your lost iPhone you can
still remotely lock or you race it to
keep your personal data secure so easy
peasy right thanks to technology no one
loses their phone anymore
well the issue with both Android and iOS
is that real-time location detection
only works if your phone's battery isn't
dead if your phone is lost and powered
down you can still get its last known
location or from these services but
there's always the possibility you left
it on a bus and it's now 500 miles away
so if you're looking for an alternative
physical GPS trackers like the one you
buy for a pet do exist but now that
hanging little gems and doodads off your
phone is no longer considered stylish it
was before they're generally considered
to be too bulky for a smartphone and
they have them in a battery life of
course you can buy Bluetooth enabled
trackers but they're only useful for
short ranges so they're mostly for the I
lose my phone in my couch cushions and
don't realize until it's dead kind of
crowd so be sure to act quickly if you
lost your phone outside of your home and
if you do think it was stolen please
resist the temptation to go after them
vigilante style if you do track down the
phone's location give that information
to the police
instead it's what they're there for and
it'll keep you from getting hurt in the
case that your phone was swiped by some
absolute
jacked-up psychopath ting is the mobile

service and customer satisfaction first

robot you get put through directly to a

what you use the average team bill is

switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your
