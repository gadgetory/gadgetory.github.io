notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so those
agreements allowing software companies
to collect anonymous usage data they
don't exactly give a ton of detail on
what exactly is in this data in some
cases is it truly anonymous and benign
or is Tim Cook sitting somewhere in the
Cupertino doughnut keeping track of the
not-so-nice things you've been saying
about their air pods
well it actually varies from agreement
to agreement and despite the lead-off
apple joke today's focus is on one of
the most common pieces of software that
phones home Microsoft Windows 10 which
caught criticism shortly after it was
released due to the fact that it was
nearly impossible for users to fully
turn off its data collection features
even if they opted out of Cortana and
location tracking and didn't create a
cloud-based Microsoft account so we're a
couple of years down the line and I'm
pleased to inform you that everything is
hunky-dory not homme no I'm just kidding
there is still no option to prevent
Microsoft from collecting telemetry data
so what is your PC definitely sending to
Microsoft as long as it has an internet
connection then well the lowest setting
you can choose when adjusting your
telemetry preferences is basic which
will give Microsoft information about
your hardware configuration so if you've
built yourself a custom rig Microsoft
likely knows what components you have
inside on the software side the basic
option allows the OS to send information
about Windows Store activity program
crashes and even usage time presumably
so they can identify issues that cause
instability but this also means that
they might know what specific programs
your machine is running though not you
personally
since Microsoft's privacy policy
promises users that they don't tie any
of that data to an actual person but if
you want to turn the proverbial
amplifier up to 11 or leave it there as
Microsoft actually has it set
this way by default I know shocking
Windows 10 will actually send Redmond
quite a bit more information selecting
the full telemetry option will provide
Microsoft with data as specific as songs
you're listening to video URLs if you're
watching a movie and it glitches out
local searches that you run when you're
trying to find specific files content
licenses disk space things you type into
the search box in your browser or in
Cortana browsing history and even ink
strokes if you're using a smart pen in
other words that is a lot of stuff that
Microsoft will have their paws on
there's also a chance that because the
full level sends memory dumps to
Microsoft they could see at least
fragments of whatever you were working
on at that time maybe even that OkCupid
message that you regretted as soon as
you hit Send and Microsoft even says
that typing input could be used to
reconstruct the original content or
associate the input to the user meaning
they are straight up saying that they
could tie your activity to your real
name or not now of course maybe you're
already consenting to this kind of data
collection and you don't really care if
Microsoft servers see your browsing
history because you're a big fan of
Cortana's custom features but what if
you're not that kind of person you don't
want to be spied on well the obvious
thing to do is make sure that you have
your telemetry settings switched to
basic but unfortunately there's no way
to turn it off completely if you aren't
running an enterprise version of Windows
a bit of comforting news is that there
have been documented specific cases
where Microsoft was honestly using this
collected data to fix legitimate
problems such as a widespread issue with
how a graphics driver was crashing
Windows 10 back in 2015 so there
probably isn't some snoop with a Costco
sized jar of lube peering at your data
but there have also been cases where
huge tech firms have been caught
collecting data on customers even if
they specifically opted out and
Microsoft also recently announced a tool
called the diagnostic data viewer which
will allow you to
you exactly what's being sent and while
the tool does seem to be pretty thorough
the data also appears as these
complicated looking raw data logs that
might be difficult for the mainstream
user to understand so perhaps one day
we'll get more transparency and user
choice as to how and whether we share
data with big companies but until then
maybe the Linux crowd really is on to
something speaking of not being spied on
this episode has been brought to you by
tunnel bear the easy-to-use VPN app when
people are shopping for a VPN to keep
their online activity private one
feature to look for is a kill switch
before you connect to a network your
device actually starts to send
information about itself and what it
wants to do so it'll try to establish
connections with all kinds of things and
there are other devices trying to
connect to it kill switches stop this
from happening so in that short period
of time before you connect to your VPN
but while you have an internet
connection all your traffic is
unencrypted and a kill switch called
vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops all
this from happening by automatically
blocking all outbound and inbound
traffic when it's not connected keeping
anything from leaking out that way your
private throughout your entire
connection time and this is cool if your
connection drops out for some reason
vigilant bear will kick back in and stop
the traffic till the connection comes
back so for a free trial of tunnel bear
go to Tunnel bear comm slash Linus we've
got that linked below give it a try so
thanks for watching guys like dislike
but whatever check out our other
channels leave a comment with video
suggestions for the future and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
