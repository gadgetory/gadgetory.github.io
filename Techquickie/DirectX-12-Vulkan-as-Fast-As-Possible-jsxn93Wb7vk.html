heard the rumors about directx12 and
vulcan and how great they're going to be
I mean we're talking stuff like massive
frame rate increases the ability to
combine performance between GPUs even
those from different manufacturers and a
drastic reduction in CPU bottlenecks so
we thought this topic deserved a little
bit of love let's start with what's an
API an API or an application programming
interface is defined very roughly as in
operating systems available resources
and tools that developers can use to
create software with or in other words
they're like the the Lego bricks that a
programmers inner child can use his or
her imagination to build with there are
some problems that can arise from this
approach however and whether through the
desire to keep the blocks simpler to use
at the expense of their effectiveness or
the bloat of supporting legacy features
and underperforming API can have a
dreadful impact on the performance of
the finished program a big problem for
gamers who want more realistic water
effects and facial animations but don't
want to spend a thousand bucks on a
shiny new graphics card that's where the
mantle API came in and be sought to give
programmers more direct access to how
their software interacted with the
graphical processor allowing them to
better optimize their software and
improve performance and while they were
generally successful in achieving this
the game support list is still pretty
small and without other graphics chip
makers on board that train was unlikely
to ever leave the station that is where
the more established graphics API
players you may have heard of Microsoft
and Chronos that's where they come in
they're poised to deliver their DirectX
12 &amp;amp; Vulkan API s respectively and while
these are technically two different
approaches they seem to be headed
towards similar goals both work to
minimize graphical driver overhead by
simplifying protocol routes and reducing
operation redundancies and both aside
from adding features for more simplicity
and realism etc focus heavily on
preventing draw calls the commands given
by the CPU to the GPU to render
something from being a bottleneck has
more and more objects appear on-screen
in a given scene oh and also to assist
multi-threaded CPUs we have more evenly
spreading out their workload to
theoretically improve performance by
leaps and bounds but as amazing as some
of the demos we've seen have been I mean
Microsoft showed off more than double
performance and the asteroids demo at
GDC 2015 the rainbow probably won't
stretch as far as some may hope
especially with existing games where the
bottlenecks being alleviated we're
already minimized during the development
process but that's not to say that the
future with unbelievable numbers of
objects and effects isn't something to
get excited about for everyone from the
guys who do want to buy $1,000 graphics
cards to the guys running several year
old hardware since both Vulcan and
DirectX 12 will work on existing
graphics cards as long as you have a
compatible operating system and driver
and while the chances are the rainbow
won't stretch as far as some hope with
first reports of real game FPS increases
being pretty small the longer term
effects of newer better tools are hard
to measure with old structures and to
think that this extra Headroom is going
to go unused for long scenes fairly
naive no matter how many blocks they put
in the bucket there's always like that
one kid who isn't happy until they've
used every last one for their castle and
likely that kid has already started
building speaking of building blocks
Squarespace simple power beautiful
websites with 24/7 tech support via live
chat and email it starts at only 8 bucks
a month and their sites look great and
work on any device whether it's a
desktop a laptop or even a phone with
something called responsive design it
just means that your website will kind
of go holy crap they're looking at it on
their phone I better make sure they can
actually see all the stuff and all the
sliders and elements work correctly
they've got all kinds of different
templates that you can use whether it's
you want to make an e-commerce site a
blog a portfolio or whatever else and
every website comes with a free online
store so you can even sell stuff through
it you can start a trial with no credit
card required so it's a two-week trial
to try it out and find out a Squarespace
is right for you and when you decide to
sign up make sure you use offer code
Lynas to get 10% off your first purchase
so I think that's pretty much it guys
thanks for watching this video like it
if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment if you
have suggestions for future fast as
possible episodes just like this one and
don't forget to subscribe and follow and
all that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
