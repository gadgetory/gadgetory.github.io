the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos it's been a
while but tech quickie is striking back
with episode 5 of avoiding common PC
building traps which will hopefully save
you from disaster even more effectively
than a dead tauntaun or that
now-infamous video with the lid strong
anti-static wrist strap speaking of
which let's tackle one thing those folks
were roundly criticized for using too
much thermal paste now although there's
a fairly widespread belief that using
too much thermal goop will have a
catastrophic effect on cooling
performance the truth is that unless you
go really overboard it actually won't be
too different from what you'd see with a
proper amount of thermal paste that is
as long as you install the cooler on top
correctly with suitable mounting
pressure your heatsink should simply
force any excess goo to flow out the
sides but we're not saying that's not a
problem any extra thermal paste that
gets on to the motherboard or stuck in
the CPU socket can wind up shorting it
out some thermal compounds are both non
conductive and non capacitive so they
shouldn't damage anything but many
others contain metal to assist in heat
transfer and are electrically conductive
or capacitive and besides even if you
use a non conductive thermal paste let's
say containing a material such as
ceramic
leaving your build looking like you
burst a tube of toothpaste on it it's
just really bad form and thermal paste
tends to be quite difficult to clean up
so remember in most situations a grain
of rice two pea-sized amount is all you
need and if you're ever unsure many
manufacturers actually provide guidance
for this as well speaking of avoiding
electrical shorts it's a good practice
to build upgrade or repair your PC on an
anti-static surface especially if you're
doing your building in a dry environment
this doesn't have to be anything fancy
though and a wooden tabletop or even a
cardboard box like the one that your
motherboard came in should do you fine
if you're still concerned though you can
improve your static management in a
number of ways for your tabletop you can
get anti-static mats that clip to a
metal ground such as the grill on your
plugged in but powered off power supply
and for your person you can get
anti-static wrist straps just slip it on
and clip the end of it to your plugged
in but powered off of course power
supply this along with common-sense
things like not working on a carpet and
touching metal now and then to discharge
any static build-up is enough for most
people if you're in a professional
environment though and you want to take
it to the next level you may also want
to consider anti-static flooring that is
grounded to a nearby electrical outlet
tip number three never actually used to
be a problem but these days it's not
uncommon to get a nasty shock after
spending a ton of money on a CPU and
motherboard only to find out your
brand-new system won't boot you see
sometimes a newer generation of
processor will actually use the same
motherboard socket as the previous
generation but may require a UEFI BIOS
or firmware update in order to
communicate properly so be sure to check
specifically what CPU generations any
motherboard you're interested in buying
supports and which firmware version is
required if you do end up needing to
flash the BIOS to get your new processor
working some boards may actually require
you to have the older gender on hand in
order to perform the update so if you
run into this make sure you ask a friend
or the techs at the store to get you
jump-started so to speak some
manufacturers have worked around this
however by including a feature on their
motherboards that allows you to update
the BIOS with a USB Drive and no CPU
installed pretty clutch while we're on
the subject of CPUs for the love of all
that is holy
don't push down on them when you're
installing them processors from both AMD
and Intel are designed to gently drop
into the socket with only gravity to aid
them there is no force necessary on the
user's part as the retention arm beside
the socket
will hold the CPU in for you on LGA
sockets where the pins are on the
motherboard pushing down on the CPU can
bend them and they are very difficult to
repair and as for more traditional PGA
sockets where the pins are on the CPU
well actually if it's aligned correctly
pushing down won't hurt it the issue is
that if it's not aligned correctly then
you can absolutely mangle your CPUs pins
rendering it inoperable
finally here's something important about
a different connector
yeah I'm not two slot although many
people associate MDOT too with superfast
nvme SSDs that use your computer's PCI
Express interface much faster than SATA
m dot 2 is really just a type of
physical connector and MDOT two drives
that use the SATA interface also exist
so if you really want that extra storage
speed you need to pay close attention to
both the compatibility of your system
and to the drive that you're shopping
for because you don't want to pull the
trigger on what you think is a super
good deal only to find out that it's not
any faster than your old SATA SSD from
five years ago so do you guys have any
tips that you haven't seen us mention
yet if you do share them with the
community down in the comment section
and stay tuned for episode 6 of avoiding
common PC building traps now with more
Ewoks or not we could just leave out the
Ewoks all the Ewoks are you worried
