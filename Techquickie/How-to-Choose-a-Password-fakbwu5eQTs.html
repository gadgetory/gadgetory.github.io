we live in a depressingly
insecure unsecure both of them probably
world
chances are the only thing standing
between your stuff and a bad guy are
some very shatter able windows you're
only a few feet from hitting another car
head-on when you drive down the street
and your private conversations and
finances are kept safe online by a short
string of characters I mean I'm not
trying to make you feel afraid or
paranoid or anything but what I am
trying to do is highlight the importance
of password security many people are
unaware that simply putting a password
on something does not make it all that
safe especially as lots of commonly used
passwords are about as secure as a
screen door in a hurricane I mean
obviously passwords like QWERTY
one-two-three-four and the name of your
favorite sports team are horrible
choices because they're incredibly easy
to guess but if you pick something
that's obscure and difficult for someone
who doesn't know you well too divine
does that necessarily even mean that
safe well that all depends on the way
passwords are stored secure websites
hash your password meaning that it is
passed through an algorithm that is
extremely difficult to reverse with the
output being what's stored on the server
the problem though is that because many
sites use the same algorithm such as the
one in the commonly used sha series an
attacker can run lots of common and or
short passwords through the hash quickly
and then compare that to hashed
passwords stored on a server to see if
any of them match and even though this
can be prevented using a technique
called salting which adds a random
numerical string to your password before
running it through a hash many secure
websites
don't bother salting meaning it can
actually be quite easy for an attacker
to guess your password with brute force
which means simply try
as many passwords as they can until one
works in fact most eight character
passwords can be cracked in only a
couple of days using this method with a
reasonably powerful modern PC
fortunately though the solution is
actually quite simple use longer
passwords having a pseudo-random
password with just twelve characters
instead of eight means it could take
thousands of years for someone to
brute-force your password instead of a
couple days and if they eventually do
succeed you'll probably be too dead to
care of course you also want to make
sure that your longer password doesn't
incorporate other common password
mistakes even a long password made up of
shorter dictionary words or containing
repeated strings of characters can be
vulnerable due to those individual
elements being easier to guess so while
length is probably the most important
variable the best thing to do is to use
long passwords made up of random
characters including symbols but Luke I
guess the script was written for him how
am I going to remember a huge password
with a bunch of pound signs and colons
in it well there are quite a few
password managers out there that not
only store and autofill your passwords
but also generate pseudo random
passwords quickly so you can use a
different one for every site just make
sure that whichever password manager
that you're using stores all your
passwords with heavy encryption
including salting and yes there is a
reason I keep saying pseudo-random by
the way instead of random software
random number generators that pump out
random passwords can never be truly
random as they work by performing
operations on a small initial number
called a seed which introduces slight
bias for certain characters of course
for the purposes of creating a secure
password this bias is negligible for
most users so don't worry about that too
much because after all in a universe
where every action has some kind of a
consequence can anything be truly random
whoa speaking of whoa audible.com is the
leading provider of audiobooks with more
