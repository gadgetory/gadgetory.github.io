loaded up a new game got into a match
and felt like your characters movement
had no real relation to how far you were
actually moving your mouse well then it
might be time to look for a new hobby as
I don't think that gaming is for you
just kidding guys it's possible that you
were experiencing something called mouse
acceleration mouse or cursor
acceleration to put it simply makes the
travel distance of your cursor on the
screen reliant on the velocity of your
physical mouse movement rather than just
the distance that you move your mouse so
making one movement of the same distance
at two different speeds will cause two
different relative cursor movements with
quick movements causing the cursor to
travel a greater distance Mouse
acceleration can be introduced by a
variety of sources including your
operating system mouse driver in game
setting or even an inherent property of
the sensor being used on your mouse
Hardware all right so I get to move my
cursor all the way to the top corner to
close the window using like a tiny quick
micro movement that sounds pretty sweet
and for some people it is if you have
very limited space to move your mouse
but don't want to constantly run a
ridiculously high sensitivity or if you
don't mind sacrificing some precision in
your mouse movements for a bit of
conveniently quick movement when you
really need it
then Mouse acceleration might not be a
bad thing but like anything that has a
potential advantage there are some
downsides that you have to take into
account first acceleration makes it more
challenging to replicate specific
movements it is more difficult to gauge
the speed of your movement than it is to
gauge the distance you move on a surface
so playing games with acceleration may
cause a much steeper learning curve if
you're trying to become great at a game
where Mouse accuracy is important like a
first-person shooter second - use mouse
acceleration properly you are going to
have to tweak and adjust your settings
endlessly until you find the exact
configuration that works for you it is
doable but it's not going to be easy and
third acceleration is something that is
in most cases caused by software and
software is not perfect
someone who may consider themselves an
expert at using a mouse with
acceleration will encounter some weird
interactions and mouse movements in the
long-term drivers another software has
improved and will continue to improve as
we move forward but for now keeping this
off is considered generally wise within
the gaming community now like most
things we discuss on this channel it
really does come down to personal
preference and in many cases it's
something that you can tune to meet your
needs like elderly people for example
might want accelerations so that when
they're trying to to reach you know that
button that's kind of hard to align with
they can move slower and the mouse
movements are much slower but if you are
not that person and your goal is to say
become very good at a game where Jean
Ray of games that requires very fine
mouse control and precision then
learning to play without acceleration
might reward you more for your troubles
in the long term just be prepared to do
a bit of learning in order to find the
right combination of hardware and
software settings to get there there's a
link in the description to a guide on
teamliquid if you want to really dig
into the technical aspects of mouse
acceleration and mouse technology just
prepare your brain for a little bit of
learning that's about to go on speaking
of learning that's about to go on
fractal design didn't tell us what we're
doing today so here we are with another
fractal design integration on this
channel why do these always end up being
punishment for me so instead of talking
about you know the minimalistic
Scandinavian design of fractal designs
cases power supplies coolers fans fans
are also coolers but I think you get my
point Josh over from fractal figured I
needed a little bit more Scandinavian
clean design myself and asked for me to
wax my mono brow that you guys are
actually pretty fond of complaining
about on this particular channel more
than the other one I guess because the
camera is usually a little closer he
also had a special request that Luke was
to be the one who stepped in here and
did the honors so fractal design
basically bad people okay
oh that's uh Wow so how do we do that
not much actually came off you still
definitely have all the hair there well
that is very unfortunate so it got to
hurt and we have to do it again
though thanks to you Josh for being a
swell guy and guys check out fractal
design they're linked in the video
description they sponsor the show
they're mostly good people except for
Josh and thanks for watching guys like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it and we will see you
again next time oh yeah and don't forget
to subscribe oh it's sticky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
