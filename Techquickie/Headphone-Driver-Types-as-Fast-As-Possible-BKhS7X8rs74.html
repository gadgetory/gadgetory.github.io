that we use to listen to music and other
audio mediums without disturbing others
headphones earphones ear speakers cans
and all those words mean pretty much the
same thing so that's not the focus of
today's video what is the focus of
today's video is the different types of
drivers that you might find inside them
drivers or transducers convert the
electrical signals sent through the
cable or the air if you're using
Wireless of Bluetooth or whatever to the
sound waves that your ears hear so first
up is the most common type of headphone
driver the moving coil driver also known
as a dynamic driver it consists of a
stationary magnet attached to the frame
of the headphone this creates a static
magnetic field a diaphragm and a coil
wire or voice coil the voice coil
actuates the diaphragm based on the
varying current that gets passed through
the coil and the moving diaphragm
combined with the air moving around it
creates the sound that you hear
practical dynamic driver sizes for
headphones are anywhere from tiny 10
millimeter or sometimes even smaller
drivers that fit inside a EMS to big 55
millimeter you know bounding bass
capable drivers that you'll find in over
ear headphones and the main benefits of
these are that they are inexpensive to
produce keeping manufacturing costs
relatively low for entry-level products
and if engineered correctly they can
deliver a wide enough frequency range
with enough accuracy that even high-end
audiophile grade products can be built
using this technology
electrostatic drivers they're a little
different they consist of a thin
diaphragm typically made of coated
polyethylene tetris phthalates film
which is electrically charged and
suspended between two perforated metal
plates or electrodes the electrical
sound signal is applied to the
electrodes which produces an electric
field between them and draws the
diaphragm towards one plate or the other
air is then forced through the
perforations or the curves on the
electrodes which when combined with the
moving diaphragm due to the constantly
changing electrical signals creates
sound waves which your ears hear
electrostatic drivers are generally
capable of producing a very wide range
of frequencies and their frequency
response often extends well above the
audible limit of approximately 20
kilohertz nowadays electrostatic drivers
are only really present in high-end
audiophile grade headphones since
they're quite expensive to produce
require stronger amplification and the
benefit for most people simply doesn't
justify the additional cost ortho
dynamic or planar magnetic drivers
operate on a similar principle but use
large permanent magnets and vary the
charge of the membrane to produce sound
the final type that we're highlighting
today is balanced armature or BA drivers
BA they're the smallest ones available
and they're incredibly power efficient
which makes them great for IEMs also
known as canal phones and for hearing
aids actually this driver type features
a coil wrapped armature that is pivoted
and then perfectly centered or balanced
between the poles of a permanent magnet
then when a current passes through the
coil it causes the armature to pin it
passing vibrations to the drive rod
which is attached to the center of a
diaphragm and the movements of the drive
rod cause vibrations in the diaphragm
creating the sound that you hear common
theme here right these drivers give a
clean accurate sound but typically have
a fairly narrow frequency response range
they also don't really deliver head
crushing bass and are very limited in
performance at the extremes of the human
hearing range but they are often joined
with much success with other ba or
dynamic drivers in a passive crossover
network to expand the overall frequency
range of the in ear monitor with each
driver focused on a certain Bend
do note though that when shopping for
headphones lor does not always mean
better so do your research on the
quality of the drivers inside a pair of
IMS before you pay some ridiculous
amount of money just because they have
16 ba drivers in each side or something
now as I mentioned before actually I
didn't mention it before because I
altered the script before I did this but
anyway this video is by no means
comprehensive but it should give you a
good idea of what the main differences
are between the most popular driver
types as well as a couple of
it's on you know the less popular
electrostatic planar magnetic ones if
you're interested in learning a lot more
about headphone drivers head over to
head fight or guess their forms have a
ton of information about all aspects of
headphones but it's a very passionate
community so bring your flood filter and
probably a dictionary you're very likely
to need both speaking of things that you
are likely to need if you have a
computer computer fans cases and power
supplies coolermaster is the sponsor of
today's episode of fast as possible and
they've got tons of awesome products in
those three categories and actually many
more including gaming peripherals like
headsets mice and keyboards under their
CM storm brand and even mobile
accessories they've been a longtime
supporter of our content here on tech
quickie and we could not be happier to
have them on the channel I think the
best testimonial that I can give you
guys about coolermaster is that we can
choose pretty much any hardware we want
and we use their v-series power supplies
in our editing workstations here at
linus media group so thanks to
Coolermaster for sponsoring this episode
guys be sure to check out Coolermaster
and CM storm at the link in the video
description if you're in the market for
a new pc or thinking about upgrading
some of your components thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
