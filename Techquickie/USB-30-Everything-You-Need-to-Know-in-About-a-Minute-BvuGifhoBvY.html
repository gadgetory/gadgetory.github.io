today's episode of one minute or less
we're going to tell you everything you
need to know about USB 3 the main
advantage of USB 3 is speed it is up to
10 times faster than the last generation
USB 2 and while it's only half as fast
as some other technologies such as
fundable
it is universally compatible it's right
in the name so it's backwards compatible
with USB 2 and you don't need a special
computer to take advantage of it if
you're not sure if your device supports
USB 3 you can check the manufacturer
specifications or another easy way to
tell is check the inside of the
connector the key that keeps you from
putting it in the wrong way is usually
blue on USB 3 devices now most USB 3
devices these days are storage devices
because that's where you can take
advantage of that extra performance
however there are other devices that are
available such as things like external
video capture devices that USB 2 is not
fast enough for but USB 3 is I often get
asked where to plug a USB device into
the simple answer is because of that
backwards compatibility it doesn't
matter all you do is plug the USB Drive
into the USB port which is usually easy
to recognize because it has a blue color
coded key on it or if that's not present
you can look inside the connector to see
if there's additional pins your computer
will also usually prompt you if you
install a USB 3 device into a USB 2 port
saying hey you've got USB 3 ports if you
want to take advantage of that extra
speed switch it over to that thanks for
