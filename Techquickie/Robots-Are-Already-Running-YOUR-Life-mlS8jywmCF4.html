intelligence one of two things come to
mind for many people an evil sentient
computer that is seeking to bring about
the end of humanity a la Skynet from the
Terminator or much less dramatically the
AI and video games that results in your
computer-controlled friends or as I call
them frenemies running out into the open
on an escort mission pushing you out a
cover or just running endlessly into a
solid wall but the reality of how true
artificial intelligence is used by
organizations is really quite different
you see although the way AI works is
only loosely modeled on the human brain
it's somewhat similar in that
computerized neural networks are general
purpose tools that can actually be
trained to perform a huge variety of
tasks you can learn more about exactly
how neural networks work up here but the
gist of it is that information is passed
through processing nodes according to
how each node waits that incoming
information once the information finally
gets to the end of the network the
output node that it hits reflects how
exactly the network recognized it so for
example if you're trying to train a
neural network to tell different animals
apart one output node might correspond
to a whale while another might
correspond to a dingo or something then
as training occurs programmers can
adjust the weights of the nodes often
automatically with algorithms so that
eventually the network will consistently
get the correct results making them very
customizable that is as long as there's
enough parallel processing power and
throughput available to handle tons of
inputs at once not only is AI based
image recognition useful for simple
tasks like finding cute animal photos on
Google Image Search or snapping a pic of
something and doing automatic comparison
shopping companies also use it for more
complicated applications in fact it's
already being used to check for defects
on assembly lines without needing
specific programming as well as to look
at things like x-rays and MRIs in the
medical
field to pick out injuries to help human
physicians double-check their opinions
then on the subject of injuries
how about preventing them in the first
place the built in AI and self-driving
cars is heavily trained to recognize
pedestrians by being shown thousands
upon thousands of images of people
crossing the street so the car will know
to stop instead of plowing through an
intersection like Lloyd Christmas you
can actually learn more about how
self-driving cars work right up here but
aside from image recognition large
financial firms are now using AI to
analyze the market and figure out how to
invest this can take on many forms but
some of these implementations will do
things like keep an eye on recent news
stories and what's being discussed on
social media to determine how world
events might impact the market and then
make recommendations accordingly
additionally AI has already been helping
these firms with high-frequency trading
where neural networks can quickly make
decisions and automatically trade
millions of times per day so that the
humans can I don't know focus on their
water-cooler chatter speaking of money
for better or for worse
AI has become a powerful tool for
marketers it's already being used to
keep tabs on foot traffic in
brick-and-mortar stores and determine
what drives the most consumer interest
as well as to gather data on consumers
to figure out how to retain them if
they're thinking about switching to a
competitor this is usually done by
offering strategic targeted discounts or
other offers also if you've done any job
hunting recently there might be more to
why you didn't get a callback than just
those embarrassing pictures on social
media some HR departments are now using
a eyes that can learn what things on a
resume will end up being the best match
for a certain position and then Auto
scanning them before they ever even wind
up on a recruiters desk on a more
positive note for poor Joshua who didn't
get that position he really wanted the
fact that a eyes don't have to be
specifically programmed and can instead
on the fly is a huge plus for your cyber
security personnel in charge of security
can now deploy a trained neural network
that can detect suspicious activity and
then shut it down without constantly
needing new definition updates and
patches so that's cool Josh for when
you're sitting at home on your computer
instead of at work and the ability of an
AI to learn has even led to AI produced
music some major artists have already
used AI to keep tabs on musical themes
being discussed on social media and then
come up with a song that fits those
trends but it even goes further than
that with entire albums having been
completely produced by an AI with no
human intervention though it might not
be surprising that one such classical
album was described as cold and chilly
now given enough time we do expect both
the programming and the power of these
neural networks to improve and unlock
even more exciting capabilities the
thing we don't know is quite when
they'll begin to understand love and
compose slightly warmer music today's
video is brought to you by private
Internet access
P ia supports a variety of VPN protocols
and types of encryption and
authentication which allows you to dial
in the exact level of privacy protection
that you need
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome and
you can connect up to five devices at
the same time with a single account
their apps include DNS leak protection
and ipv6 leak protection and they've got
an Internet kill switch that will block
all traffic if the VPN becomes
disconnected unexpectedly check it out
today at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
like dislike check out our other videos
leave a comment if you have a suggestion
for a future fast as possible and don't
forget to subscribe and ring the bell
and follow and all that good stuff it's
not really forgetting anymore at this
point I tell them all the time it's just
obstinance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
