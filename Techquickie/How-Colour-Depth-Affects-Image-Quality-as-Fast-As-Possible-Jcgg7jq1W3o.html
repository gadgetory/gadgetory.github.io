marketing terms that mean better image
quality but they're only about the
resolution or the fineness of the image
see that right there that mess you're
looking at is a high-resolution HD image
but with very low color depth color
depth is incredibly important if you
want to experience your content the way
the Creator intended color depth refers
to the amount of data that can be used
to indicate the color of each dot or
pixel on your display one bit would be
black and white tube it would be shades
of gray an 8-bit allows a 256 color
palette in short more bits of color
depth translates into more colors that
can be displayed so brain on the bits
well there are challenges processing
power on CPUs and graphics cards used to
be a bottleneck and
while today they're fine for a high
quality image every link of the chain
needs to be high quality challenge
number one is data storage and Internet
bandwidth digital files with high color
depth are really big to save space and
bandwidth they usually get compressed
websites like YouTube streaming services
like Netflix and even your cable TV
provider are all serving highly
compressed video which negatively
affects color fidelity you will often
easily detect where the approximations
are being made where the Creator
intended for the colors to blend
smoothly together but instead you see
blocks or bands of the same color
because to save on infrastructure costs
much of the data has been lost challenge
number two is displays let's say you
pony up for a blu-ray of your favorite
movie and then watch it on a cheap TV or
TN panel monitor in this case the data
is all there but your display is not
capable of reproducing all those colors
so you'll see the same blockiness and
color banding as before where the
display is just approximating the color
as best it can all right so let me get
this straight Linus you're telling me
that my viewing experience sucks when I
was perfectly happy with it before and
then you're following up by telling me
that there's basically nothing I can do
about it without spending a bunch of
money anyway are you just trying to make
me unhappy no I'm not I know all of this
and I'm still perfectly happy and
and you know Canada here with my
Canadian internet connection and you
know Canadian Netflix it especially
doesn't bother me on small screens like
on a phone or a tablet and in vibrant
scenes with many varied colors it only
really bugs me in dark scenes with many
similar colors I mean see that right
there
the blockiness and lack of detail on the
bunny when he's covered by the shadows
is a perfect example of what we're
talking about and just because we're
aware of this and understand it better
doesn't mean we have to change anything
I just wanted to cover this topic for a
while so that I can explain to folks why
they're HD image doesn't always look
that great that way if they do want to
do something about it they'll know what
to do look for content that uses
high-quality codecs and is encoded at
higher bit rates the higher the bit rate
or the amount of data per second in the
video stream the higher the color depth
is likely to be try higher quality
content first before upgrading your
display and use shadows as a quick and
easy benchmark to see if it's making a
noticeable difference and if it doesn't
make a difference to you then that's
great because there is a limit to what
your eyes can see anyway before more
color depth really doesn't make a
difference anyhow
speaking of shadows our featured
audiobook from audible.com today is into
the darkest corner by Elizabeth Haynes
you can get it or something else for
free by going to audible.com/veritasium
Sony at the newest thing out there but
it's not like I was going to go through
all 150,000 audiobooks they have to find
another one that had shadows or darkness
in the title for my segue now was I I
mean I guess I could have gone with like
heart of darkness or like book of
shadows actually I don't know if there's
a real book of shadows it's just
something that's in like every fantasy
novel ever there's always like black
shadows anyway I seem to have lost track
of what I was talking about make sure
when you sign up you go to audible.com
slash tech quickie so they don't cut me
off then the only content I'd be able to
afford to make for you guys would be
though color debt you gross anyway like
the video if you liked it share it if
you really liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment or post on
the Linus tech tips forum if you have
any suggestions for episodes that you
like to see on fast as possible and as
always guys don't forget to subscribe to
tech wiki for more videos just like this
