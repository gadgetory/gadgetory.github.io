the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so maybe
the teacher never called on you when you
were a kid or maybe you're that person
who's always dropping zesty jokes in a
group chat that no one seems to laugh at
hmm anyway whatever the reason you've
been searching for a platform where
people might finally listen to you so
you turn to game streaming and while you
might have watched our previous episode
on the kind of PC you need to stream one
detail we left out what's the importance
of having a proper audio setup starting
of course with a microphone now odds are
that if you're looking at the streaming
you probably have a webcam with a mic
built-in or a gaming headset lying
around now you can use these in the
pinch but I strongly recommend against
it as the quality difference between a
built-in solution and a proper
standalone mic will be as clear as night
and day to your viewers so one of the
primary decisions you'll have to make
when shopping for a microphone will be
whether you want an XLR or a USB
connection USB microphones have built-in
analog to digital converters that
obviate the need for any other hardware
to process whatever you're saying into
the mic this makes them simpler to set
up and more convenient but while there
are some great USB options out there
that are integrated acts and amps can
sometimes be lower quality or cause
undesirable electrical noise so in the
same way the people who are really
serious about music might use a separate
headphone app rather than relying on
their motherboards audio jack the audio
nerds of these streaming side of things
are all about that XLR XLR microphones
are usually preferred in professional
audio settings they require a separate
audio interface to plug it into one good
idea is a mixing board or mixer may
which can handle the conversion from
analog to digital for you but they also
allow finer control over your microphone
so if you want to adjust the
equalization settings monitor how loud
your voices without getting an echo
change the sensitivity or gain so that
your mic will pick up too much
background noise or hook up a second mic
if you're streaming with a friend a
mixer board provides a convenient
control center on your desk that's easy
to access during your stream without
having to tab out of the game
many mixers can connect your PC via USB
though you can also use an analog
connection in case you'd like to let
something like the sound card handle the
conversion but I wouldn't recommend it
do note though that you might not know
is a huge difference in sound quality
just because a microphone is XLR it's
just a different type of connection and
you might have to shell out some serious
coin if you want something that will
blow away a USB model however even a
lower end XLR mic can give you more
options down the road since we'll be
able to upgrade other parts of your
audio setup without having to buy
another microphone of course the actual
electronics themselves are only part of
the story to prevent unpleasant
scratching or bumping noises when you
mash or keyboard a little too hard
you'll want something to stabilize your
microphone such as a stand or a boom arm
with the latter being preferred by many
streamers because it can be mounted to
your desk to keep your mic super stable
above you to save space while also
allowing you to move it around freely
and you also won't want to forget a pop
filter which is an inexpensive disc that
goes in front of your microphone to
prevent plosives the unpleasant popping
sounds that can be caused by saying
words to start with B or P and finally
consider what's around you are you
streaming from a rather bare room with
hardwood floors or somewhere where an
era Commissioner is constantly hunting
these things might be easy to forget
about if you're wearing headphones so
try the stream from a quieter
environment with minimal echo and invest
in some rugs or squishy acoustic panels
if need be it'll be hard to attract
viewers if you sound like you're
streaming from the end of a sewer pipe
and speaking of streaming are you a
streamer that's looking for more control
over your broadcast at your fingertips
then check out the elgato stream deck
and easy to use accessory with 15
totally customizable LCD buttons that
allow you to access the streaming
commands you need with just one touch
it's compatible with twitch YouTube
xsplit and OBS map whatever you'd like
to the tactile buttons anything from
thanking a donor to switching a lower
third to displaying a gift the options
are only limited by your own creativity
and customization is incredibly easy
just drag-and-drop your actions onto the
buttons through all in whatever icon
you'd like and you're ready to go and
you could even turn buttons into folders
and create multiple profiles if 15
buttons just isn't enough
we use stream deck with the wine show
here at Linus Media Group we love it and
we think you will too so check it out
today at the link in the video
