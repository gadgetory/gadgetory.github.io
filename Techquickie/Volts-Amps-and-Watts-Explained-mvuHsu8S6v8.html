lists the usage in kilowatt hours but
when you go to the store you'll see
things like 12 watt light bulbs 9 volt
batteries and vacuum cleaners with 15
amps of sucking power but what do these
numbers even mean I mean why do we have
so many different units to measure
something that seems as straightforward
as electricity surprisingly the answer
isn't just so appliance companies and
physics professors can confuse you it's
because several important things have to
happen in an electrical circuit for
electricity to flow and for work to be
done you can think of a circuit kind of
like the faucet on your kitchen sink if
you want water to come out you need two
things
you need the water itself and some
pressure to force it through the pipes
out your faucet and into your neti pot
similarly an electrical circuit uses
electrons to carry the electricity kind
of like the water in our faucet analogy
but those electrons need something to
push them along a circuit this
electrical pressure is what we call the
voltage and is often provided by two
terminals one with a positive charge and
one with a negative charge so on a
battery electrons flow from the negative
end through whatever it is you're trying
to power and then into the positive end
where they'll stay unless your battery
is rechargeable if you're plugging
something into the wall this voltage is
instead provided by your power company
and although voltage just measures how
strongly electricity is being pushed
through a circuit it's important because
many circuits are designed only to
accept a certain number of volts which
is why the hairdryer you bought in
Monaco might release magic blue smoke if
you plug it in in New York so now that
you know what volts are what about amps
well in this context amp isn't short for
to fire but rather for ampere which is a
unit of how much electrical charge is
flowing past a given point in one second
so when you put volts and amps together
you can tell how much current is flowing
and how hard it's flowing multiply these
numbers and you get finally our third
unit the watt let's go back to our water
analogy for a second let's suppose you
wanted to spin a small water wheel
because you just like watching things
spin or I don't know maybe you have it
hooked up to a generator let's say you
have a really powerful water pistol that
forces water through a tiny nozzle even
though the small nozzle means the total
volume of water flowing per second isn't
all that much you wouldn't want to fill
your swimming pool with it
the high pressure creates a strong jet
that can spin the wheel easily but
suppose instead of a water gun you have
a much wider hose that doesn't push the
water out nearly as strongly but because
the hose is a lot wider more water flows
per second overall and the wheel ends up
spinning at the same speed it did with
your water gun if we think of the hose
and the water gun pushing out
electricity instead of water we could
say that they're delivering the same
number of watts for a more practical
example let's say you have an 1100 watt
power supply for your computer that's
drawing full load because you're rocking
four-way SLI or something so if you plug
that into a standard 110-volt North
American outlet some simple math tells
you that 10 amps of current is running
through your power supply but if you
take that same power supply and use it
with a 220 volt European outlet you're
only drawing 5 amps but since the amount
of power in watts is the same your
computer will work just fine in both
places even though you're using
different volts and amps well that makes
sense Linus but why the heck then is my
energy bill in
kilowatt-hours is that a unit of time
no actually scientists are just mean
it's a unit of energy watts and
kilowatts express how much energy is
consumed per chunk of time something
scientists call power which is not the
same as energy but if you multiply a
kilowatt by an hour the unit's cancel
and you're left with a number that shows
how much energy that you hogged by
running your air conditioner gaming rig
and novelty lava lamp all at once but
what if you're more concerned about
battery capacity instead of what's
coming out of your walls well if you're
buying a replacement battery or a
battery pack you might see their
capacity listed in milliamp hours again
not time doing the math shows that this
is a unit of charge not energy or power
so going back to our water example this
is like how much water you have in a
bucket not how much is flowing or how
fast is flowing so a bigger bucket means
you could charge your phone more times
and you can learn more about that and
battery banks in this video here so go
forth then with your newfound knowledge
and expertly buy the right voltage
adapter install the correct power supply
or just aced your electrical engineering
exam if you want to do more with your
life than work for some second-rate
YouTube channel but hey John second-rate
YouTube channel like is that supposed to
be a joke that's not funny
speaking of things that are no joke
tunnel bear VPN lets you tunnel through
up to 20 different countries well one at
a time but allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as
though you are in a different country
they have easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android yeah this fell apart PC and Mac
and they also have a Chrome extension
just choose the country in the app turn
tunnel bear on and watch as your bear
tunnels your internet connection to your
new locations actually faster than that
you don't even have to wait around for a
silly animation you just hit the switch
and boom you're pretty much ready to
rock and when you turn it on - things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
look as though you're in a different
country lets you bypass all those
annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal use
there's no DNS or router settings and
they have a top rated privacy policy and
do not log your data the best part of
tunnel bear is you don't have to take my
word for it try it for free they give
you 500 Meg's of data for nothing you
even get more if you tweet about them by
the way with no credit card required and
then if you decide to upgrade and you
want to save 10% then head over to
tunnel bear comm slash Linus and save
that money thanks for watching guys like
dislike check out our other channels
comment with video suggestions and don't
forget to subscribe I think that's the
fastest one I've done yet though I might
have negated all the time savings by
rambling about it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
