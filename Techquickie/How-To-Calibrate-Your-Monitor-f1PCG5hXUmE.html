overboard when you're buying a monitor
with 4k ultra wide and adaptive refresh
displays all jockeying for your
attention you might expect to be blown
away after plugging in your rigs
finishing touch but wait a minute
despite your monitors high price tag
something looks amiss
the colors are all wrong how could this
happen on such an expensive component
well we've covered the reasons that
monitors can look so different from each
other in these episodes here but today
we're going to talk about ways to
calibrate your monitor properly to get
accurate crisp colors whether you spent
a hundred bucks or thousands now there
are multiple ways to calibrate your
screen so let's start with the simplest
and cheapest and work our way upward but
whatever one you pick
make sure your monitors turned on for at
least 30 minutes before starting so it
can warm up and hit its usual level of
brightness method number one for some
quick and dirty display correction both
Windows and Mac OS provide built-in
tools to adjust gamma a setting that
affects brightness and color ratios as
well as contrast and color levels this
method is fast and free but since you're
expected to eyeball what the sample
image should look like without a
calibrated reference it's not much
better than checking your car speed by
sticking your hand out the window but if
you'd like to go a little bit deeper
with your monitor settings there's
method to check out one of the free
websites we've linked in the description
that have more test images and patterns
that you can use to get your display
looking nice on your own these sites
take longer and still rely on you
eyeballing things but they'll give you
more samples than what's built into your
OS for more granular fine-tuning and
better real-world results of course if
you're a little more serious about color
because you're a graphic designer
home theater enthusiast or you run a
tech channel on YouTube you might not
trust yourself to get these things right
just by fiddling with the monitor
yourself in this case you may want to
try method number three downloading a
color profile for your display color
profiles help map color information in
files and UI elements which are stored
as a series of numbers to actual colors
that your screen can display there are a
number of standardized profiles
such as srgb a common default profile
for computers and Adobe RGB which is
popular with photographers and designers
but there are custom profiles available
for specific display models to help them
reproduce colors more accurately if you
want to see if there's one for your
monitor there are websites staffed by
professionals that have created color
profiles for many different displays
which we've also linked in the video
description along with a page on how to
install a color profile on windows but
it should be noted that even that might
not be enough to get your monitor
looking its best slight manufacturing
differences in display panels can result
in even two units of the same model
right next to each other connected to
the same computer displaying colors
differently so if you want to be super
serial about your display calibration
you'll want to try method number for
buying a hardware calibrator that you
place on your screen then run
accompanying software the calibrator
will then be able to tell you exactly
how much your color balance luminance
and other factors need to be adjusted to
get your display as accurate as possible
not only that but most calibrators will
save a special custom color profile for
your monitor as well
the downside is hardware calibrators can
be a little pricey they typically start
at a hundred US dollars but electronic
shops sometimes offer them for rental if
you are into professional who constantly
needs to recalibrate displays so while
it would be nice if all of our monitors
looks perfect out of the box the reality
is a
little leg works can go a long way
especially if everyone on your screen
looks like a talking spray tan light now
