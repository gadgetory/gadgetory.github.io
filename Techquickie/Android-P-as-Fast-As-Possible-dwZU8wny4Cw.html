the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so what's
your favorite dessert that starts with
the letter P pecan pie peppermint pattie
pop-tart well we don't know which one
Google will pick for its newest mobile
operating system codenamed Android P but
we do know some of the features you'll
be able to look forward to once it hits
the phone in your pocket or the one
you're looking to buy let's start with
one of the things you're likely to
notice as soon as you pick up your phone
notifications Android Oreo introduced
the ability to reply to a message
directly from the solidification instead
of opening the app fully but P will take
this one step further showing images in
line so if one of your friends is a
narcissistic Instagrammer who keeps
sending you photos of his or her dinner
you can now feign excitement more
quickly than ever and on the subject of
images you'll now finally also be able
to draw and mark up your screenshots if
you want to call someone's attention to
a certain part of the screen cab and you
also get an option to take one just by
holding down the power button if you
don't like having to press down two
buttons at once and certain apps can
take better advantage of newer phones
that have a dual camera setup enabling
functionality like death detection and
more realistic AR experiences the visual
related changes don't stop there either
if you stumble upon text that's a little
too small to read comfortably there's
now an iOS like lens zoom feature and
there are a number of new system
animations and visual accents so you
might notice a bit more color on iOS I
could use it like different sub menus in
the Settings app but also a bit less and
others battery saver for example still
shows an icon letting you know what's on
but it no longer turns to the top of the
bottom of your screen that distracting
shade of red and Android P also features
smarter adaptive brightness now
adjusting the backlight level based on
typical usage patterns instead of
relying solely on how the dim your
surroundings are and speaking of battery
saver let's move on and talk a little
bit more about what's under the hood if
you do like the power sipping mode you
can now configure it to kick in earlier
if your phone's battery is at the
greatest but you shouldn't be spending
as much time waiting around for your
battery
tasks to complete anyway since the usual
tweaks to the run timer presence with
Google hoping for fastest ever low times
with minimal memory usage and while
we're on the subject of making things
quicker let's talk about gestural
navigation God is the triangle circle
square paradigm that Android users have
gotten used to now Android pee has a
single home button that you can tap hold
or swipe to bring up your app drawer or
recently use programs similar to iOS
which Google is hoping will make it
easier for users to bring up frequently
used or currently running apps and if
you ever get curious just how long you
use those apps for Android pee provides
a breakdown of app usage and how many
notifications each one sends you
allowing you to keep tabs on just how
bad your additions to Netflix and
snapchat really are now onto something a
little more exciting Android pees indoor
positioning feature this could come in
handy the next time you're in a large
indoor facility like a shopping mall or
an airport you see the new Wi-Fi
standard 802 dot 11 MC will be able to
measure the trip time of your Wi-Fi
signal to and from an access point which
lets it triangulate your position
indoors
it does require hardware support but
with the right device it could end up
being a huge help if you really want a
soft pretzel after a hard day of buying
things you don't need like your phone
with an iPhone style notch at the top
now that Android P supports with it
calls display cutouts for devices that
don't have perfectly rectangular screens
get ready to see a lot more phones
trying to capitalize on this design fad
and finally we'd be a bit remiss if we
didn't talk about a rather important
security tweak Android P no longer
allows apps to access your camera or
microphone in the background now
although that's comforting news it
really makes me wonder what they may
have been watching or listening to up
until now and it does nothing for the
usual vast majority of Android users who
will be left behind when Android P rolls
out sometime later this year today's
episode has been brought to you by
iFixit you know they really like to take
stuff apart and teach people how to fix
things

electrons for pair tools industry with

toolkit and it's now only 59.95
