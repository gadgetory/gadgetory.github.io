the dark web for buying and selling
shady wares as a recent phenomenon it
actually has its roots all the way back
to the very genesis of the Internet in
fact during the early 1970s a group of
students from Stanford used the
Department of Defense designed ARPANET
the predecessor to the Internet to sell
some marijuana to other students at MIT
it's actually believed that this was the
first ever instance of someone buying
something online way before Jeff Bezos
sold his first book so it turns out that
the idea of a cyber Underground is as
old as the internet itself and as the
world became more interconnected the
first day DeHaven started to appear in
the 1980s down in the Caribbean the idea
here was to house information in
countries that had looser loss
surrounding privacy kind of like tax
haven countries with looser laws about
how much the government can skim off the
top of your paycheck but data havens
were still an imperfect solution for
those seeking them out as most countries
still had restrictions on common uses
for these services such as gambling plus
housing information and services
anywhere that was subject to one
jurisdictions laws wasn't enough for
some freedom-loving netizens so a more
decentralized solution called free net
was launched in the year 2000 a dark
network designed to provide anonymity
over encrypted peer-to-peer connections
without relying on a central repository
of information because it's not
connected to the World Wide Web it
remains a rather a niche service but
it's still around
if you're curious but this doesn't mean
that everyone just kind of gave up on
housing tons of sensitive information
and trying to make a buck off it
probably the best-known example of this
is Haven Co also formed in the year 2000
by some libertarian minded folks that
wanted to put information out of the
reaches of any government the plan was
to host servers on Sealand a
self-proclaimed country off the coast of
the United Kingdom that has a colorful
history of its own it's actually an old
air-defense platform left over from
World War 2 that was seized by Roy Bates
a pirate radio broadcaster who took it
by force from other pirate radio
broadcasters he declared his little
patch of concrete in the middle of the
ocean as its own country and the UK's
own courts even ruled at one point that
it was outside of British territory so
the UK government just
kind of gave up on trying to take it
back naturally a rogue state run by
descendants of a pirate would seem like
a good place to host a darknet the plan
was for havenco to attach servers to the
concrete pillars that held up Ceylon and
fill them with nitrogen to discourage
interlopers not to mention the fact that
Ceylon was already difficult for
outsiders to access and easy to defend
unless someone tried to invade with like
actual warships and bombers
unfortunately for Haven code they
couldn't end up getting a reliable
connection and were stuck with a
satellite link that wasn't much faster
than a dial-up modem plus it turned out
that no matter what kind of content you
needed to host you could find some
country to do it in meaning that just
wasn't much interest in havenco services
outside of a few gambling sites to make
matters worse Heavin CO and sealands
government got into a spat involving
copyright infringement as the seal and
royal family didn't want to anger their
close neighbors the UK too much so
havenco eventually shut down but the
dark web has ended up thriving without
Zealand's help in 2002 around the same
time that seal and decided to buy out
Haven Co the Tor network first came
online you can learn much more boat or
up here but it's another decentralized
network ironically first developed by
the US government to protect dissidents
and is now used for all sorts of
purposes and bitcoins launched in 2009
helped the darknet grow even more since
now there's pseudo anonymous ways to
transact shady business and enable the
founding of whole marketplaces but if
you're interested just make sure you
don't get into the business of buying
and selling the wrong stuff you should
stick with the right stuff like fresh
