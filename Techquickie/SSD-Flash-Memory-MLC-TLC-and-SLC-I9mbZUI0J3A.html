computer tinkerers is that the single
best upgrade you can give especially an
older PC is a solid-state drive or an
SSD not only because this removes the
hard drive bottleneck but also because
in general any SSD is going to give you
a significant performance boost even if
you don't agonize for hours over the
exact model you're going to buy and just
to end up spending 10 seconds picking
out the highest-rated one on Amazon but
many of you also have higher performance
requirements than simply faster than a
hard drive so today we're following up
on our guide on which SSD to buy which
you can check out here with an
explanation of the different kinds of
flash memory that you'll find not only
in SSDs but also in things like
removable memory cards and USB thumb
drives so currently SSD flash memory
comes in a few main flavors SLC mlc and
TLC which you will sometimes find in the
SSD product description but
unfortunately not always which sucks
because these three things could have a
huge impact on the performance of your
drive but how well the letter C C yeah
that way in these varieties stands for
SEL as in the memory cells in your SSDs
that store data so depending on the type
each cell can hold a different number of
bits that is the zeros and ones that
make up all digital data a single-level
cell or SLC can hold just one bit per
cell while triple level cells or TLC s
can store three bits per cell ml c
actually stands for multi-level cell so
technically TLC as a subset but n LC is
commonly used to refer to two bits per
cell so it shouldn't be surprising then
that TLC which can store the most bits
per cell offers higher capacities in
fact their higher data density also
makes them cheaper per gigabyte
but there
a caveat here remember that SSDs only
last for a certain number of write
cycles and since the electronics in
TLC's requires more writes per cell
because they store more they don't last
as long as NLCS and SLC s and they also
tend to be significantly slower for
these reasons you will mostly find TLC
flash on lower end SSDs and portable
storage devices instead most mainstream
and higher end consumer SSDs these days
use mlc flash which represents a nice
compromise between data density
longevity performance and price these
drives tend to last anywhere between
twice to ten times as long as TLC SSDs
while being quite a bit faster and while
you can't cram as much data on it and
they'll see SSD for the same cost they
still represent a good value proposition
whether you just need a small SSD to use
as a boot drive or even something larger
form a storage SLC drives due to only
storing one bit per cell are even faster
still and can last for one hundred
thousand right cycles the downside
though is you can possibly guess is that
they are quite expensive so they're
usually only found in enterprise
settings where the fastest speeds and
high reliability are a must of course
there are other important ways that the
flash memory in different drives can
vary such as more recently with the
availability of 3d NAND which uses
memory cells stacked in a 3d
configuration to significantly increase
data density you can learn more about
that in this video so while nearly any
SSD will give you better performance
than your clunky old mechanical Drive
deciding between TLC and mlc with SLC
not being really relevant to less here
you know contract buying thousands of
drives at once in a data center can be
important if you're really going to be
putting your drive through the paces
whether you're a Video Editor running a
new server or you just like to run
benchmarks all the time because your
secret aspiration in life
is to be just like me speaking of secret
aspirations what if you wanted more and
