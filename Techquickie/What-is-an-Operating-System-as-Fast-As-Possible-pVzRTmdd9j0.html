as the squared rainbow or fruit themed
logo that they stare at whenever they
caress the love button of their desk and
or laptop but the big and often ignored
question beyond what makes us partial to
our own particular brand of software is
what the Sam heck do these systems of
operation actually do let's start at the
beginning before the half-eaten fruit or
surprisingly opaque window makes its
appearance when every operating system
turns on a self-sustaining snowball
style process known as a bootstrap must
complete an automated chain of functions
that gradually increases access to
system hardware and controls once this
is done the OS becomes completely
responsible for detecting what it and
all the other programs need from the
hardware and then supplying that quickly
but imagine a world where every program
needed to be written to interact
directly with every combination of PC
hardware it would be chaos fortunately
we don't need to live in that world and
special pieces of software called device
drivers which you can learn more about
here are loaded as part of the booting
process these enable Hardware makers to
write the code once and allow it to work
on a wide variety of systems running the
same or even sometimes just similar
operating systems
so you're booted and staring at the
desktop what now as soon as you interact
with your computer the software you're
using will send out something called a
system call which specifies a task a
hardware component must perform in order
for that software to continue
functioning and to send further requests
then once the operating system has
registered these requests it then
gathers them for organization and
processing and that's important so when
a program is first initiated and needs
some system memory in order to get up
and running it sends out a call which is
received by the OS memory manager once
that call has been translated to the
hardware's language the OS then slots it
into an active queue based on the amount
of memory it feels is necessary
otherwise known as
blocksize when the program is later
closed the OS will terminate the blocks
which you had previously allocated for
it and reserve them for other programs
or just leave them empty if needed in
this fashion the OS is constantly
receiving calls and altering cues using
system managers for everything from
processes to files to networks and
devices so the question now becomes how
does the OS and its system managers
determine which programs are the most
important well it's based on what we
click of course you see the second and
often most confounding function of an
operating system is to provide us with a
graphical we'll usually a graphical user
interface that includes everything from
the sign-in buttons to the taskbar
design and even that annoying little
beach ball that never stops spinning and
if done correctly the UI basically gets
out of the way so we can tell the
computer what to put at the top of the
queue maybe say for example by
maximizing it on the whole screen the
game the game not the stupid antivirus
pop up now I'm dead that's an example of
multitasking behavior in your operating
system gone terribly wrong by the way
but without multitasking modern
operating systems wouldn't be able to
share resources between different tasks
especially ones running in the
background behind what you're actually
focused on like we explained in this
video here and everyone yes you nerdy
accountants and you hipster coffee
drinkers everyone's computer usage
experience would be a very very
different one speaking of different
experiences FreshBooks imagine if
instead of running your own business by
sitting at your computer every night and
sending out invoices and crunching
numbers on spreadsheets what if instead
of that you actually just spent your
time doing the work that you wanted to
be doing and you had a tool like fresh
books to invoice get paid and track
expenses through the cloud it's an
online tool that makes it so you can
focus on the little details like you
know actually doing the job and then
make
billing your customers as simple as okay
well you know I'm a freelance guy let's
say for example I'm going to log my
hours in my phone or other mobile device
as I go throughout the project then at
the end
bippity Boop I use this to bill it and
then the customer can pay credit online
so all the entire transaction is just
much much simpler so if you're a
freelance worker or anyone working for
yourself maybe start using a service
that lets you feel like the boss that
you actually are head over to FreshBooks

trial of their service and don't forget
to enter tech quickie in the how did you
hear about a section all right I think
that's pretty much it guys thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
