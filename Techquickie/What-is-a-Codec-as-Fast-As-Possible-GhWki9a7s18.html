portmanteau of coder decoder or
compressor decompressor and it's a
device or computer program capable of
encoding or decoding a digital data
stream but let's put that in real people
terms that the average computer user can
understand shall we first what we
typically mean by digital data stream is
audio or video content that is stored in
a format that is easily read by
computers or other electronic devices
that means digital files made up of
zeros and ones rather than analog media
like vinyl records next we need to
disambiguate the term codec because
depending on whether we're referring to
a hardware chip or a piece of software
it can actually have fairly different
meanings let's start with code or
decoder hardware when the term is used
this way it usually refers to audio gear
rather than video and a codec contains
both a DAC and an ADC within one package
allowing it to convert sound to a
digital file and then allowing it to
interpret digital files and turn those
back into sound with as much fidelity as
possible some losses occur during both
of these conversions however which leads
us well into the more widespread use of
the term codec software codecs these are
computer programs that take the original
source video or audio data and pack it
up in a specific format that adheres to
a documented standard that will allow it
to be easily interpreted by other
devices or pieces of software that are
capable of utilizing the same codec but
why would you want to do that you might
ask I was trying to play a movie on my
computer and it said I didn't have the
codec installed it was a pain in the
patoot why can't everything just be sent
in its original form or at the very
least why can't everything use the same
codec great question in a perfect world
we would never compress or convert
anything because aside from the
inconvenience and I alluded to this
before
most codecs are what is known as lossy
which means that we're losing some of
the fidelity of the video or audio
recording when we convert to them
unfortunately though in the real world
the logistics of uncompressed media
files are a nightmare a 10-minute HD
video that you download from u2
might be a couple hundred megabytes
whereas a 12 bit raw file the same
length and resolution can be easily over
60 gigs try streaming that kind of data
over your internet connection lossless
codecs are a way around this degradation
of quality but compared to lossy codecs
their file sizes are still very large
and or they can be very processor
intensive to encode and decode so the
most common solution is to use a lossy
codec at high bitrate that is more data
per second in the stream if you want
high quality playback without files that
are so large you can't store them or
easily send them anywhere but there's no
one right answer some codecs are best
for high quality while others maintain
better playback on unreliable
connections while others still are
designed to keep latency or delay very
very low and that is why we need a wide
variety of audio and video codecs that
are optimized for different uses the
last thing I'll touch on is containers
an example is MKV or a VI
these are basically just easily
recognizable wrappers that contain a
number of media streams for example
video audio navigation menu and some
subtitle files
now many people equate containers with
codecs because there are file types like
mp3 or JPEG that act as a container but
can only contain a single file type so
that's where the confusion comes from
regular containers by contrast can
contain media files that utilize a wide
variety of different codecs and if all
of this is still pretty confusing and
you just wanted an answer to like how to
play your media files don't worry
there's an easy fix you can download VLC
media player which contains most of the
codecs you'll need on a daily basis or
if you don't like VLC you can install
CCCP codec pack which installs media
player classic and a wide variety of
different codecs on your system so you
basically won't have to think about this
anymore
alright so now with all this talk about
videos maybe you'd like to enjoy some
sweet enlightened videos except don't
wait pesky Gio restrictions and blackout
zones might prevent you from actually
being able to enjoy online services like
us Netflix
and Pandora because you happen to live
in a region that doesn't allow those
services good thing hotspot Shield who
