Jackson or Led Zeppelin albums on
cassette tape lying around your house
but chances are these days you're
listening to mp3s of Billie Jean or
stairway to heaven instead
but even though magnetic tape has been
long obsolete for music it's still going
strong for data storage wait a sec Luke
how is that even possible
haven't modern SSDs and hard drives
displaced everything else I mean even
optical discs are becoming a thing of
the past but believe it or not tape has
some pretty significant advantages that
have made its popular storage medium
lasts for over 60 years
in fact the first tape drive appeared
all the way back in 1951 and had a name
that made it sound like something out of
a Jetsons episode the yunus servo this
was actually the tape drive that was
used for the famous UNIVAC one the first
ever commercial computer built in the US
the univac took up an entire room and
not surprisingly the you know servo was
a behemoth as well
holding nearly a quarter mile of tape on
large reels but only about 225 kilobytes
of data later though tape storage became
more practical due to switching from
heavy metal tapes to plastic tape coated
in magnetic substances that store the
actual data more advanced recording
methods such as using the entire width
of the tape to increase data density
health brain capacities over the years
to 10 terabytes today in a package that
weighs only half a pound but then why
don't we see people using tape drives
and personal rigs very often aside from
the drives being very expensive they
also tend to be very slow think about
how long it took to rewind the tape from
Blockbuster way back in the day when
they were still a thing unlike hard
drives or SSDs which can go directly to
the data you want in a small fraction of
a second tape drives have to wind
themselves back and forth sequentially
to access files meaning they're just too
sluggish to use in day-to-day computing
but even though a tape storage solution
requires a large upfront cost for a
drive the tape cartridges themselves are
pretty darn cheap compared to other
forms of storage media and they tend to
have great longevity making tape a
great choice for archival storage and
data backups not only is magnetic tape
pretty Hardy but the fact that most
organizations use it strictly for backup
and aren't constantly accessing their
tape drives mean that they're less prone
to wearing out than something like a
mechanical hard drive which is
constantly spinning shortening their
lifespan and tapes appeal for mass
backup storage doesn't appear to be
going anywhere in fact Sony recently
developed a new type of tape that can
hold 185 terabytes
on a single cartridge so if you miss
your cassette collection from the 1980s
you can always digitize all 23 million
of your songs and just stick them on one
tape speaking of listening to things
