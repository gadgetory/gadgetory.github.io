days centers around securing things like
internet connections and passwords on a
server somewhere and it makes sense
considering how much data is constantly
being tossed around online but let's say
that you've done everything you can to
hide your online activity using a VPN
making up a 20 character freaking
password for your social media accounts
and overwriting your browser cache what
if despite all of this someone just
walks off with your hard drive or
computer or breaks in while you're out
of the house and starts trying to get
into your stuff this is where an equally
important kind of encryption could
really help you
it's called whole Drive encryption or
full disk encryption and just like the
name says the idea is to encrypt your
whole Drive so a thief can't just access
all of your private data if they walk
off with it but how does this work many
full disk encryption methods such as
Windows BitLocker try to give you a
fairly transparent experience when
you're actually using the computer to do
this all of the data on your drive is
encrypted and the next time you boot up
your computer you'll be presented with a
special pre boot environment that will
ask you for an encryption key this could
be something as simple as a password or
a key stored on a physical drive like a
USB stick if you'd rather go that route
after you supply the appropriate
credentials your hard drive will be
decrypted and you'll be able to carry on
business as usual of course if someone
steals your hard drive and your
encryption key isn't terribly strong it
might not be too hard for some miscreant
to crack it so many users who use full
disk encryption add another layer of
protection through a trusted platform
module or TPM this is an add-in chip
found on some motherboards and even if
you don't have one
many modern motherboards including
lower-cost ones have TPM headers so you
can just buy one for not a lot of money
and install it yourself what a TPM does
is generate encryption keys and stores
them at least in part on the module
itself instead of just the hard drive
TPMS can also detect tampering attempts
so if someone steals your hard drive
out of your computer and tries to put it
in their own it won't work and speaking
of tampering TPMS can additionally tell
if someone has injected malicious code
like a rootkit which you can learn about
up here into your boot sector which
often can't be encrypted by full drive
encryption schemes this way it can lock
down the system and help you recover it
later without exposing it to rootkit
malware some people even take this a
step farther and buy hardware encrypted
drives that have a built in chip that
can encrypt the entire enchilada
including your boot sector but despite
all these ways to secure your drive they
don't really do much at all to keep your
data safe once your computer is up and
running remember how I said it decrypts
your entire Drive instead many people
who are serious about security
especially if they have to leave their
computers on 24/7 for whatever reason
use some sort of file system level
encryption that can encrypt and decrypt
individual files on demand very useful
if you don't want someone to randomly
use your PC and pouring through all of
your questionable downloads so let us
know if you'd like to see a video on how
to keep your files safe from prying eyes
if you have to leave your window session
unattended
after all you definitely don't want
everyone knowing it was you that created
that piece of fanart fortune just really
can't stop talking about are you coding
for online easy payments if you're
building a mobile app and searching for
a simple payment solution
check out Braintree brain trees vi0 sdk
is just one small snippet of code and
allows you to accept Apple pay Android
pay PayPal then mo credit cards even
Bitcoin and if something new pops up
Braintree will support that too it's
used by uber Airbnb github it's scalable
integrating it into your app is as easy
as just inserting a few lines of code so
try out that sandbox and learn more
about Braintree and get your first
$50,000 in transactions fee free at
Braintree payments dot-com slash tech
quickie
don't forget to let John know in the
comments down below if you want to see a
file system level encryption video like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it don't forget to get some
- tech quickie check out links to the
video description we've got a bunch of
cool ones there they're interesting I'm
sure if you get bored by those links you
can check out channels over which is
more interesting and if you're wondering
what the hell that incessant whispering
was in the background of this entire
video
say hi Linus Linus is doing the wine
show so I'm gonna go do that now all
