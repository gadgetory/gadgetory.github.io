ah so nice oh but wait you rubbed your
feet on the carpet you're touching
position and it's dead so you've heard
of static electricity and you know that
if you touch someone and zap at this
view that's bad but how do you actually
protect delicate fragile electronic
components from the dangers of static
electricity layer number one is usually
some kind of an anti-static padded foam
usually gray or bubble wrap that is
usually pink all right so it's going to
come inside one of those in all
likelihood next up is your anti-static
bag this usually has some kind of a
conductive material on the outside of
the bag that allows electrostatic to be
discharged without actually reaching the
delicate components inside now a common
mistake that I see particularly with
motherboards is people take that fresh
motherboard out of the box take it out
of the bag put it on top of the bag in
order to call that an anti-static safe
workstation wrong the outside of the bag
is conductive and not actually good to
be used for that then how that it's all
naked and stuff how do you keep your new
expensive graphics card from being
destroyed first of all don't handle it
by the sensitive components on the PCB
handle it by the edges or by things like
heat sinks which are less likely to be
zapped into oblivion
number two is ground yourself dissipate
the static electricity by touching
something that is connected to a ground
such as a power supply that is plugged
in but turned off another option if you
can't remember to do that every time you
move or every couple minutes is to use
an anti-static wrist strap you don't
have to keep it on your wrist you can
instead keep it on your ankle but this
will constantly ground you out as long
as the other end which is usually an
alligator clip is connected to something
that will dissipate the electricity a
great example would be something like
I'll plugged in power supply some people
plug them directly into the wall but
make sure you plug it into the correct
part of the wall or you might have a bit
of a problem double-check the way that
the wiring works in your region - tech
tips takes no responsibility for bad
things that happened to you thank you
