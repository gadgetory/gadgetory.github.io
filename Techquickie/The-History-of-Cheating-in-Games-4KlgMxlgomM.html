ever since human beings coalesced in
actual societies that came up with
systems for handling their affairs
people have found ways to cheat them
from taxes to sports - that show where
Joey Greco got shanked by a philandering
lover trying to gain an unfair advantage
is nothing new and so it is with video
games just like there are plenty of
shortcuts you can take that would land
you in trouble with the IRS the history
of cheating and video games is long and
varied in fact cheating goes all the way
back to the earliest days of gaming when
developers started putting cheat codes
into their games to allow them to skip
levels in order to test their
functionality more quickly and although
many of these codes weren't intended to
be disclosed publicly some early gamers
were still quite interested in examining
the underlying code of many games in
detail meaning it wasn't long before
they started finding exploits some of
these were even used to try and fix
underlying problems such as an early
retail trainer program for Castle
Wolfenstein released in the mid-1980s
that promised to fix crashes and other
bugs but also gave players access to
additional items and level skips but
other times gamers just discovered these
debugging codes on their own instead of
relying on commercially available
trainers for additional functionality as
the developers usually didn't bother to
take these out before the games were
released the famous Konami code which is
now an easter egg on many popular
websites is a notable example of this
before long
developers took notice of the fact that
she codes made their games more
appealing and started actively putting
them into games with the intent that
players would use them back in the 80s
and 90s chasing down the almighty high
score was the holy grail of many a gamer
meaning codes for things like infinite
lives could help them reach scores that
were previously unattainable and even if
players didn't care about maxing out
their scores cheese provided a new way
to experience titles that a gamer had
already beaten for example Mortal Kombat
featured a code that wasn't really a
cheat but enabled Gore in the game which
was disabled by default because some
politicians in the u.s. thought a little
bit of 2d pixelated blood was far too
much for the masses to handle
responsibly so by the mid 1990s cheat
codes were wildly popular and the demand
for them was so high that gamers didn't
want to be
stricted - just what was built in by a
developer so products like the game
genie gameshark an action replay hit the
market cartridges that actually
manipulated the code of whatever game
was inserted into them in this way
players could discover their own sheets
even in games that didn't have any built
in and share them with other gamers and
even though some developers notably
Nintendo did not appreciate this and try
to litigate cheat cartridges out of
existence by saying that they were
infringing upon copyrights courts
disagreed and the devices remained
popular well into the late 1990s and
early 2000s but in the mid 2000s the
popularity of cheat codes plummeted
rapidly but why did gamers just suddenly
have a change of heart well sort of back
when she codes were the height of cool
they were typically found primarily by
reading gaming magazines or simply by
word of mouth making gamers that had
them feel like they're a part of some
super rad secret society but internet
search engines came along and blew up
that entire paradigm since now anyone
can look up a code in a matter of
seconds
but what really killed off the
traditional cheat code was the
achievement system that was introduced
around the same time that online play
became a key feature of first PC and
later console gaming gamers now chase
down achievement points like they did
the high scores of yesteryear but since
you can now instantly compare your
achievements with those of others from
around the world instead of just playing
for personal satisfaction using cheat
codes or other exploits to rack up
achievements became frowned upon as an
undermine those who poured tons of time
and effort into acquiring them honestly
and for those who care more about online
multiplayer than single-player
achievements online game services like
Xbox Live and ei origin started
aggressively banning cheaters in order
to provide a level playing field for the
millions of gamers who log onto their
servers of course this doesn't mean that
cheats don't still exist while cheat
codes are much rarer in games than they
used to be many games still contain
secrets or easter eggs that can be
discovered in ways other than entering
codes and exploits are still used by
speedrunners to beat games in record
time Taron making it sort of a twist on
the concept of a high score and you can
learn more about that right up here
but of course actual modern-day cheating
in the sense of gaining an unfair
advantage is the most common on
line multiplayer servers so let us know
