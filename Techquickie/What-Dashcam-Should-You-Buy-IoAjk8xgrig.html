the only places we really saw dashcams
were when we were sitting on our couches
been watching episodes of cops and
laughing as the police had to respond to
a report of an alligator on the loose or
whatever but with the decreasing costs
of portable video recorders I mean you
can get smart phones with basic cameras
for like twenty dollars these days dash
cams have become popular with ordinary
drivers for a number of reasons other
than just watching spectacular footage
of Russian car accidents one of the
biggest of these is to record evidence
to show your insurance company or the
court if it comes to that
in the event of a wreck since it can be
hard to determine who's telling the
truth and witnesses aren't always
available in fact many insurance
companies now offer discounts to drivers
with dash cams giving drivers and even
bigger incentive to buy one but which
one should you pick at first glance
buying a dashcam seems like a pretty
straightforward affair since they're
just cameras that sit on your dashboard
and record everything
however some dash cams have nicer
features that can make your life a
little bit easier because dash cams
record continuously on a limited amount
of storage such as an SD card a good
idea is to get something with a looping
function that will automatically record
over your old video that you no longer
need when the card reaches its capacity
but Linus what if someone hits me
because they were playing Pokemon go
behind the wheel instead of paying
attention to the road will my dash cam
just record over it if I leave it
sitting for too long well if you bought
a quality model
it shouldn't as many dash cams also have
a g-force sensor that can detect sudden
changes in acceleration including
impacts with other vehicles when this
happens your camera will remember to
save whatever it was recording at that
time instead of overwriting it of course
making sure your footage gets saved
won't be much help if you had an
accident while driving at night and your
camera is struggling to record in the
darkness so it's also not a bad idea to
check a dash cams nighttime video
quality
unfortunately dash cams that have
infrared or night-vision which you can
learn more about here
aren't all that reliable so a camera
that advertises that as a feature might
not necessarily work as promised other
bells and whistles include things like
lane departure warning motion sensors
that can switch the camera on when
you're parked to record things like
break-ins or battery backup so you can
use it outside of your car if need be
but none of these are a substitute for
good old-fashioned image quality given
that it's quite easy to find full 1080p
dash cams for well under a hundred US
dollars these days there's not much
reason to go with anything lower and you
might want to consider getting something
with a wider resolution such as 2560 by
1080 so you'll end up capturing more of
the stuff that's going on in the sides
of your car as well but before you rush
out to buy a new dashcam make sure you
know what's legal in your area while
some countries like the US generally
allow video recording in public spaces
like highways other countries like
Austria ban them outright in a number of
other European countries like Germany
have placed restrictions on their use
and restrictions on where you can post
footage due to concerns over privacy but
if the local cops have no problem with
dashcam usage do your homework and pick
up something reliable not only will you
have greater peace of mind
but you might just capture the next
viral video of a falling meteor or
kangaroo attack on your next daily
commute
speaking of kangaroo attacks Dollar
Shave Club is available in the US
Australia and Canada only one of which
is somewhat applicable to kangaroos but
