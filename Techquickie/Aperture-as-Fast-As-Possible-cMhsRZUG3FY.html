numbers around the lens on a camera have
you ever wondered what they might mean
it's called f-stop and it's a
measurement of the possible range of
sizes for a camera's aperture which is
the opening in a camera through which
light enters the wider the aperture is
the more light can get through onto the
camera sensor which is necessary for
properly exposing lighter or darker
scenes the f-stop number or focal ratio
indicates how much light is getting
through and each marked f-stop is either
double or half as much light but it's
not very intuitive because the smaller
numbers actually indicate wider aperture
sizes now on some cameras like cell
phone cameras the f-stop or aperture
size is automatically decided for you
but if you can adjust it manually it's
worth doing if you want to take a better
picture by adjusting the aperture not
only can you change the brightness of an
image but also the depth of field depth
of field is basically the full extent of
everything that's in focus in a picture
a deeper depth of field means that more
of the images in focus and a shallower
depth of field means that less of the
image is in focus this means that a
scene can be photographed with the
foreground and background blurred out
which allows for the main subject of the
photograph to stand out more it looks
really good but when you widen the
aperture the picture also gets brighter
so you have to compensate for that
overexposure by adjusting other camera
settings like ISO or shutter speed some
cameras like a DSLR can automatically
adjust these settings for you when put
in aperture priority mode since a blurry
background can look really good if done
correctly I used to always take pictures
with the aperture set as wide as
possible so a low f-stop to give myself
the shallowest possible depth of field
however lately I've learned that this
very shallow depth of field is not
always desirable this was shot with a
macro lens and the focus is millimeter
thin making it difficult to see the
whole subject it's up to you how much or
how little depth of field you want for
your pictures and videos and changing
the aperture is a great way to control
that but if you want more control over
your facial hair I'd suggest Dollar
Shave Club
you might remember that last time I did
a spot for these guys I dollar shaved
off my whole beard many of you cried out
in protest and so I think I'll keep it
this time around but I should probably
continue to shave the neck beard and if
you don't want to be a neck beard you
should join Dollar Shave Club Dollar
Shave Club shaves you time
saves you money by delivering
high-quality razors to your door once a
month for a few bucks a month it's like
getting a little present in the mail

like shave butter one wipe Charlies and
most recently post shave a very nice
smelling aftershave so stop being such a
neckbeard go to dollarshaveclub.com so
let's join us and join the club I hope
