seem to have typing and all caps style
opinions on I mean remember how much
controversy there was when scientists
Xerox to Dolly the sheep fortunately
though no one's going to protest outside
your house if you decide to clone a hard
drive or SSD but what exactly does
cloning a drive mean and why might you
want to do it
well it's hopefully pretty obvious that
cloning involves copying something in
this case everything on one drive to
another drive but there's a bit more to
it than that you see when you fire up
your Drive cloning software and press go
it will duplicate the data from your old
drive onto your new one sector-by-sector
so not only will you have all the same
files but they'll be arranged in the
same physical order including free space
and any fragmentation that was on the
drive which you can learn more about up
here but hold on a second Luke what if I
want to backup my drive why can't I just
copy and paste everything over using
File Explorer great question and if the
data you're trying to protect is stuff
like videos documents and save games
then yes simply copying everything over
without any special software is a
perfectly good option go ahead what if
you're trying to backup your boot disk
the one that contains your operating
system your settings or programs your
saved games whatever else simply playing
the copy/paste game won't do as many of
the files you need for an exact backup
won't be accessible within the operating
system while your computer is running
and many modern programs have
protections in place that will prevent
them from running or they simply weren't
designed to operate properly if they are
copied in this matter
however cloning software will ensure
that you catch not only all of your
files but also things like program
configurations partition tables and the
Boot Record this way if your existing
drive fails or you're just migrating to
a new one that's bigger or faster or
whatever else you can plug right in and
keep on computing seamlessly a
closely-related solution is to create a
disk image which is slightly more
complicated instead of making an exact
own of a drive on to a new physical
device an image takes a snapshot of your
disk including the Boot Record and other
data that isn't normally accessible and
saves that in a special image file on a
different device if you ought to boot
from it you'll have to restore the image
to a third drive or back to your
existing one using special software if
you're recovering from a catastrophic
failure system crash something like that
or even a virus
rather than upgrading the upside to
imaging is that it usually gives you a
few more options than just straight-up
cloning as you can fit multiple disk
images onto your backup media as long as
it's spacious enough and some imaging
software can automatically tweak your
image regularly depending on what's
changed on your drive you can also
direct your imaging software to
disregard free space so that the image
won't take up quite as much room which
you just can't do with cloning but
because cloning creates an exact copy of
your drive rather than an image file it
is the quickest and sometimes simplest
way to ensure you'll be back up and
running again
but whichever approach you choose there
are a number of free disk imaging and
cloning utilities out there that can
help you make backups upgrades or even
put the exact same disc with the same
pre-loaded programs and data on lots of
different computers and the best part is
you don't even need to be a mad
scientist or system admin to do it
audible is offering everybody watching
this video yes even you the editor a
