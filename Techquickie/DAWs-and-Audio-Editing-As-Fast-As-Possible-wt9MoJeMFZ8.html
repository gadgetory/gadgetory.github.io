something adorable like a box of puppies
no that's wrong
Dawes our digital audio workstations and
in no way adorable unless you know
you're into that kind of thing well
either way
moving on DAWs are used in production of
basically everything from soundtracks
for movies albums voiceovers podcasts
and so on much like video editing the
first audio editing involved recording -
and splicing tape and unfortunately
that's really how it stayed until the
late 1970s before then computers just
didn't have the processing power or
storage speeds needed to edit audio then
sound streams stepped in with what they
called the digital editing system it
used a special mini computer running
custom software package and operating
system the system was capable of moving
and crossfading between audio clips
which for a time was pretty dang cool
and significantly easier than splicing
tape not long after this in the 1980s
consumer computers were becoming
powerful enough to run their own dawes
digi designs sound tools and sounded
designer could be hooked up to a
computer for editing audio samples and
yes people were sampling back in the 80s
this in fact started a huge dispute over
copyright laws over sampling and shortly
after this major record labels all
started going digital digit design
answered this digital revolution with
their legendary software Pro Tools which
quickly became and is still to this day
the industry standard DAW this was
however expensive because pro tools
require dedicated hardware for audio
processing it wasn't until 1993 that a
German company called Steinberg released
the first da that broke away from
dedicated hardware but what kind of
hardware do you need to mix and edit
audio you could have something as simple
as an entry-level USB mic like the blue
Yeti connected to a computer but studios
usually have much larger mixing consoles
capable of receiving a multitude of
controllable audio sources so is there a
benefit to this other than just being
able to record lots of stuff at once of
course a recurring theme across many
topics is the benefits of dedicated
equipment just like having a dedicated
graphics card in a computer using a dead
compressor mic amp or mixer makes a big
difference in sound and performance so
by performance you mean moving and
cutting up sounds right well almost like
video editing there's lots of
possibilities and DAWs come in tons of
different flavors many DAWs allow you to
synthesize and create your own
instruments from scratch and in some
cases break away from the timeline
editing view we are so used to Ableton
Live is a perfect example since you
store your ideas and blocks and can
activate them with a controller each
button playing a different segment of
your song programs like FL studio a
well-known da for PC allows the user to
store ideas and segments in a side Bank
as loops and pull them into the timeline
whenever they're needed then there's
programs like Pro Tools sonar and logic
which are more closely designed to
emulate analog equipment giving the
operator similar set of controls to
playing a physical mixing console
ironically that means the industry
standard digital audio workstations are
actually emulating the analog audio
workstations that they replaced so
what's next and should we really expect
many changes in the future for audio
editing well that's actually a pretty
good possibility many smaller DAWs are
moving towards modularity with
third-party plugins that are there to
make the creative process easier for the
producer or artist however with the r8
analog audio is changing which is too
slow for even a clever metaphor I
wouldn't expect the toppdogg
industry-standard DAWs to change up
