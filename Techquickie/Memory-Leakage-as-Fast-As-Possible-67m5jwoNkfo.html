had slow program loading poor
multitasking and overall sluggish
performance lately that combined with
what I found when checking the systems
random access memory usage I'd say
you've got all the tell-tale signs of a
memory leak and we're back now the term
memory leak is used to describe a range
of communication errors that result from
poorly written application programming
that reduce the available amounts of
dynamic heap memory you see whenever we
start up a program on our computers or
other devices a request for hardware
resources known as a system call is
triggered and in the case of RAM it
reserves chunks or blocks of application
heap memory for a program to occupy
while it's doing whatever it is the
programs on your computer do when you're
finished with that and you exit a
program these reserve blocks of RAM are
supposed to be cleared for later use or
reallocated to another running program
that needs them the issue of leakage
arises whenever an application fails to
communicate that this reserved memory
can be cleared causing it to be
ostensibly locked in time in space or
when a program stacks requests for
repeated tasks on top of each other
instead of starting and closing them as
needed until all Ram is consumed and the
OS is forced to use lead-footed hard
drive space as a reserve at least on PCs
that is so let's give an example of what
this might look like if your web browser
was causing a memory leak you'd open up
yet another tad and fire up a website
and a chunk of RAM would be assigned
you'd open another and boom chunk of RAM
again well imagine your sister walked in
and you closed that first site quickly
before she could see it was the fan site
you made about her best friend but
instead of actually closing down the
running process when the tab was
terminated your computer's simply made
it disappear making it different
to track down what's using all that RAM
so now we know what a memory leak is so
how do we diagnose them well first we
can look at system specs versus the
tasks that the user is trying to perform
and if performance is painfully sluggish
relative to that it might be a problem
then you can fire up good old task
manager or a third party app if you're
on a phone and either monitor it
periodically for gradual increases in
RAM usage that just pile up over time or
by tracking down the typical application
memory usage to compare to what you're
seeing on the Google not to mention that
other Googlers complaining about a leaky
program is another solid indicator all
right so we've gotten this far then how
do you fix the bloomin things once you
find them well a couple of ways number
one did you try turning it off and
turning it back on again
no seriously a restart will force
Hardware resources to be given up until
they're requested again number two if
the problem is caused by your operating
system I'll you're probably stuck
waiting for an update and number three
if the problem is caused by a sloppily
coded program or game check for updates
again and if there aren't any then I
guess the only solution is to toss them
because if a manufacturer can't be
bothered to make sure their software
operates correctly then they don't
deserve your business that is unless of
course you've already given it to them
speaking of already giving them your
business lynda.com you can give them
your business without even committing to
anything you get ten days of free trial
by clicking on the link in the video
description well hold on a second
lightest what is lynda.com well it's the
site where you can watch and learn from
top experts who are passionate about
teaching teaching what you might ask
well thousands of video courses
on-demand about all kinds of subjects
whether it's digital photography video
editing business or well all the other
things that I'm sure going to be
overlaid on the screen right now in
front of you you can take notes as you
go refer to them later you can download
the tutorials and watch them on the go
including on iOS and Android devices and
you can create and save playlists of
courses that you want to watch to
customize your learning path
or share with friends colleagues and
team members so the call to action here
is pretty simple visit linda.com slash
tech quickie for unlimited access for 10
days for free and if you like it then
your flat rate membership is starting at
just $25 per month I think that's pretty
much it guys thanks for watching like
