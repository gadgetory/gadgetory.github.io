clean slate whether it's a new car right
off the lot fresh sheets in your hotel
room bed or a pardon from the state
governor for your fourteenth speeding
ticket but your driving record isn't the
only thing that could use a fresh
scrubbing reformatting the storage drive
in your computer or mobile device could
make your life easier as well but what
exactly is formatting well just like a
database is kind of useless unless it
has some sort of system for organizing
all of your data a disk isn't very
useful unless it has a file system where
I can tell your computer where
everything is physically located on the
drive when you format your hard drive
SSD USB stick or whatever else the disk
is first partitioned meaning that the
disk is given a beginning and an end
just to mark the areas where the
operating system can access it then a
file system is placed on to the disk to
allow it to organize its contents
usually NTFS for Windows Drive or fat32
or exFAT for a removable flash drive but
formatting does more than just prepare a
disk for use so if there is anything on
the disk before formatting it gets a
race during the formatting process
because formatting involves erasing the
tables that give locations to all of the
files on the disk meaning your operating
system will see all the previous data as
free space that can be overwritten and
although this is obviously a problem for
people who want to reform how to disk
because it isn't working properly but
would also like to keep the data it also
means that reformatting is a great way
to completely nukid rive really quickly
oftentimes this is done when a computer
is pretty infected by particularly
determined malware which is difficult to
remove with anti-malware applications
and can leave lasting damage to crucial
operating system files even if you do
manage to get rid of it by formatting an
infected drive you nullify its ability
to execute any malicious code and since
formatting erases the boot sector that
tells your PC to load up your operating
system it's also a great way to defeat
the more exotic viruses that infect the
boot sector directly which can give you
a truckload of problems formatting is
also a good way to remove pre-installed
software from a computer you bought off
the shelf often referred to as bloatware
since it tends to hog up system
resources and often provide quest
at best utility bloatware can be
difficult to remove completely so many
people who purchase pre-built pcs
especially laptops like to format the
included drive right out of the box and
do a clean operating system install and
if you're suffering from windows
bloating where windows just kind of
piles up background processes and
registry errors over time formatting can
serve a useful method for spring
cleaning do keep in mind however that
formatting does have some limitations
doing it to permanently erase data
beyond recovery is just a bad idea as
formatting doesn't obliterate this data
it just marks it as free space and it
can be overwritten later on and can
still be recovered by using third-party
software there's a bunch of them out
there so using an overwrite utility such
as dban or Derek's boot and nuke is just
a much better idea formatting also won't
help you if the problem you're having
lies within your PC somewhere else such
as in the case of a super corrupted BIOS
or a terrible virus that gets into your
freaking firmware and while formatting
can give you a clean slate to work off
of it doesn't make your drive like new
though a full format in Windows can
check your drive for bad sectors to at
least tell you whether or not you might
need a whole new disk drive to solve
your problems but formatting like we
said earlier remains a very valuable
tool if you're drowning in malware
bloatware or whatever just remember it
is a bit of a nuclear option so don't
push the red button unless you're sure
it's okay to scorch the earth or in this
