event or a TV commercial you probably
know that they typically pick a handful
of game-changing features to focus on
and to their credit they largely succeed
in creating tons of buzz around the
newest IFing making you a professional
photographer something for one feature
that took quite a lot of engineering and
Apple made quite a bit of noise about it
is on the verge of dying a quiet death
and I'm not talking about the iPod click
wheel if you've got a recent gen i phone
odds are that it has a feature called 3d
touch but when was the last time you
actually used it the basic idea behind
3d touch is that the iPhone would
incorporate a pressure-sensitive screen
which you can learn much more about
right up here to enable additional
functionality depending on how hard the
user was pushing down on the screen most
notably a harder press on an object
would tell the iPhone to open up a
context menu instead of opening it up
normally so for example a hard press on
an email message would give you options
to delete it or mark it as read in a
couple of ways this feature made a lot
of sense
like for example Linus absolutely raved
about it in his review of the iPhone 6s
which he declared to be his top
smartphone of the year like it just
makes sense having an alternate or
right-click option has been a feature
for decades on desktop PCs and since
you're dealing with a very limited
amount of screen real estate on a
smartphone giving users more control on
the up and down axis seem just open up
quite a few possibilities right but
while the tech itself is undeniably cool
Apple found that very few iPhone users
were actually taking advantage of it but
why well here's the thing modern
smartphone design is moving towards
minimalism both on the hardware and
software sides and this is all in the
name of improving intuitiveness with
respect to how we interact with them
need to take a photo tap the little
picture of a camera need to move
something off to the side just swipe it
in that direction but with 3d touch
there really wasn't any kind of
intuitive this is how you use this
feature signal in iOS or in most apps
consequently many users didn't really
realize it was there and many app
developers didn't bother to take
advantage of the technology which made
it quite a bit different from the
right-click paradigm of how the PC works
as it's rather difficult to know
are the fact that there's a large second
button on your mouse not to mention the
fact that 3d touch was unnecessarily
complicated if you're an Android user
you probably know that simply using a
long press rather than a hard press will
open up a context menu just as 3d touch
did without the added expense of a force
sensitive screen now to make it more
versatile than androids long press 3d
touch was supposed to have three levels
of pressure sensitivity but it's hard to
imagine many smartphone users being able
to quickly figure out exactly how many
Newton's of force to apply to the screen
in order to accomplish a certain action
especially on a device that pushes
intuition and simplicity as major
selling points so given that Apple
didn't do much to help users understand
the feature and the fact that it took
the company two years to develop it
Apple has reportedly decided it's simply
not worth it to continue offering 3d
touch the feature was already missing on
the cheaper iPhone 10 r and it's
expected that none of the new iPhones
that will be released later this year
will have 3d touch so bummer for linus i
guess he thought the feature itself was
pretty easy to use
if only the software had kept up like
how does a hard press on this Wi-Fi icon
not bring up the Wi-Fi configuration
menu
but I guess 3d touch diehards can find
some solace smartphone glass is pretty
strong these days so if pressing hard on
the display made you feel empowered I
say go for gold just don't go overboard
and get stuck with a repair bill because
you didn't understand your own strengths
you strong strong 3d touch levers bless
you
do you shower do you shave I don't do
you shave at least part of your face do
you brush your teeth I thought so
well good thing because today's sponsor
