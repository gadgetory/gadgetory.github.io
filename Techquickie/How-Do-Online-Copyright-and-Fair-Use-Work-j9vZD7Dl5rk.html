passed in 1710 I can't even imagine that
the British Parliament would have ever
envisioned people flinging pirated
copies of movies all over the internet
whatever that would have seemed like
thousands of times every day yet that's
exactly what eventually happened and
seeing as many of our copyright laws
were meant for the pre cyberspace era
the way the copyright works online is
often quite messy now we here at tech
wiki aren't lawyers up that's not
entirely true
John our writer did graduate from an
American law school but anyways we can
help clear up some of the misconceptions
around what you can and can't do online
at least legally anyways although
today's episode is based around u.s.
copyright law similar concepts exist in
many other countries as well so one of
the main reasons that copyright laws
even exist is to encourage people like
musicians software developers and game
designers to come up with creative stuff
I mean do you think that Mark Wahlberg
would have starred in that awful movie
The Happening if there wasn't a
copyright holder there to cut him a fat
paycheck so perhaps it isn't surprising
that usually when you hear a news story
about a high-profile copyright case it's
where some copyright infringer either
made tons of money off of bootleg and
copies of something or where some
bigshot movie studio comes after someone
for cutting into their profits by
distributing one of their films for free
even if the infringer isn't making any
money but let's assume that like most
people you aren't running a huge bootleg
operation and are concerned about
whether you can do something like share
a screen shot from a movie on your blog
or play a song in the background of a
Youtube upload this is where fair use
comes into play and a really important
concept that's misunderstood by a lot of
people in a nutshell most kinds of
creative work including songs books and
the angsty poems that you wrote when
you're a 16 year old scene kid have an
automatic copyright that applies as soon
as they're created but that doesn't mean
no one else can ever use them fair use
helps keep people from getting sued for
copyright infringement as long as
they're using stuff well fairly but what
constitutes fair that's a pretty
subjective question that courts use
several factors to answer but generally
speaking the most important one is
whether you're costing someone money by
how you're using their stuff even though
any reproduction without permission of a
copyrighted work is technically
infringement even if you're just
reposting some cool picture you found as
your facebook cover photo that being
said if one day you get a nasty letter
from someone's lawyer
you can probably assert fair use if
you're not affecting someone's bottom
line on the other hand simply posting
something with a disclaimer that the
content isn't yours doesn't
automatically make it fair use if you're
seeding a torrent of a copyrighted song
fair use will not save you from the
wrath of a recording studio even if you
say this isn't mine
I'm not making money off of it since
people are just going to download the
song anyways for free instead of paying
for it on itunes or wherever else the
company will see it as a hit to their
bottom line whether or not that person
would have bought the song at all or not
this concept also comes to play if
you've ever spent any time reading or
writing fanfiction it's pretty popular
for a fanfic writer to put a disclaimer
at the top claiming that they don't own
the characters but since copyright law
also gives the right to make derivative
works to the original creator for
example a movie book or game sequel it's
theoretically possible for fanfic
writers to get in trouble with
publishers though many authors notably
JK Rowling of Harry Potter Fame have
given their blessing to fanfic writers
so long as they're not trying to sell
their stories and of course content
creators are under no obligation to let
people use their stuff even if they
aren't making money off of it
but at least the way we think about laws
in an age where anything can be uploaded
in a matter of seconds seemingly
they're catching up to reality even if
the process is a bit slow one appeals
court in the u.s. recently ruled that
fair use should not just be a legal
excuse for infringement but instead a
right
that shouldn't constitute infringement
at all after Universal issued a takedown
notice after a woman uploaded a
30-second clip of her kids dancing to a
print song meaning it may be the case
soon where major companies have to
actually think before just flagging
everything they can we've also seen the
proliferation of sites that use things
like Creative Commons licenses to allow
for free reuse of lots of different
types of content Wikipedia is a good
example of this and we've also seen the
end of heavy-handed lawsuits from
entertainment industry associations
against people who shared one or two
songs often unwittingly but even though
the powers that be seem to be trying to
make it a bit easier for folks who
really aren't intentionally doing
anything wrong do be careful about what
you share or hosts online and remember
not to buy Game of Thrones episodes on
USB sticks from that dude that hangs out
in the alley behind Arby's it's just
it's just not safe fresh books is on a
mission to make freelancers less
stressed and more organized through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
sending professional invoices in seconds

and you can even accept deposits from
those people through their platform so
you are paid on your schedule they also
have a tool to manage your expense
reports their mobile app lets you take a
picture of your receipts and it pretty
much handles the rest getting started on
fresh books is extremely simple even if
you're not a numbers person and they say
especially if you're not a numbers
person you can try fresh books for free
for 30 days by going to fresh books calm
