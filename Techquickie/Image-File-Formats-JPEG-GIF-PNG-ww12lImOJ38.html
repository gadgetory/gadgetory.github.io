favorite image editing program and your
masterpiece is ready for the art gallery
your web design portfolio or even 4chan
but when you go to save it you're
presented with this baffling array of
file format options hiss PNG BMP and
come on
why does Photoshop think you look like
you know what a JPEG is when all you
want is a picture of a got-dang hot dog
well the answer Hank Hills question JPEG
stands for a joint photographic experts
group and despite the fancy sounding
name you don't need to be an expert to
use it as it's an extremely common
format in the world of photo storage
JPEGs are popular for a number of
reasons but one of the biggest is that
they save a lot of storage space
compared to older formats like BMP which
used to be widely used due to a
simplicity and compatibility across
devices but has since fallen out of
favour now to achieve these space
savings JPEGs use what's called lossy
compression so when you save an image as
a JPEG some of that image data actually
gets discarded to reduce the file size
now the way that it does this is it
compares every 8 by 8 block of pixels
that make up the image a 64 standard
patterns then determines how much weight
each of those 64 patterns contributes to
that block afterwards the higher
frequency or more checkerboard light
patterns you see to the lower right have
their respective ways forward by an
amount that depends on the JPEG quality
setting as your eyes aren't really all
that good as seeing lots of brightness
differences over a small area
this means that often times these higher
frequency patterns end up contributing
nothing to the compressed image which is
the main way JPEG compression can reduce
photos down to just around 10% of their
uncompressed file size with very little
loss of perceptible quality but there's
a catch JPEG compression works best with
photos because the detail in the photo
tends to hide compression artifacts JPEG
struggles with sharp edges and curves
you often find in non photographic
images such as diagrams or design
elements on webpages for these a much
better format is the graphics
interchange format commonly known as a
gif or Jif well however you pronounce it
gifts use lossless compression making
them ideal for simpler images like
corporate logos because you won't end up
with any of those nasty artifacts that
are easier to see in a clean simple
design gifts can also vary notably even
be animated by showing multiple images
in rapid succession but their huge
drawback is that they're only limited to
256 colors meaning they often appear
grainy when used for more complex images
so then if you want no loss in image
quality without the huge file sizes what
do you do well this is where you might
turn to the increasingly popular PNG
format which stands for portable Network
graphics now as the name suggests it was
designed to be useful for sending images
over the internet now PNG s can reduce
the file sizes of graphics heavy images
without introducing compression
artifacts the way JPEG and gif can
though the lossless compression means
your file sizes will be larger so keep
this trade-off in mind but it's not all
about image quality versus file size PNG
also supports transparency meaning
images and web browsers can understand
that certain areas of the image are
meant to be transparent allowing more
flexibility in how the image is used of
course there are times when image
quality is of paramount importance and
your honor is concerned about file sizes
such as in professional photography
settings where kist is a popular format
now all those tips can use compression
it also supports uncompressed images as
well as many different color spaces and
other options making it popular among
photographers and printers it's also
increasingly common to run across images
in the scalable vector graphics or SVG
format which can be resized as much as
you like with no loss in quality meaning
file sizes are usually very small and
you can learn much more about vector
graphics right up here and there's
actually one important format that isn't
really a format at all raw images which
are also sometimes referred to as
digital negatives now just like a
negative from an old 35 millimeter film
camera a raw file isn't an actual
picture but it contains the information
needed to create one so it's a very
lightly
process file that contains as much of
the original information captured by the
camera sensor itself as possible RAW
files typically require special codecs
to open them on a desktop image as er
but RAW images are favored by
photographers because having all of that
original data opens up so many more
editing options such as more granular
control over brightness and colors than
would otherwise be possible now some raw
formats and they are not all the same
even allow things like white balance or
overexposure to be corrected after the
fact whoa
then after editing RAW images can just
be saved as whatever format makes the
most sense so I hope this video has made
it a bit clearer why there are so many
different formats for something that
seems as simple as displaying images and
if it has let us know if you'd like to
see future episodes that explain other
kinds of file formats for things like
audio and video tunnel Bayer VPN lets
you tell to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the internet and
use all online services as if you were
in a different country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and also a Chrome extension just
choose a country the app turn tunnel
bear on and one since you're a bear
tunnels your internet connection to your
new location when you turn tunnel bear
on two things happen first your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and second your
public IP address gets switched so you
can show up as your in a different
country total bear lets you bypass all
of the annoying details that typically
come with using a VPN for personal use
there's no need to mess around with port
configurations DNS or any other router
settings for that matter cuddle bear
handles all that in the background they
also have a top rated privacy policy and
they do not log user activity and now
you can try out total bear VPN with 500
megabytes of free data with no credit
card required and if you choose to get a
year of unlimited data you can save 10%
by going to total bear calm slash Linus
so thanks for watching guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment with
your suggestions for future videos and
check out their other channels they're
always doing something wild and crazy
over on channel super fun whatever is
playing above my face right now I'm sure
that looks just fantastically
entertaining so
go check that out and we'll see you guys
