the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos I don't
know about you guys but my parents were
always yelling at me about singing too
close to the TV they block up my glasses
blah blah blind blah blah go outside and
play with your friends
ma you know I don't have any friends why
do you keep bringing it up anyway back
on topic is there truly a correct
distance to sit from your screen well
let's start with unpacking the claim
that sitting too close to the TV is bad
for your health
well as it turns out this widespread
belief may have originated from a
legitimate concern over a TV recall in
the 1960s where a certain line of
defective televisions actually did emit
a significant amount of x-ray radiation
that is bad for your eyes and everything
else but given there haven't been any
reports of this problem since then why
are people still concerned about it
well I strain is something that you've
probably experienced after focusing on
anything for a long enough period of
time even books or magazines this
happens because the muscles attached to
your eyes tense up to help them focus so
just like any other muscle if you
tighten them up for long enough they
start to ache and there is some truth to
this effect being stronger with a
backlit source if your eyes need to be
constantly adjusting between the
brightness of your screen and the
sharply contrasting darkness of your
room you'll experience this eye strain
fatigue more quickly there is good news
though you can slow down the effects by
blinking more frequently to moisturize
your eyes glancing away from your book
or monitor periodically and by using a
moderate brightness that's not too
dissimilar to the brightness of your
surroundings that and eyestrain is
easily relieved and doesn't cause any
long-term problems as far as we know
just rest your eyes for a while by
moving to a dark environment or relaxing
them by not focusing on anything too
intently with
said we still don't recommend sitting
too close to your screen not because
it'll hurt you but because it'll hurt
your viewing experience as we explained
in our video on retina displays which
you can check out up here the correct
distance to sit from your screen is at
least far enough where you can't make
out individual pixels that will make the
image look blocky and distorted so if
you're in the market for a new display
there's a simple way that you can figure
out what size you should buy for a 1080p
display figure out how far you'll be
sitting from the screen and divide the
distance by about one point six to get
the size of the largest TV or monitor
you should purchase you may even want to
get something slightly smaller to be on
the safe side with respects to image
quality but there's no reason to get
something much smaller than the formula
recommends as for 4k displays the pixels
are much smaller so you can get away
with buying a larger screen especially
as that will make it easier to see
details that the higher resolution makes
possible so for 4k your display size
should be about the same as your viewing
distance or just slightly smaller and
that's it once you've done some simple
math purchased the right display oh and
maybe installed some biased lighting
which we covered here behind the display
to improve contrast and reduce eyestrain
even further you're all set to sit on
your butt and stare at tech quickie for
as long as you want we won't tell your
mom today's episode is brought to you by
random facts about bears did you know
that when bears hibernate they actually
don't have to go to the bathroom any
waste material is converted into protein
which is weird and gross
our next bear fact comes from a hunting
story involving u.s. President Theodore
Roosevelt the story goes that President
Roosevelt was hunting bears when his
party saw a wounded black bear cub Teddy
ordered a merciful death for the cub and
the story was memorialized in a
political cartoon in the Washington Post
seizing an opportunity a New York toy
store owner started manufacturing teddy
bears and the name stuck because they've
just like taken to a vet that actually
seems like it would
a lot more humane anyway the Malayan
Sunbear is also known as the honey bear
because honey combs and bee larvae make
up such a large part of its diet hmm bee
larvae anyway you can get your very own
free bear over at Tunnel Bear comm slash
Linus we've got that linked below
it's a VPN software so thanks for
watching guys like dislike leave a
