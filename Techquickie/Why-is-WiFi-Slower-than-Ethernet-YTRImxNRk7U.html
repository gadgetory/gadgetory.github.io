this you just wired your desktop PC up
to some uber fast internet connection
which is like super exciting because
surely this will be no more legging out
of your favorite games or thrilling
skype dates then eager to experience
this kind of speed on your laptop or
mobile device you buy a fancy looking
Wi-Fi router you key in your password
your speeds aren't even half of what
you're getting with the wired connection
what gives well unfortunately Wireless
is pretty much always gonna be slower
than Wired it's a near universal truth
that becomes more and more obvious the
faster you try to go even if you spend
tons of money on high-end wireless gear
but then okay bear with me here because
iam waves do move faster through the air
then electrons do through a wire so why
is it well let's start with the most
obvious signal range if you're using an
Ethernet cable and you want gigabit
speeds you can have a cable run of up to
a hundred meters that's roughly as long
as a football field this is because the
signal inside the cable doesn't
deteriorate appreciably until you have a
longer cable run but radio signals
flying through the air such as Wi-Fi are
much more prone to signal degradation
unlike a physical cable which has a
copper wire inside that only carries
network traffic and is wrapped up in
materials to shield the signal for
interference Wi-Fi signals are just
blasted everywhere meaning they have to
compete with walls your roommates
microwave and other network traffic you
see unlike Ethernet where your device
gets one dedicated pipe that runs to
your modem or your router there's only
so much spectrum available for your
Wi-Fi enabled laptop and your phone and
anything else and what that means is
that your device will often be
broadcasting on the same frequency or
channel as others which can lead to more
interference that can further degrade
the signal and give your router more
work to do to sort it all out
but okay hold on a second Linus you can
hook up lots of wired devices to a
router as well so doesn't your router
have to figure out where all those
different signals are supposed to go yes
but Wi-Fi and Ethernet have different
strategies to combat packet loss which
is exactly what it sounds like when a
chunk or a packet of data doesn't reach
its destination oftentimes this can
occur due to a collision when two
devices try to transmit it it precisely
the same time and if this happens the
packets have to be resent so the way
that an Ethernet connection avoids
collisions is that once the sender
determines that its path to the
destination is clear it sends the packet
immediately if the path is busy the
sender will send the data as soon as the
path is clear again Wi-Fi on the other
hand introduces a small delay once the
path becomes clear the idea is that
since a wireless router can't magically
detect a collision in midair
this delay reduces the risk of
collisions but as it does so it also
adds more latency and although many
leaps and Wi-Fi technology have been
made over the years it still resembles
much older school communications
protocols in one important way it is
half duplex meaning that a Wi-Fi gadgets
antenna can only be sending or receiving
at any given moment not both now full
duplex wireless is in the works but it's
still experimental and suffers from its
own special kind of interference that
results from the antenna trying to deal
with both inbound and outbound signals
at the same time by contrast Ethernet
has been full duplex for quite some time
now as it's not difficult to simply put
one wire in for transmitting data and
another one for receiving it on the same
cable so all other things being equal
don't be surprised if your Wi-Fi
connection always seems just a bit
slower even if you do walk around with
your smartphone neurotically duct-taped
directly to a router
please please go faster speaking of
going faster if you're a freelancer or
small business owner and you want to get
your work done faster
check out fresh books fresh books is the
cloud accounting software that's design
for the way you want to work and it's
