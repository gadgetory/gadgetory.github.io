need a a but seriously guys I'm not
talking about Alcoholics Anonymous I'm
talking about anti-aliasing which refers
to the technology that removes jaggies
or the staircase effect from your video
games in real time making them appear
smoother so where the heck dude jaggies
come from well the images on your
computer screen are made up of tiny
squares called pixels whereas real
objects have rounded corners so what
happens is when you take a bunch of
squares and line them up you end up with
a nice straight line that looks perfect
but then what happens if you try to draw
a diagonal line that's where the squares
end up corner to corner and you end up
with that staircase effect that looks
quite unappealing now there are a wide
variety of different kinds of
anti-aliasing the most basic being msaa
or multisample anti-aliasing and some
more advanced newer ones like fxaa which
is a faster more approximate style of
anti-aliasing from Nvidia
but they all work in fundamentally the
same way that is to say that they take
the missing data in that line and they
go okay well there's there's a gap here
but we're going to take samples all
around it and try to fill in the
approximate data that should be there in
order to make the image look more
pleasing to the user I call
anti-aliasing fake resolution you're
always better off to increase the
resolution to get a more clear image
hence something like Apple's Retina
display where rather than using
anti-aliasing tricks they actually are
just squeezing more pixels in to the
point where you're I can't even tell
that it's a square block anymore but if
you don't have that option anti-aliasing
is a way of making it look smoother and
higher resolution without actually
upgrading the display device that you're
using thank you for checking out this
explanation on tech wiki for anti
aliasing and as always don't forget to
share the video don't forget to like the
video and don't forget to subscribe for
more fast as possible topics just like
