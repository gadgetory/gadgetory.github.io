favorite kind of bar ice cream power
singles well if you're suffering from
tinny
unsatisfying audio from your expensive
new TV a sound bar might be the friend
you never knew you need it but why are
they suddenly in vogue now well there
actually is a reason that TV speakers
these days sounds so flat in a week back
when we were all using large heavy CRTs
the additional space inside the chassis
allowed manufacturers to build in bigger
more powerful speakers and the simple
fact is that richer sounds especially in
the Boush range need physical space as
well as large enough drivers to be
reproduced correctly but times have
changed and the trend these days is for
TVs to keep getting thinner and sleeker
which is great for having more space to
walk around in your living room and
saving on your power bill but it's also
left no room for a decent pair of
speakers in most cases that was a pun so
sound bars and sound bases your TV
actually sits atop the ladder have
become very popular because unlike
traditional home theater kits which are
often bulky with complicated set up
procedures involving a bunch of messy
wires most consumer sound bars are meant
to be more or less self-contained units
that don't take up a ton of space but
still contain larger speakers that can
reproduce sound more faithfully than the
tiny ones built into your TV and the
growing market for sound bars has driven
a lot of innovation in the space
nowadays they aren't just strictly
replacements for stereo TV speakers and
many some bars have built-in subwoofers
an additional driver to enable center
channel or even multiple additional
drivers to enable virtual surround sound
which you can learn about more right up
here in fact the fanciest sound bars
include upward firing drivers and can
even simulate speakers on your ceiling
for next gen object-based sound
implementations like Dolby Atmos this is
often indicated as a third number in the
sambars channel description so that's
pretty cool than I guess but what else
should you consider once you've decided
whether you
the simple stereo sound bar or something
that will make your living room sound
like a cinema that partially depends on
the size of your room larger sound bars
might be able to fill a larger space but
make sure you check on this before you
buy as some larger sound bars don't
actually dedicate more space to drivers
and are just longer mostly empty cha
sees without much substance under the
hood like Michael Bay movies
I'll not note if action flicks are your
thing check to make sure your sound bar
supports the audio formats you'd like to
use if you want to use it for
high-quality lossless audio from
something like a blu-ray player it needs
to be certified for those formats and
have HDMI inputs instead of optical only
as optical connections don't have the
bandwidth for your fancier standards
like DTS master audio and the after
mentioned that'll be at most with all of
us said if you really want to faithfully
reproduce sound it is true that many AV
enthusiasts prefer a traditional setup
with a receiver and amplifier and
speakers even the highest end sound bars
often struggled to reproduce the most
accurate positional sound the way
speakers can and while some models of
sound bars allow you to connect two
separate subwoofer even wireless
satellite speakers most are tightly
integrated with non upgradeable
components so think about whether
simplicity or performance are worth more
do in the long run so you can make a
sound investment
and speaking of sound investments
