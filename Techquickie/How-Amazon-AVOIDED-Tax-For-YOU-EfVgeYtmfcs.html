noticed lately that shopping online has
gotten a little bit more expensive and
this is not to help Jeff Bezos pay his
alimony losing anyway if you were to
look closely at the bill for that 18
pack of toilet paper you just bought you
might notice that you're now being
charged sales tax something that's
becoming more and more common around the
United States on purchases made online
but then again I mean it's 2019 like why
is this happening now and if you guys
are watching from a different part of
the world you're probably really
confused because like what Americans
could shop online without paying tax no
fair and yeah to quite a significant
extent they could you see in the US
sales taxes are collected by the
individual states themselves not by the
federal government so that means that if
you're an online retailer you get
subjected to this large hodgepodge of
laws about whether or not you have to
charge your customers tax depending on
what state they're from and unlike
places such as Europe where all online
purchases have had value-added tax or
VAT slapped on them for a long time the
law in the US was that individual states
couldn't require businesses to collect
sales tax unless they had a physical
presence inside the state you know
something like a retail store this rule
actually came out of a federal court
case from 1992 that didn't even involve
the internet rather the controversy was
over a company using a mail-order
catalogue to ship floppy discs to North
Dakota anyway the idea was that if a
state could force far away retailers to
collect sales tax it would be too much
of a hindrance to interstate commerce
possibly making it hard for folks to
order cheap perfume off of daytime
shopping networks so this was the law
that Americans lived under for a long
time and for online shoppers it was
pretty freaking sweet since if their
favorite online store didn't have enough
of a physical presence inside their
state they could shop tax-free
now state governments were
to this and a number of them asked their
citizens to voluntarily report otherwise
tax-free online purchases and pay a use
tax but haha you can guess how much luck
they had with that now of course many of
you Americans have been paying tax on
online shopping for a while now
regardless as more and more digital
retailers have expanded their physical
operations into more States but last
year a new Supreme Court case ironically
involving the other Dakota this time
changed the legal situation completely
the current Supreme Court ruled that
because so much of the nation's Commerce
is now online the old physical presence
rule just doesn't make sense anymore
and so the court allowed states to
charge tax with far fewer restrictions
on sales and as state governments rarely
turn down opportunities for easy money
most of them are now forcing online
retailers to collect and then fork over
this sales tax the states can do this as
long as the company is selling a certain
dollar amount worth of merchandise or
selling to a certain number of customers
within their state so that they're not
running afoul of that pesky old
Constitution but let's say that you
really don't want to get charged an
extra 70 bucks for that thousand dollar
TV you're planning to buy is there any
way around the new laws actually yes
there is move to one of the five states
that just don't have a sales tax like
