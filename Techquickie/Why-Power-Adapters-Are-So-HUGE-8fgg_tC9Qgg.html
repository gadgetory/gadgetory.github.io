is to make gadgets smaller lighter and
more portable I mean we even have
smartwatches because we decided that
checking your already pocket-sized phone
when you get a text was simply too much
work but there's one rather fat fly in
the ointment when it comes to
portability those huge power bricks that
still accompany many of our electronic
devices now many of them have gotten a
fair bit smaller since the days of the
original Xbox 360 AC adapter like I'm
sure you could use that thing as a
murder weapon but the question remains
as to why we need them at all even those
relatively small wall Wars for mobile
phones can still be inconvenient due to
how much they stick out of the wall or
how they can block other outlets well
the basic reason for these clunky boxes
is that our modern electronics cannot
use the raw AC power that comes directly
from the wall instead it has to be
converted to direct current or DC you
can learn more about the differences
between AC and DC right up here but the
important thing to know is that unlike
DC an AC power uses a current that is
constantly switching direction so
because the transistors that lie at the
heart of contemporary electronics need
the current to flow one way only in
order to work properly they need extra
equipment to convert or rectify AC power
into one-way DC this is why simpler
electrical devices like a desk lamp work
just fine without a space hogging
adapter but that doesn't explain why
they need to be so big and why they
can't just be built into our electronics
well as it turns out a fair bit of
equipment is actually needed for this
simple AC to DC conversion now back in
the day many electronics used linear
adapters which could turn the 110 or 220
volts from the wall into a specific
smaller voltage that the electronics
needed but their drawback was that they
gave off a great deal of waste heat I
mean I guess that's no problem when the
number of people on your city's power
grid is measured
thousands but in the modern world the
more efficiently that we can perform
these operations the better also all
that waste heat would have been really
bad to have inside the same chassis as a
bunch of sensitive electronic components
so nowadays most power bricks are
switching adapters which means that they
themselves use fancier electronics to
switch voltages and current depending on
what exactly is coming out of the wall
and what the device
specifically needs not only does this
allow your electronics to work in
countries with different voltages as
long as you've got a simple plug adapter
it's also a lot more efficient than the
older linear power bricks which is why
some devices do have integrated power
supplies like some monitors with that
said switching adapters still give off a
fair bit of heat because they aren't
nearly 100% efficient and the
electronics inside them can create
interference meaning that it can be
helpful to separate the adapter itself
from whatever it's trying to power if
it's susceptible to that kind of
interference on top of that they often
include RF shielding which can add still
more weight and bulk making matters
worse even though modern electronics
tend to be a lot more efficient than
what we had a couple of decades ago some
gadgets still do need lots of power and
generally speaking the more power device
needs the larger its adapter will be as
larger components and wires are needed
to safely carry the additional current
the thinner smaller components just have
too much resistance and can't handle all
of that juice this is also part of the
reason that internal power supplies for
desktop PCs which can consume hundreds
or even over a thousand watts are bulky
and heavy with often large cooling fans
in them back to our mobile electronics
for a moment though these two have a lot
going on but in a much smaller space and
building power delivery directly into
something like a phone or a gaming
laptop would not only add undesirable
bulk but possibly make the whole system
too hot to function
and increase the price of replacing the
power adapter in the event of a failure
so the good news is that while we won't
be getting rid of them outright anytime
soon as electronics continue to get more
efficient with processors becoming more
powerful while simultaneously needing
less energy AC adapters should generally
keep shrinking or at least stay smaller
and lighter than they used to be good
thing too because I never have enough
room in my suitcase
speaking of room in your suitcase I'm
sure you could make some room for mass
drops sennheiser HD 6 XX headphones
these things sound fantastic and they
are one of mass drops all-time
bestsellers with over 50,000 units sold
and no wonder they've got an unchanged
driver and sound structure compared to
the HD 650 s which are a modern classic
delivering balanced mid-range and
natural sounding bass and they've got a
couple of improvements including a
detachable six-foot cable instead of a
ten-foot cable so you don't have quite
as much wire to manage it comes with an
eighth inch plug that's versatile for
everyday use and a quarter inch adapter
and includes Sennheiser's long-term
support so check out the link below to
join the drop today so thanks for
watching guys like dislike check out our
other videos if you have a comment
please do leave one especially if you
have a suggestion for a future video
you'd like to see covered and don't
forget to subscribe and follow so you
never miss a tech quickie never not even
once not even if you were like you had
food poisoning and you were throwing up
you'd be like you'd be there on your
phone
that sounds very awful maybe don't throw
