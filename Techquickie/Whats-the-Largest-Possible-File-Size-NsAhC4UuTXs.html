one of our younger viewers you may not
remember a time before a hundred and
twenty gigabyte hard drives were the
bare minimum but others of you may
actually recall the days where two gigs
was an extravagant luxury these days
though it isn't uncommon to see multi
terabyte drives in even mid-range
computers due to the exploding file
sizes from ever more elaborate PC games
and 4k movies I mean a single to our 4k
film on blu-ray can take up around 45
gigabytes of space which got us thinking
exactly how big could one single file
get is there a hard limit is it bound
only by the capacity of your storage
medium I mean could you theoretically
sit there and watch every movie TV show
and cat video ever made packed into one
mp4 file provided you had a hard drive
and bucket of popcorn large enough well
as it turns out the answer is
complicated there is actually a crucial
limiting factor to file sizes your
storage devices file system and you can
learn more about that up here but simply
put a file system is the scheme that
your hard drive SSD or memory card uses
to organize and keep track of your files
and one thing that most modern file
systems do is keep records of how large
each file is both so that the user can
manage his or her disk space and so the
computer can keep track of how much
space is being used in different
physical parts of the drive these size
values are stored as either a 32-bit or
a 64-bit value so older operating
systems like Windows 98 often used 30
two-bit file systems fat32 was the most
common on home pcs in the late 90s and
actually still persists in some
applications today but unfortunately the
highest value you can express in 32 bits
is a little over 4.2 billion meaning
that the file size limit on many desktop
computers used to be four point two
gigabytes which is less than a full
single layer DVD so that clearly
wouldn't cut it these days
but ever since Windows XP Microsoft has
switched over its home operating systems
to the NTFS file system which supports
64-bit file sizes something that would
have caused slowdowns due to file system
overhead on older pcs so nowadays the
theoretical limit for a single NTFS file
is over 18 exabytes enough to hold 400
million of those 4k movies that I
mentioned earlier though good luck
finding a drive that large and anyway as
with many other theoretical maximums the
real-life limit is actually smaller
modern operating systems impose
additional limits on file sizes with
Windows 10 cutting you off at 17 and a
half terabytes I mean that is still
larger than any hard drive on the market
at the time we shot this episode but
years from now we may have to rethink
file systems yet again if they figure
out a way for us to dump our
consciousness onto a 100 exabyte DNA
