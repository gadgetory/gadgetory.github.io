wall of fire they might think of the
pyrotechnic seen on any first-rate metal
band stage but unfortunately firewall
protection services aren't quite as
awe-inspiring as all that that's not to
imply though that they aren't terribly
important or that none towns caused by
failing to ensure proper firewall
protections can't be as damaging as a
direct blast of a flamethrower firewalls
adopt their name and function directly
from physical structures that stand
between danger often fire and fragile
stuff like your face and computer
firewalls actually do bear some
similarity to their RL counterparts they
work to protect users and their
information not from thermal energy but
instead from the scum and villainy which
occupy the wretched hives of the open
Internet generally speaking there are
two layers of firewall protection which
operate in conjunction with both hard
and soft wear to carry out a given set
of rules hardware firewall solutions are
automatically built into the routers
that most of us are using today these
work by tagging all outgoing traffic
from a private network like the one in
our home with a specific network ID that
is then also attached to any
corresponding incoming traffic this
allows the router to determine the
origin of incoming packets blocking any
transfers which weren't initiated from
behind the firewall it also prevents
files from being downloaded without a
user's knowledge and stops first-step
intrusions known as ports can attacks
letting us feel safe that the update for
our favorite new game is what it says
and not some piece of spyware that will
constantly spam us with adverts for
pills that improve performance I'm not
sure where it got the idea I need those
problem software-based protections
function by monitoring the integrity of
flowing traffic processes through
variables such as incoming in
destination IP addresses transfer times
or download sizes and killing
connections that don't meet expectations
these are advantageous because they
monitor outgoing traffic as well as
incoming blocking programs such as IP
spoofing ones from attacking individual
machines once they've infiltrated a
network these are what allow us to
transfer files between our friends
without worrying that a third party has
attached something along the way or feel
safe
and constantly transferring packets
during things such as an online gaming
session knowing that any unapproved
packets will be detected by the firewall
in fact often times the large-scale data
thefts we hear about come as a result of
some entity which has gone and painted a
giant target on their back by not
implementing strong enough active
firewall protection allowing unwanted
information transfers to remain
disguised as authentic ones so while in
theory firewall protections work as
seamlessly as their physical
predecessors in practice these types of
solutions can require a little bit more
attention than your average wall made of
brick pretty well anyone who has ever
installed a new game or component has
run into that annoying Windows prompt
asking them if they're really sure they
wish to connect and update the software
which won't even be enough if your
router doesn't automatically get
configured in the process and they can
be used for things like Regional
Information censorship as well but while
they're not all good news no matter how
arbitrary a warning message might seem
or how annoying its accompanying beep is
these grievances are nothing compared to
the sound your customers and partners
will make when all of their credit cards
and other information has been stolen
why do they put that logo behind me
speaking of logos let's swap that out
fractal josh has decided to mercifully
spare me this week all I have to do this
time is tell you guys about their sleek
clean Scandinavian design their
excellent cases power supplies and
cooling products and how you can check
those out at fractal - design comm
that's all I have to say but actually
there's another thing I have to say that
was a total lie he's put me through a
lot over the last 10 months and
apparently there's going to be a clip
show or something like that so it's not
actually really any less embarrassing if
I don't have to do those things again if
I'm showing them to you guys again but
don't worry too much about that
the point is josh wants you to let
fractal design know what you thought of
this whole humiliate linus promotion on
their Facebook page they should they
bring these spots back what do you want
to see from them in the future
so that's pretty much it there's a link
in the video description thanks for
watching this episode of fast as
possible guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you thought it
stunk leave and comment under the video
if you have suggestions for future
episodes and as always don't forget to
