miss placing stuff I do personally
whether they can't find their keys in
the morning they leave a clothes
everywhere like my sweaters they don't
even know where that stack of $100 bills
is that they want to casino okay
honestly I've never done that but
anyways could you imagine if your
computer was that forgetful and never
remembered where you put stuff like
savegames
important papers or tax documents or
your operating system
fortunately all computers use some kind
of file system so it can keep track of
where all your stuff is just like how
you might use a closet space or cabinets
at home to keep your collection of
random clothes and kitchen items from
being a complete mess so how do they do
that
well there are many different types of
systems out there but what they all have
in common is that they divide up your
hard drive SSD or flash drive into small
units that store data and have some kind
of way of remembering what data is in
each unit so it can go and find it later
on to better understand how this works
and to figure out what system to use for
your own stuff let's have a look at some
common file system starting off with
file allocation table or fat and
although it's name is incredibly
unflattering that was used by the vast
majority of home windows-based pcs until
XP came out that worked by splitting the
disk into a bunch of clusters giving
each cluster a unique ID number then
using a table to track what part of what
was stored in each cluster alright
pretty straightforward and simple no big
deal there but as hard drives became
larger and larger fat ran into some
problems namely it resulted in a lot of
wasted space because it often couldn't
fill clusters completely a problem
called slack and could only support
drives that were kind of smaller to the
way that fat stored information about
file locations fat32 which came to
prominence with Windows 98 was an
improvement but still couldn't deal with
partitions larger than two terabytes
which isn't that big these days to
overcome these limitations every version
of Windows since XP + NT 3.1 on the
business side of things has used the
only slightly less awkwardly named new
technology file system or
NTFS NTFS uses some space management
tricks to make it use space much more
efficiently than fat resulting in better
real-world capacity in many cases and
can support massive partitions of
hundreds of terabytes as well as huge
individuals file sizes important in the
age of 4k videos that can span multiple
hours making the massive it also has
features to help prevent data loss in
the event of a crash native file
compression and security features
including native file encryption support
to keep out unauthorized users these
features have made NTFS an almost
universal choice for windows-based pcs
these days but just like it's hard to
get rid of those last 10 pounds of fat
at the gym fat the file system hasn't
completely gone away fat32 is still
commonly used on USB flash drives to
maintain compatibility with older
versions of Windows as well as operating
systems such as Linux and speaking of
flash drives there's a new version of
that called exFAT which is surprisingly
not the name of a line of diet
supplements exFAT was designed
specifically with high capacity flash
drives and memory cards in mind and
support much larger capacities and file
sizes than older versions of fat
well not including features of NTFS that
flash drives don't really need in order
to keep things running quickly
exFAT isn't always compatible with some
quite a bit older versions of Windows
though so keep that in mind when
choosing what you're going to use for
your flash drive if you for some reason
are still using like unpatched versions
of XP the good thing though is that it's
pretty easy to switch file systems on
your flash drive by just doing a quick
reformat after you've saved your file
somewhere else of course I don't want to
be responsible for that but no matter
what you choose you can bet that your
drives will keep track of your data
better than your roommate who is always
asking you where the TV remote is are
you ready for a line of style segue I
got this one I got this one speaking of
keeping track of things keep track of
