each of Apple's App Store and the Google
Play Store smartphones have grown to
become far more versatile than when they
first burst onto the scene about a
decade ago and now that trend is
evolving into a greater selection of
smartphone attachments from miniature
projectors to infrared cameras so maybe
then it shouldn't be too surprising that
actual molecular scanners for
smartphones are making their way to an
iPhone near you but what the heck is a
molecular scanner is it like one of
those tricorder things that mr. data
used in Star Trek well actually yes
just as the fictional tricorder could
give the crew of the enterprise useful
information about their surroundings
real-life molecular scanners analyze the
chemical makeup of objects without the
need for uber expensive lab equipment or
restraining orders UC chemicals with a
different molecular structure absorbs
and reflect light in different ways due
to electrons in those molecules existing
in different energy states it's been a
long time since you took highschool
chemistry and you forgot all this stuff
but gist of it is that a handheld
molecular scanner fires a light beam in
the near infrared spectrum which is used
because it's higher frequency can
penetrate further into objects then
lower energy far infrared or radio waves
once the infrared light hits the object
you want to scan that object will absorb
certain wavelengths of light more
strongly than others based on its
chemical makeup the light that's
reflected back to the center is then
analyzed to create what's essentially a
chemical fingerprint based on how
strongly or weakly each wavelength of
light is reflected this kind of scanning
more formally called near-infrared
spectroscopy or
NIRS is used for tons of cool
applications in medicine NIRS can
analyze everything from oxygen
saturation in blood in patients with
cardiac issues to brain activity by
determining hemoglobin concentrations in
the brain all without the need to slice
anybody open but if you're not a doctor
and you're interested in getting your
hands on the smartphone model I
mentioned in the beginning consumer
physics has come out with a personal
molecular scanner called Scio which
mimics some of the industrial
applications of NIRS such as analyzing
agricultural products and
pharmaceuticals but what does this mean
for you well consumer physics is
pitching more everyday uses for the
style as well like scanning food and
having nutritional information pop up on
your screen
since supermarkets typically don't stick
calorie labels on ribeye steaks or
avocados or if you want to take the nirs
for nutrition angle a bit further you
could point this gadget at yourself and
it would give you a body fat percentage
so you can feel proud or hate yourself
accordingly they've also announced that
there will be support for drug
identification right out of the box and
no not those kinds of drugs so don't
expect the cops to carry them around
right away it's designed more for
over-the-counter and prescription
medicines so you can tell exactly what's
in them so since there are also features
for developers you might be able to test
other objects for authenticity in the
future if this particular product takes
off we might see more consumer molecular
scanners from other companies
hopefully for less than consumer physics
is current 300 US dollar
asking price but do keep in mind that
nirs isn't meant to be a super high
precision method of chemical analysis it
sacrifices some degree of accuracy for
speed and ease of use and while this
probably won't
matter much to general consumers it
means that I wouldn't bring it into the
lab and take its readings as gospel if
you're preparing your PhD dissertation
in chemistry tunnel Bayer makes browsing
the internet safer and more secure it
lets you tunnel to up to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services like
video streamers as though you are in a
different country region locks they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and they have a Chrome extension as
well it's super easy to use you either
just download the app or you go to the
tunnel Bayer website which we have
linked in the video description and
it'll actually start downloading
automatically you install it and you
select a country and press on that's it
no complicated nonsense your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and your public IP address
gets switched to whatever country that
you selected the best thing about tunnel
there is that you can try it for free
they throw in 500 Meg's of data with no
credit card required even and you can
kind of go oh yeah gee this is amazing
not to mention that they have a
top-rated privacy policy and don't log
user activity and then once you're like
yeah this is great just head over to the
link in the video description that's
tunnel bear comm slash Linus and you can
get 10% off and unlimited data plan so
thanks for watching guys like this like
check out our other channels or leave a
comment if you have suggestions for
future fast as possible videos or just
as a troll for a John just be like John
your rosy cheeks they make me so hot if
everybody does it'll be very funny
because he does read the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
