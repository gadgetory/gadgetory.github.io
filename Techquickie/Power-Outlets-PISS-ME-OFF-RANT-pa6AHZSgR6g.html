whenever I go overseas I have to carry
around this bulky looking adapter for
all my gadgets and that is assuming of
course that I can even get it into my
overstuffed bag lest I have to pay
another outrageous amount of money to
heaven forbid check a bag with the
airline and you know speaking of
Airlines how exactly is it that we as a
society have figured out a way to safely
get thousands of flights to their
destinations every day even between
countries where the air traffic
controllers don't speak the same native
language yet we haven't figured out a
way to get everyone using the same type
of power plug and yes I know about the
voltage differences worldwide with large
parts of the americas operating on 110
volts while much of the rest of the
globe uses between 220 and 240 but
that's a rant for another day and
besides there is absolutely no reason
that these prongs that we use here in
Canada couldn't carry a 200 something
volt potential and did you know by the
way that this same style of North
American plug first appeared all the way
back in 1912 that means the world has
had at least a hundred years to get on
the same page about this it's pathetic
but you know hang on a minute because
now that I think about it this style of
plug actually kind of sucks I mean aside
from them being super easy to plug in
the wrong way and frustrating users way
before USB ever did have you ever
inserted a plug only partway and then
got in a really nasty shock when you
accidentally touch the prong
well I have and let me tell you it's
about as much fun as a soft kick to the
privates well I guess I wasn't the first
person to notice that as electrical
power for homes surged in popularity
long before there was any kind of
serious international effort to
coordinate how it was delivered so
countries mostly developed their own
outlet standards separately and some of
them even intentionally deviated from
the North American style in favor of
safer designs with less exposed metal I
mean the thing is all you really need
for a working outlet is a couple
of sticks of something conductive and
then maybe a third prong for safety
reasons so it doesn't really matter what
shape they are or what kind of emotion
the outlet on the other end ends up
conveying so everyone just kind of said
you know what who cares just make it
work and we ended up with this whole
mess of different plug standards that we
have today I mean sure I get that when
all of this happened no one was taking
lightweight laptops and electric razors
across the Atlantic all the time but
like please won't someone think of the
future generations of children I mean in
fairness right around the time the
world's electricity usage was starting
to ramp up and different nations might
have come together harmoniously holding
hands to figure out this plug issue some
jackass named Adolf Hitler was busy
trying to conquer the globe so the
international community was a bit more
worried about stopping him than getting
a record player that someone bought in
New York to work over in London
speaking of London did you know that the
Brits hastily developed a new plug
standard that nobody else was using in
their effort to put their country back
together quickly after the Blitz that's
part of why gadgets from England need an
adapter as soon as you get to the other
side of the channel but it's 2019
and there aren't any world Wars going on
and even the Cold War is a distant
memory so why can't we go ahead and
agree on one plug and one outlet
standard I mean is it seriously just
because it would be too much of a hassle
to retrofit everything and it's much
easier to just use them an adapter okay
yeah I guess that's exactly the reason
well until we figure out totally
wireless energy transfer I guess I'll
just charge everything before I get off
the plane with those fancy International
Chargers they have on the back of the
seat or maybe I'll just start going to
the United States for all my vacations I
hear in Europe some places it is
actually illegal to offer free soda
refills did you know that cuz I didn't
it's making of refills if you've ever
been in the need for a quick refill for
your b-roll After Effects templates or
motion backgrounds checkout story blocks
we use story blocks all the time here on
tech wiki and it has really
simplified our workflow stock video
clips are easy to find and you can
download as many as you want at a low
cost to test them out in your project
whether it's a YouTube video or a video
background for your website so instead
of letting your creative needs take a
backseat due to budget constraints or
scrambling because a client made a
last-minute change use story blocks is
affordable high quality footage instead
of like doing to try and find someone to
go out and shoot it for you we're gonna
have a link to story blocks right now in
the video description go check it out so
thanks for watching guys like dislike
check out our other videos and don't
forget to leave a comment if you have a
future fast as possible
idea forgot what I was gonna say but
that's okay because we all forget things
