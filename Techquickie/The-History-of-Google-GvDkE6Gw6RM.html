always been worth a sensible chuckle
before being named after a misspelling
of a really large number it was a
research project called backrub and
although it wasn't the first search
engine by any means it worked in a
fundamentally different way than most of
the other options out there including
backrubs entire lack of a friendly
Butler that would fetch search results
for you most early search engines gave
you results based on how many times
words you searched in a string appeared
on a page so if you typed Linus instead
of articles about Linus Torvalds Linus
from peanuts or Linus tech tips you
might instead see some random fanfic
with a main character named Linus along
with some other guy named Luke or
something yeah anyways backrub rank two
search results based on how many times
other pages linked to them using a
system called PageRank
the idea was that a page that had lots
of other pages linking to it was more
important and more likely to be what
people were searching for
and although Google's current algorithm
has grown to be much more comprehensive
PageRank back then was such an
innovation that it gave Google a massive
edge over its competitors that spurred
its rapid growth in the late 1990s and
early 2000s forcing it to quickly move
from its original homes of Stanford
University servers and kaliesha incoming
a garage in a Silicon Valley house
Google's popularity was also boosted by
its clean simple layout
remember how cluttered and add filled
other web portals of the time were now
don't get me wrong Google did sell ads
but they're unobtrusive nough stood a
great deal to keep them popular and they
made lots of money by targeting the ads
based on what users were actually
searching something that took its
competitors longer to catch up on back
in 2002 Google started making its first
real forays into products besides
standard web search such as Google
shopping and Google Books
then a couple years later than now near
ubiquitous Gmail showed up on April
freakin Fool's Day of 2004 which led
many people to believe that it was a
joke at first I mean a gig of web
storage for free back then
that was crazy and since it was invite
only to start accounts for highly
coveted leading it to become hugely
popular when it released to everyone so
maybe it's no huge coincidence that
Google went public later that year
making some longtime Googlers very
wealthy
shortly after Google's initial public
offering they rolled out a lot of
services that are now Google staples
Maps earth transit street view calendar
and the ever-present gchat all hit the
scene between 2005 and 2007 with Google
acquiring YouTube in 2006 and
introducing there faster than a potato
gun Google Chrome in 2008 which is the
world's most used browser today by a
large margin even though it's become a
little more bloated since then
Google's freely available Android OS
launched in 2008 which now has chrome
built in which is probably contributed
largely to that previous statistic made
Google a major player in the mobile
market leading to the more recent dive
into the world of hardware and I mean
other than that like Search Appliance
thing for businesses that they rolled
out back in 2001 I'm talking about the
2009 release of the Chromebook a low
cost line of laptops built around the
Chrome browser which you can learn more
about up here that was followed by Nexus
phones and tablets the next year 2009
and 2010 also saw Google's search
algorithm revamped to focus on adding
real time and recent content meaning
that Google could now be used not only
as a repository of existing information
but as a true source of current news
very timely considering the explosive
growth of devices with Google search
functionality baked in allowing people
to punch in a wider variety of queries
even current weather and sports scores
and still get relevant results so with
their own software and hardware now
nearly everywhere at this point
including their new pixel smartphones
which you can learn more about up here
Google is even dabbling in
infrastructure projects like Google
Fiber an internet service that's been
rolled out in 7 America
Metro areas since 2013 and with other
ongoing Google projects like driverless
cars and balloons that can provide
Internet access to underserved areas
Google's reach has amazed some but also
concerned others who worry they'll
become the real world by and large and
considering their absolute dominance of
the search and data mining business
their tax avoidance strategies that have
been described as ethically questionable
and their abandonment of the don't be
evil as a corporate slogan who knows all
I know is that I would definitely stick
to DuckDuckGo if you want to see how
many other people think Larry Page kind
of looks like a Bond villain for non
members of Dollar Shave Club if you join
today you will get your first month of
razors for free and if you continue on
after that they will continue to deliver
razors directly to your door in a timely
manner membership means that you can
shave with a fresh blade anytime that
you want you'll get a first-class shave
and use the executive blade without it
actually hurting your wallet which is
pretty cool and you can use it with dr.
Carver's shave butter which goes on
clear so you actually see where your
shaving if you care about your face not
looking like a complete mess which is
probably a good idea and they ship to
the US Canada and Australia so head over
to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and
give them a try for free alright guys if
you like that video like if you dislike
to dislike it get subscribed to a
channel superfund they're pretty cool in
the comments down below let me know what
kind of stuff you want to see on a tech
wiki in the future and I'm going to see
you next time goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
