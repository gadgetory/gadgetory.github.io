the time it takes to send and receive a
packet of data between two devices such
as computers on a network a simple
analogy would be to pretend that the two
computers are two people Dick and Jane
ping would be the amount of time it
takes dick to say something to Jane and
receive a response the lower the ping
time or latency between Dick and Jane
the more effectively they can
communicate as ping times increase the
time intervals between sending and
receiving messages will continue to
increase until the delays are so long
that their communication stops making
sense altogether low ping times are
extremely important in scenarios where
the timely delivery of information is
more important than the quantity of
information that can be delivered in an
online game where two players are
competing against each other for example
the game data things like player models
maps and textures is stored on the
individual PC or console of each
competitor in order to play against each
other the only information that needs to
be transferred back and forth between
the players is simple stuff like the
location bullet trajectory and updates
that are being made to objects on the
map such as buildings that have been
damaged or destroyed in contrast to
applications like games surfaces like
Netflix are not very dependent on low
ping times in these cases bandwidth or
the raw amount of data that can be
delivered per second is more important
to the quality of the experience the
reason for this is that data is only
being sent one way and large buffers or
chunks of the movie that are pre
downloaded on-the-fly
can mask many issues that would be
caused by an inconsistent or not very
low latency connection so in short you
can think of ping like the whatsapp or
Twitter of network communication compact
messages that are optimized for quick
communication and coordination between
devices in real time another major
contributor to your online experience is
jitter but that's a topic for another
video hopefully we'll be able to add a
link to it at some point here speaking
of Link's head over to audible.com slash
tech quickie to sign up for audibles
monthly audiobook service you get one
audiobook per month with the
subscription and it includes a free one
to get you started now why would you
want an audio
book you might ask well I would say you
might want a version of The Hobbit by
JRR tolkien without any extra characters
for example you can check that out at
audible.com slash tech quickie I hope
you do find a chance to do that in the
meantime guys thanks for watching share
this video if you enjoyed it like it if
you liked it leave a comment if you have
an opinion that simply can't be
expressed by sharing or liking something
like like screaming into the keyboard or
posting screamer pictures or links to
places that aren't really I don't know
whatever the YouTube comments are broken
right now um anyway as always also don't
forget to subscribe to tech quickie for
more videos like this in our fast as
possible series as well as some other
exciting stuff that we have coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
