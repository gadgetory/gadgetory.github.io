and we all know how it ends but instead
of the usual song and dance
why don't we all put down our glorious
broadsword then hasn't hit forks for one
second stop acting like the poop we're
slinging doesn't stink as much as the
other guys objectively speaking what is
best a PC or a console let's log our way
through the traditional arguments shall
we
first up is exclusives whether their
intent God of War Final Fantasy
Starcraft Gears of War halo or Super
Smash Brothers fans will argue all day
that the exclusives make a given
platform best hmm there is no such thing
as a best exclusive and every platform
has exclusives ironically given how
often console silence bringing this
point up the Windows PC platform
actually has more exclusive than every
other console ever combined along with
stellar backwards compatibility thanks
to DirectX but and here's a bombshell
for the PC zealots that doesn't make it
best either a fat lot of good redneck
rampage is gonna do for someone who only
really wants to play Pokemon next is the
living room experience consoles are
optimized for the couch the interface is
easy to read the controllers are
Wireless and this might seem like a
small detail but they can be turned on
with the controller arguably steam big
picture improves game navigation on the
PC and yes you can buy little dongles to
run the same controllers wirelessly even
but no one actually does that one
infinitesimally small number of you
actually have a separate PC on your TV
for local gaming or game streaming that
yes yes I know a handful of you do but
most people who invest in two separate
gaming boxes will at least consider
buying two different kinds of console
for the TV and a PC for the desk horses
for courses my friends but the PC is the
horse for any course isn't it Linus you
can buy a cheap O'Dell slam the video
card in it and start playing great free
games like League of Legends and Team
Fortress 2 just like that or you can go
balls to the wall
and Dec your setup out with cool
peripherals like the oculus rift 4k
monitors and even elaborate multi-screen
configurations yes the value and
flexibility argument is a strong one for
the PC but one counter is the simplicity
argument yes internet connections have
made console game releases more PC like
than ever and not in a good way but at
least the game works as well as it can
across the board because let's face it
not everyone wants to care about what
brand motor oil is in their car what
heating element is in their dishwasher
or yeah it's true what leaked video card
is in their gaming system which leads us
to performance I'm legit tired of
hearing about how pcs are faster I
really am they are and their core
functionality is much deeper than what a
console can be but to be a whole lot
faster they're also more expensive at a
similar price a PC really isn't that
much better than a PlayStation 4 with
that said I'm even more tired of hearing
about how consoles are faster they're
not if you think they are you're wrong
there was a time when you could argue
that but these days you're just wrong
sorry bruh
then there's the closely related value
argument both sides can lay claim to
massive catalogs of cheap games that
were released last year but two
seemingly devastating blows to the
console argument are the backwards
compatibility of the PC courtesy of
DirectX
and the lack of a system-wide paid
subscription for multiplayer unless of
course you don't appreciate the rampant
cheating in many PC games even at the
highest competitive level sometimes
something that console gamers don't
suffer from to the same degree and then
of course there's the hardware - you
know this is where it kind of degrades
most of the time consoles are cheap it
lasts a long time
yeah but PC gamers could keep their
computers for seven years if they wanted
potato grade graphics to your games are
locked in 30fps 792p oh yeah well all
your triple-a games are crud ports of
the games that run better on our
supposedly inferior hardware but maybe
if your hardware didn't suck so bad the
whole industry could be able to move
forward out of faster
jacent yeah we all knew this was heading
there as soon as the potatoes got
brought up so let's reset again the
problem and I'd actually like to address
my fellow PC master-race members for a
moment here is that at the end of the
day life is not a spreadsheet and the
way that we approached this video in the
first place is actually sort of wrong if
we tackle this purely objectively the PC
is superior it can achieve more check
marks and fewer X's at a lower price or
a vast number more check marks at a
greater price yeah I know but guys it's
not about dispassionately comparing
stats to crown a winner it's about the
games and the experience that you as an
individual are after if you want a super
deep experience an EVE Online makes you
happy then great but if someone else
wants to play singing dancing games with
their friends do you really expect them
to crowd around a PC to do it no of
course not it's one of those scenarios
more hardcore oh I don't know probably
but who cares it's entertainment and the
TLDR here is everyone needs to just calm
the heck down speaking of calming back
