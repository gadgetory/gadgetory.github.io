we've laid bare on our hard drives many
of us have done a woefully bad job of
protecting the things that are for our
eyes only
I mean sure you can put a password on
your computer but windows passwords are
notoriously easy to get around and if
you share a PC with family members
co-workers or roommates there is often
very little to keep them from rifling
through your private files so what's the
security conscious user to do there are
actually hardware level whole Drive
encryption solutions but these are
mostly designed to keep an attacker from
getting into your data when switching
the computer on or from just physically
ripping out your drive and walking away
with it
once you log into the OS the entire
drive is decrypted meaning that sharing
a computer with someone are just walking
away from it while it's turned on
becomes a big security risk this is
where the ability to encrypt individual
files and directories can really help
and possibly the most straightforward
way to do this is with file system level
encryption on Windows this takes the
form of a baked in technology on
creatively called encrypting file system
or EFS which works with NTFS the main
file system used by modern Windows
versions for the desktop here's how it
works
EFS allows you to encrypt a file or
directory simply by checking a box on
its properties window once you click OK
it uses standard public key cryptography
which you can learn more about here to
encrypt the file or folder with a
generated key called an SDK miss key
itself Ben is encrypted as well with a
public key unique to that particular
user and finally the encrypted fdk is
stored in the files header when the user
wants to go back and access it later
it's decrypted with the users private
key and this is all done seamlessly and
transparently so you won't be
continuously prompted for keys or
passwords as long as you're logged in
under the account the encryption is tied
to the nice thing about this paradigm as
opposed to whole Drive encryption is
that it's much more difficult for other
users logged in under their own accounts
to peek at your files but before you go
rushing off to encrypt all the
embarrassing stuff you've filled your
drive with over the years
remember that EFS does not obviate the
need for a strong Windows account
password a weak password not only makes
it easier for an attacker to log in to
your account but it also weakens the
encryption on the files themselves as
the cryptographic keys that Windows
generates to do the actual encrypting
are based on your password so make sure
you pick a strong password as we
discussed in this video but if you don't
feel like having all your data available
after login is secure enough and you
want another layer that asks for some
kind of verification when you try to
access a file or folder you might want
to consider various third-party
encryption tools although these usually
aren't as seamless or sexy as file
system level encryption they might
provide you with a bit more peace of
mind as they aren't tied to your login
and can offer more options such as
stronger encryption algorithms or the
ability to create things like hidden
virtual drives to make it exceptionally
difficult for snoops to uncover your
secrets but whichever method you choose
to secure your individual files the most
robust solution is to combine it with
hardware based whole disk encryption to
frustrate multiple kinds of attacks
after all think about the humiliation
you could suffer if someone found those
sappy letters to your ex that you forgot
to delete additionally if you're looking
to take your sappy letters to your ex
with you on the road how about an
encrypted USB flash drive to
checked it from prying eyes the Kingston
encrypted USB flash drive provides
high-level security with 256 bit AES
hardware-based encryption USB 3 support
means you don't have to compromise on
transfer speeds for top-notch security
and for additional peace of mind the
drive locks down and reformats itself
after 10 intrusion attempts you can also
upgrade your drive with built-in
antivirus protection and remote
management features and if you're
curious about the other secure USB
options that Kingston has they have
encrypted USB drives for all levels of
security from entry late entry late
that's a mix between level and grade
entry level all the way up to government
and military grade construction and
certification so check them out at the
