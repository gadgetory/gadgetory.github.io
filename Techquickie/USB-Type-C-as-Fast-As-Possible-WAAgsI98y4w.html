specifications for USB were a and B
don't you love it when engineers name
things with both male and female
connector types for each female a
receptacles were intended for host
devices like computers the ones that
control the transfer of data over the
USB connection while female B
receptacles were intended for upstream
peripheral devices printer scanners CD
burners and the like most cables feature
a male a connector and a male B
connector of some sort because with the
exception of on-the-go capable devices
there's no reason to connect two hosts
to each other or to peripherals now back
to the original standards I don't want
to hate on them or anything they did
propel the Universal Serial bus to damn
near ubiquity in the computing world but
they had some fairly significant
limitations they were large bulky and
fragile rated at a mere 1,500 insertion
cycles they were only designed to
deliver a little bit of power the speeds
at which they operated quickly became a
bottleneck and finally particularly
irritating on the a connector they only
went in one way without any clear visual
indication of which way was right
leading to awesome computer nerd jokes
like how many tries does it take to get
a plug into a USB connection for twice
to get it wrong once to think you got it
wrong and one more time to put the damn
thing in so that you can hear that ever
so satisfying doo doo now many of these
issues have been improved over the years
almost right away USB 2.0 dramatically
improved speeds without requiring new
physical connectors or cables mini and
micro versions of the B connector were
developed to be more durable and more
suitable for devices that fit in your
pocket and more recently the backwards
compatible USB 3.0 standard brought
about new a B and microbead connectors
that add physical pins to dramatically
improve speed and power delivery again
to keep us be competitive with newer
standards like eSATA and thunderbolt and
that's for rad today but can USB be even
better
Apple sure thought so and introduced
their proprietary lightning connector
which is smaller rugged enough for me to
sleep with my phone under my pillow
without worrying about breaking it and
reversible but unfortunately still
limited to USB 2.0 speeds so
there's still room for improvement and
here it is the future is now the USB
type-c connector has been finalized and
if it delivers what it's promising it's
going to basically kick all those other
connectors to the curb with a completely
redesigned connector designed to deliver
up to double the data of USB 3.0 10
gigabit per second up to a hundred watts
of power so you could conceivably power
a monitor or charge your laptop off of
it really you can't go for seconds
without reusing a joke anyway back on
topic it has a slim design with a 10,000
cycle durability rating so you can use
the same cables across all your
different devices and not worry about
breaking them and finally it has a
reversible connector so you never have
to play guess the orientation again
speaking of orientation today's episode
of how not to shave is brought to you by

razor blade graphed firmly in your hand
