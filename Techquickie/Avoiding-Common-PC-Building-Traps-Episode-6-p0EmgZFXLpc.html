news today
the bad news is that Disney wouldn't
licence us the rights to use a walks in
today's episode of tech quickie but the
good news you guessed it it's time for
episode 6 of avoiding common PC building
traps and I'll bet you thought we were
ready to give this series a funeral pyre
nope let's get right into it the Empire
did not spend enough on protecting the
main reactor of either Death Star but
that doesn't mean that you should go on
a spending spree for your power supply
either don't get me wrong
buying a bargain-basement psu from a
brand you've never heard of is a
terrible idea as it can damage your
components but I'm saying you most
likely shouldn't be spending extra on a
high wattage power supply either you see
because components today are a lot more
power efficient than they were even a
decade ago you can easily get away with
having a lower wattage PSU even if
you're rocking a higher-end CPU and GPU
a standard build with one of each of
these components should be served well
with a 500 watt power supply with higher
wattages really only necessary if you're
running multiple graphics cards or have
some other kind of exotic setup if you
really want to be sure check out one of
the power supply calculators we've
linked in the video description you
might be surprised how little you really
need speaking of powerful components
don't feel like you need to invest in a
fancy water cooling setup just because
your rig is on the higher end although
water cooling is indeed significantly
more effective than traditional forced
air cooling it does not give you too
much of an advantage unless you're
overclocking even high-end CPUs and GPUs
are designed to last a very long time
with whichever cooling option they come
with whether that's a reference cooler
or an AIB partner solution like you see
included on many graphics cards and if
you go with an enthusiast class CPU that
doesn't come with a stock cooler you can
still get away with an inexpensive air
cooler if you're just running the chip
at stock speed so feel free to save your
money and skip the water cooler unless
you really just want the aesthetic on
the subject of cooling if you're gonna
be installing more than a couple fans in
your case pay attention to how many fan
headers are on your motherboard modern
motherboards allow you to control fan
speeds and curves from the BIOS or the
operating system meaning you're gonna
miss out on this if you have more fans
headers and you end up needing to plug
some of them directly into your power
supply though you can also pick up a
physical fan controller to adjust speeds
from the outside of your case or use a
case with one built in let's wrap things
up by talking about something outside of
your PC itself your monitor in a
previous episode we mentioned ensuring
that you plug in your display to your
graphics card and not your motherboard
in order to assure you're actually
getting the performance you paid so much
money for but on a similar note monitors
with fancy features like high refresh
rates and adaptive sync are becoming
more and more common but these bells and
whistles often are not enabled by
default so if you have body monitor that
supports any refresh rate above 60 Hertz
or any other premium features check both
your display settings and your graphics
card control panel to see if everything
is set properly after all your monitor
isn't gonna come with an astromech droid
to do it for you speaking of doing it
for you pulse wave pulse weight is a
real-time remote monitoring and
management software that's compatible
with Windows Mac Linux and more it gives
you access to real-time status system
resources logged in users network
performance windows updates and more you
can fix problems on the go by sending
commands from any mobile device you can
create and deploy custom scripts to
automate your IT tasks and you can scan
install and update all your systems on
the go it also has a remote desktop
functionality and you can try it all out
free today at pulse Wacom or through our
link in the video description so thanks
