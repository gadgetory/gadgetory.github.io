subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos wouldn't it
be nice if instead of working for the
man you could just sit at home and play
video games all day and get paid to do
it I'm sure many of you have had this
thought especially since some of the
most popular game streamers out there
are making very comfortable six-figure
incomes or perhaps even more to go along
with the worldwide stardom but let's
bring it back down to earth for a minute
here if you the average gamer was
willing to put in the time and effort to
stream how much could you reasonably
expect to make and just where does all
this money come from anyway
so here we go you're a smaller time
twitch streamer will focus on twitch
since they're a market leader right now
you're just getting started and through
a combination of good gameplay
entrancing charisma and devilishly good
looks you built up a small base of
viewers congratulations if you've got up
to 50 followers you can become a twitch
affiliate which at some point will give
you a share of the pre-roll ads that
twitch runs against your stream but that
typically isn't much money in the grand
scheme of things much more important is
that it gives you additional
monetization options with one of the
most significant ones being
subscriptions on twitch subscriptions
work a little differently than they do
on sites like YouTube although streams
are free to view some fans choose to
subscribe to streamers that they like
which not only supports the streamer
financially but gives the subscriber
perks like special emoji and badges for
use in the chatroom as well as the
ability to watch streams without any
twitch advertisements so at the time of
writing twitch subscriptions cost
between five and twenty five US dollars
per month depending on how much the
viewer wants to pay with that money
being split half half between the
streamer and the twitch platform and
viewers can also purchase what are
called bits which are essentially
animated emoji that appear in the chat
window when your fans cheer with their
bits you will receive a cut of that
money they spent on those bits viewers
additionally have the option of simply
donating their contribution directly to
you without subscribing the benefit of
this method is that there's no revenue
share with twitch so for some streamers
this can be a big deal but this comes
with a drawback that there's no Auto
renewal so it can be a little
unpredictable affiliate programs
not to be confused of being a twitch
affiliate our yet another popular source
of income this is why many twitch
streamers have the links to the
streaming gear they use the games they
play products and feature on their
stream or just a box to buy random crap
on Amazon every time a viewer clicks on
one of these links and buy something the
streamer will get a small kickback now
to be clear if you're just an affiliate
running a smaller channel you won't be
looking at any life-changing sums of
money from anything I mentioned so far
however if your stream becomes popular
enough let's say you regularly have 100
or even a couple hundred people watching
your stream at once you can apply to
become a twitch partner which has a
potential to give you much more exposure
if your application is approved you'll
get the monetization features we just
talked about but because twitch will
start recommending your stream to
viewers actively putting your content in
front of more people you'll not only
make more money from subscriptions and
donations but you might also get offers
for sponsorships that you can run on
your stream such as a banner product
placement opportunities like a specific
brand a gaming chair merch stores that
will help your fans buy hoodies with
your face on it and give you a cut or
even invitations to conventions like pax
where you could get paid for making an
appearance but the road to becoming a
streamer this caliber can be hard long
and hard because the competition is
fierce
and even if you're genuinely really
talented building up a loyal base of
fans doesn't happen overnight many pro
streamers have cautioned against trying
to break into the professional streaming
scene if your primary motivation is
money let's ignore that for a moment
though and finally answer the $64,000
question if you do make it as a pro what
kind of income can you be looking at
funnily enough sixty four thousand bucks
might not be too far off the mark as
many full-time streamers who have found
sustainable employment in playing video
games for an audience might make between
three and five thousand bucks per month
not exactly baller money but certainly
enough to think about doing it full-time
rather than as a hobby as for the very
successful streamers they can use their
popularity on Twitch to land deals with
outside sponsors and sell even more
merch meaning six and even seven-figure
incomes aren't unheard of but if you
want to dream of reaching that level
make sure that in addition to your
gaming skills
you have something to offer your viewers
whether it's a quirky sense of humor
a silver radio voice or even fashion
advice anything that helps you stand out
is a good thing I even heard about one
guy who made it big online thanks in
part to his trademark socks and sandals
