groceries your clothing whatever else
you need you take off the packaging you
throw it in the trash can and once a
week someone comes to take it all away
it's like magic once it's gone you never
have to worry about it again
unfortunately for us the same cannot be
said for deleting files on a computer
storage drive for one thing usually
deleting a file just moves it to the
recycle bin which has no sanitation
technician who comes and removes it
every week it's simply a different
folder location where files are stored
indefinitely the file is still there and
anyone with access to your computer can
find them silly Linus once it's in the
bin I can just empty the whole thing
with one click and my computer tells me
hey this is a permanent change and that
file will no longer be accessible on
your computer once you do that and you
would be correct mostly the file is no
longer easily accessible on your
computer but there is a huge difference
between whether a file is easily
accessible and whether it has actually
been removed on both magnetic and
solid-state drives the bits of data that
make up your photos music tax records
and whatever else are naturally kind of
scattered around and the way your
operating system knows where to find all
the pieces is on NTFS formatted drives
anyway through the reference to it in
the master file table so back to
deleting stuff removing a file from the
recycle bin only removes the Master File
table reference that points to the
pieces that make up that file puzzle and
registers the space that it used to take
up as empty this gives the operating
system permission to go right over it
but that does not mean that right after
you clean out your recycle bin the file
is gone not by a long shot in fact there
are many programs that are dedicated to
reconstructing deleted files some of
which can do so even after a drive has
been reformatted and using those
programs right away
like right after an accidental deletion
or reformat before lots of the data has
been gradually overwritten has saved
many a person's bacon from costly or
upsetting loss of data but sometimes you
want to get rid of files permanently
from a storage drive like if you were
going to sell it or donate it in that
case how do you do it well there are a
few tried-and-true methods that we'll
highlight today the first one is to
delete all the data on the drive then
fill it up to capacity with new random
data over and over again this method
really wipes your whole drive so make
sure you have any important family
pictures transferred to a new drive
before you go ahead and do that
the second is physical destruction of
the drive both fun and effective but
obviously you won't be able to donate
that drive that's more for if there's
very sensitive data on it that you just
need to get rid of speaking of things
that are fun and effective Khanda I'm
sorry I mean today's sponsor fractal
design which what we can't do the
humiliating thing here we have to leave
ok well see how this goes so we're here
in the park where apparently today's
whoo today's humiliating thing is for me
to be spun around instead of talking
about fractal designs you know
Scandinavian design minimalistic cases
and their power supplies and their
cooling products and fans I guess fans
are also cooling products but basically
the point is I'm supposed to spin to
them like super dizzy and then run
through a gauntlet of my co-workers who
are all armed with hopefully not spikes
because they could have changed the
pillows out for anything while I've been
doing this what do you think am i dizzy
enough ok here we go oh well thanks for
watching this episode of fast as
possible like any camera don't forget to
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it subscribe if you

you have suggestions for future knots as
