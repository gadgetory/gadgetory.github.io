from grocery store scanners and Printers
to lethal alien blasting weapons and
ill-tempered sharks to protect your
freaking evil lair okay the last two are
science fiction but lasers were
originally developed for scientific
applications that were very much real it
was all the way back in 1917 that the
illustrious Albert Einstein published a
paper containing the underlying science
that would allow light to be amplified
enough to form a laser beam but it
wasn't until the late 1950s that the
idea really took off with the first ever
laser being turned on in 1960 it didn't
take long then for people to find real
applications for lasers as the laser was
used to treat an eye patient the very
next year and then by 1969 we were using
lasers to estimate the distance to the
moon but how do you laser generate
powerful enough light for these cool
uses the idea basically boils down to
the way electrons that spin around the
nuclei of atoms behave you see electrons
can gain or lose energy in a number of
ways which can happen if lights hits
them inside of a laser a powered lamp
flashes and the light from this flash
energizes or excites electrons in a
material called a gain medium some of
these excited electrons spontaneously
lose their energy and in the process
give off a photon an extremely tiny unit
of light the photons then hit other
excited electrons causing more and more
photons to be released which travel at
exactly the same angle and phase as the
original photon eventually enough in
phase photons will bounce back and forth
off of two mirrors on either side of the
laser and shine through one mirror which
is semi-transparent forming a laser beam
that you can use to play with your cat
laser beams are powerful due to the way
the internals amplify the light and
they're narrow
due to the fact that the photons are
coherent or in phase and although the
first laser was that familiar red color
these days we can produce many different
colors of laser light by using different
gain media different materials will emit
different wavelengths of light and also
need different amounts of energy to
excite their electrons both the costs of
these very
guest materials and their different
energy requirements contribute to the
fact that some colors of laser are more
expensive than others with red typically
being the most readily available and
cheapest and with advancements in laser
design it's become one of the most
versatile pieces of technology invented
in the last hundred years high-energy
lasers have made it possible to cut
things with light alone sends data over
very long distances through fiber optic
lines identify fingerprints with
precision at crime scenes and even
remove embarrassing body hair we're
seeing other cool stuff too like
Facebook Aquila an experimental drone
that transmits data and very high
bandwidth using laser light and of
course we'd be remiss if we didn't
mention the humble optical drive which
while it might be on its way out really
got people thinking about the benefits
of using lasers to store access and send
information but if lasers have been
around for over half a century why then
don't we have cool weapons like the
phasers from Star Trek well the main
hurdles to real-life laser guns are
power we just haven't gotten energy
sources powerful enough to weaponize
lasers shrunk down to any kind of
practical size and efficiency as lasers
strong enough to cause physical damage
are susceptible to overheating however
active research into directed-energy
weapons has made some progress in recent
years just don't hold your breath
waiting for someone to turn the moon
into oh I don't know a space station
speaking of directed things what if
there was a way for people to easily
direct their online payments to you how
about Braintree if you're building a
mobile app and searching for a simple
payment solution there Braintree V zero
SDK is one amazingly simple integration
that gives you every way to pay
developers around the world have
embraced the Braintree view 0 SDK is the
easiest way to add secure mobile
payments to their apps and websites
Braintree allows you to accept Apple pay
Android pay PayPal venmo credit cards
and even Bitcoin and if something new
pops up Braintree will support that too
it's used by uber Airbnb and github so
yeah it's pretty darn scalable but let's
say you're not looking to take on uber
tomorrow but you want to try out brain
free no worries you can even get your
first 50
dollars in transactions fee free at
Braintree payments calm slash tech
