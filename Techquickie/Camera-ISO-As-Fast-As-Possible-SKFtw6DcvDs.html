you're tired of your smartphone photos
coming out looking like crap if your
shooting environment isn't perfect
how many Instagram filters have been
used applied over the years just to hide
the fact that your original photos
looked awful
but even though SLR is an incredibly
versatile tool the maze of settings and
options to get your pictures looking
just right can feel like an unsolvable
puzzle to a photography novice but one
of the most important settings is also
one that is not too hard to get the hang
up I'm talking about ISO which stands
for international standards organization
which I know makes a ton of sense ISO
settings are extremely useful for taking
photos when the lighting around you is
less than ideal a lot of you might
remember the days when we all bought
rolls of film instead of SD cards and
the primary way one roll of film seems
to differ from another was the film
speed given by iso or AAA ratings like
100 200 and 400 although it's hard to
buy film anymore this is essentially the
same system that's used in modern
digital cameras but instead of measuring
film speed ISO is now a measurement of
how much light reaches the image sensor
you can learn more about that up here so
why does this matter well each time you
double the ISO rating the amount of
light that the camera needs to produce
an image is cut in half
suppose you're trying to take that
perfect family photo but then keeping
everyone in focus at F 2.8 on any lens
can be difficult so you stop down your
lens to increase your depth of field but
now your shot is way too dark but
instead of using your on-camera flash
which can render backgrounds fairly dark
you can increase your ISO to see all
those wonderfully painful smiles that
have been held over all the time you
took to take that photo increasing the
ISO setting is also a great idea if you
have to utilize a high shutter speed
such as when you're doing sports
photography too low of an ISO setting
will make a fast skating hockey player
or a soccer ball hurdling towards the
goal look blurry properly exposed so
it's critical for people who shoot
sports for living to get the ISO setting
correct to work with a high shutter
speed so is it a good idea to just leave
your ISO on a high setting all the time
given the obvious advantages of a high
ISO you might think so but there are
some significant drawbacks as well
higher ISO settings tend to introduce
noise to your photograph which usually
makes your pictures look very grainy
since the camera is high sensitivity at
a high ISO will also make undesirable
noise to be amplified while
eight modernist Lars can usually keep
noise at a higher ISO to an acceptable
low level but if you crack the ISO too
high enough point your pictures will
start to show the grain very easily
lower ISO settings also tend to produce
more realistic looking colors so if you
have even lighting it's probably a good
idea to use the lowest ISO setting you
can without making your pictures look
too dark just as there were good reasons
for people to buy one hundred speed film
back in the day there are still good
reasons to use the lowest ISO setting
possible on your digital camera such as
when you're taking pictures of a still
object in clear sunlight but if you're
concerned about having accurate shadows
and highlights and retaining the most
detail in your dynamic range a higher
ISO is still often the way to go
especially if you're trying to shoot in
a poorly lit environment so next time
you're struggling with getting just the
right shot remember to do a quick check
on your ISO setting and save yourself
the pain of trying to fix it in
Photoshop or having a photo that looks
like a drunken concert selfie and
speaking of getting your lighting
exactly right highlighting they're one
of the leading plasma lighting
manufacturers for all production needs
they have three different fixtures that
can be used in many versatile ways from
theater production onstage to the
lighting we used for this video the
watts which is our fixture of choice is
one of the lowest power draw lights I've
ever used coming in at 273 watts and
giving me the output of an incandescent
light that would easily draw six times
more power which makes it a lot nicer on
the office power Braille when I
accidentally leave lights on so thank
you guys for watching if you like this
video give it a like if you didn't like
this video give it a dislike and if you
have any other ideas for videos on this
channel please leave a comment down
below while you're done doing all of
that maybe check out a channel super
vine video where we had way too many
glow sticks so we play glow stick
dodgeball in the dark gym roll that's
what we did don't forget to subscribe
