storage you should have in your desktop
or laptop computer but the brain trust
here at Tec wiki got back to work and
quickly decided hey hold on a minute
people are on their phones a lot more
than their computers these days why
don't we do an episode about whether
buying a high-capacity phone is worth it
and when I say high-capacity I mean it
these days it is easy to find phones
with up to 512 gigabytes of on-board
storage that's as much as you would find
in some laptops and there are even a
handful of one terabyte models on the
horizon but is there a practical use for
such spacious phones or is everyone
dropping fat stacks on them just wasting
their money let's break down what
actually eats up phone storage to begin
with any phone you buy will obviously
have an operating system installed that
takes somewhere in the neighborhood of 5
to 15 gigabytes depending on exactly how
it's been tweaked by the manufacturer
for your device so after you knock that
much off the listed capacity another
massive space hog on your phone can be
games just like on a desktop PC now of
course you're not gonna see mobile games
that take up 50 gigabytes or more like
you would on Steam but the lower
capacities of most smartphones mean that
you do have to keep track of what you're
installing quite a few of the more
graphically intensive games out there
can take up around 2 gigabytes of space
each and some of them can even take
upwards of 5 however most games usually
take between a couple dozen and a couple
hundred megabytes so let's say you like
your games and you've got a handful of
the more elaborate titles and then a
dozen or so of the lighter ones you're
probably looking at another 10 to 15
more gigabytes for gaming the next
storage glutton is video to use an
iPhone as an example a standard 1080p
video at 30 frames per second will take
up around a hundred and thirty megabytes
of storage per minute with 4k video at
the same frame rate taking up about
three
times that much so if you have a total
of let's say an hour a video at both
1080 and 4k on your phone you're
probably looking at needing around
another 20 gigabytes of space the nice
thing though is that both iPhones and
Android devices come with a certain
amount of free cloud storage and of
course you can pay for more thing is
though it will take slightly longer to
access files in the cloud as opposed to
one stored locally on your phone and if
you're on your mobile data connection
and you've got a low bandwidth cap it
could end up costing you money to bring
down videos that you want to show
someone now with that said we still do
recommend that if you shoot lots of
videos or photos regardless of how much
storage space is on your phone that you
do safely back them up either to the
cloud or to another device in case your
device gets lost or damaged
now speaking of photos many flagship
calibre phones will use around 4
megabytes per photo on their default
settings so if you have about 500 photos
stored on your phone something that can
happen pretty easily you're gonna need
to add another 2 gigabytes again though
cloud storage will help offset this
impact if you've got a quick shutter
figure but what about audio well gone
are the days where most of us are
walking around with gigs upon gigs of
songs in our pocket because these days
it's much more common to subscribe to a
streaming service like Spotify and Jam
out that way so we're gonna assume that
you don't need a ton of space for actual
music but with that said you might want
to reserve another gigabyte or two or
another 10 or 20 if you're into
downloading podcasts or audiobooks or
video content from Netflix and consuming
it when you're offline like when you're
on the plane bringing us finally to the
variable with the greatest amount of
variation all your other apps so if
you've been keeping score at home we've
come in at anywhere from around 50
gigabytes of space to 70 to keep things
comfortable for what we would consider
to be a pretty heavy user but how much
you need beyond this heavily depends on
how you use your phone
it's very easy for the average user with
a couple dozen taps installed to need an
additional 15 to 20 gigabytes not only
for the apps themselves but in many
cases to store all the extra data that
they create and download think about all
the photos that you take from within a
social media app or all the pictures
that people share with you in large
group chats so with all that said what's
the answer to the original question well
we think that a user who uses their
phone for lots of different things
should be very comfortable with either a
64 gig or 120 gigabyte model depending
on their specific needs so at this time
we wouldn't recommend spending money to
go over that unless you've got some
really esoteric use case where you know
you're gonna go over that speaking of
going over that I've got to go over
these notes from our sponsor pulse way
is a real-time remote monitoring and
management software that helps you fix
problems on the go by sending commands
from any mobile device it's compatible
