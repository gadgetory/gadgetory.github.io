the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos recently we
did an episode explaining the different
standards available for HDR or high
dynamic range TVs and displays which you
should check out over here if you
haven't but come right back because if
you find yourself drawn in by all those
HDR marketing promises of brilliant
lifelike images what else should you
consider before you buy and why is HDR
such a big deal anyway
simply put dynamic range is the
difference between the darkest dark and
the brightest white that your display
can show having a high dynamic range
will improve both contrast and color
reproduction saving you from scenes that
look overly muted or washed out so your
first step in buying an HDR display
should be to check what standards it
supports such as HDR 10 Dolby vision and
HL g against what kind of content that
you're going to be watching and you're
gonna want to cross-reference that
against the standards that the content
that you'll be watching utilize also if
you're into that sort of thing
you'll need to ensure that your favorite
streaming service will provide your
device with an HDR feed at all for
example Amazon Prime video supports HD
are on certain TVs and phones but not on
pcs which isn't to say that you'll
automatically have a wonderful
experience if you go with a Dolby vision
TV to match your impressive Dolby vision
blu-ray collection another specification
you should pay very close attention to
is it displays brightness rating in nits
since HDR is predicated on having a Y
brightness range you'll want a display
that can get sufficiently bright for you
to see the HDR effect as intended so
many of the nicer HDR displays are rated
at a thousand nits peak brightness which
is ideal because that's what HDR 10
videos are mastered at now I'd say you
could get away with a TV in the 600 to
700 nits range if you're on a budget but
beware cheaper models below 500 nits
most of these really can't do HDR
justice with the exception of course of
ohlet's these don't go as high
in terms of their peak brightness but
they go much lower in terms of their
maximum level of black so you're still
getting a very wide range all right then
so you've done your homework you've
picked the right display and you've made
sure that your devices like your blu-ray
players and your PC's support the HDR
standard you want which for a PC means
you've got HDMI 2.0 a or a DisplayPort
1.4 port as well as a GPU that's no
older than Nvidia's GTX 10 series AMD
Tsar X 400 series or Intel's eighth
generation Core gyu HD graphics is there
any additional set up to do well you
probably don't need new HDMI cables but
you will of course want to make sure
that any HDR functionality is switched
on for all devices in the chain
sometimes this can actually be buried
deep within a menu under a different
name like deep color on LG's displays
which I guess isn't entirely inaccurate
but if you're trying to use HDR on a PC
things can get even Messier you'll want
to go into your GPU settings and make
sure that you switch the bit-depth to
10-bit since Ted of 8 this will ensure
that your computer will use the wider
color gamut we discussed previously then
you'll need to double check that the HDR
and advanced color settings under
display properties and the stream HDR
video options under video playback are
both enabled you'll also want to make
sure that you have the latest graphics
drivers installed and that you're
running the windows 10 full creators
update at minimum because even with a
recent GPU HDR support is non-existent
on older drivers and windows builds
prior to 1709 this is especially
frustrating if you've put together an
expensive computer to play the growing
number of HDR games on offer and even
more so if you're a Linux user which
perfectly illustrates I guess that while
we've tried to give you the best advice
we can in today's episode HDR is still a
fledgling technology with even more new
standards trying to gain a foothold so
pay close attention to what changes are
taking place if you're buying a new TV a
year or two down the line or if all of
this is too much you can just go outside
and look at the trees it's like HDR
gaming but with even better graphics
speaking of even better
today's sponsor will make you even
better are you interested in computer
science
check out brilliant a problem-solving
website that teaches you to think like a
computer scientist instead of just
passively listening to lectures with
brilliant you get to master concepts by
solving fun and challenging problems and
they provide the tools and the framework
that you need in order to do it
brilliance thought-provoking content is
based around breaking up complexities
into bite-sized understandable chunks
and will lead you from curiosity to
mastery and you'll be in the company of
over five and a half million members who
share your curiosity and love for math
and science so what are you waiting for
