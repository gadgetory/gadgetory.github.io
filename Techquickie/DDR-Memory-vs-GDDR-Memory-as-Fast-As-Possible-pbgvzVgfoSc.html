receive is my computer uses ddr3 RAM but
all the new graphics cards come with
gddr5 Ram will they work in my system in
a word yes in 74 words yes because the
type of RAM your CPU can use your system
memory doesn't impact the type of RAM
that your graphics card can use because
the CPU or central processing unit
interacts directly with its own memory
and the GPU or graphics processing unit
interacts directly with its own memory
those processors work together and
communicate with each other through a
PCI Express slot so the type of RAM
they're each using doesn't matter so
another common question then is this why
is video card memory so far ahead of
system memory gddr5 has been available
for years while ddr4 is still not
available there's basically no mention
of DDR 5 at all can't we just use gee
ddr4 our CPUs to take advantage of all
those technology improvements well this
sensor is a little bit more complicated
while each new generation of gddr3 dr
aims for similar improvements over the
last one higher capacities reduced heat
output and power consumption and higher
performance particularly with respect to
maximum bandwidth that doesn't mean that
these technologies are the same a common
misconception is that there is a
correlation between the generational
numbers in GD d r and d dr
they're independent of each other G ddr2
with somewhat related to ddr2 but the
newer ddr4 and gddr5 standards are
actually much more closely related to
ddr3 than to ddr4 or a future DDR 5
standard ok so if they're not really as
different as they sound and they're just
variations of similar technology why do
we need two different types of memory
well as the old saying goes horses up
for courses my friends I mean all rows I
didn't mean meal courses I meant race
courses yeah that's not even a tasteful
joke sorry now that we're back on track
now that's a great joke my point stands
you want memory that's special
alized for your application but when a
typical person uses a computer we don't
actually need any more bandwidth for
system memory it's much more important
for everyday tasks to have very low
latency access to your ram with better
granularity while a graphics card is
typically moving massive chunks of data
into and out of the frame buffer that is
the RAM things like high-resolution game
textures or large data sets for computer
simulation work the average desktop is
being bombarded with a multitude of much
smaller transfers like that instant
message you just received or that virus
scan that's picking through all your
files in the background
normal DDR is optimized for desktop use
and GDD are just wouldn't be as suitable
in spite of its impressive on paper
performance numbers especially with
respect to bandwidth speaking of
impressive performance we've got a new
sponsor that we absolutely love
shutterstock.com is the affordable way
to get royalty free stock photos
graphics and video footage that you can
use for anything from gussied up a
PowerPoint presentation all the way to
inclusion in a professional newscast
before we accepted them as a sponsor
I actually went ahead and bought a two
hundred and fifty dollar monthly
subscription to evaluate the service
that plan entitles us to 25 images per
day and has made life so much easier
for my video editor for this video he
just fired up their awesome search tool
to browse their enormous 30 plus a
million image library found something
that Illustrated the point I'm making
and added it to the video no worrying
about usage rights I'm easily saving my
$8.50 per day in time alone of course I
know not everyone edit its videos every
day though don't worry they've got
everything from pay-as-you-go all the
way to enterprise grade solutions with
extra support and enhanced usage rights
so guys you should definitely check it
out you can see their entire image
library with watermarks for free so head
over to shutterstock.com and try it out
and if you like it make sure you use
offer code tech
214 to get 25% off your new account
thanks again to Shutterstock for
supporting tech quickie and thanks again
to you guys for watching this video like
it and share it if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment
let me know did this help clarify DDR
versus G DDR for you or did you already
totally understand this and now it's
just a convenient little resource for
you to send to people whenever they ask
about it and right don't forget to
subscribe either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
