Ramsay cooking can be tricky and
time-consuming but imagine this a
high-tech way of cooking tons of
different meals with extreme precision
and nerdy fine-tuning without using a
bulky stove it's even backed by gabe
newell know this isn't a pitch for some
cheesy infomercial product I'm talking
about sous-vide a method used by
higher-end restaurants that's finding
its way into techie kitchens today so
what's so awesome about this that even
Lord gaben is putting his money into it
sous-vide cooking involves sealing food
into tight bags preferably vacuum sealed
then submerging the food into either
precisely temperature controlled water
which is what we'll be focusing on today
or steam both for long amounts of time
and at temperatures much lower than
other forms of cooking such as frying or
baking the idea is to cook food as
evenly as possible without overcooking
and while retaining moisture and flavor
this is all thanks to the vacuum sealing
process in fact sous-vide is actually a
French term that literally means under
vacuum
temperatures stay relatively low never
getting up to boiling also known as
staying below 100 degrees Celsius and
212 degrees Fahrenheit these lower non
boiling temperatures prevent proteins in
meat from denaturing and tangling
together resulting in a tender dish
lower temperatures also keep the juicy
little cells that make up your food from
popping like balloons making things
moist and succulent perfect if you want
a luscious steak in fact many higher-end
restaurants have used sous-vide for some
time now just for this reason
after a chef cooks a steak sous vide he
or she can briefly sear it in a pan
without drying it out or overcooking the
inside not only that but the vacuum
sealing allows things like herbs and
marinades to penetrate your food more
deeply instead of just sitting on it
like parsley on a Thanksgiving turkey
okay so that's cool and all Luke but how
is this any way possibly tech related
well with how technology is progressing
there are cool innovations in almost any
industry even cooking and on the
consumer side there are many modern
sous-vide cookers that could make your
old microwave pretty jealous these
cookers can be pretty small fitting onto
an existing pot but still feature
full-fledged heating elements and pumps
to constantly circulate water and may
tane constant precise temperatures not
only that but some can even connect to
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for easy control and
can even send you notifications to your
phone perhaps the best part is that you
really don't have to be a trained chef
to use one and as technology progresses
these cookers are becoming more and more
affordable gabe newell is even backing a
sous vide cooker that is supposed to
deliver a 1100 watt heater in an 11 inch
cylinder just don't try to install steam
on it but is there a downside to all
this well the big one is that it can
take a long time to cook something sous
vide due to the low temperatures it's
not typically the kind of thing where
you can whip up something in 10 minutes
in fact in some extreme cases it can
take up to 96 hours to fully tenderize
certain meats though most foods will
cook in as low as 1 to 4 hours or even
less than one hour for seafood and some
nicer steaks the other downside is that
food should be vacuum sealed before
cooking for best results though vacuum
sealers are pretty easy to come by and
even squeezing the air out of a sandwich
bag by hand will can do in a pinch maybe
all this convenience will bring us a
little bit closer to having the robot
cooking servants we all dream of that
being said my food is done so I'll see
you guys next time
well back to work for me and possibly
for you as well because freshbooks is on
a mission to make freelancers less
stressed and more organized through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
sending professional invoices in seconds
which can be honestly one of the most
annoying parts of your job if your job
isn't literally making invoices first
books also helps you track down your
hours so that when it comes time to
create set invoice you know exactly what
you did when you did it who you did it
for where you did it all that kind of
stuff and you can even accept deposits
through their platform so your work is
paid for on your schedule which is again
rather important they also have a tool
to manage your expense reports their
mobile app lets you take a picture of
your receipts and pretty much handles
the rest which is super easy and maybe
we should get a solution like that I
don't know getting started on fresh
books is extremely simple even if you're
not a numbers person actually if you're
not a numbers person it's totally fine
don't worry about it at all you can try
fresh books for free for 30 days
by going to FreshBooks comm forward
slash tech quickie and entering tech
quickie into how did you hear about us
section thanks for watching guys if you
liked the video like it hopefully you
guys enjoyed this little bit of a fringe
topic if you disliked it you're like
screw cooking stuff I don't want any
cooking stuff on this channel then maybe
do that we also have channel super fun
which you should probably check out
we're going to do something else
with a vacuum set up fairly soon which
involves like shooting things and stuff
don't worry about it also comment down
below if you have other videos
suggestions probably not any cooking
stuff or at least that I can think of
anyways we'll see what you guys say also
don't forget to subscribe and fall out
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
