rig imaginable and try to keep it as
safe as you can by not visiting
questionable websites putting it in a
locked room and maybe defending it from
your cat's claws with a nerf gun or
something
but there are some things you just can't
predict asteroid strikes nuclear war and
perhaps the worst of all power outages
there aren't too many things more
frustrating than being in the middle of
writing an important paper or work
report when everything just suddenly
goes dark fortunately a great defense
against this has been around for quite a
while the ups and I don't mean having a
guy in brown shorts deliver a generator
to your house I'm talking about
uninterruptible power supplies which can
keep your equipment running even if the
power grid has gone dark
there are many different kinds of UPS's
on the market with different internal
workings but the basic principle of
operation they all share is this you
plug your UPS into the wall and then you
plug whatever you're using computer
monitor or server rack or whatever into
the UPS kind of like you would a power
strip or surge protector the UPS has an
internal battery that gets charged from
the wall so if the power goes out your
UPS can keep your stuff running keep in
mind however that UPS is designed for
and affordable enough for home use won't
keep your PC running for hours on end
during a blackout they're designed to
give you enough time to save your work
and shut down your computer properly so
you don't lose anything important but
that's kind of it buying the right UPS
can give you longer running time more
features and increase reliability so how
do you know what to pick one of the most
important specs to pay attention to is
how much power the UPS can deliver what
makes this a little complicated though
is that it isn't just a matter of say
matching your power supplies wattage to
the UPS's UPS capacities are typically
given in both amps instead of watts but
those of you who paid attention physics
will know that volts times amps give you
what so isn't that just the same thing
in UPS land though they aren't because
of resistance present in electrical load
so you'll want to pick up a ups with a
volt amp rating 50 to 75 percent above
whatever the typical wattage load from
your PC will be
and of course make sure you factor in
everything else that you have plugged in
such as a monitor some UPS's are also
what's called line interactive meaning
they have a special transformer built-in
that can deal with voltage dips or
surges if you live in an area where the
power grid just yet oh isn't the best
and you have to deal with stuff like
frequent brownouts that make your lights
flicker since electronics need a steady
supply of power this can give you a
great additional layer of protection
even if the power doesn't go out
completely also pay attention to what
kind of software the UPS comes with many
units will allow you to connect the UPS
to your computer with a USB cable and
use software that will tell you the
battery life of your ups and how many
minutes of uptime to expect if the power
goes out as well as automatically shut
down your computer properly once the
battery gets low some UPS software will
even save your work for you beforehand a
very useful tool in case you stepped out
of the room or even left the house
entirely when the power went out and of
course you want to make sure that
whatever UPS you get can actually give
you enough run time off the battery many
UPS's will state a number of minutes on
the spec sheet but remember this is only
at a certain wattage so if you have tons
of stuff plugged in and you're in the
middle of gaming at 4k you simply won't
have as much time so keep these tips in
your mind and you can rest easy if
there's a freak blackout or something
well at least about your electronics
since not much can save you from having
to replace all that food in your fridge
if you're stuck without power for long
