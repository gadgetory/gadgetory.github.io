glass if you've been in the market for a
cellphone or tablet in the last several
years and you probably know that for
some reason it's desirable but do you
actually know what's special about it
the thing I'd like to get out of the way
first is that it's not made of gorillas
sorry to disappoint you but gorilla
glass is just a brand name that Corning
incorporated uses to describe this thin
tough glass that they make that has gone
from being an unusual selling point on
portable touchscreen devices to being a
pretty much a requirement for many
shoppers myself included if they are
going to consider buying any touchscreen
device gorilla glasses main benefits in
no particular order are as follows it's
easier to clean more difficult to
scratch harder to break thinner more
flexible and does all of this while
maintaining outstanding optical clarity
compared to regular soda-lime glass but
to which you might reply okay that's
interesting in theory thanks Linus for
being Corning's messenger here I'm sure
Corning makes a lot of claims about how
great it is but it's not like I'm going
to go drop things on my notebook or my
phone to test it so is there really any
proof that it's as marvelous as they say
it is and as a matter of fact there is
at the last couple of trade shows I
attended I actually got to see live
demos and even go hands-on as they
demonstrated the impact resistance of
Gorilla Glass 3 by tracking regular
soda-lime glass a piece of aluminum and
finally Gorilla Glass 3 with a big ball
bearing I mean after that they showed me
their scratch test then they let me
perform their ease of cleaning test
their pressure test to show off cracking
resistance and finally they also let me
perform their flex tests at the next
show they had a new thing to show off
and that's their antimicrobial Gorilla
Glass without hurting toughness or
clarity they've built in an ionic silver
component which serves as an
antimicrobial agent to keep the glass
clean and protect the touch surfaces
from odor and stain causing bacteria so
yet another cool thing about it you can
keep your eye out for and they actually
did a live demo of that for me as well
now to be clear law Gorilla Glass isn't
perfect of course it can break we've all
seen drop tests and cellphones on
YouTube but the objective isn't to make
the world's most indestructible piece of
glass the objective is to create glass
that enables
devices to keep getting slimmer lighter
curvier and generally sexier and yet be
durable enough that if you're reasonably
gentle with them or even have an
accident or two it'll probably still be
okay and it's not as if Gorilla Glass is
the end of the line in terms of tough
you know clear covering materials
sapphire crystal glass is something that
is coming to the forefront and while
Gorilla Glass is the 800-pound gorilla
of the industry so to speak right now
that's not to say that this particular
episode of fast as possible is going to
be the last one I ever make about
fantastic you know scratch and break
resistant materials to go over your
touchscreen devices well I am prompt
about the last fifth of that video and I
can't think of a new Segway now that my
scripted one doesn't work anymore so
there you go guys
audible.com slash tech quickie is the
place to go if you want to get a free
audio book to go along with your monthly
subscription they have over a hundred
and fifty thousand audiobooks some of
which are hot new releases and some of
which are old classics I mean ok it's
not that old but it's definitely a
classic how to win friends and influence
people by Dale Carnegie is an epic tale
of the many misfortunes that befall and
innocent Russian Mouse who emigrates to
America and I think I must be thinking
of something else
but maybe it's more about making friends
and influencing people but you'll have
to listen to it to find out what it's
actually about it like I said before the
first one with your monthly subscription
is free so that's audible.com slash tech
wiki to check out that service and I
