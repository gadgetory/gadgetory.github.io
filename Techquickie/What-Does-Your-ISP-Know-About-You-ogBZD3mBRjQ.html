participate in modern society you have
to give up some degree of your privacy
and at this point I'm not even sure that
moving off the grid to a jungle
somewhere and living off the land would
actually insulate you entirely from the
watchful eyes of the powers that be and
perhaps there's no better illustration
of this than the amount of trust that
people are expected to place in their
internet service provider or ISP I mean
just think about how much of your
personal data concerning everything from
your financials to your vacation
planning to your love life its flowing
through that tube that goes from your
house soft to some other mysterious land
of long corridors close office doors and
networking equipment that grants you
access to the Internet so just how much
of this is your ISP really keeping tabs
on well it's probably not that
surprising that since the function of an
ISP is to connect you to the websites
and services that you want to access
they know at least in a general sense
the IP addresses and the sites that
you're visiting because DNS requests
which you can learn more about up here
are unencrypted that means that they can
see the domains that you're going to
like youtube.com or Linus tech tips com
but not necessarily which specific pages
on those domains like GE ni dot u s
slash capital D lowercase M DK uppercase
J lowercase a these IP addresses are
just one form of simple trackable
metadata which is a catch-all phrase for
information other than the content
itself with other examples being email
addresses timestamps and port numbers so
your ISP will know you visited Facebook
last Thursday at 3 p.m. but won't have
access to the encrypted data like your
login credentials who you talk to and
what you said now let's talk about
unencrypted sites or sending and
receiving unencrypted communications
when you do this your ISP can actually
see specifics about your activity
including the exact content on those web
pages or messages yikes they can even
make educated guesses as to some of what
you're up to on encrypted
so for example looking at individual
packet size routing patterns and timing
they can piece together details like
recipient of a message or the length of
a password and get a pretty good picture
of what your online life is without
relying on delete hacks ORS or the NSA
to break the encryption so by this point
you might be a little nervous even if
you're not some notorious cyber criminal
I think it's fair to say that the vast
majority of us have done something
online that we sort of rather not share
with the rest of the world but it's not
all doom and gloom odds are there isn't
someone at your eyes PE just munching on
some popcorn and going through your
private stream of Internet packets but
that doesn't mean that this isn't a
concern or that they're not just logging
all of that information anyways for
later use the upsetting thing for a lot
of people specifically is the potential
for ISPs to sell this information to
advertisers or other more nefarious
partners it's kind of like how Google
delivers advertising for products that
they think you might like based on your
browsing history except that in the case
of an online service it's often easier
to opt out or just avoid using it
compared to literally your internet
connection there's a good reason to be
uncomfortable once that information gets
sold
there isn't much telling what some
unscrupulous advertiser would do with it
even if they aren't selling it directly
to email spammers there's no guarantee
that your information will remain out of
the hands of malcontents look at how
many major data breaches are in the news
these days it happens all the time
however there is a bit of good news for
those that are concerned about privacy
more and more websites especially large
popular ones are encrypting connections
by default
thanks to services like let's encrypt
and additionally ISPs don't save this
dirt they have on you forever
most of them keep it for about two years
at most but not to say that they don't
just sell it every two years but either
way there might not be a complete
picture of your digital life forever
available at any individual point in
time and you might also be using
multiple ISPs which is becoming common
as many people even unintentionally in
most cases
use one provider at home another at work
and a third for cellular data and so on
and beyond that if you do want to get
super serious about privacy and limit
what your ISP knows about you using a
reputable VPN service with good security
that doesn't log user activity can help
a lot a VPN creates a secure tunnel
between your device and whatever you're
connecting to and some of them even
secure your DNS requests meaning that
theoretically your ISP could end up
knowing virtually nothing about your
online life which is awesome
just make sure the VPN service is one
that you can trust because all the same
metadata will be flowing through them
and they can theoretically just be
exactly as malicious with it so that
would be bad
but why do they have to keep track of
this information at all can they just
leave us alone
well believe it or not ISPs aren't just
tracking you to make a quick buck
identifying patterns and user behavior
helps them with traffic management to
make your connection run more quickly
and reliably and also helps them protect
users from cyber attacks and malware so
it's not like there's no benefit to this
user data collection but even so no one
would blame you if you develop trust
issues like me in this brave new world
of exploding phones and fake dating
profiles it's good to be safe out there
cuddle bear VPN allows you to tunnel
into up to 20 different countries making
it so that you seem as if you're from
that country when you're using and
browsing the internet they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and they also have a Chrome
extension just choose the country that
you want a tunnel to in the app turn
tunnel bear on and watches your bear
tunnels your internet connection to that
new location when you turn tala bar on
two things happen your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
so you show up as if you're in well
that country tunnel bear lets you bypass
all the really annoying details of
setting up certain other VPNs for
personal use by not needing to mess
around the port configurations DNS or
any other router settings some bear
handles all of that for you in the
background it's easy they also don't log
user activity you can try out a tunnel
Bayer VPN with 500 megabytes of free
data and no credit card required today
and if you
choose to give unlimited data you can
save 10% by going to tunnel bear comm

alright guys like if you liked it
dislike if you disliked it get
subscribed so you can see more tech wiki
videos and if you watch too many tech
wiki videos and you're like too much
knowledge is in my brain and you need a
break go to Chell super-fun take a brain
break over there watch us do some silly
silly things and then come back learn
more things I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
