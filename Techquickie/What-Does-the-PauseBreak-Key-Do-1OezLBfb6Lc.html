alright so it's around 2:30 p.m. you're
stuck at work
and you're desperate to get away for a
coffee because your boss is breathing
down your neck for I don't know a line
graph or something but suddenly you
glance down at your keyboard and you get
an idea what would happen if I actually
hit that key
so you spring into action mashing your
index finger down on it and as it
bottoms out your boss freezes and a
delightful coffee appears right in front
of you pause break am i right well no no
I'm not right so what is the break
button actually therefore then I mean
unlike the scroll lock key which you can
learn more about up here it doesn't even
toggle that little wide on your keyboard
well the origins of the break key
actually go all the way back to the
1800s when zesty memes were sent in via
Telegraph rather than the internet back
then if two people were communicating
via teleprinter one person could press
break to break the circuit which
effectively interrupted the sender and
let them know that the other end needed
to transmit something this usually
happened when one new source that was
sharing a telegraph line with others has
some breaking news to report
but even though teleprinters have long
been obsolete the break he's stuck
around on computer keyboards as a means
to stop or terminate a running program
now this functionality was much more
common back before graphical operating
systems were a thing but for fun you can
still use control plus break to
terminate a program in Doss or in other
text-only environments but on a more
practical note you might also still see
a system administrator using the break
key if a PC is connected to a mainframe
and they have to interrupt the boot
process to recover a password but that
doesn't have much applicability to you
folks a home does it so a far more
common use for you would be to pause
that flow of text you might see on your
own computer at boot time like if you
would like to see BIOS messages that
might help you understand or
troubleshoot any issues you're having
now it doesn't work on every PC but
gives a shot the next time you
your system if you're curious the pause
button will also stop any huge avalanche
of text scrolling down your screen if
you're using command prompt and even if
you can't be bothered to care about
anything that has to do with old-school
command line computing there are still
two modern applications for pause brake
holding down the windows key and
pressing pause brake will bring a cure
system property screen and some games
will let you press pause to pause your
game play makes sense right it does make
me wonder why that isn't the standard
but even if your favorite game doesn't
use the pause key for this purpose you
can always use hotkeys software to make
this extraneous button do whatever you'd
like beating games or in Adobe Premiere
just whatever you program it to do don't
expect it to bring a halt to those
incessant work messages about how you
need to find a way to make episode is
about obscure keyboard buttons more
compelling maybe we should've thrown to
some more explosions and speaking of
explosions would you like your Internet
experience to be more explosive and
exciting well then check out tole better
