subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos 3d video
it's one of those things that were
constantly being promised is going to be
better than ever
from Hollywood blockbusters that you
have to pay an extra seven bucks to see
in real d2 the Nintendo 3ds which force
without even needing those dorky glasses
but the consensus among moviegoers and
gamers alike is that current 3d
offerings are more than a little bit
underwhelming with words like
unnecessary distracting and sorry
nausea-inducing uses fraud the
experience so why is it in 2017 nearly a
hundred years after the first 3d feature
film hit the theaters that 3d consumer
technology is still so terrible well it
turns out that the human brain is pretty
hard to trick into thinking that
something is actually real and immersive
when it's really just a projection on a
flat surface you see when we look at an
object in the 3d space of the real world
our eyes are just trying to focus on
that object alone but we're looking at a
3d movie or a video game our eyes need
to stay focused on the screen while
they're simultaneously trying to focus
on the object now because the virtual
objects look like they're somewhere
between the screen and our faces it's
not something we're all used to doing in
the real world and it's a very tough
problem for our brains to figure out how
to resolve and of course to
sharply-defined edge of the screen
doesn't help the sense of immersion
either meaning the resulting 3d image
looks less than realistic and that's
also where the queasiness I mentioned
earlier comes in so let's talk about
some of the problems that specifically
affect movies the real D branded 3d
system that you commonly see in movie
theaters works with dual projectors and
glasses that polarized light in
different directions for your left and
right eye so each I guess is slightly
different image to fool your brain into
thinking that it's seeing something
three-dimensional but unfortunately
filtering out half the light has led to
complaints that modern 3d movies
not only unconvincing but they're also
way too dark to enjoy so given the price
a little buyer's remorse is
understandable home solutions have also
been fraught with problems requiring
bulky power glasses which you can learn
more about right up here very expensive
television sets pricier copies of the
same movie or at the very least a
halving of the vertical resolution so
that each eye only sees what it's
supposed to oh yeah and everyone
watching has to look like a dipstick
there's also the minor matter of how
these movies are produced in the first
place some films are produced
specifically with 3d in mind a duel and
stereoscopic camera rig that can capture
3d images natively is neither for the
best results avatar was notable example
of this done correctly and animated
films can have this effect applied with
virtual cameras after the fact
now although doing this doesn't
eliminate all the problems associated
with 3d it generally makes for a more
pleasant experience than the many other
films that were actually shot in 2d and
chizel ii converted to 3d later on you
can think of this a little bit like how
video games pour it from console to PC
are so often disappointing which you can
learn more about up here
well except a little worse and speaking
of games what about the 3ds well thanks
to Nintendo's use of a parallax barrier
which is a series of slits placed over
the back light illuminating some pixels
towards your left eye and some towards
your right eye there are no brightness
issues and you don't need glasses but
unfortunately the physical slits can
severely restrict viewing angles which
is why the 3d effect doesn't work nearly
as well if you tilt your screen more
than just a little bit when you combine
that with the system's low resolution
and lower refresh rate than what you get
at the cinema it isn't surprising that
many people were instead clamoring for a
clamshell style 2d s which of course
Nintendo ultimately did give us and
desktop PC gaming and stereo 3d had a
similarly short 15 minutes of fame in
the form of Nvidia's 3d vision which
required a supportive islander a support
a graphics card specific classes and
validated games for the best experience
so is probably not surprising it didn't
take off
now with that said with the rise of high
quality VR headsets like the oculus rift
and HTC vive consumers are beginning to
enjoy 3d experiences at high refresh
raised without flat projection screens
that throw their entire field of vision
helping to alleviate some of the issues
we've discussed but with VR tech still
attempting to catch on with game
developers and other content providers I
do wonder if we just be better off
waiting for someone to invent a
real-life version of the Star Trek
holodeck if we really want convincing 3d
and speaking of three dimensions are you
ready to add a new dimension to your
browsing experience
we'll then checkout tunnel Bayer VPN
which lets you tell the 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
Internet and use online services as if
you're in a different country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and a Chrome extension when you turn
tunnel bear on 2 things happen first
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption second your public IP
address gets switched so you can show up
as if you're in a different country
tunnel bear lets you bypass all the
annoying details that typically come
with using a VPN for personal use
there's no need to mess around with poor
configurations DNS or any other router
settings total bear handles all of that
in the background they also have a top
rated privacy policy and do not lock
user activity and right now you can try
out tunnel bear with 500 megabytes of
free data with no credit card required
and if you were with a 7 day free trial
just head over to Tunnel bear comm /
