where CPUs are designed startups
flourish and no one can afford to buy a
house but did you ever stop to think
about why it's called Silicon Valley why
exactly does Silicon seem to be so
universally used for electronics instead
of some other material like copper
graphite or potato
well silicon has a number of properties
that make it unusual among chemical
elements right now scientists know 118
elements and of those only six are
commonly classified as metalloids
silicon being one of them these
metalloids exhibit metal-like
characteristics but aren't true metals
usually they have a silvery shiny look
like true metals but instead of being
malleable they're often quite brittle
meaning they can break apart easily and
although they can conduct electricity
like metals they aren't quite as good at
it which is where the word semiconductor
comes from this semi conductivity is
especially important because while
obviously computers and other things
that use microchips need electricity to
run their whole principle of operation
relies on being able to let electricity
pass through certain transistors
selectively which you can learn more
about in this video a normal metallic
conductor would let electrons through
too easily
meaning way too many transistors would
light up at once and your CPU wouldn't
be able to process instructions
correctly which is okay if you want your
computer to serve as a very expensive
paperweight or a cheap one I guess as it
were which is all fine and good then
Linus but you still haven't answered the
question why silicon specifically
instead of some other semiconductor like
germanium well although Silicon Valley
might be an expensive place to live
actual silicon is quite cheap and it's
also pretty easy to find in the Earth's
crust in fact silicon is one of the most
common elements in the universe so it's
fully possible that spacefaring
nations in some distant galaxies are
using silicon CPUs to play plants vs.
humans or whatever silicon also has
other benefits such as being able to
operate well at a wide temperature range
stock coolers am i right and it can be
easily doped with other chemicals that
are necessary for micro processors to
work for example it's quite easy to form
an insulating layer of silicon dioxide
just by sticking silicon into a hot
furnace the tiny transistors in a cpu
need insulated areas to further control
and direct the flow of electricity with
precision
so silicon's versatility makes it a
natural choice
but even though silicon has proven to be
extremely useful it is not perfect
although it's cheap and abundant there
is a trade-off with how quickly it can
conduct electricity other semiconducting
materials can move the electrons around
faster meaning that they could be used
to make higher performance processors
albeit at a higher cost and another
limitation of silicon will mean that it
will not be the universal material in
our processors for too much longer
transistors keep being made smaller and
smaller and smaller in order to make our
chips more powerful and more power
efficient but we're getting to the point
where silicon can't be made into
transistors much smaller than what we
have already
due to its chemical properties in fact
intel has already announced that for its
seven nanometer chips that could be
released around 2020 it will be using
something other than silicon to put that
in context 7 nanometers is only about 35
atoms wide pugh so there you have it
while smaller transistors and faster
CPUs may require more exotic materials
there's no doubt that the path to this
future of tomorrow was paved with
silicon I mean quite literally really if
you think about it they used to use it
in like pottery and bricks they still do
use it in bricks if you count like
minecraft speaking of bricks let's say
you work as like a freelance bricklayer
or you do on the side computer work or
you run a small dance studio out of your
garage
whatever it
is that you do as a freelancer or small
business owner it shouldn't be wasting
time with complicated accounting
software and that is where fresh books
comes in fresh books is designed to save
you time and help you use the time that
you save to make more money or have more
of a life and they've got a whole new
platform that's been redesigned for the
way you work to be simpler and easier
than ever before not to mention helping
you get paid more quickly you can create
and send professional-looking invoices
in less than 30 seconds you can set up
online payments with just a couple of
clicks and get paid up to four days
faster and you can even see when your
client has seen your invoice and put an
end to the oh did you send that to me oh
gee I guess I'll check with Jill from
accounting and see if we could play that
eventually no no wrong so fresh books is
offering a 30-day unrestricted free
trial to our viewers and to claim that
all you have to do is head to fresh
books comm slash tech quickie and enter
