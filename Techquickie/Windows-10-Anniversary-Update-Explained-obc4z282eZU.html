windows 10 has been with us whether we
like it or not for a little over a year
now and given that Microsoft has moved
away from monolithic updates every three
or so years in favour of the new Windows
as a service concept with feature
updates being pushed out more regularly
I guess they decided it's time time for
the well anniversary update but wait
does this actually add new functionality
or does it just make the operating
system less broken Allah the Windows
service packs of yesteryear good
question and while there are bug fixes
to be sure
Microsoft has stuck with their vision of
incrementally adding legitimately new
features instead of just selling us a
whole new version of the software a few
years later so what's inside well since
you're probably watching this video
through some form of web browser we'll
start off with the updates to Microsoft
edge the replacement for Internet
Explorer which you can learn more about
here the anniversary update finally
brings the long-awaited browser
extension support to edge as well as the
ability to pin your most important tabs
on the subject of keeping things
organized Cortana is a heck of a lot
more useful now she even works from the
lockscreen if you want to tell her to do
something with your computer from across
the room my girlfriend could maybe learn
a thing or two you can also add images
to your reminders useful for recalling
stuff you have to do at a quick glance
and speaking of Android Cortana desktop
can now push to your Android or iOS
device or your Windows Phone if you have
one of those if you spend late nights
staring into your computer monitor
instead of your mobile device one very
welcome change is a dark theme for
Windows 10 which can be accessed with
one click from the personalization menu
instead of a registry tweak this should
help keep you from being blinded by the
light colored UI elements during your
late-night browsing sessions and on the
subject of late night tinkering if
you're moving to a new setup or
upgrading an old one Microsoft has made
it a lot easier to deal with activation
issues as a result of hardware changes
by
giving users the ability to link their
Microsoft accounts to their license keys
so you'll be able to reactivate more
easily if you do something like swap on
a motherboard or a video card although
this doesn't completely remove
activation concerns
it does give frequent upgraders a fair
bit more wiggle room and experimenting
on the software side just got a lot
easier as well as the anniversary update
includes a full fat bash shell
essentially you can run linux commands
from within windows similar to how wine
enables you to run Windows applications
on Linux an awesome feature for both
developers as well as people who just
want to dabble in Linux without having
to dual boot or virtual eyes touch input
is also more versatile Windows Inc
supports annotations and gestures on
more programs including office and maps
if you've got a smart pen and continuing
to develop the do stuff without touching
the keyboard paradigm you can also log
into windows with supported wearables
and smartphones
if your computer is NFC capable although
that being said third-party solutions
with this functionality aren't brand new
this is the first time Windows has
supported it natively finally apart from
the usual security patches facelifts and
bug fixes the Start menu is different
again mine is working for now the
anniversary update allows Windows
Defender the built-in malware protection
program to scan your system from time to
time even if you have a different
antivirus solution installed just to
make sure that your primary solution
didn't miss anything so while the
anniversary update isn't quite like
getting a whole new operating system I'd
say it's a nicer surprise than the
traditional first anniversary gift of
paper unless of course you'd rather have
the official Microsoft pop-up book
