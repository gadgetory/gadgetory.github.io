explanation I could give for this topic
is well it's short for double data rate
fourth-generation synchronous dynamic
random access memory and at this point
you're probably sitting there going do
you Ram it Linus those are just words I
want to know what it does okay fine
let's start with what memory or RAM is
actually for in your system let's
imagine for a moment that a builder is
like a CPU doing work and tools are like
data so a processors cache is a very
small amount of incredibly fast storage
directly on board this is kind of like
the hands of our builder he can't keep
much there but it's really fast to
access next up is RAM or working memory
this is whatever our builder can store
on his belt or nearby as he works it's
slower to get to than cache and you
can't keep everything you could possibly
need there but it should be enough to
complete whatever is the current task
next up is mass storage which would be
your SSD or hard drive this is much
slower than Ram to access kind of like
going down the ladder to grab something
from his truck and then if we wanted to
keep the analogy going even after it's
worn out its welcome we could say that
off-site storage like over the Internet
is kind of like driving to the store to
buy a new tool outright it's that much
slower again so there you have it Ram is
the tools or data bring it back to
computers that your CPU needs to
complete its current tasks or tasks so
the more of it you have the less often
you the Builder will need to go down the
ladder to retrieve things and the faster
it is the less downtime you'll need to
deal with every time you realize you're
holding your drill when actually you
need a circular saw on two ddr4
specifically it's the next evolutionary
step forward in memory technology from
ddr3 I know go figure right but J deck
hasn't been sitting on their thumbs for
the past half a decade and this isn't a
small upgrade compared to ddr3 it offers
over 20 new features so I think it goes
without saying that it's not backwards
compatible and you'll need a new
motherboard and CPU to use it sounds
expensive why would I even want that
Linus well first up it's going to
improve performance
aside from allowing much higher clock
speeds we're talking thirty two hundred
megahertz stock ddr4 is a bigger change
than it might at four
appear to be with some clever
architectural wizardry designed to
improve performance particularly in
multi-core systems next up we've got a
capacity right off the bat ddr4 will be
capable of double the density per die
but perhaps equally important is that it
can support up to eight dies per package
instead of four which combined
translates into an effective prodrome
pooling of ddr3 theoretical maximum
capacity of 128 gigabytes per module
yeah
512 gigabyte memory sticks baby but of
course for now that benefit along with
some of the others won't be very
applicable to home users a couple more
such improvements are the 40% or so
reduction in power consumption due to
ddr4 is better power management and
lower operating voltage as well as its
support for a much more advanced error
detection prevention and correction this
last one is going to be key as
capacities grow to the point where
errors become actually inevitable
speaking of inevitable airs going to the
store to buy replacement raisers if you
haven't already signed up for a Dollar
Shave Club yes it's been a while since
we've talked about Dollar Shave Club but
that doesn't mean that the scary man
with the weapon obscenities private army
and trained bear is gone oh no he's
still watching you in the bathroom or
maybe that was me someone's watching you
shave I mean what did you think we were
watching you doing that's gross we'll
never know who it was anyway the point
is that for just a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club delivers high-quality
razors and other bathroom supplies
straight to your door the club is
available in the US Canada and Australia
for my friends down under and aside from
their great razor blades and shave
butter they've got one wipe Charlies
butt wipes for men for my enemies down
under if you catch my drift anyway
that's pretty much it head on over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and join
the club to start shaving time and
shaving money thanks for watching guys
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment if
you have suggestions for future episodes
and fast as possible or just anything to
say to us about this particular one I
think that's pretty much it don't forget
to subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
