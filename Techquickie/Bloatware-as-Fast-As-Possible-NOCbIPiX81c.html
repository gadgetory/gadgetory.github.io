internet browser and oh oh my eyes it
burns oh the toolbars
this is probably a pretty familiar
experience if you have ever worked in a
computer repair shop or help the less
tech-savvy member of your family fix an
issue with their computer browser
toolbars pre-installed programs
Auto starting apps and tools that change
your default search engine no I don't
want to use ask Gump com are referred to
as crapware and bloatware many people
use these terms interchangeably but I
think there's actually a pretty
important distinction between them
crapware is used to describe software
that has no sensible use like those
awful toolbars that take up half the
browser but sponsored links to sites you
would never want to visit and leave you
with no space to actually view the web
content that you came to see
whereas bloatware is software that can
be legitimately useful but that was
installed without your approval usually
by the manufacturer of your computer and
that you probably wouldn't have
installed if given a choice so how do
you get bloatware and crapware well as
mentioned before a lot of bloatware
comes pre-installed on your PC and
actually the same goes even for mobile
devices the Samsung Galaxy s4 was
particularly in datoria s-- for shipping
with excessive bloatware with about
seven gigs of the capacity of the 16 gig
model taken up by pre-installed apps and
software that you couldn't remove
without a pretty solid understanding of
how Android works
yikes not all bloatware is pre-installed
on Hardware though sometimes you'll find
it hidden in the recommended or Express
installation options for free software
subscription-based antivirus solutions
are notorious for this hiding in
countless installers just waiting to eat
up your CPU and RAM resources and in
this regard crap where is no different
if I had a penny for every time I had to
uncheck install ask toolbar when trying
to install a new program on my PC I
would already have my kids college
education paid for now in a world where
PC manufacturers often spent countless
hours and funds designing and developing
their latest and greatest new laptop or
whatever why on earth would they include
pre-loaded programs that seemed to do
nothing but slow your PC down
sometimes the answer is pretty innocent
and it's just a matter of they wanted to
put on this light feature that it turns
out people didn't really care about that
much it wasn't very well coded and it
used up resources you just pull it off
other times the answers a little more
sinister cache cheddar greenbacks Yin
dong dong anyway um
back on topic companies like oh let's
just use Norton as an example we'll pay
PC manufacturers to preload their
software onto their computers because
once it's there many people don't know
how to get rid of it or even know that
they should want to well hold on Linus
the apps pre-installed on my PC were
free I mean how is there a benefit to
anyone to have it installed there here's
how let's take a hypothetical dude Jeff
who brings his new PC home and it's
pleased to discover it is protected by
Norton AntiVirus an anti-virus program
that was included with his purchase how
nice
only a year from now that software's
gonna be all like yo Jeff man I'm
expired man your PC is like unprotected
unless you purchase another year the
service act now before the hacker worm
children monster virus steals all your
personal information man because Norton
was pre-installed on that PC Jeff never
realized that he could shop around and
find free alternatives that work just as
well
or better so now they get to rake in
$54.99 a year for the lifetime of that
computer pretty smart
well okay Linus now that I know about
bloat wearing crap wear how do I get rid
of it and what can I do to make sure I
don't get any more

rescue once again with their excellent
