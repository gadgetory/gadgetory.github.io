shopping for I don't know a Bluetooth
speaker wireless antenna or whatever
else but many people I talked to are
shocked to hear that when one thing is
rated at twice as many decibels as
something else that does not mean it's
twice as strong or twice as loud let's
start at the beginning shall we
the base unit in this case is actually
the bell named in honor of Alexander
Graham Bell who achieved fame and
fortune most notably for filing a patent
for the work of Antonio Meucci the true
inventor of the telephone anyway that's
a whole other discussion call me we'll
talk about it sometime the point is one
Bell represents a difference in a
relative power of 10 with a decibel
being 1/10 of a Bell so if one value is
10 decibels higher than another it is an
order of magnitude greater whereas a 20
decibel difference will be two orders of
magnitude greater and so on and so forth
well hold on a second Linus if it's a
unit of relative rather than absolute
measure then how can we possibly say
something like this as a three decibel
antenna or this fan is rated at 21
decibels you see that next to the
decibel symbol for that fan that is how
it's all about context decibels have
been adapted for many different uses so
they can be expressed more easily by
defining standard reference points or a
base value in the case of an antennas
gain reputable companies will rate them
in DB D or relative to a dipole while
companies who want to show inflated
numbers will rate in DB I relative to an
imaginary antenna that radiates in all
directions and then in the case of noise
the main focus of this video we use
sound pressure level a measurement in
decibels above a base value
approximately equal to the threshold of
human hearing
okay cool Lynas odd now I know what a
decibel is but logarithmic units are a
little hard to compare in your head when
you're shopping for a cooling fan or air
conditioner or something so one buddy
told me that I can just kind of go well
a three decibel gain is an effective
doubling of sound well I heard from
someone else that it's six decibels
which is right
aha this is where things get really fun
three decibels equates
approximately to a doubling of the power
ratio but when we want an amplitude
ratio let's say to express relative
voltage or a field quantity like sound
pressure level we need to square the
amplitude which means that a difference
of 6 decibels will equate to double the
voltage or double the sound pressure
level if you measure it but that doesn't
mean to your ears a vacuum cleaner rated
at 6 decibels lower than another will
actually sound half as loud as the next
leading brand or whatever your ears
don't hear increases in sound pressure
in a linear fashion in fact depending on
the frequency of the noise the general
rule of thumb is that it takes somewhere
between a 6 to 10 decibel increase in
sound pressure to achieve a perceived
doubling of loudness alright Linus I get
it now but why do we need a unit of
measurement that appears to have been
designed to confuse people and make
comparisons difficult fair question
there is the bit about how human
perception of sound and also light
actually is more closely related to the
logarithm of intensity rather than the
intensity itself but the main reason is
that it allows the use of much smaller
numbers in cases where we need to
compare values that can differ by many
orders of magnitude instead of saying
these speakers don't end billion times
louder than to beat human hearing
threshold we just say it's a hundred
decibels SPL but if you're sitting there
worried about how you're ever going to
remember all of this fear not wikipedia
has a handy dandy chart that you can
reference next time you see a loudness
rating in decibels so that you have some
context for interpreting the otherwise
truthfully pretty confusing numbers
speaking of confusing today's episode
sponsor is Linda comm an amazing way to
increase your understanding of a variety
of topics without unneeded confusion
they offer thousands of courses with
more added every week all taught by
