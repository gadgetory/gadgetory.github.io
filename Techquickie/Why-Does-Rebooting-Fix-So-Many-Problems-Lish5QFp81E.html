won't miss any future videos we've all
been there
your computer won't respond to mouse
clicks the keyboard on your smartphone
is stopped working or your game console
suddenly get stuck in perma screenshot
mode
fortunately there's often an easy fix
for these catastrophic crashes turn it
off and then turn it back on again and
then often times the issue has
mysteriously vanished like sleeping off
a night of heavy drinking but why does
rebooting or at least restarting a
problematic program seem to be some kind
of magical cure-all for your technology
well it comes down to the fact that most
computer freezes happen because of some
kind of mishap that your system can't
recover from
on its own think of it this way suppose
you're on a road trip and you see that
the road is blocked off ahead because a
truck overturned and spilled 5 tons of
thumbtacks
but that doesn't pose a problem for you
since you can just take the nearest exit
navigate a few back roads and then get
back on the highway a short while later
but then let's say later on you come
across a collapsed bridge that's the
only way to access a river for hundreds
of miles on either side unless you
somehow figure out a way to your
wagon and float it across without losing
a hundred pounds of buffalo meat you
don't have any choice but to turn back
around the way you came and start down a
new path computers work similarly when
they encounter a problem if the issue is
more minor your system might be smart
enough to work around it on its own for
example if you're using a wired Ethernet
connection and your adapter starts to
misbehave it can transition over to
Wi-Fi no problem so that you can carry
on computing kind of like the thumbtack
truck example but in more serious cases
like the collapse bridge your computer
simply can't find a way through or
around once they occur and it has to
start back at square one
sometimes code is written in a way that
whatever program you're running expects
resource it's using to be present and
behave a certain way a good example of
this is certain blue screens of death in
Windows such as the infamous page Fault
in non paged area which in layman's
terms means that Windows was trying to
access a piece of data in memory that
simply wasn't there and the code doesn't
know what to do next kind of like when
you encounter a vaguely worded Exam
Question on a topic you didn't study in
this case rebooting forces the windows
code to reload from the very beginning
getting your system functioning again
but even if your computer isn't
hopelessly stuck in a blue screen it may
be running very sluggishly
due to a temperamental individual
program badly written code can be
stymied when it encounters an unexpected
problem like in the Windows example or
certain conditions can cause it to run
in what's called an infinite loop like
that like a trick Dictionary that keeps
sending you back and forth between two
words loops can hog lots of CPU time on
your computer since the program won't
stop and they can also make it difficult
to force quit the program meaning that a
reboot can break the loop and get you
running again so that you can angrily
uninstall the offending application and
even applications that are behaving more
or less normally can open up background
processes that can hog memory or CPU
cycles or be affected themselves by
other malfunctioning programs so a
reboot will kill those processes and
when your system starts back up only
what it normally loads will be present
in memory and since errors that programs
simply aren't smart enough to recover
from or so common turning it off and
turning it back on again has become one
of the key components of becoming your
family's resident IT expert along with
the basic ability to search Google for
troubleshooting tips speaking of
