aspect of how video streaming websites
like YouTube Netflix and Hulu work
without it you wouldn't be able to
stream such high quality high frame
videos like this one first some math
let's say you're watching a video with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels that's
like 2 million pixels per frame and in
this case you've got 30 frames per
second that's a whopping 62 million
pixels per second if each pixel needs 24
bits or 3 bytes of information you're
looking at 178 megabytes of data per
second
completely uncompressed that would be 51
gigabytes of information for a single
5-minute video we've got pretty fast
internet here the office but even we can
only download like two and a half
gigabytes in five minutes that's a long
ways away from 51 fortunately a five
minute high-definition YouTube video is
not 51 gigabytes it's in fact more like
72 megabytes
that's like 700 times smaller how did
they do that that's the magic of video
compression which works mostly by
minimizing redundancy in the video data
now there are all sorts of different
ways to compress video and lots of
different video containers and codecs
but I won't go into detail about that
because lattice already covered it in
this episode and frankly I still don't
really understand at all even though I
am employed as a video editor so don't
tell Linus so here's what you need to
know there are two ways to compress
video spatial compression and temporal
compression also known as intra frame
and inter frame respectively seriously
who names this stuff anyway I'm going to
describe each of these in terms of the
JPEG image format and the MPEG video
format spatial or interframe compression
is applied only to individual video
frames to compress a video frame you can
use the same process that's used to
compress a still image like a JPEG when
a JPEG is created color information of
the image is reduced in a process called
chroma subsampling and then the image is
split into sections of 8 by 8 pixels
called macro blocks then all of this
fancy stuff is done to these blocks to
further reduce the file size it's easy
to see this effect on an image that has
been saved with a high amount of
compression
all those ugly looking squares are known
as compression artifacts some images
like this red square can be compressed
more than others like this complicated
photograph because the red square is
very simple with a lot more redundancy
but that's how a JPEG uses spatial
compression now for an MPEG sometimes
called a motion JPEG things are a bit
more complicated than just lining up a
whole bunch of JPEGs one after the other
to be used as video frames doing it that
way would not allow for inter frame or
temporal compression temporal
compression works again by reducing
redundancy if you go through a video
like this one frame by frame you'll
notice that many frames are almost
completely identical
that's redundancy which can be easily
compressed for example for all the parts
of this video that don't need to change
from one frame to the next like all this
whiteness around me all we need is an
instruction for those parts of the frame
which says don't change anything like
JPEG the MPEG standard breaks a video
frame into 8x8
pixel macro blocks and each macro block
receives instructions on what to do with
pixels they already have there are
instructions for staying exactly the
same for moving rotating changing color
changing completely and so on video
frames with instructions like this are
called keyframes and they use about half
as much data as an iframe which is
pretty much just a JPEG there are also B
frames which are predictions or
interpolations between I and P frames B
frames use a quarter as much data as an
iframe so they really save a lot of
space this is all pretty easy to see on
a video file that has been saved in an
extremely low quality setting like what
you're seeing right now again all these
awful square thingies are called
compression artifacts furthermore
sometimes a video file will be corrupted
or missing some data when that happens
you get an effect like this one this
particular effect is caused by a missing
iframe which would have cleared away the
old image to make room for a new one
without the iframe the list of changes
in the following B and P frames are
applied to the wrong image so now you
know why a video sometimes looks weird
it gets all blocky
those artifacts are a result of the
video compression being either too high
or else some kind of
error in the coding or transmission of
the video data now listen if none of
that made any sense everything I've said
can be broken down to one thing
bitrate the bitrate is the amount of
data or bits that are being used every
second if a video has a low bitrate it
will be low resolution and/or low
quality with lots of compression
artifacts if a video has a high bitrate
it will be high quality and/or high
resolution so the more bits you have to
work with the better the video will look
there's just no getting around that
even with the best compression methods
video compression is a balancing act
between a good-looking video or a small
file size you can't have both but if
compromise is not your style maybe
you'll like fractal design now I'm sure
you've all grown accustomed to
embarrassing torturous events happening
to line us in these spots let's look at
them now behind in this manner
blinking of moon fractal design is back
buying up all of my advertising
inventory where I was a little nervous
about doing this ad I am however
relieved to say that josh has granted me
a reprieve I guess Linus is the one he
wants to torture so we're using this
spot to thank all of you the viewers who
went to the survey page and responded so
positively to our previous fractal
design as on fast as possible that
they've decided to continue sponsoring
this show so thanks to you guys and
thanks to fractal design the company
whose cases power supplies and fans
bring all of the boys to all of the
yards be sure to check back over the
next few weeks to learn just what that
reference might mean thanks for watching
this episode of fast as possible give us

you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
