specifically 1971 a little company
called Intel introduced their first
microprocessor to the world the 4000 for
a 4-bit microprocessor that ran at a
blistering 740 thousand cycles per
second or kilo Hertz and while that's
pretty cool by today's standards that
processor would not only be uselessly
slow it actually wouldn't be able to
communicate with modern computer
operating systems and programs at all it
wasn't until the release of the 8086
processor seven years later that the
groundwork was really laid for the next
forty or so years the 8086 was a 16-bit
which by the way served us quite nicely
through most of the DOS operating system
days chip clocked it up to 10 million
Hertz or mega Hertz and capable of
accessing one megabyte of memory but
more importantly than that it introduced
the x86 instruction set that remains
with us as the intermediary between the
CPU hardware and the rest of the system
I'll be it with a few additions bolted
on to it today this is what set us down
a long road of Intel rolling out
processors in accordance with Moore's
law not a law per se but more of an
observation that every year the number
of transistors per square inch on an
integrated circuit had doubled and that
an end to that trend would take a long
time before it stopped so let's have a
look at some of the notable milestones
along the road the 386 DX in 1985 was
Intel's first 32-bit x86 processor
clocked it up to 33 million Hertz or
mega Hertz and capable of addressing up
to 4 gigabytes of system ram a
limitation that actually wasn't lifted
until almost 20 years later the pentium
generation also added the MMX or
multimedia extension to x86 a couple of
years later the Celeron 300 a was
notable for its easy and incredible
overclocking abilities according to a
non Tex 1998 article it could perform
pretty much on par with a much more
expensive four hundred and fifty
megahertz Pentium 2 but
Pentium three generation introduced
speedstep the ability to run at a lower
clock speed and power state when idle
was the first CPU from Intel anyway to
include an on die level two cache for
lightning fast access to frequently use
data and the first again from Intel
there's some dispute about who was
actually first to break the one
gigahertz barrier that's 1 billion Hertz
from there on throughout the early part
of the Pentium 4 era it was pretty much
business as usual clock speed boosts
faster ran faster frontside bus speeds
with hyper-threading technology which
you can learn more about here showing up
in 2002 and LGA type sockets that put
the contact pins on the motherboard
instead of on the CPU arriving in 2004
around which time a fundamental change
occurred Intel's desktop team continued
to chase clock speeds in excess of 4
gigahertz with ludicrously priced
Extreme Edition chips but in spite of
modern features like PCI Express for
higher bandwidth to graphics cards and
even multiple graphics cards working in
tandem for better 3d gaming performance
they struggled to compete with AMD
64-bit Athlon 64 lineup even after
adding support for AMD 64-bit x86
extension allowing a theoretical 64
exabytes of system memory and after
releasing the pentium d dual-core lineup
with two physical CPU cores on a single
chip assuring in the era of true
multitasking while the mobile unit
quietly released a little product
codenamed Banyas an efficiency minded
laptop CPU that was the beating heart of
those Centrino laptops that you probably
remember seeing and that eventually
inspired Intel's return to performance
dominance on the desktop with the core 2
lineup of dual and quad core processors
in 2006 that marked officially the end
of the gigahertz war because thanks to
greater emphasis on efficiency a lower
clock port who could smoke a much more
power hungry and higher clocked Pentium
series
oh yeah and this is where virtualization
the ability to run multiple operating
systems with necks no performance hit
more about it there on a single CPU hit
the main stream Conroe was sort of a big
deal
the very next cpu socket 1366 for the
high end and 11:56 for the main stream
also kind of a big deal
the quickpath interconnect or qpi and
slower direct media interface or DM I
replaced the frontside bus for
communicating between the CPU and the
rest of the system with the most
important change here being at the
memory controller that used to sit on
the Northbridge moves to the CPU itself
for much lower latency access to system
ram turbo boost momentary clock speed
increases when the workload power and
thermals allow also showed up here you
can learn more about that in the link up
there and on the mainstream dual-core
models the idea of putting the onboard
graphics core on the cpu package was
first introduced here and it's a trend
that continues today with Intel touting
powerful onboard graphics as an
important part of overall system
performance with supported workloads
video encoding for example potentially
performing better on the GPU than on the
CPU itself and honestly even though that
last thing I just said happened back in
the 2008-2009 timeframe whether it's
because AMD has been largely
uncompetitive for the better part of the
last decade or because Intel arbitrarily
decided that average Joe has all the
performance he needs not a whole lot has
happened since then with each new
generation bringing small improvements
updated i/o options USB 3 m2 and
thunderbolt being notable ones cool
features like improved system sleep and
wake times improved power efficiency and
with that comes more processing cores
per CPU on the enthusiast and server
platforms and finally consistent but
fairly unexcited 10 to 15% generational
performance improvements with each
passing year
speaking of improving performance
lynda.com improves the performance of
your brain on lynda.com you can watch
and learn from top experts who are
passionate about teaching they've got
thousands of video courses across a wide
variety of different topics from
business to productivity software to
video editing to photography and what's
cool about it is you can either stream
the I wanted to call them episodes but
the more like lessons you can stream the
lessons or you can download them to your
device and watch them on the bus you can
take notes as you go you can browse the
course transcripts to follow along or
search for an answer and skip to that
point in the video you can create and
save playlists of courses that you want
to watch or you can you know share that
with your friends and colleagues to
learn together basically awesome stuff
