smartphones to pick from none of which
are more prominent than the iPhone but
wasn't it just yesterday that flip
phones dominated the market actually no
it's been nearly a decade and in that
time the device that mr. Jobs assured us
had been patented up down and sideways
has evolved alongside other developments
in mobile technology to become very very
different so let's take a little journey
through time shall we the first iPhone
launched exclusively on AT&amp;amp;T for five
hundred dollars for a four gig or $600
for eight gigs of storage in 2007
brought some very important new features
to the table that ended up being a major
influence on the entire industry first
interaction with the iPhone became
almost completely touch based a big
change as most smartphones of the era
had some kind of physical keyboard
attached to them the original iPhone was
also one of the first multi-touch
devices meaning that it could register
multiple fingers at one table in
features like pinch to zoom users were
additionally treated to a web browser
that could access the whole web albe it
at cellular data speeds a breakthrough
at the time since most web enabled
phones back then could only access
specially designed sites and were shut
off from most regular web pages
the very next iPhone the iPhone 3G was
launched just over a year later and
alleviated two of the main pain points
of the original you guessed it 3G
network speeds and prices dropped to
start at $200 on contract Apple followed
this one up with the iPhone 3GS a
performance upgrade with a 32 gig option
before rolling out the iPhone 4 whose
big feature aside from the use of more
premium glass and aluminum materials
instead of plastic in its construction
and the end of 80 exclusivity was the
concept of a Retina display Apple's
marketing term that they still use
heavily today for a display with pixels
that are indiscernible from each other
at a normal operating distance a huge
improvement over
pixelated junk screens that were common
on mobile devices up until that point
this was also the point where we first
saw a front-facing camera on the iPhone
enabling FaceTime chats and for better
or for worse self-portraits or selfies
they followed this up with the 4s
variant which was faster the S is for
speed had 1080p video recording a 64 gig
option for storing it and Siri Apple's
sometimes woody voice assistant but
notably at the time
no LTE data support no that along with a
much better camera a lighter aluminum
body and a longer wider aspect ratio
screen arrived with the iPhone 5 I guess
Apple maps also showed up around this
time but that was seen by many as a
rushed out mistake
and speaking of mistakes the
next-generation 5s was accompanied for
the first time by a second body option a
plastic value iPhone the 5c will ignore
that though just like everyone did and
focus on the 5s which brought
fingerprint verification to the
mainstream with touch ID as well as a
gold finish for people who care about
the booing bling characteristics that it
shares with the iPhone 6 that replaced
it and finally addressed Apple's users
desire for more storage and larger
screens with both the 4.7 inch standard
and 5.5 inch plus model available in up
to 128 gigabyte capacities not to
mention slow-mo video capture at 240 FPS
and near field communication supporting
Apple pay which brings us finally then
to the latest model the iPhone 6s whose
primary innovations are that it can
record up to 4k video to its
lightning-fast nvme based on board
storage and 3d touch which allows the
screen to distinguish hard presses
versus soft presses and execute
different actions accordingly what a
journey right it sure has been but even
though the iPhone has come a really long
way in just eight years a number of
common criticisms remain even now the
bass iPhone has a near 60
gigabytes of storage which especially
now that iOS has grown over its nine
iterations is simply not enough and
Apple still gives their users no way to
insert an SD card for additional storage
and although Apple's innovation on most
iPhones has been well-received
they have been slow to adopt some of the
features commonly found on competing
Android handsets such as 1440p or 4k
screens on top of that the iPhone also
keeps its reputation for being a closed
environment that discourages tinkering
and self repair with all that said
though the iPhone is probably going to
remain a mainstay on a smartphone seen
for a very long time
meaning that shouting matches between
Apple and Android fans in comment
sections just like what is probably
below me here aren't going anywhere soon
speaking of things that aren't going
anywhere your business if you can't
figure out how to stop wasting time on
paperwork sitting at your computer at
the end of the day when you're just
tired and don't want to deal with it
anymore instead of spending your time
getting rested and doing the work that
you're supposed to be doing and that's
where FreshBooks comes in it's an online
tool that you can access from your
iPhone or other phone or mobile device
that makes invoicing getting paid and
tracking your expenses easier all those
little details about like how many hours
you worked on this job and your cash
flow are in one place so you always know
where you stand and it shows a full
history of each invoice allowing you to
check if your client has viewed it and
also allowing your client to pay via
credit card through fresh books so if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff that makes you feel like a boss
and fresh books is the easy way of doing
your billing online so you'll have more
time to do the work you actually need to
be doing head over to fresh books comm
