used to hdmi 2.0 as the new normal with
its support for 4k resolution at 60
Hertz making it a viable option for
gamers and enthusiasts but there's
already something much more impressive
on the horizon the recently announced
HDMI 2.1 of course going from 2.0 to 2.1
might not sound like a huge leap for
mankind
think about how unexcited the transition
from windows 8 to 8.1 was but this new
revision of hdmi actually has massively
enhanced capabilities first up let's
talk resolution 4k 5k and even 8k our
child's play for the new hdmi 2.1 which
supports content at up to 10k and
although the hdmi forum hasn't yet said
if 10k means the typical 16 by 9 aspect
ratio with about 10,000 pixels across or
something more widescreen and cinematic
it definitely far outstrips the 4k
resolution of older HDMI
perhaps even more impressively though
HDMI 2.1 can handle these absurd
resolutions at equally absurd framerate
we're talking 120 Hertz at 10 K which
makes even the a K 60 Hertz capabilities
of the latest DisplayPort revision 1.4
look positively pedestrian and although
you would need a seriously incredible
video card in your computer to push that
many pixels in a game you can still
perhaps look forward to ultra smooth
movies and videos on YouTube at
staggering resolutions and on the
subject of gaming hdmi 2.1 will support
its own variable refresh rate technology
simply called
game mode vrr this allows a source
device like a PC or a game console and a
connected display to synchronize their
refresh rates and thus avoid pesky
screen pairing similar to Nvidia g-sync
and AMD freesync which you can learn
more about here hopefully this will
finally make adaptive refresh much more
accessible than the fragmented bundle of
ecosystems that we have now and that's
not all it can do to make your content
look more real than ever before
like hdmi 2.0 2.1 supports HDR or high
dynamic range which expands black and
white levels as well as color ranges
especially in bright and dark scenes you
can learn more about HDR here but hdmi
2.1 takes the concept a step further
with dynamic metadata this allows the
exact range of luminance to be varied on
a per frame basis and although the
existing dolby vision HDR standard also
supports dynamic metadata it's a
proprietary standard whereas the HDR 10
standard is open meaning more devices at
lower prices and of course HDMI carries
audio along with your video so there are
improvements for your ears as well we'll
be getting a feature called enhanced
audio return channel enabling objects
based on schemes like Dolby Atmos and
DTS X meaning each sound in the movie or
show that you're watching is encoded as
its own specific object instead of just
having a limited number of discrete
channels making positional audio more
realistic whether you have four speakers
in your setup or 24 but all of this new
stuff means hdmi 2.1 needs a larger pipe
with higher bandwidth 48 gigabits per
second to be exact which is over twice
as much as hdmi 2.0 and even faster than
current MDOT 2 PCI Express SSDs
there is bad news though in addition to
buying a new TV a new source device and
new copies of all of your content you
will even need new HDMI 2.1 cables to
take advantage of the higher resolutions
just make sure that you don't get
hoodwinked into buying one of those
thousand dollars silver ones from wire
world racing against the clock as a
freelancer challenging yes but with the
growth of the internet there's never
been more opportunities for the
self-employed and come on did you have a
degree in accounting already I didn't
think so
but fresh books just launched a new
version of their cloud accounting
software that is designed to make your
life simpler and save you time not to
mention help you get more organized you
can create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments with just a
couple of clicks you can see when your
client has seen the invoice and put an
end to the guessing games you can take
deposits you can track your expenses
basically it's flippin awesome but don't
take my word for it check out the 30 day
unrestricted free trial that we've got
