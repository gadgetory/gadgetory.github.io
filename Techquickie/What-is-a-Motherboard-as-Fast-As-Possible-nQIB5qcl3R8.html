when she tells that story that I've
heard like a hundred times but when I
was young and crying up the nose and and
I just wish you'd stop telling that
story ah that's a joke know where the
CPU or the central processing unit is
colloquially referred to as the brain of
a PC the motherboard or the mainboard is
often described as the backbone it's the
component in a PC and for that matter
pretty much any other electronic device
whether it's a game console C II device
a piece of industrial equipment or a
cell phone that contains all the slots
that everything else goes into alright
so how do I find it well that's usually
pretty easy because it's the largest PCB
or printed circuit board inside the
device and it's covered in slots
connectors chips and other electronic
doodads at it's very core a motherboard
is just a bare PCB and contains no
actual processing power it relies on
other processors like the CPU and GPU
which are sometimes socket it in and at
other times soldered on directly to
perform all of the actual work and give
life to your device but that doesn't
make it simple motherboard designers are
tasked not with creating a simple
platform onto which everything else will
be stuck like Lego but rather with
crafting and infrastructure for some of
the fastest and most delicate
electronics imaginable even though the
majority of the other components used in
the system aren't manufactured by the
motherboard maker they are responsible
often for choosing these components for
their placement and configuration and
making sure that every signal will be
sent where it's needed interpreted
correctly then passed to where it needs
to go and all of this without excess
interference even something as seemingly
trivial as a single trace that's a
little bit too long can cause one
electrical signal to be a little bit
late and another a little bit early and
causing stability that's why you'll
sometimes see little zigzag patterns and
the traces on a PCB those aren't for
beauty they're not for looks everything
about a motherboard is highly functional
a motherboard also isn't purely Hardware
either there's a software or firmware
component on a PC this is referred to as
a BIOS or UEFI and is often the
difference between a
motherboard and a great motherboard this
software acts as a way for the
manufacturer to correct small bugs that
are inevitable with something so complex
and to add functionality in the future
it also serves as a way for the user to
alter settings or tweak them for optimal
functionality on consumer electronics
this software component also exists but
it's normally not user accessible
alright so what if my motherboard dies
which might even be while you're sitting
here watching this video well for
consumer electronics and phones and
whatnot you're often hooped
if you can find a new one there are
often extremely fragile cables and
connectors attached to them and if you
can't find a detailed guide on a site
like I fix it for example I would
recommend leaving it to the pros for a
PC life is a bit simpler many pcs use
industry standard components including
the motherboard but many others use
proprietary and expensive alternatives
so the only way to find out for sure is
to contact your manufacturer directly
but there's a good chance that you'll be
able to get your hands on something once
you've got a new one replacing a PC
motherboard is in many cases not
difficult but it can be time-consuming
and tedious and will usually involve
removing pretty much every other
component in its system in order to
extract it and replace it the good news
is you can check out one of the
excellent PC build guides on my other
channel and that will tell you pretty
much everything you need to know about
installing a motherboard any other
questions you might have can likely be
answered on the Linus tech tips comm
forum where people are friendly and
happy to help
speaking of friendly and happy to help
hotspot Shield take special care of our
community members and has been not only
a sponsor of our videos but also a
supporter of the users we refer to them
complaints and questions from folks on
the line of spec tips form are easy for
me to escalate and get resolved so I
guess that's great but what exactly is
hotspot Shield you might ask well it's
an easy to use VPN service which is
basically a way of obscuring your IP
from the sites you're visiting this can
be helpful if you want to make your
footsteps more difficult to track if you
want to keep others from easily finding
out your location and identity or even
if you just want to bypass geographical
restrictions such as sites that are
blocked in your region or services that
vary from one place to another like
Netflix so yeah us netflix roll we have
a free trial of their elite service
which you can find in the
in the video description and if you like
it you can use offer code Linus to save

watching this episode as fast as
possible guys like this video if you
