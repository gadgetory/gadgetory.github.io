really well kind of I'm not quite
talking about a desktop or a laptop with
all the bells and whistles I'm talking
about the little single board computer
the Raspberry Pi a tiny credit card
sized device with so many uses that it's
possibly the biggest British Invasion
since the Beatles now at first glance
the Raspberry Pi doesn't seem very
impressive especially when you get to
the spec sheet you get a quad-core arm
CPU that doesn't support all the same
instructions as a desktop or a laptop
x86 CPU a single gigabyte of RAM 4 USB 2
ports one HDMI port and Ethernet jack a
microSD slot for storage wireless and
Bluetooth and a three-and-a-half
millimeter combined video and headphone
jack huh well at least they got that
part right which is good anyway you can
try to use the PI as a general-purpose
PC for web surfing and YouTube and
whatnot but we don't really recommend
this as the default Linux distro that
serves as the PI's operating system
called raspbian isn't that great for
everyday use you can actually learn more
about that in our review of the
Raspberry Pi on our other channel here
what really makes the PI interesting is
not only a couple of slots for mounting
a small camera in an LCD display think
like the kind you'd find on the back of
a digital camera but the 40-pin general
purpose input and output or GPIO which
allows you to connect the PI to
everything from weather stations to
robots this functionality was originally
built into the PI so it could be used to
teach computer science and programming
to relatively young students but is the
main reason that it's become so popular
among do-it-yourselfers of all ages for
home projects imagine a DIY media stick
with more power and flexibility than a
chromecast thanks to open-source media
centric os's like Kodi or a dirt cheap
Home Server slow
when you connect a USB stick or an
external hard drive if you're looking
for something beyond the realm of
everyday computing though you can buy
special low-light cameras for the pie
and have a simple but effective home
surveillance server you can hook it up
to your home's entrance to create a
smart door lock or even a brewing
controller for home beer making
delicious
indeed projects range from pet feeders
to real working food dispensing robots
to even Raspberry Pi control drones but
I'd be remiss though if I didn't mention
the rasp eyes gaming potential I mean
though you're not going to be able to
run Crysis at max settings but it turns
out the pie is a great platform for
retro games of all sorts as open source
projects like retro pie are capable of
running games for everything from the
Atari to the Nintendo 64 many users have
even gone as far as to build custom
enclosures for the pie turning it into a
fully portable retro gaming machine
supporting more consoles than you'd find
at RadioShack back when that still
existed of course a lot of those
projects require you to have a little
patience and learn a thing or two about
Linux but with 10 million raspberry pies
shipped since its debut in 2012 and even
kids producing some really cool projects
there's nothing stopping you from making
something as crazy as your own fallout
pip-boy especially as there are plenty
of custom cases accessories and how-to
guides online just don't try to eat it
as it is not a real dessert it is pie
not pie speaking of learning a thing or
two about coding that's pretty much all
you'll need to know in order to use
Braintree payments Braintree whether
you're working on the next goober Airbnb
or github by the way they all use it is

too they're fast payouts and continuous
