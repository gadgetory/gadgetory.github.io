god this is Kathy
no but seriously bits and bytes are the
units to measure computer data it is the
smallest form of data and it's basically
like an on-off switch it can be either a
0 or a 1 but that's it even basic
information like a letter of the
alphabet cannot be expressed as a bit in
spite of the name alphabet you'll need a
byte which is a series of 8 bits in
order to express even something as
simple as a character of text you can
think of it as 8 on or off switches
which can be configured in any number of
different combinations to represent
different values often a letter of the
alphabet or another character for
example this is TQ for tech quickie
represented in 16 bits or 2 bytes and
this is a smiley face represented in 16
bits or 2 bytes but you're a
sophisticated guy you might need to
store data that's more complicated than
a single letter of the alphabet and the
simple answer is you're going to need
more bytes by the way these taste awful
for example even a text document that
contains only 3 characters would need
more than one byte of data to represent
it that is why we have prefixes like
kilo mega and Giga to refer to much
larger file sizes I mean otherwise in
casual conversation we'd have to say
things like oh hey man how BIG's that
song around three million five hundred
and twenty one thousand three hundred
and sixty two bytes or you could just
say three and a half Meg's so when do
you use bits and when do you use bytes
the general rule that I use is bits for
interface speed bytes for data storage
so here's an example your internet
service provider has a plan for you
that's a hundred megabit per second and
you have a file that's a hundred
megabytes don't get confused you're not
going to be able to download a 100
megabyte file size in one second with
that plan it'll actually take more like
about eight seconds because 100 megabit
is around twelve point five megabytes
where it gets really confusing ah
sometimes they represent speeds and
bytes too
like when you transfer files on your
computer from one folder to another one
so the best way to keep from getting
confused is to follow a couple of simple
rules number one rule is the big B
anytime it's denoted is four bytes the
bigger unit and a small B is four bits
which is the smaller unit big letter big
unit small letter small unit and rule
number two is you can use this simple
and approximate very approximate not
correct conversion where you take a
number that you read in bits and you
divide it by 10 to get bytes for example
that internet service provider that
advertises a hundred megabit per second
in theory 12.5 megabytes not going to
happen in the real world due to network
protocol inefficiencies or any other
snafus that might occur in the
advertised speed so it'll probably be
more like 10 megabytes per second even
if your service provider is being honest
about their speeds speaking of reading
this video is brought to you by
audible.com I've heard well and
experienced that you can download
e-books from the megabits actually no
I'm just kidding you can actually
download books from the internet you can
listen to them whether it's on your
smartphone on your couch and your car
while you're commuting or whatever else
the case may be you can even get a free
ebook by visiting audible.com slash tech
quickie where you can download pretty
much anything you want
I meant to read this book and instead
what I ended up doing is picking up the
e-book because even though it'll take
about twice as long to listen to this
book as it will to read it I don't have
the time to sit down and dedicate to
reading it whereas I can listen to it
while I'm doing other things the other
cool thing about this one is the fact
that the audible ebook is read by Jim
Collins himself which means he added a
little bit of insight and tailored the
experience to the listening version as
opposed to the reading version which was
very very cool now I'd like to change
things up a little bit for my next ebook
and I'd love for you guys to check out
the audible bestsellers list and leave
your suggestions in the comments in this
video I would like to try something that
is entertaining as opposed to business
oriented I'd like to try something that
was read by someone other than the
author so that I can have that
experience as well and as always guys
