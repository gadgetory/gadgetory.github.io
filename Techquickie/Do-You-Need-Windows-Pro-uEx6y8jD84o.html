a new computer but one key decision
remains what operating system are you
going to pick and unless you're using a
Linux distribution or buying a Mac
chances are you're going to end up with
some version of Windows or another now
at first this might seem like a
non-decision just pick the 64-bit
version of whatever the latest Windows
is and you're all set right
well maybe not because ever since
Windows XP there have been home and
professional editions of every Windows
and some additional ones from time to
time
and it isn't always obvious what the
extra money
some times as much as another hundred US
dollars will get you with a enhanced
professional license so when does it
actually makes sense well the answer
depends not only on your needs but also
on which version of Windows you need to
run as many folks still need a copy of
Windows 7 to run legacy applications so
we'll be covering 7 8 and 10 in this
episode now it's one thing if you're
thinking about getting a professional
Edition just for the extra bells and
whistles but it's quite another if you
need one to take advantage of your
hardware specifically memory if you're
running Windows 7 is a big factor here
the home premium version only supports
up to 16 gigabytes of RAM and with many
higher-end computers these days having
sometimes significantly more than that
that would be a reason to go pro windows
8 and 10 support a much more generous
128 gigabytes on their home editions
although pro could be a good option if
you need more RAM than that for
something like virtualization especially
as hyper-v windows is built-in
virtualization support is only available
in pro and higher but other than
supporting more memory than an elephant
what else do professional editions offer
well ever since Windows 7
BitLocker Microsoft's version of full
disk encryption which you can learn more
about here as well as in
crypting file system has required buying
an addition beyond just the home version
windows 8 and 10 professional include
BitLocker while for Windows 7 you'll
have to step up to the even more
expensive Ultimate Edition so if you're
storing sensitive data on your drive
that you can't afford to have stolen
shelling out more money for a fancier
version of Windows might be something to
look into and if you're watching this
the chances are you might be the de
facto IT person for your friends or
family or even work and you might find
the remote desktop connection feature in
Pro useful as only computers with Pro
Editions can be remotely controlled if
you need to fix a problem or grab a file
from another PC though it should be
noted there are lots of remote control
options other than the built-in one in
Windows we've actually talked about them
before but wait a second Linus I mean
can I just use third-party tools for a
lot of this stuff well yeah in fact many
of them are free so why should you give
more money to Microsoft well the answer
is that more expensive versions of
Windows still have some features that
are hard to get by other means or just
more difficult to do without switching
operating systems entirely such as
setting up a domain at home which can be
useful if lots of people need access to
the same resources and if you'd like to
fine-tune what they can and can't do and
if you can get your hands on an
enterprise version of Windows 8 or later
you can actually use Windows to go which
essentially allows you to run an entire
customized Windows session off of a USB
flash drive which is pretty freakin cool
so even though the base versions of
Windows have gotten more feature-rich
over the years Pro and higher versions
might still be worth a look if you'd
like an experience that's a bit more
powerful without having to run around
and find third-party tools for
everything you want to do just don't
call yourself an IT professional on your
resume after picking up a copy of
Windows Pro especially if the only
reason you bought Windows Pro was to
virtualize 10 instances of Minecraft
speaking of being a pro FreshBooks are
you running a small business
even like a sort of getting bigger
business freshbooks is on a mission to
make your life less stressful and more
organized through their easy-to-use tool
for crafting and sending professional
invoices and keeping track of your
accounting stuff like how many hours you
spent on a particular job whoo you did
it for I mean I know I know I have been
through that I have forgotten things
like that being able to accept and keep
track of the deposits that have been
paid for your work it is freaking
awesome
they even have a tool to manage your
expense reports the mobile app just lets
you take a picture of your receipts and
boom pretty much handles the rest
getting started on fresh books wouldn't
be helpful if it wasn't extremely simple
even if you're not a numbers person so
you just try it for free for 30 days by
going over to fresh books calm forward
slash tech quickie which is linked in
the video description enter tech quickie
and how did you hear about us and find
out if fresh books is right for you

accounting for your business with like

leg spool of paper that comes at the top
