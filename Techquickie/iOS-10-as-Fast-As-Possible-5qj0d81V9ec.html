September which is maybe why Apple the
tech company has made September releases
of new versions of iOS a bit of a
tradition over the last few years and
things we're no different this year with
the release of iOS 10 alongside the new
iPhone 7 which you can learn more about
here but with iOS 10 supporting iPhone
and iPad models all the way back to the
iPhone 5 and the fourth gen iPad from
2012 you don't have to shell out tons of
new money on a brand new phone to get it
but is it worth getting excited over
anyway well let's start with the way you
get into your phone in the first place
gone are the days of slide to unlock as
now you either have to press the home
button or on iphone 6s and newer just
lift the phone up to wake the screen
which could be useful if your arms are
full and it would be difficult to try to
manipulate the phone itself once you're
in you might find it a little easier to
customize what's on your homescreen I
mean they still don't allow you to place
app icons wherever you want for some
reason but they finally introduced the
ability to hide some of the preloaded
stuff you never use that you still can't
uninstall them completely to save space
on your phone a little annoying if
you're trying to remove GarageBand
iBooks or the stocks app because your
portfolio consists of 10 bucks and some
oddly colored pocket land but one thing
you probably will be using a fair amount
is the messages app which not only can
animate your own handwriting for a
personal touch but can now also show
video and image previews from a number
of different apps it can auto suggest in
different languages if you routinely
type in multiple languages and it can
convert words to emoji on the fly you
can even make your outgoing messages
stay obscured on your recipient screen
until they manually swipe them if you're
sending a private message now let's talk
notifications you no longer have to
leave the homescreen to interact with
your notifications many of them now
support 3d touch interactions and you
can now directly reply to text messages
without having to open a new window or
even unlock your phone then and this is
cool once you're done you can get rid of
all your notifications at once if you
have a 3d touch enabled device a welcome
addition for long time iOS users who
know the pain of manually scrolling
through ancient SMS messages to mark
them all as read moving on to actually
using apps here you'll find some more
useful enhancements the default phone
app can now transcribe your voicemails
without a third party service hey boss
is John um listen we're going to need an
order of about 10,000 hula hoops if you
don't have time to listen to them and
can also check incoming calls against a
registry of known spammers so you'll
know if that ring is really someone
trying to steal your credit card number
in exchange for a vacation but it isn't
just the default apps that offer more
functionality perhaps even more
importantly iOS 10 offers more robust
support for certain features of the
hardware in third-party apps 3d touch
now supports more applications and you
can now shoot high-resolution images in
RAW format in supported apps if you'd
like to work with them later in your
favorite image editing program on your
computer Siri also plays more nicely
with non apple programs you can tell her
to call you a ride through over or get
her to interact with your fitness app
because you're just too tired after all
those uh bent presses to lift up your
phone and speaking of going to the gym
iOS 10 has built-in water detection for
iPhone 6s and later to warn you if you
need to let your phone dry out perfect
even if you didn't go to the gym and you
just like keeping your iPhone
dangerously close to your big gulp no
word yet though on whether any updates
will automatically get Siri to shame you
for being too sedentary speaking of
shame it would be a shame if you
when to build yourself a awesome website
and you didn't use Squarespace to save
yourself a bunch of freaking time and
end up with what will probably be
better-looking in the end anyway
Squarespace has beautiful templates that
look great across any device whether
it's a computer or your shiny new iOS 10
iPhone 7 whatever the case may be and
they make it easy it's all cloud-based
so you pretty much whether you don't
know anything about websites or whether
you do know a little bit you go in you
kind of go page by page you put in your
pictures you put in your text and boom
you can preview the whole thing pretty
much live and any changes you make are
done immediately it's also
extraordinarily stable Squarespace
takes care of all the hosting back-end
stuff so you don't have to think about
it at all our Squarespace site has never
gone down in the years we've been using
it and the best thing is it starts at
only twelve bucks a month and you get a
