to be that overclocking your CPU that is
making it run faster than the advertised
speed was almost exclusively the domain
of super hardcore computer enthusiasts
nerds and the overclocking community was
kind of like this weird secret society
but fast-forward to the modern age and
it's never been easier to give your
processor and artificial boost many
motherboards are marketed is even being
overclocking friendly with some of them
offering one-click like dead simple Auto
tuning features and then on top of that
AMD and Intel actively promote the fact
that some of their chips can be
overclocked as a selling point but hold
on a minute
why is it then that this voids your
warranty if they're encouraging you to
do it well one term that you might hear
thrown around by overclockers is Silicon
Lottery and no that is not what they
call the Powerball in San Francisco the
term refers to the way that small
physical differences between individual
processors can significantly affect
their overclocking potential so while
your chip might refuse to be overclocked
by more than two megahertz your bodies
might be happy running at a full
gigahertz above spec because of nothing
more than dumb luck this variation is a
big part of why chip manufacturers only
warrant their processors up to a certain
speed they determine that the advertised
frequency is the one that they can
guarantee stability at and that anything
much higher may or may not work due to
the silicon lottery the way that
individual users will tend to tune their
processors differently is another big
factor so if one person applies more
voltage than another that one is more
likely to burn out sooner you know
flying close to the Sun and burned wings
and all that
so the CPU companies
look at this not unlike how they would
look at you using your new core or a
Rison processor to slice a block of
cheese instead of using it for computing
you can absolutely use it for that
purpose it's a free country
but it wasn't designed for that and they
don't want to be held liable if bits of
cheddar on the Contacts keep it from
working inside your PC and you know what
there's not much that you the consumer
can do about this legally speaking goods
that you buy generally come with an
implied warranty that guarantees that
they will conform to industry norms and
that they are fit for ordinary purposes
but even if you could debate whether or
not overclocking is an ordinary purpose
for an unlocked chip both AMD and Intel
disclaim this implied warranty in their
own express warranty that's that piece
of paper that you threw away when you
opened up the box and they are legally
allowed to do so however that doesn't
mean that you are completely without
recourse if you try to overclock your
processor and something goes wrong at
least if you have an Intel chip Intel
offers what they call the performance
tuning Protection Plan a kind of
insurance policy that you buy so that
Intel will send you a new CPU if you fry
your old one from overclocking
predictably though the more expensive
your CPU the more you'll have to pay for
this service
AMD at this time doesn't offer a
comfortable plan with all of that said
whether your team blue or team red the
good news is that modern consumer CPUs
tend to be exceedingly reliable and very
rarely fail at stock speeds and voltage
or even slightly boosted ones which
means that it isn't likely that you'd
ever need to use that warranty anyway so
we're not saying don't do it we're just
saying that if you decide to overclock
and throw your warranty in the garbage
be a little conservative with how far
you push your settings specifically
voltage that's the big killer so do your
research to determine the widely
accepted safe voltage range for your
model of processor before you proceed
bottom line don't do anything odd
stupid and you will probably be fine
speaking of being fine do you find
yourself as a freelancer or
small-business owner not fine are you
just tired because you're at work all
day dump plumbing or teaching dance
classes or whatever it is that you do
and then you have to go fight with
complicated accounting software at the
end of the day well FreshBooks
