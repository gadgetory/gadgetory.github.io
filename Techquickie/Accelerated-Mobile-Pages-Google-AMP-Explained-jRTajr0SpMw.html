won't miss any future videos so mobile
internet sure has come a long way since
the days of downloading sick ringtones
to our flip phones but using a browser
on the latest smartphones still presents
some challenges clunky advertisements
that take up the whole screen Rises
you're about to scroll down poor
responsiveness caused by too much page
clutter and spotty connections in some
areas that can all be incredibly
frustrating and all of these issues were
the inspiration for Google's amp project
something you've probably taken
advantage of without even realizing it
you see whenever you run a Google search
on the mobile device you might notice a
small lightning bolt icon beside a given
search result to let you know that if
you click on it you'll be served an amp
version of that page now this page won't
come to you directly from the site
you're trying to view instead after the
administrator of the site creates an amp
version of the page it'll be
automatically pushed to a CDN or content
delivery network oh and by Google or
CloudFlare these amp caches then push
the page to your phone with the goal of
improving loading times but this isn't
the only difference between an amp and a
regular page if one of your favorite
sites often takes a long time to load
the culprit may not be a server with a
slow connection instead there might be
complicated HTML elements that take a
long time for your browser to render
poorly written CSS that makes the page
looks like a mess or scripts to ask for
more resources than your device can
easily deal with so instead of allowing
website owners to design their pages
however they want amp uses its own
customized and stripped-down versions of
HTML and JavaScript these prevent the
implementation of layouts that are slow
clunky or disruptive to the user
like the dreadful full screen as I
mentioned before in fact one of amps
built-in restrictions is that as could
only take up a certain amount of space
on the screen you'll still see them of
course but an amp page should mostly be
the actual content you want to see
rather than the scammer screaming at you
about the fat busting juice cleanse and
amp is also smart enough to judge the
relative importance of each element of
the webpage so if you're trying to read
an article about the latest big scandal
it'll try to load things like the
article text and an unflattering picture
of your local politician before say an
ad that you won't see until you scroll
to the end of the page combine all this
with limiting other resource hogging
effects like animations and amp ends up
doing a pretty decent job of making the
mobile browsing experience less rage
inspiring overall now it does have its
limitations the restrictions on page
elements and style neither the works
best for news articles consisting of
mostly text and a few still images
rather than highly interactive websites
for suited to a desktop browser but if
you are doing loss of your browsing on
mobile see if you notice the difference
the next time you load up an aunt page
after all this new world of constant
connectivity has gotten us all amped up
on instant gratification so if it can be
slightly more instant so much the better
