of our jobs they'll eventually decide
that the world just really doesn't eat
humans that badly and will do away with
us altogether but then haven't you ever
wondered how this incredibly rosy vision
of the future will come to pass well I
can tell you that it'll probably involve
neural networks now we tend to think of
artificial intelligence as the
capability of a computer to make
sensible decisions on its own kind of
like a human and as it turns out it's
more human-like than you actually might
think computer scientists and
programmers have modeled the way that
computers arrive at their decisions
after our own brains at least to a point
so inside your nervous system your
neurons are arranged in such a way that
after information is taken in one group
of neurons we'll pass that information
to the next group in a way that depends
on what signals the previous group was
sending okay so for example then if
neurons in your muscles sense that
they're working really hard because
you're going out for a run those neurons
send out signals through a specific
pathway that ultimately results in your
brain telling your diaphragm to breathe
harder rather than you know send a
message to your hair to grow faster and
although the way that our neurons work
is immensely more complicated than an
artificial neural network made up of
ones and zeros the neural networks used
in machine learning are at least loosely
based on the workings of your brain
instead of neurons made up of DNA and
cytoplasm though a software neural
network uses processing nodes stacked
into many different layers so a node in
the first layer which initially receives
the data waits all of its incoming
connections by multiplying each piece of
data by a certain factor depending on
the connection it then adds these
numbers together and if it's above a
certain threshold the node sends it
along to a node in the next layer and
then so on and so forth
once the data gets to the end of the
neural network the network has
effectively made a decision based on
waiting this combined and then
recombined data across many of these
layers now all this probably sounds
quite abstract but basically neural
networks use thousands or millions of
these nodes to turn those numbers into
something useful
of course even the most sophisticated
neural network isn't gonna know right
off the bat how to differentiate a
picture of a burrito from a body pillow
just like a baby doesn't pop out of the
womb already knowing how to speak the
King's English
so instead developers train a neural
network by feeding it lots and lots of
both relevant and irrelevant inputs so
for something like a self-driving car it
might be a ton of images including some
of pickup trucks as the data gets fed
into the network developers monitor its
behavior and then adjust the weights on
the processing nodes until the desired
output is reached and the system can
eventually quickly differentiate a truck
from a bicycle or baby stroller or
stationary object or what have you the
whole idea is very general purpose so it
can actually be adapted to lots of
different situations other than the more
well-known examples that we've already
discussed like image recognition and
autonomous vehicles neural networks have
been used for everything from filtering
spam out of email to training computers
to play video games nearly as well as
professional level human players of
course training a computer to think is
more complicated than getting it to run
a bunch of predefined instructions and
as such training a neural network can be
quite time-consuming and depending on
the application require some pretty
powerful hardware in fact the computers
in current self-driving cars are not
only more powerful than your standard
desktop PC
they are notorious battery hogs but as
processors become more efficient and our
training methods become less tedious we
fully expect that one
our cars and spam filters might be even
smarter than we are so even if they do
decide to turn on us take over the world
and rule and tyranny at least we won't
have to deal with scan emails from
Nigerian Prince's or terrible drivers
anymore private Internet access supports
a variety of VPN protocols and types of
encryption and authentication to allow
you to dial in the exact level of
privacy protection that you need they've
got apps for Windows Mac OS Android iOS
Linux and Google Chrome with support for
other platforms coming you can connect
up to five devices at the same time with
a single account and their apps include
features like DNS leak protection ipv6
leak protection and an internet kill
switch that will block all traffic if
the VPN becomes disconnected
unexpectedly so check it out today at
the link in the video description so
thanks for watching guys like dislike
check out our other videos leave a
comment if you have a suggestion for a
future fast as possible episode and
don't forget to subscribe to tech
quickie and ring the bell
it'll look really closely make sure it's
