subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so you know
how even some of the nicest smartphones
on the market feel disposable in the
sense that you'll inevitably end up
feeling pressured to buy the newer
sexier version a few short months later
well strap yourselves in here guys
because it actually seems like with
their newest software update Apple is
trying to allow users to squeeze a
little bit more life out of yesterday's
hottest devices I mean of course you'll
need more recent hardware to use all of
its features
but iOS 12 will support gadgets as old
as the iPhone 5s from 2013 and it may
even get a little snappier Apple is
claiming up to 40% faster app launches
as tested on an iPhone 6s but
performance improvements tend to be
standard fare for mobile OS upgrades so
let's look at some features that are a
little more unique
although the augmented reality or AR
space has been largely pretty stagnant
one cool way it's being put to better
use in iOS 12 is that your device will
be able to measure the dimensions of a
real-world object simply by pointing the
camera at it so this is a quick way to
tell if say you'll be able to avoid
paying those gouging level bag fees on
your next flight and while we're talking
about the camera the Photos app is a
little more powerful for the shutter
bugs out there as you can now edit RAW
images right from your phone though you
will have to import them from an
external device the app will also
introduce a facebook ask feature though
that will suggest that you share photos
with the people who are in them just in
case Apple didn't already have enough
information about who you hang out with
Ben if you'd like to hand them even more
info syria's anew feature called
shortcuts that can execute a number of
user-defined tasks for you almost macro
style with a single voice command at
this year's WWDC Apple showed this off
simply
having an employee tell Siri I'm heading
home which prompted her device to ping
her roommate activate appropriate smart
home features and give an estimated time
of arrival but if you don't want Siri or
anything else on your phone chirping at
you
iOS 12 offers some more robust options
to deal with that as well Do Not Disturb
can now auto cancel if it detects that
you have left a certain location or if a
calendar appointment has ended so you'll
actually start getting messages again
once your boss finishes droning on about
social media analytics or whatever and
you can change your per app settings
directly from the lock screen now - so
if an app keeps bugging you with
irrelevant headlines you can tell it to
STFU permanently quicker than ever
making matters even better the
notifications that you do want also got
revamped and we are finally getting
Android style group's notifications that
will sort things according to app and
thread which is especially useful if
your inbox is constantly getting slammed
of course constant notifications might
be a sign that you're glued to your
phone a little too much so iOS offers
activity summaries both for yourself and
any offspring that you may have produced
and you can restrict usage time per app
though parents out there we would ask
that you please don't do it for you -
because I'm tech wiki as it's an
educational Channel write as form emoji
well you can limit those these are
similar to an emoji but they allow you
to look like yourself instead of a lion
or a piece of poo or whatever though you
will need the iPhone tens depth sensor
in order to use this particular new
feature even if you are rocking older
hardware though you can still enjoy the
front-facing camera a little bit more
now that you can FaceTime with 32 people
at once whoever's talking automatically
gets the bigger tile similar to Skype
group calls iOS 12 is also bringing
student ID integration to both iPhone
and Apple watch to make it easier to get
into your dorm or pay for overpriced
textbooks if your student at Alabama
Oklahoma or Duke you'll be among the
first to get this functionality and
faul but more schools will be added
later on this year finally iOS 12 is
trying to secure more than just access
to the campus gym it now offers a secure
password generator built-in similar to
third-party password managers like
LastPass and can even autofill those six
digit security codes that you get over
SMS putting us one step closer to the
iPhone no longer even requiring a user
to operate it at all are you interested
in computer science then check out
brilliant a problem solving website that
teaches you to think like a computer
scientist instead of passively listening
