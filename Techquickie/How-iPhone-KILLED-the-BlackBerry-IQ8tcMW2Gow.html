iPhone hit the scene in 2007 maybe for
you it was busting out your Motorola
RAZR at Warped Tour but for a lot of
others it was actually the blackberry
but beyond the botanical name and an
addictiveness that led observers to call
it the CrackBerry the blackberry was
actually a very different kind of
smartphone from what we're used to today
was actually initially marketed to
businesspeople as an alternative to
lugging around the slow heavy laptops of
the late 1990s and early 2000s in fact
blackberry employees even gave the
devices away for free trials to people
that they saw using laptops encouraging
them to give the BlackBerry a try
because it was an always connected
device that would instantly notify the
user if they got a new email now because
email was quickly becoming a preferred
method of communication for businesses a
device with push email notifications as
well as an ergonomic full QWERTY
keyboard that made typing significantly
easier than on other handheld devices
caught on pretty quickly remember guys
this was before touchscreen technology
became widespread and all those cellular
data speeds at the time were very slow
sending and receiving a few lines of
text in an email didn't require much
bandwidth so suddenly there was this
device that was much more convenient
than either a laptop or a Palm Pilot
which for the earlier models had to be
synchronised manually with your PC so
blackberries quickly found their way
into the hands of executives and
politicians everywhere not just for
email but also to keep their personal
information safe thanks to the
additional encryption of blackberry
messenger compared to traditional SMS
instant messaging this at the stage for
the company to keep expanding and
eventually release a very successful
line of devices that we would recognize
today as true smartphones albeit still
with the full physical keyboard that
became one of BlackBerry's signature
features and then the iPhone hit the
scene
and it didn't take long for the
BlackBerry to fade away into obscurity
but why was this just a result of hype
from Apple's flashy advertisements with
white earphones well it turns out that
while that may have been a factor
blackberry also missed some key
indicators about where the industry was
headed when the iPhone was announced
blackberry was still growing by leaps
and bounds and they didn't see the point
in trying to compete with a device that
they viewed as something for younger
less serious consumers and to boot the
BlackBerry execs assumed that cell
networks simply wouldn't be able to keep
up with how much data the iPhone was
designed to send and receive instead
blackberry decided to keep selling
primarily to business users that wanted
a secure platform and honestly it kind
of seemed to make sense at the time as
this was exactly the formula that
vaulted blackberry to their position as
a major player on the phone scene
however business users were much more
easily wowed by the iPhone and later
Android phones as well then blackberry
anticipated not only did the touchscreen
centric design of competing phones have
more futuristic sex appeal iOS and
Android were more open platforms in that
Apple and Google designed them
specifically with third-party developers
in mind that could release thousands of
apps to expand their devices
functionality blackberry on the other
hand continued to rely on first party
apps at least in part because it still
thought of its phones as just that
phones rather than the do at all devices
that now dominate the market the
death-knell though didn't come until
companies started figuring out that the
more consumer focused iPhones and
Android phones that their employees
already owned were just as capable as a
blackberry if not more so so at that
point
turns out businesses just love saving
money who knew right
they generally started having their
employees bring those to work and use
them for that too instead of investing
in a
fleet of BlackBerry's and I mean there
were other missteps to remember how
controversial Apple's decision to dump
Adobe Flash was well although it was
inconvenient at the time
Apple was ultimately correct that the
mobile industry would move away from it
but you can learn more about here by the
way blackberry on the other hand
continued to make supporting flash a
priority even though the hardware inside
their phones wasn't powerful enough to
run it anyway
they also stubbornly ignored that
consumer sentiment was rapidly shifting
toward favoring touchscreens over
physical buttons including on the
business side so all of this meant that
Blackberry went from controlling over
40% of the American smartphone market in
late 2009 to zero in 2016 that's right
my friends
blackberry the company has stopped
making their own phones altogether now
the BlackBerry name is still around and
the flavor of Android that current
Blackberry phones run is still being
worked on by blackberry but long gone is
BlackBerry's custom-built mobile
operating system and the phones you see
on the market are actually made by other
companies under licensing agreements for
the name don't feel too sad for
blackberry though I tried one once and
it was honestly wonderful it was both
tart and sweet at the same time I hear
it's absolutely fantastic in PI's just
