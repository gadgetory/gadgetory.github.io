your favorite coffee shop sipping an
overpriced latte
Chino thing and browsing whatever the
drama of the day is on Reddit I'll tell
you doing it securely although public
Wi-Fi networks are useful for staying
connected on the go
they're also notorious for being easy
for attackers to spy on and see a heck
of a lot more than just the dank means
that you send to your friends so why are
these networks so insecure what are some
of the common ways they get attacked and
what can you do to keep prying eyes away
from your browsing habits even though
public Wi-Fi hotspots have been around
since the early 2000s and people have
generally become more aware of online
security risks since then there are
still a number of common vulnerabilities
that attackers can exploit for instance
many public Wi-Fi networks use no
password or encryption of any sort in
which case attackers can see all the
traffic on the network and you actually
don't even need any special hacking
skills to do it there are plenty of
programs floating around that enable
spying on unsecured networks with just a
few mouse clicks
now you might assume that public Wi-Fi
that uses wpa2 PSK the standard dataflow
encryption in most modern routers is
safe and that would be true in a home
setting as you're only sharing a
password with people you trust but in a
public place like a cafe anyone with the
password who connects before you do can
spy on your handshake the communication
that occurs between your device and the
access point when you first connect to
the hotspot in this way an attacker can
steal your encryption key and see all of
your traffic even though your connection
is encrypted public Wi-Fi is also
susceptible to something called a
man-in-the-middle attack which is just
what it sounds like a bad person sitting
in between your device and the internet
looking at all of your stuff as it flies
by many times this kind of attacker will
set up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot
that looks like a legit one if you
connect to it your internet traffic will
go right through the attackers computer
possibly allowing them to see whatever
you're doing okay Linus I get it public
Wi-Fi is about as secure as a screen
door made of cheese but is there any way
that I can use it without broadcasting
everything I'm doing fortunately yes
there are a number of things you can do
to protect yourself
number one use HTTPS you know that thing
that encrypts your connection and puts a
little lock icon in the corner of your
browser many websites that require
logins such as Gmail and Facebook use
HTTPS by default but for sites that
don't you can actually download browser
extensions that for sites to use an
HTTPS connection as long as the site
supports it some of these will also
enable sending your cookies over a
secure connection to prevent cookie
theft which you can learn more about
here this allows your traffic to be
unintelligible to attackers even over an
unsecured Wi-Fi connection or number to
use a virtual private network or VPN for
more serious security this will create a
secure tunnel between your device and a
proxy server that encrypts all traffic
even if the site you're visiting doesn't
support HTTPS VPNs are available as both
free and paid services and often let you
choose between various tiers of service
depending on your needs and finally
number three make sure to ask the
management at whatever establishment
you're visiting what the name of their
actual Wi-Fi network is to avoid
connecting to a fake access point
remember identifying fakes won't always
be as easy as not connecting to the
shady white van parked outside Wi-Fi
network and this is related to our topic
today sort of I mean apps are online and
we're talking about on anyway don't read
about it too much
Braintree yes my friends if you're
building a mobile app and looking for a
simple payment solution Braintree

way to go check out their V dot 0 SDK

saying try out brain free today and see
how it works for you so thanks for
