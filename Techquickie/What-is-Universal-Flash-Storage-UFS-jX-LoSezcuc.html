developments in storage has been the
microSD card with capacities of hundreds
of gigabytes on a card about the size of
your fingernail they've enabled awesome
storage flexibility in tons of small
devices that even full scale home PCs 20
years ago couldn't dream of but in this
age of say 2/3 and PCI Express drives it
is clear that the bottleneck of most
storage formats is still one that people
want to overcome and that is speed and
this is especially relevant to micro SD
as these small memory cards are becoming
increasingly popular as a more primary
storage device such as in a netbook or a
smartphone or Raspberry Pi
well enter universal flash storage or
ufs a new format that aims to ultimately
replace micro sd and although they're
both about the same size yeah physically
and in terms of capacity right now ufs
promises to be a heck of a lot quicker
most mainstream microSD cards have
sequential read and write speeds below
100 megabytes per second and even
high-end UHS 2 cards have a theoretical
cap of 312 megabytes per second one
direction or 156 megabytes per second in
full duplex with most cards being slower
than that ufs on the other hand can
perform sequential reads at up to 530
megabytes per second which essentially
matches high-end SATA 3 SSDs write
speeds will be as high as a hundred and
seventy megabytes per second allowing
for better performance when recording 4k
video or taking large uncompressed
photos things that are becoming more and
more common as feature-rich smartphones
decrease in price and become more
widespread and if you're interested in
using a ufs card for things other than
just storing large files such as running
mobile apps or using it instead of a
hard drive in something like a
book ufs also has vastly improved random
performance which is usually expressed
in IAP sir inputs and outputs per second
which is the most important thing in
some ways for everyday all purpose use
something you can learn more about in
this video so the fastest current-gen
microsd cards can get a little over
3,000 i ops 4k random reads but you FS
cards can do up to 40,000 read and
30,000 bright ions that's not quite as
fast as a current mid-range SSD which
might get around 70,000 I ops but that
is still insanely fast for such a small
card and several thousand times faster
than your typical mechanical hard drive
so not only do these increase speeds
mean better performance they might also
give us greater flexibility with regards
to app storage options as many
developers haven't allowed their apps to
run directly off of microSD cards
due to concerns about responsiveness and
since devs might be more open to having
their software run off of us fest cards
you're not going to be as hamstrung by
your phone's internal memory and you
might even get well more value optimized
choices for your next phone since
manufacturers won't have to maintain
SKUs with a bunch of different
capacities inside you can just put in
your own storage add in the
significantly lower power consumption
compared to microSD which will keep your
battery powered up for longer especially
if you're taking pictures or recording
videos and ufs looks set to make our
mobile gadgets even more useful than
ever before though you might have to
wait a bit to take advantage of it
Samsung just announced you FS quite
recently in the cards haven't quite hit
the market yet not to mention that there
aren't any readers for them however this
might be good news for those looking to
buy a Galaxy phone in the near future
especially as Samsung has developed a
slot that can accept both micro SD and u
FS cards even though the two formats
aren't electrically compatible but
regardless of your device of choice keep
an eye out for u FS card soon because
nothing could be worse than your micro
SD card depleting your battery while
you're in the
playing Pokemon go could anything be
worse than that no it could not speaking
of things they couldn't be worse does
your job suck are you bored with a
lynda.com membership you can watch and
learn from top experts who are
