and boy this time ever fly it seems
we've worked our way all the way down to
Q the 17th letter of the alphabet and
the first one that I can't think of a
single desert name for so if you guys
come up with something post it down in
the comments please for now the official
name of the new mobile OS from Google
will remain a mystery regardless of how
sweet sounding it ends up being though
there should be a boatload of new
features to enjoy once it actually
starts getting pushed out to our phones
so let's have a look at some of the
highlights grabbing and sharing a
screenshot has been easy for years but
it's been a lot trickier to actually
record what's happening on your screen
if you need to send a video of something
funny or instructional now Apple has
supported screen recording natively
since iOS 11 but on Android we've had to
rely on third party apps we'll know more
Android hue will feature a native option
to capture your display now it's unclear
whether you might have to go into the
developer options to enable it or not
but either way it should be a very
useful feature another very overdue
change is the ability to alter accent
colors now I personally don't think
there's anything displeasing about the
default blue but Android cue will let
you change key UI elements to black
green and purple in the beta and there
might be more colors on the way also if
you don't like the new-school circular
icons for apps and whatnot you can
switch them back to rounded squares or
even teardrops
if that tickles your fancy speaking of
fancy if you've ever wanted to use
certain Android services on your desktop
because you strongly prefer a keyboard
to mashing your sausage-like fingers
against the little tiny screen Android q
is going to make that a bit easier by
providing a desktop mode natively so if
you connect your phone to a monitor
you'll get an interface that's much more
mouse and keyboard friendly so you can
finally use chat snap without tons of
spelling errors or at least without the
unintentional ones perhaps the most
useful feature though will be how
android cue lets you share your Wi-Fi
connection quickly and easily I'm sure
many of you are familiar with the hassle
of
having a friend over and they ask for
your Wi-Fi password and you don't
remember cuz it's been 18 months since
you typed in your own bloody Wi-Fi
password and then you got to go find
that convoluted string of characters and
they can check back well that sucks but
Android Q can just display a special QR
code that another phone can scan to
instantly connect to the same Wi-Fi
network no messy passwords required if
you're one of those people who doesn't
think Wi-Fi passwords are that
complicated and your concerns are more
with the camera though you might like
this one
Android Q is going to have built-in
support for a picture format called
dynamic depth which will map out what it
believes is the proper depth information
for whatever the camera sees so that
apps can produce more and better bokeh
effects as well as even 3d images on
supported Hardware finally if you're
extra exclusive and you have a foldable
phone Android Q will provide better
native support for these devices
including allowing two apps to run side
by side when the phone is unfolded with
instant switching when you fold it back
up and of course there are hosts of
smaller extras too if you slide down the
notification tray you'll see that the
battery indicator will give you an
estimated time when your battery will
die so you won't have to just rely on a
percentage privacy gets an overhaul with
Android Q allowing you to specify
exactly when apps can use information
instead of constantly sharing data like
your location in the background and
they've added easier access to relevant
settings without having to leave the app
that you're using
so in summary q is shaping up to be a
nice little update to make your device
quite a bit more interesting which is
all the more reason that I hope it
doesn't end up standing for quiche I
mean I like a good quiche but it ain't
dessert
speaking of dessert the dessert for this
