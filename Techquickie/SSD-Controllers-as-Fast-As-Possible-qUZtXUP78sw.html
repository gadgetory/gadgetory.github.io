solid-state drive chances are that
you're thinking about things like
capacity and speed if you've ever read a
more in-depth review of an SSD you've
probably seen talk about Drive
controllers and how they have the
potential to make or break a drives
overall performance but what exactly is
a drive controller well think of it this
way if you were to go to the local
hardware store and just buy a toolbox
it's not very useful unless you're
putting stuff in it and while it's
possible to use your toolbox despite
dumping stuff in it willy nilly you'll
get a lot more out of your general
toolbox experience by sorting your
pliers and nails and whatnot into the
little compartments so it'll be easier
to find stuff when it comes time to
tackle your next big project this
process of sorting your stuff in a
storage container is very similar to
what an SSD controller does just like a
toolbox can't sort the tools itself the
flash cells on your SSD that store data
need something that can fill them up
sensibly with ones and zeros and talk to
the rest of your computer the SATA data
connector on your SSD is wired directly
into your SSDs controller which
processes the data and then sends it to
your drives flash memory so because the
controller is responsible for actually
putting data onto the SSD lower-end ones
can create a bottleneck or even be less
reliable due to hardware and or firmware
differences unfortunately the reasons
behind why one controller is better than
the other aren't always clear because
manufacturers treat controller designs
like trade secrets so it's a little hard
to analyze sand forces signature blend
of 11 herbs and spices compared to
Samsung's secret sauce that actually
just turns out to be Thousand Island but
what we can tell you is that nicer
controllers in higher-end drives are
connected too many memory cells at once
for faster throughput a little bit like
how GPUs contain many compute cores that
work in parallel to help you get higher
frame rates but what are some of the
other important ways a controller keeps
data flowing smoothly well one of these
is we're leveling on
like a traditional mechanical hard drive
that will generally last until the
moving parts wear out SSD flash cells
can only be written and rewritten so
many times so imagine a shelf instead of
always putting data on the lowest
easiest to reach one the controller will
try to write all cells evenly to extend
the usable life of the drive as a whole
controllers also handle a couple very
important features called garbage
collection and trim unlike hard drives
where data can just be overwritten at
will SSDs store data in blocks that must
first be erased before new data can be
written garbage collection handles this
by marking certain parts of data within
the block as stale if they're ok to be
replaced with newer data moving the
remainder of the still good data to a
new block then finally erasing the old
one the problem with this is that when
you go to delete a file garbage
collection doesn't mark the deleted data
as stale so garbage collection actually
keeps copying these data to new blocks
needlessly using up write cycles this is
where trim comes in an operating system
command that tells your SSD controller
which pieces of data within a block are
actually parts of deleted files so they
won't stick around both improving
performance and increasing the lifespan
of your drive which is critical if you
want your SSD to last the four years
it needs to so it can store an entire
election cycles worth of dankmemes
speaking of that Squarespace simple
powerful beautiful 24/7 live chat
support and email if you need help
setting up your website that you can get
for twelve dollars a month and if you
buy a year you get a domain thrown in
with that website as well when you're
setting things up there's responsive
design so that your website that you're
building based off one of their many
awesome templates will look great on a
huge variety of devices and if you want
to sell something you can do that as
well using their commerce module if you
just want one Stingo page that just
looks really good you can use their
cover page module which also works just
great and now they have Squarespace
start an app that allows you to create a
simple one-page site that I just
kind of referenced from your mobile
device you can start a trial with no
