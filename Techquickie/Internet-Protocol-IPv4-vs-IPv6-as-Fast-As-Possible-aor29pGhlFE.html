rules that governs the exchange or
transmission of data between devices on
separate networks it's got two main jobs
and for both of them an easy comparison
can be made to the mail system so number
one is addressing hosts and that's an if
everyone on earth just came up with
their own idea of how they should go
about sending an item to someone ideas
like putting the return address inside
the box for better personal security or
sending out six of the same thing to
everyone on a city block to ensure that
at least one of them will reach the
intended target may be well intentioned
but would create a ton of unnecessary
overhead leading to inefficiency the
internet protocol dictates the header
format of a Datagram or packet similar
to the label on a package as well as the
way the data payload is nested within it
to improve efficiency number two is
routing or predicting and selecting the
best possible path for data transmission
across network boundaries this function
is mostly performed by routers and it's
the equivalent of your parcel let's say
it's heading from the west coast of the
US to France reaching a courier hub in
Chicago where the decision gets made to
forward it to New York than Paris
instead of letting it make stopovers in
Brisbane New Delhi Moscow and Toronto
along the way seems pretty
straightforward right
well actually we've got a small problem
at the moment ipv4 the first non
experimental version of the Internet
Protocol and a cornerstone of the
Internet as we know it has only received
relatively minor revisions since its
original development in the late 70s
when the digital lifestyle we enjoy
today with all of these connected
devices all around us was basically
science fiction so it has some
limitations that ipv6 was designed to
deal with first up ipv4 allows for only
about four billion unique addresses
which might sound like a lot but once
you do the math it's not enough for
every device on earth to have its own
address and without a unique address
there's no way to ensure that a packet
is being delivered to the correct
destination ipv6 replaces ipv4 32-bit
address with a 128 bit address that
allows about 340 trillion trillion
trillion addresses enough for every
person on earth to
billions of addresses for every device
they own well hold on a second - four
billion is already not enough how did we
make it this far
great question aside from reusing IP
addresses one of the main ways we've
alleviated the need to have more of them
is through network address translation
this is kind of like apartment numbers
two completely separate buildings can
each have an apartment number 804 in
much the same way that your PC at home
can have the same 192.168.1 ever private
IP address as UPC at work but their data
never gets missed delivered in the same
way that those apartments have different
public street addresses all of those
overlapping private IPs are behind
unique public IPS from which all the
traffic appears to originate well that
sounds great - why can't we just keep
doing that once again great question
that is not a bad thing and you can keep
using it with ipv6 if you want it brings
some real benefits to the table in terms
of control and convenience if you were
to switch IPs for example but security
is a mixed bag with its inherent
firewall like features considered good
but the fact that it messes with packet
tampering prevention protocols like
IPSec considered bad and on top of that
NAT adds performance overhead and
increases the complexity of peer-to-peer
connections which are great for file
sharing communication and much much more
which leads into my next point
simplicity having each device be able to
address every other device on the
network will improve performance
directly and on top of that with ipv6
devices can auto configure themselves
rather than relying on DHCP to get an
address and the header data that must be
included with every packet while
actually larger to accommodate the
longer addresses has a ton of extraneous
stuff that's been cut out to reduce
overhead while allowing more
customizability for the future
sounds great Linus but just like we
predicted that we need 64-bit processors
to address more memory we knew this was
coming
so why didn't we switch to five or even
ten years ago the answer is
compatibility trying to access a website
that only runs ipv6 from an ipv4 system
just wouldn't work
there's no backwards compatibility built
but that said older hardware can
sometimes be upgraded with new firmware
for compatibility modern PC operating
systems and even most phones out there
have been ipv6 capable for some time now
so the issue actually isn't on our side
as consumers know it's the internet
service providers holding us back once
again moving to purely ipv6 equipment or
dual stack gear that can operate with
both protocols is expensive doesn't
offer an easily communicated benefit to
Joe average customer and most troubling
of all removes the need for carrier
grade nat solutions that add overhead
but also give your isp a great deal of
visibility and control over the traffic
in and out so why would they bother
given how fond the average isp is of
important stuff like maintaining net
neutrality which I would encourage you
to read up on because whether it seems
important or not the net neutrality
debate will have a profound impact on
the way internet communication works in
the future regardless of when we
transition to ipv6 speaking of reading
up on things not everyone has time to
sit down with a book and catch up on
their reading and for those folks
there's audible.com honorable comm is
the premier source for audio books
online with the selection of over a
hundred and fifty thousand titles
they've got dry stuff like you just
listen to for the last six minutes and
just kick back and enjoy an opposites
attract love story stuff like 1+1 by
Jojo Moyes nothing to do with the phone
by the way the best part is that if you
head over to audible.com slash tech wiki
and try out their monthly membership you
can get a free she's like put like a
fancy graphic tree with little sparkles
