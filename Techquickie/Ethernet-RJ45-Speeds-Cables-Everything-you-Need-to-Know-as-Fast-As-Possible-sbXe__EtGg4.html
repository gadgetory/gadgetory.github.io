that's right rj45 Ethernet cables we're
gonna tell you everything you need to
know as fast as poss is this all you got
whoa there we go
that's more like it if you live on the
planet Earth you've probably seen an
rj45 Ethernet cable and a jack that it
goes into at some point so it'll be on
the back your computer on the back your
modem network switch wherever else like
that and then the cable plugs into it
with a nice little locking connector
just like that but what actually affects
the performance of this interface the
number one factor affecting the
performance of the link speed is the
rated link speed so the most common
speeds now are ten hundred which runs at
100 megabit per second gigabit which
runs at 1,000 megabit per second and ten
gigabit however because the ports and
the cables all look the same
superficially you sometimes have to get
down to the little details to see what
speed a device is capable of running at
another alternative is checking the
manufacturer website or looking on the
side of the box one of the challenges
however is that the way that
manufacturers denote the speeds can
often vary so here are four different
ways that you might see one gigabit per
second actually written data signal
integrity is also affected by the cables
so it can be rated at ten gigabit all at
once but if you have a low quality cable
in between your speed is going to be
degraded and not down to five gigabit
it's going to go all the way down to
gigabit you can only go in full steps so
make sure you have a cable that's rated
for the correct speed and the correct
distance the most common cable types
these days are cat 5e which is rated for
a hundred meters at gigabit speed but
only 55 meters at ten gigabit speed and
cat six which is actually rated for a
hundred meters at full ten gigabit speed
however it's not always easy to tell
what type of cable you're looking at so
look for the fine printing on the side
of the cable in order to tell you
exactly what type you're dealing with
it'll tell you the thickness of the
wires inside as well as the category
rating it's usually pretty easy to tell
if there's a performance problem with
your network for example that file that
normally transfers in ten seconds might
be taking a hundred seconds all of a
sudden because it's running at a slower
speed you
the problem isn't caused by the network
card itself so there's a few things that
you can do before you go ahead and
replace your cable number one I always
do this first is take the connector and
plug it in and pull it out a few times
this can scratch off any corrosion or
oxidation on the connectors and can give
you a better connection between the
cable itself and the network interface
card or the router the next thing you
can do is check your cable run do you
have any really tight bends or any kinks
in the cable these can cause problems
and they can make it so that your signal
is degraded last thing I'd check is make
sure that you're not actually running a
cable that's too far maybe you have a
single 100 meter cable and you go aw
well it's rated for a hundred meters it
should be fine
what if it's running into a switch
somewhere that has some internal cabling
what if that is been running another 1
meter or 5 meter cable that goes out to
another device that's where you can run
into trouble with the distances so once
you've checked all those things and you
still aren't getting the connection you
need it might be time to replace your
cable with something that runs a higher
category or a higher quality internally
