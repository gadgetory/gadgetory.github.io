painstaking research you finally decided
on a pair of fancy headphones replace
those crappy little earbuds that came
with your smart phone and good for you
but unfortunately actually using them
often isn't a matter of just plugging
your cans into a headphone jack
you see nicer headphones often need more
power in order to operate properly due
in part to their high impedance which is
a measure of how much something resists
electrical current high impedances allow
headphones to be built in ways that can
result in better overall sound quality
but they also mean that they often need
an amplifier in order to drive them
properly if your headphones don't get
enough power not only will they be too
quiet to enjoy but they also won't sound
right in different frequencies meaning
you've just paid a lot of money for nice
headphones that won't sound nearly good
enough to justify their cost but how do
you know if an amp is even necessary
typically many cheaper headphones or
headphones that are designed
specifically to work with portable
devices such as smartphones will have
lower impedances usually 35 ohms or less
making an additional amplifier
unnecessary in most cases but once you
start getting to 50 ohms and higher
amplifiers can make an audible
difference and north of 100 ohms you'll
definitely need one if you're wondering
how much impedance your headphones have
this can usually be found pretty easily
on your product packaging or a spec page
so if it turns out that you need an
amplifier what should you pick other
than following the usual steps of
checking online reviews and manufacturer
reputations a good place to start is to
determine not only your headphones
impedance rating but their efficiency or
sensitivity which is a measure of how
many decibels the headphones will output
per milliwatt or millivolts if your
headphone specs don't give a number it's
easy to look up efficiency or
sensitivity ratings for lots of popular
models online once you've got one of
these numbers you can enter it along
with your impedance rating on one of a
handful of freely available headphone
power calculator
online a few of which will be listed in
the video description down below you can
then tell how many milliwatts you need
to get your headphones up to a certain
level of loudness a good idea is to
assume 110 decibels which is about 10
lower than the threshold of pain after
you've gotten this number just have a
look at whether the power output of the
amp you like is at least that high this
will be listed as how many milliwatts it
can put into a certain number of ohms so
make sure the power output is sufficient
for your headphones impedance many amps
spec sheets will say things like this
model can put 40 milliamps into 300 ohms
to give you a better idea of exactly how
much juice it can provide it's also a
good idea to get something a little more
powerful than the calculator says that
you need as many headphones can have
variable impedances depending on whether
you're listening to low or high
frequency sounds for example popular
models of Sennheiser headphones are
known to have impedance spikes in the
lower frequencies again you can look up
impedance graphs for lots of headphones
online to see if they're significantly
different than what's listed on the box
and choose an amplifier accordingly the
last main specification you should be
looking at is the amplifiers output
impedance which is separate from your
headphones impedance rating a good rule
of thumb to follow is you want to make
sure that your amps output impedance is
at least eight times lower than your
headphones impedance so if you've got a
200 ohm set of headphones you want an
amplifier with an output impedance of no
more than 25 ohms okay Luke I get it
it's super important to get the right
amp but what about the right DAC I mean
it's even in the video title come on man
well a digital analog converter can be
helpful in certain circumstances a DAC
takes the digital signal from your
computer whether it's an mp3 or flat
file or whatever and converts it into an
analogue signal that your headphones can
then
turn into sound your computer has a DAC
built-in to allow you to plug in
headphones or speakers but some cheaply
implemented Dax can pick up electrical
noise from inside your PC which can
result in hissing crackling static all
that kind of stuff
right to your headphones or speakers so
if you're experiencing these symptoms or
weird sounding audio in general an
external DAC that's outside of the
electrically noisy environment that is
your computer it can definitely help but
if you aren't suffering from these
symptoms you probably don't need an
external DAC especially as onboard
motherboard audio has improved quite a
bit over recent years but some audio
files do claim that a nice DAC can open
up the sound stage on nicer headphones
especially open backed ones so if you
really want to explore high-end hi-fi it
can be something worth considering and
although all this sounds like a lot of
unpleasant math a little work can go a
long way in making sure you get that
transcendent listening experience that
you've always wanted speaking of great
experiences fresh books is on a mission
to make freelancers less stressed and
more organized through their easy-to-use
tool for crafting and sending
professional invoices in seconds fresh
books also helps you track your hours so
when it comes time to create set invoice
you know exactly what you did when you
did it who you did it for all that kind
of stuff and you can even accept
deposits for that work through their
platform so you get paid on your
schedule they also have a tool to manage
your expense reports their mobile app
lets you take a picture and then that's
pretty much all you have to do it
handles the rest getting started on
fresh books is extremely simple even if
you're not a numbers person and they say
especially if you're not a numbers
person you can try fresh books for free
for 30 days by going to fresh books calm
forward slash tech quickie and entering
tech quickie in the how did you hear
about us section
alright guys like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it check
out our other channels like Lana's tech
tips and the much-ballyhooed
channel super fun also if you guys are
interested in the shirt that I'm wearing
the like gold-plated tech quickie shirt
thing this will be available not yet but
soon so watch that description down
below also if you want to see those
links for the power calculator things
also in the description down below leave
suggestions for other tech wiki's that
you want us to see or make videos about
I can talk sometimes let us know in the
comments down below and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
