gonna do the highlights in about five
minutes
they recap the iOS 7 and iPhone 5c and
5s launches biggest iPhone launch ever
with 9 million sold as of last month and
200 million devices running iOS 7 in the
first 5 days but if by run they mean
what my iPhone 4 does with iOS 7 the mr.
Cook and I can agree to disagree about
that particular number first up for new
stuff is OS 10 mavericks no more cat
names we're switching to locations in
California
Mavericks improves power efficiency
promising longer browsing time and movie
playback and adds memory compression for
inactive RAM having 6 gigs of data in 4
gigs of RAM sounds awesome and is much
better than swapping that data from the
SSD Mavericks also dynamically resizes
the system RAM allocated as a GPU frame
buffer so if the GP who needs more RAM
it can grab it on demand now why would
you want more RAM for your integrated
graphics well as supports OpenCL now
which means you can use the GPU to yield
better performance with supported
workloads the new software features
include better multi display support
maps and iBooks apps notifications that
can be dealt with without losing focus
on the current application document and
file tagging the iCloud keychain for
password management and a lot more it's
a single step upgrade and it's free for
pretty much anyone who bought an Apple
computer in the last half dozen years
damn the retina macbook pro about time
right is here with Haswell 4th
generation Intel Core Series processors
and 13 inch and 15 inch varieties the 13
inches under three and a half pounds and
point 7 1 inches thick it features
Thunderbolt 2 a PCI Express based SSD
Intel iris graphics up to nine hours of
battery life and AC Wireless it's also
$200 cheaper than the old model for a
base config with a 2.4 gigahertz i5 dual
core 4 gigs of RAM and a 128 gig SSD the
15-inch model is quad core Core i7 only
and gets AC Wireless PCIe SSD tech
Thunderbolt 2 up to 8 hours of battery
life and is just generally beefier in
every possible way
but on top of a discreet NVIDIA GeForce
GT 750 M option it has Intel iris Pro
onboard graphics
with crystal well which is a 128
meg cash that acts as an overflow for
the CPUs level three cache and can
assist with either CPU or GPU intensive
tasks it also gets a $200 price
reduction for the base model which has
eight gigs of RAM and a 256 gig SSD
we've got almost every detail except a
release date other than this year
sometime for the upcoming Mac Pro it
runs eons in quad six eight or twelve
core configs and can have up to 30 Meg's
of level three cache it has 40 PCIe gen3
lanes and uses ddr3 1866 ECC memory and
B can be configured with up to 64 gigs
of that and a quad channel config it
runs dual AMD FirePro GPUs in a variety
of configurations up to some pretty
overpowered looking stuff and uses a PCI
Express based SSD that can handle up to
one gigabyte per second write speeds
Thunderbolt 2 hasn't seen much adoption
but that doesn't stop the new Mac Pro
from having 6 ports allowing 3 4k
displays and overall as many as 36
devices including external PCIe
enclosures storage devices and whatever
else you can imagine to be connected
power consumption at idle is improved
but I guess that's bound to happen when
you skip entire generations of processor
technology in between your product
refreshes and idle noise tends to scale
pretty tightly with idle power but I
need you to show me load numbers and
then I'll care
mark my words guys this machine will not
be quiet under load AC wireless is
standard and a very humdrum looking
config looks like it'll run you around
$3,000 iLife suite updates include iOS 7
makeovers and iCloud integration for
iPhoto iMovie and GarageBand you can
have more tracks and GarageBand there
Pages Numbers and Keynote applications
now support live editing and some other
neato features not gonna spend much time
on that though it's not that these
updates aren't very important they are
it's just that this is called tech
quickie and creating a concert poster of
yourself isn't tech in the same way that
dual fire pro cards in a PC the size of
a novelty trash bin that sits on your
desk is with that said I work is now
completely free which is awesome free OS
and free productivity suite if I'm
Microsoft and I'm not making money on
hardware to fund the development of my
software I am scared right now I pad
larger version Apple can't seem to
decide what to call this thing from
generation to generation gets a new look
and an
name the ID has been updated to be more
like the iPad Mini and it's called the
iPad air now it's 43% thinner than the
previous model on the bezel and 20%
thinner in thickness it's 1 pound
compared to 1.4 pounds and it has the
new a7 chip same as the iPhone 5s a
refresher for those who don't remember
that means a 64-bit processor up to 8
times better CPU performance than the
iPad 172 times better GPU performance on
the iPad 1 and the m7 motion coprocessor
MIMO wireless has been added which is a
huge deal for heavy wireless users and
it's not like iPads have Ethernet ports
so yeah you kind of rely on wireless I
guess they added some other incremental
upgrades to dual mic stand out to me as
a really nice feature for better voice
communication for example it's available
in silver / white and Space Gray / black
and is expensive as balls considering
that it's a 16 gig tablet but let's face
it
apparently 80% of you are using iOS
compared to Android for your tablet
experience so it must be worth it right
it's available starting November 1st the
iPad Mini has been given the retina
treatment as expected with a 7.9 inch
2048 by 1536 display it gets a 10 hour
battery life the same a 7 with m7 motion
coprocessor combo as its big brother jet
it m7 knows where you are and so does
Big Brother
so anyway I'm sorry it has an a7
processor and MIMO wireless which means
it is dramatically faster in every
possible way than the iPad Mini 1 it
also comes in silver / white and Space
Gray / black and is more expensive than
the original iPad Mini which looks like
it'll be a continuing model there are
new colorful covers to protect your
screen and new colorful cases if you
want to protect your whole iPad and
here's pricing of the whole family of
iPad products I hope you've enjoyed this
