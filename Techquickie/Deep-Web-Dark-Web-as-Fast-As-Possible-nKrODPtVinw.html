majority of what's on the Internet is
part of something that sounds like it's
right out of a cyberpunk thriller it's
called the Deep Web and although you
might not feel like tank from the matrix
you probably use it just about every day
without even realizing but what exactly
is this Deep Web actually the definition
is quite simple it's the stuff on the
internet that you can't bring up with
Google or your favorite search engine
including everything from private social
media profiles to hidden subreddits to
medical scientific and business
databases to the archived pages you'd
find on the wayback machine and really
just any page that you simply can't get
to without having the actual URL and the
permissions to access it and all this
stuff really adds up I mean just think
of how many Facebook accounts there are
how many companies with sensitive data
and cloud storage and how many private
YouTube videos there are of god only
knows what although it's nearly
impossible to determine exactly how big
the Deep Web is it's been estimated that
99 percent of content stored on the
Internet is part of the Deep Web leading
some to compare the Internet to an
iceberg with the Deep Web being the huge
mass you can't see below the surface
except it's made up of corporate secrets
and drunken selfies instead of ice all
right Linus uh speaking of Secrets and
substances I just read a news story
about some bigshot online you know drug
kingpin or weapons dealer that got
busted was he or she operating in the
Deep Web to actually not exactly there's
a lot of confusion between the Deep Web
and the dark web which is somewhat
similar concepts but has some very
important differences unlike the Deep
Web sites on the dark web are often
meant to be publicly accessible however
you can't get to these places without
special software that usually encrypts
and anonymizes your connection in some
way the best-known system that does this
is the Onion Router or
tor which works by encrypting data when
it's sent and bouncing it through a
number of nodes until it arrives at its
destination each node only decrypt
enough of the message to know where to
bounce it next so only the receiving
user knows the actual content this
successive peeling back of encryption
layers inspired the onions name because
of tours high degree of anonymity it's
earned a reputation for all sorts of
illicit stuff like trafficking of drugs
weapons animals and humans crime for
higher scans botnets and all sorts of
other seedy enterprises but believe it
or not tor wasn't invented by some group
of online mafioso types hoping to make a
quick buck it was actually developed by
the US Navy to protect sensitive
military communications and although the
US government is busy trying to catch
those who use tor for nefarious purposes
there are a lot of nobler uses for tor
and other dark nets as well they can
provide protection to human rights
activists and oppressive nations people
with fringe political views or outside
society's mainstream those hiding from
abusers whistleblowers or just folks who
want more privacy in an age where people
are concerned legitimately about
surveillance in fact Uncle Sam actually
heavily funds the Tor project to help
people who are trying to speak out in
authoritarian countries so with the
continued growth of our social media and
cloud storage and an online community
that is increasingly aware of threats to
privacy usage of the deep and dark webs
should continue to climb rapidly but
just remember guys that even the best
security can be defeated by someone
looking over your shoulder speaking of
looking over your shoulder are you
