last couple of months especially if
you've been looking up news about the
Nexus 6 or Android 5.0 lollipop then you
may have encountered the term material
design and found yourself wondering what
the devil does that even mean in a
nutshell it's new visual and interactive
design concept from Google that contrary
to how you might initially interpret it
has nothing to do with this and isn't
really what I thought it would be either
I thought it would be like some kind of
philosophy where everything needed to
look like a real-world material like
titanium and trees no it's not that at
all instead material is more like this
hypothetical material render out of
which all the UI elements buttons icons
and themes are constructed and
constructed is key here because material
and I'm going to keep finger quilting
that must behave according to a number
of guidelines set out in Google's
material design spec sheet a living
document that was created to guide
artists to make a more unified look for
lollipop and presumably other Google
products in the future
all right then Linus so what are these
guidelines you say well first much like
construction paper material can come in
many different shapes when you look at
it head-on but while it's almost flat it
is solid so it does have a little bit of
depth to it all material is exactly 1 DP
thick even when content is displayed on
top of it which is not the same as 1
pixel thick by the way to allow for
consistent appearance on high and low
resolution displays now because material
has that depth some more rules apply
while it can change shape grow shrink
and be moved and rotated along any axis
it's solid so you can't click or see
through it two pieces can't occupy the
same space at the same time the same way
that my hands can occupy the same space
at the same time one must be above the
other and it can't pass through other
material it also can't bend or fold
alright Linus's is starting to sound
like a bunch of arbitrary hipster design
crab to me why does any of this matter
well believe it or not design
philosophies like this matter more than
you'd think because material design
extends much further they
just rules for what a play outs and
buttons look like it's a whole set of
guidelines for how we interact with our
devices including things like realistic
movement animations which combined with
other techniques for drawing the users
eye to the correct part of the screen
enables more natural interaction there
are also color suggestions so every app
on your phone or tablet can have its own
unique visual identity yet be part of a
greater whole and even advice for
developers about how to make sure their
product is accessible for users with
disabilities so while I unfortunately
cannot stand here and go into as much
depth as I could on a topic like this I
hope it was enough to explain the
importance of material design as a
toolkit for app developers to help make
the Android ecosystem feel well like
just that more of an ecosystem as
opposed to an eclectic collection of
random functionalities all bolted
together and then stuck into your pocket
speaking of an eclectic collection
lynda.com is the sponsor of today's
episode they have thousands of online
courses available in a wide variety of
subjects from business to photography to
music production to development a quick
search for material design unfortunately
didn't come up with anything today but
as it becomes more of a standard I'm
sure they will add some great
instructional content about it or even
integrate it into some of their other
courses because their library grows with
new courses every week and every course
is taught by an industry expert so you
can rest assured that you're not just
listening to some actor read from a
script these are people from the field
with real up-to-date knowledge unlike
that tech quickie guy hey who put that
in there now I'm just kidding guys plans
start at a very reasonable twenty-five
dollars per month but if you use our
link in the video description to sign up
that's lynda.com slash tech quickie you
