sticks for your computer you make sure
that they're the right speed and they're
the right voltage and even paid extra
for that SiC RGB lighting bro but when
you furiously rip off the packaging and
are just about to insert the modules
into your motherboard you notice a
strange sequence of numbers on the
stickers and start wondering what those
mean is there some crucial specification
you've missed before buying your Rams
these numbers here are called memory
timings and they are one of the factors
that determine the performance of a dram
module but how does that work doesn't
Ram frequency and megahertz already tell
us how fast it goes not quite well the
clock speed can tell us how much data
your RAM can send and receive per second
it doesn't tell us anything about
latency the delay between operations
which you can learn more about up here
that is where timings come in they give
you information about how quickly memory
can be accessed before the data starts
flying around let's start with the first
number in the string this is called
cache latency this is the time it takes
for the RAM module to start responding
to a request for data measured in clock
cycles in general this means that a
lower caste latency is better but
because different Ram modules run at
different clock speeds you have to
consider them together with the
frequency to find the total real-world
latency in nanoseconds using this
formula so check this out
slower clocks Ram can effectively be
quicker if it has a lower caste latency
something to keep in mind when buying
your memory though remember your speed
is still going to be more important
generally speaking but what about those
other numbers the second is a mouthfull
row address two column address delay or
TRC D you see Ram is set up in a grid
and your computer needs to access a
particular row before finding which
column of that row has the piece of data
that it wants so this number expresses
the small delay between row and column
access the third number is row
pre-charge time or TRP referring to the
latency
involved in opening a new row and the
fourth is row active time or tra s the
minimum number of clock cycles that a
row must stay open to ensure the data is
read or written properly that's why this
one is longer than your other timings
and how does all of this affect the way
that you configure your RAM modules when
you first slot them into your
motherboard most modern biases will have
a pre-loaded XMP profile that you can
enable to ensure that these modules are
running at their rated speed voltage and
timings but if you want to get the
fastest speeds possible you can actually
lower or tighten your timings then run a
stress test like mem test 86 plus to
validate that your changes aren't
causing any system instability I would
recommend changing each of the first
three numbers by an increment of 1 and
then validating in between perhaps
giving your RAM or memory controller a
bit more voltage of things look unstable
but to be sure check Intel or AMD s
recommended voltages to make sure you're
not going too high once you've done that
adjusts your key Ras accordingly and
you're pretty much done
once your RAM is stable although it's
been a while since tightening timings
has given a noticeable real-world
performance boost in most applications
early reports are indicating that Ram
speeds matter far more with AMD's new
rise and chips than on the Intel side so
if you really want to dive into the
world of enthusiasts tinkering and
you've got a rising base system you
might want to give adjusting your
timings a shot at the very least it'll
be something else to experiment with if
you've ever gotten tired with playing
with the RGB effects on your computer
tunnel Bayer VPN lets you tunnel to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
services as if you are in a different
country they have easy-to-use apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
have a Chrome extension just choose a
country in the app turn tunnel bear on
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
when you turn total bear on 2 things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so that
you
show up as if you're in that other
country they also have a top rated
privacy policy and do not log user
activity you can try out tunnel Bayer
VPN with 500 megabytes of free data with
no credit card required and if you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tell Abair
comm slash Linus alright guys thanks for
watching if you liked the video like it
if you just liked the video dislike it
gets subscribed to see all the rest of
our videos and hit the little bell icon
so you get a notification every time a
video of ours goes live also check out
channel super fun I've been on there
again it's been like twice in the last 4
or 5 months so that was fun it was cool
we shot some nerf rival guns I don't
know when that's actually going to show
up it might be like a few months from
now it might be before this video
happens so just stay tuned for that and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
