the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so what do
you call this symbol pound sign number
sign gate sharp octothorpe well while
none of these are incorrect many people
these days have gotten into the habit of
calling it a hash sign or a hash tag
after all those little identifiers to
see all over Twitter Instagram and other
social media services but why a hash
symbol instead of something else well it
turns out that shift 3 has been in use
in the tech world for a long time if
you're a coder you might know that it
indicates something that should happen
before the program is compiled if you're
using the programming language C which
has been around since the 1970s and even
if you're not a coder you still might
encounter them hash symbols were used to
designate channels in the popular chat
service IRC meaning hash tag sports
would be maybe a good place to argue
with football fans and this paradigm has
also carried through to more modern chat
platforms such as discord and slack it
was actually this method of organizing
chat rooms that gave one early adopter
of Twitter the idea to use the same
symbol to make it easy for users to
search for all the tweets related to a
particular topic and thus in 2007 the
modern hashtag was born now the feature
had no official support from Twitter but
the site was fast becoming known as a
place for up to the second news which
made the hashtag a natural and useful
complement to the posting style of many
users especially when they were
commenting on quickly developing current
events and so by the summer of 2009
hashtags have become so popular that
Twitter turned all hashtags into
hyperlinks and heavily used hashtags in
this trending feature that debuted in
2010 cementing their role as a topic
identifier for what was currently
popular and as other sites also look to
become sources of trending news and
discussion the hashtag found new homes
on Instagram in 2011 Facebook in 2013
and YouTube in 2016
though you should bear in mind the
hashtags don't function identically
across sites in that some special
characters will break a hashtag on some
size but not on others just make sure
that whatever you do you don't include
any
basis and to add even more effectiveness
to the concept of a hashtag indicating a
specific topic
many organizations events sports teams
political movements etc have attempted
to promote specific official hashtags
for their followers to use to help them
gain more visibility on social media or
to help organize tweets for things like
Q&amp;amp;A sessions feedback from angry
customers or contest entries now
enterprising individual netizens have
also found ways to turn the hash tag
into expressions of their own
personalities or feelings on a
particular topic some of these are
exceedingly clever while others look
like they're from people who only have a
very questionable grasp on how social
media functions but no matter how you
feel about the proliferation of hashtags
their popularity is both a method to
catalog vast numbers of social posts and
a way for us to show the internet how
clever we are means that it looks like
they're here to stay and no joke
there's even a soccer / football team in
London called hashtag United FC you know
sometimes I really do wonder if we're
all just living in a giant mean and
