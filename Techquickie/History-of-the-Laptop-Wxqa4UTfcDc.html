could fit into a single room was viewed
as a pipe dream but a similar concept to
the contemporary laptop was envisioned
all the way back in 1968 by computer
scientist Alan Kay when he conceived of
the Dynabook a gadget that bore a
passing resemblance to a modern eReader
but was perhaps surprisingly intended as
an educational tool for kids
now the Dynabook was never manufactured
but portable computing didn't take long
to become a reality
arguably the first ever portable
computer for the general public the IBM
5100 hit the market in 1975 and yes this
is an actual photo of the 5100 it
essentially looked like an entire
old-school desktop computer except with
a tiny 5-inch display capable of
displaying a whopping 1,024 characters
Wow
at 53 pounds or 24 kilograms
it wasn't exactly a backpack friendly
though to its credit it did come with a
carrying case but it was hailed as an
engineering marvel at the time because
packing all those components into one
somewhat portable box hadn't been done
before and it could be yours for the low
low price of only $9,000 equivalent to
about $41,000 today subsequent portables
the term laptop would be coined later
continued heed tiny CRT and a heavy case
trend at its launch in 1981 the Osborn
one weighed twenty four and a half
pounds and cost a much more reasonable
$1,800 so then it wasn't until 1983 that
we saw the first laptop that somewhat
resembled what we're used to today the
$8,000 grid compass which featured a
salaat electroluminescent display
instead of a CRT helping to reduce the
weight to less than 11 pounds at the
time it's 320 by 240 pixel display was
praised for being nice and sharp and it
even came with 384 kilobytes of bubble
memory an early form of solid-state
storage fun fact it's rumored that the
grid compass served as part of the US
president's nuclear football at some
point but continent destroying
capabilities aside the compass had a
huge weakness in that it wasn't
compatible with the widely used IBM PC
though it didn't take too long for
laptop manufacturers to catch on
starting in 1985 with the kaypro 2000
which came with a surprisingly handsome
aluminum shell followed by the IBM PC
convertible the next year falling prices
and at least passable portability meant
that laptops quickly became popular
among business users toward the late
1980s and in 1988 the world was
introduced to the NEC ultralight
weighing just over four pounds boasting
a thickness of only 1.4 inches which
would actually put it in the same
ballpark as some modern machines indeed
the ultralight is often credited with
being the first laptop in the world to
be called a notebook due to its compact
size however the ultra light was still
criticized for being relatively light on
features and we didn't see a major shift
in the lightweight laptop industry until
Apple rolled out the original PowerBook
100 which included their system 7
graphical OS as well as a built-in
trackball another fun fact while it's
nearly impossible to find track balls on
laptops today the PowerBook 100 was
credited with popularizing the concept
of a built-in pointing device and Apple
would continue this leadership when they
introduced the
first built-in touchpad on a later power
book in 1994 the next year 1995 saw the
release of Windows 95 which was a big
deal for laptop technology Windows 95
was able to standardize many elements of
laptop design thanks to its ability to
talk to the laptops BIOS more directly
to handle functions like power
management obviating the need for the
wide variety of bios's and drivers that
were necessary on older devices making
manufacturing simpler and increasing
interoperability another feature that's
now ubiquitous on laptops built-in Wi-Fi
first appeared in 1999 on the Apple
iBook which was even more well known for
its up interesting design subsequent
laptops incrementally added features
that we're used to today like HD screens
webcams solid-state drives and even
desktop grade graphics processing and
we've gotten some new form factors along
the way such as the briefly popular
netbook an underpowered Windows machine
with an unusually small keyboard which
was introduced in 2007 and the huge
blitz of two and one touchscreen devices
in 2013 when Microsoft rolled out
Windows 8 along with that horrendous
metro modern whatever you want to call
it Start screen thing and thanks to
smaller more efficient processors
laptops have generally become thinner
and lighter some are even in the
neighborhood of 2 pounds which is less
than 125th of the weight of the original
IBM 5100 maybe one day your laptop won't
be much thicker than a piece of paper
but then you'll run the risk of
crumpling it up if you get matted
speaking of paper do you do your
accounting on paper well that's terrible
