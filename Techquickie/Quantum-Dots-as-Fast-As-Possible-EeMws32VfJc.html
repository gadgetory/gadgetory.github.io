TV or phone purchase or whatever
figuring out which selection hits the
right price to performance ratio for
one's needs can you enough to drive
prospective buyers insane and apparently
some companies didn't think we'd gone
mad enough so they've introduced a new
style which uses a little things called
quantum dots to increase performance
over standard LCDs while undoubtedly
increasing standard prices as well
now modern LCD screens are made up of
blue LED backlights that have had a
layer of yellow phosphorous added to
them which causes their emitted light to
turn from blue to white this white light
is then filtered through red green and
blue sub pixels at varying intensities
creating the end color of a pixel of you
know whatever shade of magenta floats
your boat set in an entire array of them
and while this design enabled us to
create a wide range of colors that
pretty darn fast refresh rates the style
of white backlighting that they deployed
me their color recreation especially for
Red's a little bit on the weaker side
and this is where the use of quantum
dots in LCD screens comes in QD LCD
screens also start with a blue layer of
backlighting but instead of using
phosphorous to turn the light white red
and green fluorescent nano crystals are
used these nano crystals range from
about one and a half to a little over
four nanometers in size and actually
emit light instead of just filtering it
so when the light of the blue LED causes
the red and green dots to illuminate it
creates a pure white than before this
pure light is able to more efficiently
pass through the subpixel filters
allowing engineers to create screens
which require less operation energy to
achieve increased spectral ranges or in
other words colors are able to be
brighter and more vibrant all while the
screen is using less juice
but while quantum dot LCD screens boast
a wider range of colors compared to
their regular LED backlit predecessors
that does not automatically make them
the new king of the rainbow castle quite
a few people who have seen them in
action still testify to the superior
image quality of OLED screens this would
be largely due to variability
to shut off individual pixels creating
much darker blacks and giving them this
like massive contrast ratio there are
also a lot of people who are questioning
the ability of the initial run quantum
dot screens to handle motion blur
properly at higher refresh rates leading
many to wonder why this technology is
even being implemented in the first
place the answer of course is money as
if it was ever anything else like I
previously explained QD LCDs operate at
lower energy costs than their
competitors making them highly
attractive to anyone who wishes to
reduce power consumption and then the
other big upside to them is that the
production costs of quantum LCD panels
can reportedly range anywhere from as
low as half to a third of an OLED screen
making them extremely attractive to
manufacturers as well as budget minded
consumers because the simple fact of the
matter is that while there's going to be
the tech geeks out there like oMG to put
the word quant a minute I need 7 most
consumers already have screens capable
of displaying content meant to be viewed
at the standard of 60 Hertz or below and
don't generally seem to be interested in
forking out huge sums of money for ol
Ed's in which they may see very minimal
benefits and if you cross section like
those guys with the people who are
interested in reducing energy costs
expanding battery life on mobile devices
and potentially driving the purchasing
cost down of their next upgrade then you
arrive at this group of people that
might find quantum dot LCD technology
very very appealing because while it's
not gunning for the top dog spot with
OLED as a stopgap solution until prices
fall on OLED or new technologies are
developed it seems pretty compelling
speaking of things that are compelling
especially if you're a freelancer or
small business owner FreshBooks
it's a cloud accounting service designed
with you know people who want to spend
their time doing their work and not
spend all their time doing a bunch of
like paperwork and nonsense and
reconciliations in mind it makes
invoicing getting paid and tracking
expenses easier they've got an online
tool that helps you get your accounting
done quickly and
I mean they've got all kinds of little
cool stuff too like they make invoicing
simple your clients can pay you online
which is really neat your expenses are
automatically tracked as you spend and
all the little details about cash flow
are in one place and you can even do
things like log hours so you just update
your FreshBooks timesheet from your
phone and then it goes Boop okay project
hours that goes right into an invoice
you send that to the client and as I
mentioned before you can go ahead and
they can pay it on line so if you're
your own boss you should be using stuff
that makes you feel like a boss and
freshbooks is an easy way of getting all
that stuff done online so you can do
what you need to be doing which is the
work that you need to be doing so head
over to FreshBooks comm slash tech
quickie and don't forget to enter tech
quickie in the how did you hear about us
section linus would also be acceptable
thanks for watching guys like this video
if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it just plain suck leave a
comment under the video if you're you
know had a suggestion for a future fast
as possible episode just like this one
don't forget to check out our other
channels Linus tech tips and a channel
super fun where we have lots of like
super fun stuff going on I think that's
pretty much it don't forget to subscribe
and follow if you want to see more
videos like this and I will see you guys
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
