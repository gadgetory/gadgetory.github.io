build your own PC I mean it's gotten to
the point where DIY enthusiasts have
used the phrase Lego for adults to
describe how simple it's become but
nonetheless there are still quite a few
common pitfalls that the novice builder
and even some experienced ones still
fall into so what are a few things that
merit a little extra attention when
picking parts or during the building
process itself to save you a ton of
headaches down the line
well since part of the reason that
building pcs is easier these days is
because components are becoming more and
more power efficient we will start with
a tip on power supplies don't cheap out
on your power supply and I don't mean
avoid a well rated power supply from a
reputable manufacturer just because it's
on sale if you can find such a deal go
for it what I'm talking about instead is
finding out that your rig only needs 250
or 300 watts of power and deciding it's
okay to go for some bargain basement
unit with questionable packaging from a
brand you've never heard of way too
often these are made with cheap
unreliable components that can't even
deliver the amount of power advertised
without failing sparking or even explode
if that happens not only will you be out
whatever you spent on the psu it could
also damage whatever you have plugged
into it meaning hundreds of dollars down
the drain but let's say you've gotten a
nicer power supply anyway because you
want a multi GPU setup and you've made
sure that the motherboard you picked has
enough PCI Express slots to support
multiple cards you should be ready to go
right wrong if you're going with nvidia
sli the motherboard needs an sli
certification so unless it specifically
indicates it's compatible with the level
of sli you desire it probably isn't even
if it has multiple PCI Express slots but
if you're more of an AMD fan and you
want crossfire things will be a little
easier for you as crossfire technology
doesn't need anything other than the
aforementioned PCI Express slots so
you've got the right power supply and
motherboard and dark
busying yourself getting everything
installed in your case and suddenly you
hear a clattering noise one of those
tiny screws has slipped off your
screwdriver and is trapped somewhere in
your case possibly under the motherboard
if this happens don't be tempted to just
leave it there and deal with it later
metal screws conduct electricity so if
they touch the traces on the underside
of your motherboard they can cause
electrical shorts that could permanently
fry your system in fact part of the
reason we use motherboard standoffs is
to keep those traces from touching the
metal part of the case which prevents
electrical mishaps so make sure you
retrieve those loose screws before
turning anything on and by the way yes
you can use a magnetic screwdriver to do
this as the magnetic force is not great
enough to damage your components even
hard drives finally to round things out
here's one from the simple thing that's
easy to forget Department screw in your
graphics cards many GPUs especially
higher-end models are heavy enough to
put a significant amount of torque on
the PCI Express slot that they're
plugged into fortunately it's easy to
avoid this simply by screwing the card
bracket into your case but this is very
easy to overlook which can actually lead
to the cards weight ripping out the PCIe
slot entirely I have seen this damaging
both the card and forcing you to buy a
whole new motherboard which has happened
to people when their GPU popped out when
they were trying to plug in a cable now
there are some other boards on the
market with reinforced PCIe slots to
help keep this from happening but those
can be pretty expensive so the best
thing to do is just be mindful of these
little details so your dream rig doesn't
turn into a nightmare so what are the
some of the things that you wish you had
known before building your first PC let
us know in the comments I'd also like
you guys to be sure to like those useful
comments so that we build up a little
repository of computer building tips
below this video for people to check out
also let us know if you'd like to see
more computer building mistakes to avoid
videos like this one tunnel Bayer VPN
lets you tunnel to up 20
see different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as though you are in a
different country they have easy-to-use
apps for iOS Android PC and Mac they
also have a Chrome extension and all you
got to do is choose a country in the app
turn the switch on tunnel there and
watch as your bear tunnels your internet
connection to your new location which
does a couple of things number one your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption encryption encryption
not encryption it's the good kind of
encryption and to your public IP address
gets switched so you show up as if you
are from that other place they also have
a top rated privacy policy and they do
not log user activity you can try out
tunnel Bayer VPN with 500 Meg's of free
data and no credit card required at the
link in the video description and if you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear
comm slash Linus so thanks for watching
guys if you liked this video like it if
you just liked it dislike it if you want
to check out our other channels go ahead
right there we've got a featured video
it's going to be very good I promise
unless it's bad in which case I'm sorry
you can leave a comment with suggestions
for future fast as possible and as
always don't forget to subscribe and all
that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
