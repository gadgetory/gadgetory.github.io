of the box but if you're a Tweaker or a
tinkerer you might find the
customizability of your iPhone or
Android phone a little underwhelming
after all being able to change your
background in room tone and whether or
not Siri has a British accent only goes
so far when it comes to tapping into
your phone's hardware potential so
because of that many people have turned
to processes that remove some
limitations that's jailbreaking for the
eye sheep and routing for the fan droids
and although jailbreaking and routing
are technically quite different they
accomplish similar goals namely they
give you privileged access to the
devices operating system allowing you to
do things you wouldn't normally be able
to kind of like when neo was able to see
through the matrix except you won't be
able to stop bullets seriously please
don't try let's start with Apple iOS by
default blocks any apps that haven't
been approved by Apple and placed into
the App Store and it also forces you to
use Apple's default user interface on
top of that the iPhone hides its
filesystem from users so not only is it
tough to see all your files conveniently
that are actually on your device it also
prevents you from using the free space
as a handy-dandy USB flash drive if
that's what you're into if you have a
jailbroken iPhone though these
limitations are removed and you can
intensely customize the look and feel of
your user interface install and use any
program written for iOS no Apple
approval needed and directly access the
file system allowing you to use your
phone as a flash drive or external hard
drive and a large community has popped
up around the practice of jailbreaking
and you can find plenty of jailbreak
exclusive tweaks and apps for your
iPhone including everything from Windows
Phone lookalike themes to classic game
emulators but what about Android they
already have gaming emulators as I
mentioned before the Android equivalent
to jailbreaking is rooting which also
allows for a large number of visual and
usability tweaks as well as advanced
features like app automation the ability
to turn your phone into a free Wi-Fi
hotspot sometimes even if your carrier
doesn't allow it and even overclocking
but frankly many users do it on the
Android
for far less exotic reasons to get rid
of the annoying hard-to-remove bloatware
that comes pre-installed on many Android
devices and even change operating
systems entirely so what if you're ready
to take the plunge then and give it a
shot well jailbreaking or rooting your
phone often isn't horribly difficult a
quick google search will yield a number
of downloadable tools that you can use
to enable elevated access rights on your
device but keep in mind that since these
tools are technically software exploits
that take advantage of security flaws in
the operating systems code jailbreaking
and rooting might not be available if
you have a newer or a more obscure
device or a very recent version of iOS
or Android as some phone manufacturers
work actively to prevent these practices
when they release software patches well
hon oh wait a second Linus did you just
say their exploits all this sounds kind
of shady aren't there risks involved
well yes like many things you can do to
tweak your gadgets jailbreaking and
rooting do come with a few caveats
modifying your phone in this way can
often void your warranty and if you do
it improperly it could even brick your
device a lot of people also wonder
whether jailbreaking or rooting is even
legal I mean fine jailbreaking even has
the word jail right in it and although
I'm not a lawyer and the true answer
depends on where you live and the time
that you live in I can tell you that the
short answer for those of you in Canada
and the u.s. living in the now is yes
it's legal as long as you're not doing
it to infringe on a copyright but
remember guys that laws change
frequently so you might want to do some
digging around before you decide to
trick out your phone with that super
cool Linus theme that I'm sure one of
you has spent days working on right
no all right then that's fine anyway
I'll use this awkward silence to tell
you guys about fresh books fresh books
is a cloud-based accounting tool that's
designed for freelance workers or small
businesses it makes invoicing getting
paid and tracking expenses easier with a
phone base things you can just leg
bippity Boop here were the hours I work
bippity boop send it invoice and boom
they can pay you by credit card online
so the whole process is much simpler
because as you all know if you're a
small
this owner half of the battle is getting
the work done the other half is actually
getting it billed and paid so you can do
all kinds of little self-management
stuff that is easy now as opposed to
involving tedious paperwork and sitting
down at a computer so you can spend your
time doing the work you need to do as
opposed to just you know filling out
forms and invoices and sending up bills
and follow-ups and all that kind of
nonsense so head over to freshbooks
