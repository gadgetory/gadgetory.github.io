that my fastest possible episodes
haven't been fast enough lately and to
that I would reply but you weren't all
throwing things at me while I try to
film the bloody things maybe we wouldn't
have this problem
so with that 15 seconds of your valuable
life wasted let's get right into it a
driver is as Microsoft defines it
software that allows your computer to
communicate with hardware or devices
simple right but why do we even need
that so you've got a device let's say a
sound card you should be able to just
plug it in with no drivers and your
music player let's say Winamp
should generate a digital signal that
says you know yo sup dog I need to
e-flat up in this biz or something and
the sound card should make that noise
right well actually yeah that's
basically how it works and if there is
only one sound card in existence it
pretty much could but there's a problem
there are literally thousands of sound
devices and all of them will work
completely differently from each other
the signal that meant a flat in our last
example could mean dinosaur onion to
another and for everything to work
correctly software makers would need to
rewrite their software with specialized
signalling for your sound card along
with every card that ever existed in
every card that ever will exist it would
be fine if every single software
developer was the freaking doctor but
this is the real world not by fantasy so
that's what a driver is it acts as an
abstraction layer or translator that way
the makers of your favorite programs
only have to interact with your hardware
in one standardized language and the
driver handles the rest so that sounds
relatively simple
why do drivers cause so many issues well
there are a ton of variables that exist
for the programmers on the driver side
as well aside from our oversimplified a
flat example your hardware is capable of
a great deal of amazing stuff all of
which we expect to work absolutely
perfectly and even though standards
exist even if they weren't here to
perfectly things like other devices and
other pieces of software can cause
conflicts and on top of that separate
drivers need to be maintained for
multiple operating systems like Linux
OS 10 windows and the various flavors of
each that exists in the wild each with
their own universal language that the
driver needs to translate to it leaves
plenty of room for one of the variants
of a driver for a particular piece of
hardware to have an imperfection or two
and helps me at least understand by
sometimes a piece of hardware lacks
support for the OS I'm trying to use it
with which isn't to say that the lack of
an official driver always precludes
using the hardware on windows anyway
sometimes if you know what you're doing
you can force install one and it will
mostly work driver files are usually dot
INF files and vista drivers can
sometimes be used on Windows 7 and
Windows 8 and vice versa so pick the
correct version of Windows that is to
say 32-bit or 64-bit not Pro or ultimate
or whatever extract the files from the
Installer and give the manual browse
feature and device manager a crack
before you totally throw up your hands
and give up this trick has saved my
bacon with wireless network adapters and
other things a handful of times speaking
of saving my bacon this is from Dollar
Shave Club and it contains their
wonderful smelling shave butter and the
only thing that could be manly or about
it would be if it smelled like bacon
this majestic 6 blade razor also from
Dollar Shave Club on the other hand
couldn't be more manly if it smelled
like bacon was covered in back hair and
belched the Pledge of Allegiance every
morning before a breakfast made of bacon
Dollar Shave Club saves you time and
saves you money by delivering wicked
high quality razors and other bathroom
supplies directly to your door once per
month so you can be shaving with a fresh
blade every week without the hassle of
running to the store that way if the guy
selling you the razor drops f-bombs all
over the place brandishes a machete as
he packages it and then rocks out with a
leaf blower for some reason he is safely
on the other side of the country for the
Americans or if you're in Canada I guess
it would be the other side of the
continent and if you're in Australia the
other side of the world and if you're
anywhere else then I'm sorry there's
nothing I can do for you right now but
for anyone in those three countries
visit dollarshaveclub.com slash linus to
learn more and sign up now oh and they
also have man do I have to talk about
this please don't make me talk about
this
okay they also have peppermint scented
butt wipes for men
maybe if I used these instead of normal
butt wipes I wouldn't stink and the
human interaction made possible by my
nan stinkiness would give me the
confidence to tell you know again that's
