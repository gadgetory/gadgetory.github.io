middle of a raid trying to submit an
assignment five minutes before it's due
or about to watch an important penalty
kick when everything just freezes and
that little yellow icon says no internet
connection frustrating as it may be
unless there's been an infrastructure
failure outside of your house at least
you know a relatively easy fix go over
to your router which probably has some
indicator lights
blooping that there's a problem unplug
it wait a few excruciating seconds and
plug it back in although you've probably
missed something critical in the interim
you're at least back online now but why
does this seem to happen so often
seemingly out of nowhere well here's the
deal although we think of a router as a
simple little box that sends your
internet connection to your devices
there is a lot going on under the hood
just like a full blown desktop PC
routers have their own CPU memory
mainboard IO and even operating system
all of which help it manage data traffic
deciding what needs to be sent where and
these components of a router can get
overloaded similarly to how having 40
browser tabs multiple HD video streams
and a game running at the same time
might bring your laptop to its knees
pushing tons of data through your router
to lots of different devices can also
slow it down
sometimes to a screeching halt further
complicating matters is the fact that
most home internet connections use what
are called dynamic IP addresses you see
Internet service providers typically
assign IP addresses which are like
street addresses to help Internet
traffic find your devices to each of
their modems only for a certain period
of time when this period expires your
ISP will give you a new one but if your
router is very
busy it might not latch on to the new IP
address and continue trying to use the
old one which is kind of like trying to
receive mail at your old apartment your
router might be yelling as loudly as it
can for Google to deliver that darn
Chinese food order but no one down at
the city wok can hear it scream and
while we're on the subject of chicken
fried rice your router also might be
cutting out because it's as hot as a wok
many of us are guilty of this but
shoving your router in a corner
somewhere where it's ventilation holes
might get blocked by cables or dust can
cause it to overheat so be sure to check
that if your router is crammed behind a
piece of furniture it can actually
breathe but there are other problems
that aren't necessarily caused by a
router malfunction if you're on a Wi-Fi
connection sometimes the airwaves just
get very crowded especially if you're on
the common 2.4 gigahertz band where
noise from common household devices like
microwave ovens and baby monitors and
even signals from other nearby routers
on the same frequency can overlap and
make it difficult for your receiving
device to hear what your router is
trying to say if this is the case which
you can actually find out by downloading
a mobile app to look at nearby networks
try going into your router settings and
changing the channel or switching to the
5 gigahertz band if your router and your
device is supported it not only delivers
data more quickly but it also offers
many more channels and is less crowded
overall and if changing channels making
sure your router has cooled off and the
time-honored tactic of turning it off
and on again doesn't help will see if
your routers manufacturer has a firmware
update available sometimes intermittent
connectivity problems are a result of
buggy software that can be solved with
an easy download and a quick round of
everybody's favorite game RTFM fun time
and finally while remembering this
handful of tips we'll use
ensure your routers never out of
commission for too long if it does
happen we've got a great tip to help you
feel better keep a stress ball nearby so
you can route your frustrations into
