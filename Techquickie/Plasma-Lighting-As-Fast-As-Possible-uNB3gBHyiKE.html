matter in the universe yet many of us
don't see it in consumer products unless
it's in fluorescent lights neon signs or
those little lightning ball knickknacks
you can get in the mall but what exactly
is this stuff
well plasma is similar to ordinary gas
but the difference is it's been ionized
meaning that the individual atoms or
molecules in the gas have been given an
electrical charge by applying an outside
energy source to it such as heat or
electromagnetic radiation because
plasmas are energized in this way their
atoms can emit light by a similar
process to lasers you can learn more
about how energized atoms give off light
in this video but unlike laser light
which relies on additional equipment to
form a narrow beam many plasma light
sources are useful for illuminating
large areas whether it's a warehouse
filled with fluorescent lights a city
lit by a lightning bolt or even the
entire earth since the Sun also uses
plasma to produce light but a new crop
of plasma lamps has opened up a whole
new use for plasma light and is stealing
headlines in the photography world for
someone like me proper lighting is
extremely important whether I'm shooting
an episode of Linus tech tips or still
photos of our team members in the office
and getting my lighting setup exactly
right can be a bit tricky plasma lamps
though are trying to mitigate problems
that have faced photographers and
cinematographers for years one big issue
that we regularly contend with is
flicker you see all artificial light
sources flicker to some degree including
popular HMI floodlights widely used in
the film industry often due to the
alternating current that powers them
when you plug them into a wall and even
though a typical flicker rate of a
hundred and twenty times per second or
120 Hertz is imperceptible to the naked
eye it can be a huge problem when
shooting in slow motion or at a very
high frame rate as the camera will
easily make this flicker visible plasma
lamps though attempt to solve this
problem by converting argon gas into a
plasma because of Argon's chemical
properties it flickers at such a high
rate hundreds of millions of times per
second that the light it produces is
flicker free for video shoots in absurb
frame rates that can expose flickering
and other light sources like LEDs plasma
lamps are also more neutral in color
than many other kinds of bulbs not
unlike direct sunlight which tends to
illuminate everything without giving any
noticeable color shift although lights
like CF
LEDs often give objects a slightly green
or magenta shift plasma lamps are
full-spectrum so that the colors can be
filmed very accurately and because
plasma lamps use radio waves instead of
heat to produce their light they're also
very power efficient especially
important since many kinds of
professional lights are notorious energy
hogs so if you are serious about
shooting video or even stills plasma
lapse might be a good idea for you
especially if you don't want your boss
to freak out about the power bill
speaking of plasma lighting hive
lighting there a leading plasma lighting
manufacturer based out of the u.s. for
all your production needs they have
three different fixtures that can be
used in many versatile ways from theater
production onstage for the lighting we
used for this video the loss which is
our fixture of choice is one of the most
low power draw lights I have ever used
coming in at a mere 273 watts and giving
me the output of an incandescent light
that could easily draw six times more
power which makes it nice on the office
power ball when I accidentally leave
lights on this thing on that's actually
still not okay I don't care how any
efficient it is so thank you guys for
watching and if you didn't like this
video you know what to do but if you
liked it give a like and while you're at
it check out the channel super fun video
where Tim was pranked for nearly a year
