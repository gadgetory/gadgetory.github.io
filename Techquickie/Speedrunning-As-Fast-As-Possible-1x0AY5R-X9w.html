completionist when we play our games and
don't rest until we've explored every
crevice of every map and picked up every
single unnecessary item there's
something pretty awesome about powering
your way through a game as fast as
possible'
like when you did when you were a kid
and you use those warp zone pipes at the
end of Mario levels or was that
yesterday but anyway a large community
has sprung up around the practice of
speedrunning which is a pretty simple
idea complete a video game in the
shortest period of possible time
speedrunning videos can be found all
over the internet and part of their
appeal is that it's kind of mesmerizing
to watch games get completed at what
seems like impossibly short periods of
time so how is it that speedrunners are
consistently shattering world records
obviously being really good at a game
and having tons of practice does help
but many speedrunners commonly employ
other tactics to push their times from
being merely very good to truly
remarkable one fundamental concept is
route planning to ensure that a
speedrunner doesn't get mired in some
time-consuming part of a level this
involves studying a level very very
closely or simply playing through it
many many times to figure out which
route presents the fewest obstacles and
difficult time-consuming enemies or even
the best shortcuts to time-saving
power-ups to allow them to finish the
level in the shortest possible time
since many competitive speedrunners are
fighting for every last millisecond it's
not uncommon for them to even keep track
of parts of the game that are prone to
lag and system slowdowns and avoid those
as well
although some speedruns are indeed done
cleanly and nothing but practice and
route planning and lots of practice are
put into play it's more common to see
faster runs that employ some form of
sequence breaking which entails doing
something out of order in the game
sometimes this is done by executing
precise moves to get to an area that is
not really meant to be reachable at that
point in time but more often speed
runners will take advantages of glitches
in the game to skip ahead
save huge amounts of time since it can
take a long time for the gaming
community to discover and exploit these
kinds of glitches older games are often
more popular for speedrunning the number
of well-developed emulators available
for older games and platforms has also
made speedruns of retro titles enormous
ly popular not only because emulators
allow people to try their hand at
speedrunning without the original
console or without one that's still
working but also because emulators have
opened up a different method called
tool-assisted speed running or TAS TAS
takes advantage of emulator tools like
being able to save the game at any
particular instant call the save state
this allows the player to piece together
a near-perfect run even if they make a
mistake
another one is slowing down the game to
such a low speed that a speed runner can
execute complicated maneuvers that would
be virtually impossible to do in real
time this is in order to shave off small
little bits of time and this often
involves executing very hard to exploit
glitches for reasons that should seem
obvious tasses usually considered a
separate discipline from regular
speedrunning to keep things fair
tool-assisted runs are often posted so
others can enjoy watching the sheer
perfection of speeding through a game
fall asleep but unassisted speedrunning
is still popular for organized
competitions and high profile
speedrunning events such as things like
games done quick a series of twice
yearly gaming marathons that feature
live speedruns while raising money for
charity from the viewers which is
awesome and while watching streams of
experienced speedrunners can be a little
intimidating to those who have never
tried it
you don't need any special skills or
equipment to dive right in just watch
some runs of your favorite games and
learn the unique nuances and glitches as
you go pretty soon you might be the one
a top world leaderboards and even if not
having fast reflexes is always useful
for staving off those unexpected office
pranks Squarespace if you want to build
a website and you want to look like all
nice and pretty and stuff Squarespace is
probably a pretty
good idea you can get templates
basically everywhere on the Squarespace
website that look just awesome but if
you want to do some special stuff they
also have things like cover pages if you
want to do something like a resume
commerce modules if you want to sell
things or whatever if you wanted to make
sure it looks pretty on every device
they have responsive design so we can
look at on tablets phones desktops
doesn't matter it's only eight bucks a
month if you buy a year you get a free
domain included that's pretty cool they
have 24/7 live chat and email support
which is super helpful if you have any
problems and it's it's all basically
taken care of for you I've probably done
this integration like 300 times I think
you guys get it at this point but
they've launched something new called
Squarespace circle it's a community for
developers and designers that have
exclusive how-to materials enhanced
customer care and expert insights so
that should hopefully be super helpful
you should check that out and you should
start a trial with no credit card
required today so you can start building
your website now when you go to sign up
for Squarespace make sure to use offer
code Linus however because you save 10%
off so you should probably do that
Squarespace you should like the video if
you liked it dislike if you disliked it
check out our other channels like
Channel super-fun
speaking of unexpected office pranks
there's there's a bunch there you can
you can see all of them but if you're
like nah dude I don't want to see
unexpected office pranks I just want to
see like knowledge then you know
