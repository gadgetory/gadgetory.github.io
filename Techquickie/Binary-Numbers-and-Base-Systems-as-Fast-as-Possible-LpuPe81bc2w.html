work and inside of a microchip
electricity is turned either on or off
which is represented by the symbols 1
and 0 this is called binary you've
probably heard of binary already and
that that's how computers work but do
you know how binary works well you're
about to find out but first we need to
understand exactly how our numerical
based system known as decimal or base 10
works the way it does so there are 10
counting 10 symbols that we use for all
of our numbers starting from 0 we can
count all the way up to 9 before we run
out of symbols to use now we could just
keep adding symbols at this point but
that would get out of hand very quickly
I mean can you imagine having to
memorize a specific symbol for every
single number that's ridiculous and
that's why we reuse the same symbols
over and over again in a very clever
system called
positional notation so in the base 10
system as soon as we get to 10 or an
exponent of 10 we need to add another
digit to the left of our current digit
because there are 10 symbols
each new digit has to have a value 10
times greater than the digit to it's
right so that's using 10 symbols but
what if you had only 2 symbols to work
with well then everything that I said
still applies
with just two symbols each new digit
needs to have a value 2 times greater
than the digit to it's right so a
sequence like this would equal 1 times
128 plus 1 times 16 plus 1 times 8 plus
1 times 2 plus 1 which is 155 and that's
how you count in binary it's actually
really simple it's just multiplication
and addition now it gets a lot more
complicated from here with bits and
bytes and boolean logic and ASCII and
the list just goes on and on so let's
return to base systems there are a lot
of ways to write numbers other than
decimal and binary you've got base to
base 3 base for base 5 I could go on
they all work with the same principles
of positional notation so you might be
wondering with all these numbering
systems to choose from why do we use
base 10 that's a good question this goes
all the way back to Roman numeral
an Egyptian hieroglyphs it's likely that
we use base 10 simply because we have 10
fingers
also known as digits other based systems
like base 8 and base 12 are actually
superior for simple everyday math since
8 and 12 are much more easily divisible
than 10 but it's definitely too late to
change our minds about using base 10
we'll probably be stuck with it forever
switching away from it now would be even
harder than trying to convince America
to drop the Imperial system and finally
switch to metric you know like the rest
of the civilized world like yeah the
metric system is superior but who's
gonna tell America what to do now if
you're going to be using base 12 or any
other base system with more than 10
digits its standard to use letters to
represent numerals higher than 9 so 10
is a 11 SB 12 is C and so on this is
called alphanumeric you know those URL
shorteners that you see on Twitter and
elsewhere have you ever wondered how
they work all those jumbled characters
really just represent a very large
number by using numerals and every
letter of the alphabet you can get all
the way up to base 36 using lowercase
and uppercase letters gives you base 62
and with that you can get all the way up
to 14 million with only four digits with
just 10 digits you can get up to 839
quadrillion possible values that's a lot
of shortened URLs so you just learned
about positional notation binary numbers
numeral based systems alphanumeric
characters and URL shorteners I hope you
enjoyed it and if you're in the mood for
more learning maybe you'll like today's
video sponsor which is the excellent
lynda.com for the past six years I have
been using and recommending lynda.com to
people as an excellent means of learning
new things especially software you see
over six years ago I wanted to learn how
to use Photoshop so I googled around and
as usual many of the software tutorials
I found just assumed that I had
pre-existing knowledge either that or
they'd be out of date not have enough
pictures if any have unclear missing or
downright incorrect instructions worst
of all I was having to piece everything
together based on multiple disparate
instruction
from overlapping and sometimes
conflicting sources of information and
then I discovered lynda.com which is
pretty much the opposite of all of that
lynda.com has thousands of high quality
easy to follow video tutorials taught by
industry experts who actually know what
they're talking about they've got a wide
variety of subjects like photography
programming video and photo editing and
tons and tons of different software each
course is structured so you learn from
start to finish at your own pace on your
own terms access to all of their courses
starts at $25 a month but if you head
over to lynda.com slash tech quickie you
can get a free 7 day trial and see for
yourself just how excellent they really
are thanks for watching this episode of
fast as possible give us a like or a
dislike if that's how you feel
