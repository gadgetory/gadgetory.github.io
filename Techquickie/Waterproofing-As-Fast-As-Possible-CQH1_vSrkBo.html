with a single oxygen one to create the
harbinger of all life in the universe it
is Earth's most precious resource but
it's also the substance most responsible
for ruining our favorite outfits
electronics and parades since the very
beginning of time and that is why
waterproofing techniques have been on
the forefront of technological advances
since well technology was invented and
although nature provided us with
rudimentary water protection in the form
of tree branches and caves it quickly
became apparent that we needed to
protect our warm-blooded selves and
tribe mates from the harsh thermal
robbing effects of constant drenching
these evolving forms of water protection
came to be measured by their ability to
resist humid and damp conditions known
as damp proofing or their ability to
resist water infiltration known as
waterproofing now water and dampness
resisting techniques usually involve
covering an object with something that
will help it to repel liquids the
original Scotchgard treatment from 3m is
a great example it was used on furniture
and clothing inherently porous materials
to resist water penetration and prevent
stains from spills but modern science
has taught us that just because we can
doesn't mean that we should and the
fluorocarbons used in the original
formulation of this product we're
capable of causing liver failure and
birth defects so new techniques needed
to be developed both to overcome those
downsides and in response to new demands
like that pee repelling wall paint that
causes public urinators to accidentally
soak their pants and shoes or bringing
it back somewhat more on topic the
developments in the protection of
electronics where they originally turned
to cumbersome physical barriers that
either prevented or impeded their use
but had thanks to modern technologies
like the 2013 development of nano
material coating 1000th as thick as a
human hair are now able to protect
electronics by just covering them with
this tiny layer that forces liquid
molecules to bead and roll off of
surfaces without penetrating them
allowing for things like
the new waterproof mobile devices that
we've seen with some relying on rubber
barriers for extra protection but others
leaving exposed their headphone and
power jack so going bareback but these
methods also aren't the be-all and
end-all of waterproofing techniques and
whatever a manufacturer may claim the
best way to prevent water damage is
still to keep your stuff from getting in
contact with water which is why
waterproof headphone jacks often still
have a little rubber seal at their base
and serious waterproof items like
pelican hardcases
usually follow the old steadfast method
of encasing an item in something durable
and then tightly sealing it in which
carries the added benefit of decreasing
an object's vulnerability to higher
water or atmospheric pressure often
measured in numbers atmosphere with each
digit representing 10 meters of depth
with the only disadvantage to this
technique being that it also restricts
access to a containers contents and
anyway unless total submersion is the
plan more often than not water resisting
techniques combined with our final
waterproofing strategy controlling and
routing fluids around is amply effective
you'll see this method used in the
overflow port on your bathtub on your
house in the form of a waterproof roof
and gutters to keep liquid from pooling
and penetrating and even in Lenovo's
water rerouting ThinkPad keyboard which
can survive a direct spill on top of it
but that's the key to all of this I
guess a spill just because an item is
rated for a general type of water
protection and you can learn more about
these standardized ratings up here that
does not mean that it will stand up to
prolonged or extreme exposure cases like
rugged water sports for adventures in
the salty blue sea there is a big
difference between long-term solutions
and protective measures so just because
that new phone is rated at safe 200
meters or whatever that is not an
invitation to make dropping it in the
toilet a morning routine especially for
coffee drinkers
speaking of morning routines it sure is
hard to get up in the morning if you
stayed
all linked reconciling your accounting
numbers and you know logging your hours
for jobs no no no forget about that
freshbooks is the online accounting tool
that is designed for freelance workers
or small businesses
it makes invoicing getting paid and
tracking your expenses easier and helps
you get organized little details about
cash flow are all in one place so you
know where you stand and you can see a
full history of each invoice allowing
you to log your hours I check if your
client has viewed the invoice even pay
from within fresh books that can be an
obstacle by credit card so there's no
excuses for why they haven't paid so if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff that makes you feel like a boss
and freshbooks is an easy way of doing
all your billing online so you have more
time to do the work you actually want to
be doing head over to fresh ebooks.com

out what the actual difference in
performance from one card to another in
spite of them being identical can be
very interesting stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
