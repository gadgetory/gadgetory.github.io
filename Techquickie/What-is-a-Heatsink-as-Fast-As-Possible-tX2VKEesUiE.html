amount of complexity into a very small
space which creates a lot of heat heat
that if left unchecked could reduce the
lifespan or even destroy outright the
processor that created it that's why
when you first open up a PC or other
electronic device one of the first
things you'll see is one or more large
metal objects called
heat sinks inside a PC heat sinks will
be found on the CPU graphics card
motherboard inside the power supply and
even in other places as needed as you
can see they can look very different
from each other but they all serve the
same basic purpose to remove heat from
delicate components and extend their
lifetimes let's walk through some of the
different kinds of heat sinks you might
encounter first up is the heat spreader
this is the most basic heat sink and it
consists of a simple flat piece of metal
it only moderately improves heat
dissipation because while metal will
transfer heat to the surrounding air
faster than plastic it would be much
more effective if it also increased the
size of the area of the surface that's
being used to transfer that heat that
leads us to our next common type passive
pinned or finned heat sinks these are
basically heat spreaders with structures
on top of them that dramatically
increase the surface area that can be
used to dissipate heat to the
surrounding air they are much more
effective than heat spreaders but they
are also more expensive to make and they
take up more space speaking of taking up
space adding a fan to blow air directly
add a thinned or pinned heatsink is
relatively inexpensive and very space
efficient as a means of dramatically
improving heat sink performance for this
reason actively cooled thinned heat
sinks are one of the most common types
of heat sinks found in PC systems where
size and cost are major design factors
speaking of cost of the most effective
and the most expensive common type of
heat sink in a PC is a heat pipe or
vapor chamber heat sink for very hot
components like CPUs or graphics cards
the limiting factor of a standard Thind
heat sinks performance is no longer the
speed at which the fins can be used to
dissipate heat to the air
but rather the speed at which the heat
can be moved away from the very small
processor core to the fins in the first
place heat pipes and vapor chambers
usually consist of an outer copper wall
and a material inside that is constantly
changing phases between liquid and gas
they can be used to carry heat away from
a small heat source extremely quickly to
a large array of heatsink fins where it
can be dissipated to the air so far I've
talked mostly about surface area and how
that helps but there are other factors
that affect heat sink performance up for
example copper performs better than
aluminum as a heatsink material and
among aluminum alloys some of them are
better than others but the material
selection like many of these other
factors cannot be controlled by anyone
other than the manufacturer so it might
not be that useful to you but what can
you do to improve your heatsink
performance number one is to lower the
ambient temperature if cracking open a
window lowers the room temperature by
five degrees it will lower your heat
sink temperature by about five degrees
number two is more air flow the faster
the air moves over the heatsink the
better it will perform number three is a
better thermal interface material no two
pieces of metal will ever meet up
perfectly and thermal interface
materials fill in these micro gaps for
better heat conduction or better heat
transfer between them replacing the
subpar solutions that come pre-installed
on your components with high performance
aftermarket thermal compound can easily
lower temperatures by several degrees or
more number four is mounting a good
solid mount improves the contact between
a chip and a heatsink and ensures
effective thermal transfer often a heat
sink that isn't performing as expected
is being held back by an air bubble
trapped in between or a small component
nearby that is interfering with the heat
sinks mounting pressure speaking of
mounting pressure in spite of all the
hubbub about the NSA your digital
privacy is still under attack and
there's not much you can do about it but
that doesn't mean you have to be
