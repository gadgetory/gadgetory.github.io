than a few seconds of thought each day
to charging your phone hopefully you
remember to do it before you go to bed
and that's about it right what if you
just kind of passed out after a night of
heavy drink
csgo and woke up the next day realizing
you forgot to plug it in your battery
bank is in a night club couch cushion
somewhere and you have to leave the
house in half an hour
enter fast charging feature is supported
by some modern phones and tablets then
you power it up in the time that it
takes that'll rinse only shower grab a
cereal bar and get your shoes on
it's either reason many devices take
such a long time to charge normally is
the limited amount of power many common
wall chargers can push to your phone or
tablet at once typically five watts or
less this is a design choice that keeps
manufacturing costs for basic wall warts
low and also ensures that the relatively
small batteries inside of mobile gadgets
won't fry from being overloaded with too
much power but in reality many mobile
devices can handle more than this thanks
to internal circuitry that sets a
maximum amount of wattage that will hit
your battery at one time fast chargers
take advantage of that by adjusting the
voltage amperage or both to deliver up
to 20 watts or even higher if your
device supports the technology whoa whoa
whoa hold on a second loop supported
technology what needs to be supported
we're just clobbering a battery with
electrons well there are a lot of
factors but one of the most basic ones
is that with higher power comes higher
heat so a device without enough internal
room for the battery to expand might end
up damaged if it gets charged too
quickly so for that reason many
companies that developed fast charging
technology have implemented a
handshaking process between the charger
and phone or tablet to make sure they're
both certified to support the extra
power Samsung's fast charge and one
pluses - charge are both popular
protocols but perhaps the most
widespread one is Qualcomm quick charge
which is found in a large number of
Android devices so this means that just
because the charger says it supports 2.5
amps at 5 volts doesn't necessarily mean
that it will
charge your phone superfast and there
are other caveats as well although many
devices that support fast charging do
come with compatible chargers you'll pay
a premium for extra ones and you might
need to buy slightly nicer cables too as
cheap thin 28 gauge cords often can't
handle the extra current very well also
remember that as we mentioned fast
charging can generate more heat which is
harder on your battery and may shorten
its longevity a real concern now that so
many phones are very difficult to open
if you want to put in a new one plus
fast charging is much more useful when
your battery is significantly drained
and you need a really quick partial
charge to keep you afloat for a little
while speeds tend to taper off
significantly as your phone gets closer
to 100% so unlike filling up at a fast
pump gas station for the big rigs don't
expect to go from empty to full with
blazing speeds though at least you won't
have to pay 50 bucks every time you need
a recharge or more not everyone just
wants a VPN for privacy concerns or to
get around geo restrictions believe it
or not some people actually want to use
a VPN as it was intended to manage
traffic in a secure way countless
businesses use VPNs every day to work
securely in the office or while
traveling the downside is enterprise
level VPNs can be incredibly expensive
and complicated to set up and use subtle
therefore teams changes all of that you
can painlessly add your whole team to
the account giving you the ability to
easily change update and manage users
without complicated interfaces or setup
