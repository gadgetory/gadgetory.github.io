the name alone we knew it wasn't gonna
be a new high-end device so it wasn't
clear why Motorola was making such a big
deal out of a new mid-range product
offering
well this as fast as possible so I'll
cut to the chase as quickly as I
possibly can the Moto G delivers a four
and a half inch 720p LCD display a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU
and Adreno 305 GPU one gig of ram 3G
connectivity a five megapixel rear and
1.3 megapixel front camera and Android
4.3 with a guarantee upgrade to 4.4 in
January 2014 for $179 us for an 8 gig
model and 199 us for one with 16 gigs
there's no SD card storage expansion but
the phone does come with 65 gigs of
space on Google Drive the Moto G has a
very similar curved clean industrial
design compared to the Moto X but
customizability
has been taken a step further with
removable coloured back plates colored
protective bumpers and colored smart
screen covers real-world performance was
the main focus of the presentation with
the non-removable 2070 milliamp battery
referred to several times as an all-day
battery and rather than show us
synthetic benchmarks Motorola focused on
metrics like boot up time browser launch
time and phone call initiation then they
went a step further and compared these
numbers to a high-end phone costing two
to three times as much
now this performance was achieved by
delivering a pure Android experience
that enhances Google services rather
than competing with them for the longest
finger quotes ever so basically they're
issuing the use of custom skins and
avoiding creating non-removable apps on
the phone that duplicate the
functionality of Google applications
this is more intuitive for the phone
user and it's also a clear shotsfired
moment at Samsung and other members of
the Open Handset Alliance instead of
that other stuff Motorola focused on
value-added software development so
Motorola migrated for example ADEs easy
data migration from your old phone and
motorola assists proactively changes the
behavior of the phone when you're
sleeping or in a meeting or any other
kinds of behaviors that it can learn
over time finally the camera app has
been given an extremely simple gesture
aware UI now there was a lot
to talk about high-end performance but
at $200 or less the Moto G is not meant
to be a top-tier smartphone contender
the feature set is aimed squarely at
lower end markets FM radio is there some
music streaming will be possible in
regions with spotty data connectivity
and dual sim support will be available
in countries where that feature is the
norm as well however premium features
like 4G LTE wireless charging high-speed
dual band or AC Wireless and Motorola
zone us-based manufacturing active
display notifications and always
listening voice control from the Moto X
are all absent no the intention here
wasn't to make a high-end smartphone the
intention was to deliver a mainstream
film that doesn't feel distinctly last
gen and to position themselves as a
clear value leader in big markets like
India and Brazil around the world where
disposable income and carrier subsidies
are not as high as in North America the
other intention that Google and Motorola
remember under the same management now
basically have demonstrated very clearly
with the Nexus 5 and the Moto G is that
they want the off-brand phones with
degraded user experiences and the
premium phones with huge profit margins
to have a very hard time competing with
their own offerings it's going to be an
interesting year speaking of interesting
hotspot Shield VPN is an interesting
solution to a common problem these days
