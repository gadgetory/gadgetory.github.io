could just watch everything in glorious
for care even at the very least full
1080p HD but we've all been faced with
that unfortunate choice when watching
something that was recorded and encoded
at a lower resolution do you watch it in
a tiny little window to keep the picture
sharp and just kind of move your face
closer to the screen or do you blow it
up to full screen only to have
everything look like it was recorded on
a potato for years now many companies
have been looking for a better solution
to this or at least a partial solution
to this and it's called upconverting or
upscaling and while you mostly see it
used as a marketing tool on new
murderers or TVs you've probably used up
conversion at some point in your life
even if you've completely sworn off
optical discs for example if you're
watching a 480p YouTube video and you
make it fullscreen on your HD or full HD
monitor then the video has effectively
been up scaled to fit the screen you see
that 480p video contains about 300,000
individual pixels which might sound like
a lot but Full HD resolution contains
over two million pixels with 4k being
four times that amount so there just
aren't enough pixels then in low res
video to actually fit the whole screen
without doing some kind of a conversion
now modern displays themselves have
logic that can apply an algorithm to a
lower resolution video clip or even
something like your bios as you're
booting up your computer for the first
time and it what can do is guess what
the missing pixels should be when it
expands the video to full screen
unfortunately a lot of the time it just
plain doesn't look very good for example
if the display recognizes that there's a
lot of you know grass in sound of music
it'll fill in that grassy area with
basically big chunks of
antek green pixels that looks pretty
nasty
now upscaling logic can try to smooth
out the edges of those lines so they
don't look so blocky but this amounts to
basically an anti aliasing effect as
opposed to something that really makes
it look as though it were actually shot
you know in 4k for example so wait a
second done Linus if it's better than
nothing how do I get this up conversion
then can all screens do it and if all
screens can do it well what's the point
of those up converting DVD players that
I see at the store they just snake-oil
not exactly
so DVD it's right in the name is a
digital format but most early DVD
players only had analog outputs like
component video this means that the
signal is getting converted from digital
to analog and then back to digital again
when it goes on to your flat-screen TV
this conversion and reconversion
ultimately leads to a loss in quality so
modern up converting players have
digital output such as HDMI to avoid
doing so many conversions and they also
have their own more sophisticated up
converting logic that is arguably better
than especially what an older TV would
be able to do on its own remember though
that upscaling
isn't a real substitute for watching
native high-definition or 4k content and
an upscaled video is always not going to
look as good as something that was shot
natively and encoded in higher
definition so specifically no matter how
good your algorithm is and they're
always trying to sell the upconverting
capabilities all this new TV when it
runs at a resolution for which there's
no freaking content available no matter
how good it is you can expect some
blurriness or other visual artifacts
from the processor guessing where the
pixels should be but you should notice a
slight improvement making it at least a
way to breathe a little more life into
your standard definition videos as long
as you manage your expectation and don't
think that it's going to be as though
The Wizard of Oz was shot on a freak
naari Alexa with that said if the makers
of The Wizard of Oz had asked me if they
