the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos
technically sharing a cool image or a
video that you found online constitutes
copyright infringement yes even that
super funny spongebob meme but often
times there's no way to know if the
rights holder is the guy who runs the
sriracha sauce company who is super
chill about other people using the name
or if it's some super litigious artist
who's gonna send a tactical team of
lawyers to your house at 3 in the
morning and because it takes about two
seconds to repost something on social
media or a blog there have been a number
of efforts to make it clearer what you
can and can't do with the content you
find online with one of the most notable
being the Creative Commons license
you've probably seen these on websites
like Wikipedia and Flickr whenever you
click on an image but what exactly do
they mean a Creative Commons license
aims to find a happy middle ground
between media that the creator declares
it's in the public domain meaning that
they've made it free for anyone to use
for any purpose and works that are
protected by the full force of copyright
which by the way you should probably
assume for anything that you find on the
internet that isn't otherwise labeled
here's how it works
the Creative Commons organization
provides a number of pre-written
licenses that a creator can choose from
instead of having to draft one
themselves or hire a lawyer to do it for
them an expensive process these licenses
allow any member of the general public
to do certain things with their image
song or computer program without having
to explicitly ask permission as long as
certain rules are followed all Creative
Commons licenses require at the very
least that the user attribute their work
to the rights holder so you'll see
example of this right here on tech
quickie as you may have noticed when we
put attributions down in the corner
whenever we use a CC image simple
attribution licenses such as these are
popular among business you
such as a cafe owner who wants to play
music in their coffee shop without
having to pay royalties however other CC
licenses place additional restrictions
on how the work can be shared a share
alike license for example requires that
any transformed creation like a remixed
song also be distributed under the same
CC license creators also have the option
of banning any commercial use or
modification which could be useful if
you're say a photographer who doesn't
mind people posting high-res versions of
your pics on their personal cool desktop
wallpapers blog because it's 2002 but
doesn't want some shady character
selling canvas prints on the sidewalk
for 300 bucks a pop profiting off of
your work but line is come on what's the
point of all this
can't I just assert fair use if I'm
using something without making money off
of it actually no not only can you still
get in trouble for reusing a copyrighted
work without permission even if you're
not turning a profit but you can learn
more about up here but fair use is a
squishy-squashy subjective a legal
standard that has led to some lengthy
court battles in the past Creative
Commons licenses spell out exactly what
is and is not allowed by the creator and
the organization also provides easily
readable summaries and icons that
creators can use to label their work if
you don't want to read through all of
that messy legalese but bear in mind
that the CC system isn't perfect for
example you could still get in trouble
for distributing an image of something
copyrighted by someone else if they
didn't correctly license it to begin
with
or if the work is otherwise legally
problematic in the first place like for
example if it violates someone else's
personality or privacy rights and
although Creative Commons provides
licenses as a convenience to creators it
isn't a law firm so you can't go crying
to them if you misuse a CC license piece
of content and you get sued
just like McDonald's won't provide you
with on site heart surgery if that
quarter-pounder finally seals up the
last bit of artery that was still
