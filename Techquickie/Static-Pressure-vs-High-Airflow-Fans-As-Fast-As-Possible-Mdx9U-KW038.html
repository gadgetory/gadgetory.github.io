enthusiasts and gamers want to make sure
that they've got some serious flow going
on and no of course I'm not talking
about your questionable hairstyle but
about airflow but unlike buying say a
ceiling fan picking the biggest fastest
spinning computer fan you can find is
not always the best solution don't get
me wrong
fan sizes and rpms how fast they spin
are important but an element of fan
design often overlooked by novice
builders is whether the fan is optimized
for high airflow or high static pressure
but what does that mean I mean can't any
fan provide decent airflow if it spins
fast enough
well actually different fan blades are
engineered to move air in different ways
fans marked high airflow have one
objective in mind to move as much air as
possible through an open opening you
might see the marketing for a high
airflow fan focus on its CFM rating
which stands for cubic feet per minute
since a cubic foot is a measure of
volume then this is indicative of the
actual amount of air that the fan can
either intake or exhaust or I mean if
you think about it both going to be
about the same on the other side of the
coin our high static pressure fans
static pressure is actually a concept in
fluid dynamics but don't worry too much
you don't need a degree in physics to
understand how this relates to cooling
down your rig simply put high static
pressure fans are better at forcing air
harder through small spaces they may not
move the same volume of air as a high
airflow fan if they were both in sitting
on a desk with nothing to push through
but they typically blow air a little bit
of air more strongly so what exactly do
you want to pick one over the other well
as a general rule high airflow fans are
better suited to be used as case fans PC
cases tend to be relatively open inside
that is assuming you didn't cram a bunch
of
wiring into the front of it or like
Snoopy or something meaning that being
able to move lots of air at once can
result in more effective cooling by
contrast static pressure fans typically
find their homes on things like heat
sinks are cooling radiators cooling
components like these often have lots of
metal fins that are used to increase the
surface area of the device that needs to
be cooled and to dissipate heat so to
cool off the heat sink properly air
needs to move through these fins with a
sufficient amount of force in this
situation to make sure that the amount
of air moving through your heat sink is
high enough you've got to have high
static pressure but that doesn't mean
that static pressure fans are a
one-trick pony in fact they can often be
a good choice for chassis fans if you've
got some kind of an obstruction that
might hinder air flow otherwise for
example many cases have hard drive cages
directly behind the front intake fan so
in this situation a static pressure fan
can be more effective at getting the air
through these small gaps they can also
be useful if you have a case with very
narrow vents on the front or a fan
filter that's designed to filter the
dust out of the air but as of course
going to obstruct air flow since many
radiators and CPU heatsink come with
fans pre-installed it's a good idea to
ensure that their high static pressure
if you want to get the best performance
possible despite the fact that these
fans are better for CPU cooling some
manufacturers stick with whatever
standard airflow focused fan for
whatever reason to do your homework so
you're getting the best performance
possible out of your new cooling
solution after all there's nothing quite
like the feeling of seeing your
temperatures stay low after hours and
hours of gaming that is assuming you
didn't build your computer into the side
of an igloo you got a whole other set of
issues
speaking of igloos Braintree their code
for easy online payments means if you're
building a mobile app and searching for
a simple payment
solution you're going to want to check
it out I mean the payments API is an
extremely important aspect of any
successful app well maybe not a
successful app I mean flappy bird was
technically a successful app if we look
at it in terms of downloads but if you
want to get paid then it's a very good
idea the Braintree V dot zero SDK is one
amazingly simple integration that gives
you every way to pay I mean we're
talking Android pay Apple pay PayPal
then no credit cards even Bitcoin and if
something new pops up bringing tree is
going to be figuring out how to support
that to their used by uber Airbnb and
github so they are scalable and
integrating it into your app is as
simple as inserting a few lines of code
and if you have trouble they will help
you out by the way so try out the
sandbox learn more about Braintree and
get your first fifty thousand dollars in
transactions fee free over at Braintree

come on let's see if it works I tell
people to do it will they do it probably
not
