machine also known as the Google reveals
just shy of 9 million hits about sixty
four-bit vs. 32-bit processors I know
some of this hype was started by the PC
crowd back when AMD launched their first
desktop PC 64-bit CPU back in 2003 but
since last fall's launch of the iPhone
5s the first smartphone with a 64-bit
CPU it's become a hot topic again but
what does it actually mean for average
Joe let's start with what a bit is very
briefly here one bit is a single
character in binary either 1 or 0 so it
can only express up to two values with
two bits we can express up to four
values and with three bits that goes up
to eight every bit we add increases the
number of different values we can
represent in binary exponentially now
you'll hear about bits in relation to
all kinds of computer things from data
storage to data transmission to data
processing so that brings us back to
CPUs in the context of a processor the
number of bits generally refers to the
amount of memory it can address so while
a 32-bit processor is without PAE magic
trix limited to about four gigs of
memory or ram a 64-bit processor can
handle up to 16 billion gigabytes of RAM
hahahahaha alright Linus that sounds
interesting more RAM is good for
performance right bring on the bits
where's my 128 bit well hold on a second
there cool your rainbows my pony friend
more RAM is only beneficial if you need
it to store data that's applicable to
the task your processor is working on at
a given time adding more RAM to this
isn't going to make the ball move faster
so move to more bits 4 processors it's
not something to be undertaken for no
reason aside from the hardware
re-engineering and instruction set
architecture extension or redesign it
involves a complete rewrite of
fundamental parts of the operating
system via windows OS 10 Linux Android
iOS or whatever it requires specific
driver software for all hardware
components that will be used and finally
application 2
we'll need to at least recompile and
debug their code just to achieve basic
compatibility without taking advantage
of any performance improvements well ok
Linus but I really want that shiny new
Roo 64-bit processor may be the entire
hardware and software industries will
cooperate for a fast migration for the
first time ever so I can have huge
performance gains right anyone I
wouldn't hold your breath here we are
over ten years after the release of the
Athlon 64 and in addition to most of the
applications on my 64-bit pc anyway
running in 32-bit mode Microsoft is
still supporting entirely 32-bit
versions of even their latest windows
8.1 OS and furthermore if you think a
64-bit processor is faster then I'm
afraid you bought into the hype my
friends for certain workloads and
nothing you're doing on your phone at
the moment there will be a benefit but
in most cases what you're actually
benefiting from is that a 64-bit CPU
will tend to have a newer more robust
design overall with more registers
functional units memory bandwidth and
all that other stuff so until we need
more than four gigs of RAM for our phone
applications which who knows may not
actually be that far away the 64-bit
nests
just a necessary transition being
packaged up for the general consumer as
a selling point speaking of selling
