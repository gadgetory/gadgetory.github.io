novices that says if you can smash
something with a hammer its hardware but
if you can only swear at it in futility
its software but not everything is that
cut-and-dried and one of the most
important parts of your PC is actually a
closely linked fusion of hardware and
software I'm talking about the basic
input/output system or BIOS which I
certainly don't recommend hitting with a
hammer by the way no matter how upset
you are so the BIOS is a very small
piece of code that sits on a read-only
or a flash memory chip on your
computer's motherboard it's often
referred to as the motherboards firmware
since it links the software to the
hardware but how well think about it
kind of like a person your brain stem
helps control very fundamental bodily
functions like breathing in your
heartbeat but it doesn't do any actual
thinking so your computer's BIOS does
some very basic but crucial things
without which you couldn't watch tech
quickie or have your redbull fueled csgo
marathons but it doesn't you know render
graphics or anything like that so when
you first turn your computer on the BIOS
is the first thing to spring into action
and wake up the rest of your computer
kind of like how your car's ignition
gets the engine going the BIOS first
checks settings stored in a CMOS chip to
determine how the user wants the system
to run so that's all that stuff that's
in the utility that you get to by
mashing delete or f2 when you first boot
up then what it does is it initializes
your devices accordingly CPU Ram
graphics card peripherals and so on
after this the BIOS will run the
power-on self-test or post to make sure
that all the gizmos inside your case are
functioning correctly if everything is
hunky-dory you'll usually hear a single
beep to let you know that everything's
good provided that you installed the
little speaker that came with your
motherboard if you get an error you know
like be pbbb pbbb it's not Morse code
it's probably telling you you need to
reseat your ram or video card or check
for a part that's just plain gone kaput
once that's done the BIOS will check for
a bootable device meaning some kind of
drive with an operating system on it and
then it'll hand off control of your
computer to the OS now old-school BIOS
is often provided a link between your
keyboard mouse and other devices and the
OS while modern operating systems like
newer versions of Windows control the
hardware more directly so once you're at
the Windows desktop your BIOS basically
goes to sleep until you need it to start
things up again seems pretty
straightforward right I'll sort of
actually the way that the BIOS was
implemented for a long time had some
very serious limitations one of the most
obvious of them being drive support the
system that a conventional BIOS uses to
access your hard drive or SSD called the
Master Boot Record or MBR could only
handle partitions less than two
terabytes and that was fine for a long
time but with many modern hard drives
holding way more data it became obvious
that something new was needed the
unified extensible firmware interface or
UEFI which no one can agree how to
pronounce was born not only can you efi
deal with insanely large storage devices
we're talking millions of petabytes here
it's also quicker than a conventional
BIOS to boot up and can use an actual
graphical interface complete with
animations and mouse support older BIOS
has only featured that blue screen that
looked kind of like a crash but it was
fine which at least I guess was better
than the really old days where there was
no BIOS utility at all and you had to
physically move jumpers around on your
motherboard in order to change settings
speaking of going through tedious
procedures in order to make basic
changes to simple stuff FreshBooks is
the tool that makes your accounting
pretty much the most tedious part of
running a small business simpler and
more accurate it helps you get organized
get paid on time and send out bills
correctly all kinds of great stuff fresh
books is on a mission to make
freelancers whether you're a plumber or
a computer technician you
run a small yoga studio you run a
daycare whatever kind of small business
you're running FreshBooks takes your
accounting and bookkeeping and your
billing stuff and puts it in a
cloud-based utility that is easy to use
even for people who aren't super
technical and they're adding new
features all the time now you can accept
deposits like say for example you're a
housepainter so you can make sure that
even if the client bails you're not
stuck holding literally gallons of paint
that you had to pay for out-of-pocket
and now have no way to return because
you can't take back tinted paint I speak
from experience so getting started on
fresh books is extremely simple even if
you're not a numbers person and you can
try it for free for 30 days by going to
FreshBooks com forward slash tech
