mostly paying for things by swiping our
credit cards as furiously as you'd swipe
toilet paper after eating that spicy
burrito special yeah but the venerable
magnetic stripe is being phased out in
favor of EMV chips which have become
quite common in most of the world over
the past few years but are just now
catching on with our friends in the
United States but why are we ditch the
mag stripe in the first place
unsurprisingly one reason is security
mag stripes store data like card numbers
and expiration dates in an unsecure
manner meaning bad guys can steal the
information quite easily in a variety of
ways for example if you're somewhere
like an ATM or gas station that only
accepts mag stripe cards visually
inspect the card reading equipment and
give it a little jiggle to see if it's
loose if something seems not quite right
it's possible that someone has installed
an inexpensive card skimmer which reads
your card as you insert it into the slot
and transmits the information to a
nearby criminal who can then use your
card number two at best waste your money
and at worst make super suspicious
purchases that could land you on some
kind of FBI watch list and more skilled
hackers can even sneak malware onto
retail systems that's a lot more
difficult to detect this is what
happened in the u.s. recently when tens
of millions of customers had their data
stolen when cyber criminals planted
malware in the payment systems of the
retail giant target so how then do chip
cards prevent these types of breaches
well they use a form of public key
cryptography you can learn more about
that in general in this video but here's
what happens
specifically each time you insert your
chip card into a reader the car
generates a random code that's good for
that transaction only depending on how
exactly the encryption is implemented
the terminal can use encryption keys to
decrypt your account information and
authorize this transaction even if it
can't communicate with your credit card
company unlike mag strip cards which
always had to do this to process a
transaction
since each code is one time used only
it's totally useless to an attacker that
intercepts it and if your car gets
stolen it's extremely difficult for
someone to clone the chip as opposed to
mag stripe cards which spit out your
information as readily as a participant
in a watermelon eating contest spits out
seeds that visual aside many systems
also now require the use of a pin or
personal identification number so even
if a thief tries to use your original
card instead of cloning it the
transaction won't be authorized unless
they know your PIN a better solution
than the old authentication method that
only involved signing a receipt of
course the EMV chip cards are not
foolproof aside from the constant arms
race between financial institutions and
black hats who try to crack their
security there's also the backwards
compatibility purposes of your card I
mean many chip cards still have a mag
stripe which are just as vulnerable as
ever and the chip doesn't do much to
stop fraud in situations where someone
can just enter a card number such as
pretty much all online stores that have
online shopping that being said it's
still better than what we used to have
but until we have James bond-style
biometric scanning at every gas station
and 7-eleven in the freaking world keep
your card close and think twice before
using it at a shady merchant you don't
want to have your credit card limit
maxed out by some dude who promises you
an official - action figure with hot
swappable sandals and a little version
of the LTTE sweater after he says all
you have to do is put your credit card
information into the message box like I
did I'm still waiting Jacob where's my
action figure anyways here's the sponsor
spot but unlike Jacob scammy website you
could make a beautiful wonderful
well-respected website using Squarespace
it's 12 bucks a month and you could have
domain included if you buy it for a year
and they have 24/7 live chat and email
support they also have responsive design
so if someone views it on a phone or a
tablet or a desktop or a different phone
or an even more different phone or a
console or an even more different phone
it will work on all of them
and they have stuff like cover pages so
you can have one of those single pages
that you just scroll through the entire
thing instead of having multiple pages
which is Linus's favorite thing he
absolutely loves those and there's also
Apple pay if you're running a
Squarespace store so if you want to have
a secure way for people to be able to
buy your stuff you could enable Apple
pay which is fantastic start a trial
with no credit card required and start
building your website today and when you
do decide to sign up for Squarespace
make sure you use offer code to tech
quickie to get 10% off your first
purchase you guys like this video like
it if you just like to dislike it
leaving us a comment down below letting
us know if you have any video
suggestions for future tech quickie
episodes also check out channel
super-fun I have no idea what's
happening over there I think I've been
in one episode and the last like half a
year so it's hilarious though I still
watch it every Wednesday like clockwork
I just want more episodes over there
hopefully we can figure that out
eventually anyways bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
