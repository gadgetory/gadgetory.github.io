things might come to mind Rosie the maid
from the Jetsons r2d2 from Star Wars or
the entire Gundam series for the anime
fans out there but even though these
might all seem like far flung pipe
dreams there are robots out there right
now that can at least to some degree
serve many of the same functions but how
exactly do real robots stack up to their
sci-fi counterparts and what different
kinds are there well to answer that it
helps to understand how the heck real
robots do what they do
most modern robots are self operating
physical machines that use either
computer programs or hardwired circuitry
to perform tasks but this hasn't always
been the case in fact older robots often
called automata have actually been
around for centuries
the ancient Greeks developed the world's
oldest-known
analog computer that used a complex
system of gears to determine the
positions of the stars later on people
started developing automata purely for
amusement things like fountains
mechanical animals and even robotic
musical ensembles that could
automatically play instruments and
thanks to power from steam water or even
just wait this kind of stuff could
operate well before electrical power
became widespread but once everyone
started plugging things in during the
first half of the 20th century modern
robotics developed more or less
alongside digital electronics this meant
that suddenly you had robots that could
be programmed in much the same way that
computers can instead of being hardwired
to do only one thing
this allowed robots to become deployed
to do all sorts of stuff that was once
only the realm of science fiction
we now have everything from massive
mechanical arms that can build cars with
more precision than a human could ever
hope to the humble Roomba to make
vacuuming a thing of the past and even
battle droids that can keep soldiers out
of hazardous situations and hopefully at
some point just fight the wars entirely
amongst themselves and leave the humans
out of it speaking of fighting though
that stuff I said about Gundam in the
intro might actually be a heck of a lot
closer to reality than I let on a Gundam
is specifically designed in a somewhat
realist
Manor is a core idea and it was a big
part of the inspiration for an upcoming
real-world battle between robot
designers from the USA in Japan in 2016
rival robotics companies from the two
countries are deploying to piloted
robots that make everything you saw on
battle bots although that was a super
cool show look like toys not only will
the competition feature gigantic cannons
and guns but we'll also see some melee
combat which make there's something like
a cross between mech warrior and MMA but
other than futuristic gladiatorial
sports what's down the road in the field
of Robotics well a lot of progress has
been made lately on androids or droids
for short these are robots that are
designed to look and to some degree act
like humans so c-3po with his gold
plating doesn't quite count but one
korean company has actually developed a
female android already who not only
looks like a human but can sing simulate
emotions and act annoyed if you try to
bother her and beyond just showing a
handful of emotions google has recently
patented certain methods for robot
personality development possibly
allowing people to do things like hang
out with their favorite celebrities or
long past friends and relatives so even
though all of this might plant fears in
the back of some people's minds of a
robot apocalypse you may also be heading
towards a reality that's even stranger
and cooler than fiction that is to say
if the human race survives the point
where dating robots becomes cheaper than
dating other humans and on the subject
of dating you ever work on like a a
project as a freelance worker or
contractor and not remember which days
you worked and how much you were billing
and what expenses there were well you
should probably try out fresh books
we've got a link in the video
description
it makes invoicing getting paid and
tracking expenses much easier all the
little details about cash flow are in
one place so you always know where you
stand it shows a full history of the
invoice and allows you to check if your
client has viewed it and build them
through the online tool by credit card
so there's no more excuses if you're
your own boss you should be using stuff
that makes you feel like a boss and
fresh books is an easy way of doing all
that stuff online so you have more time
to do the work
actually want to be doing fresh
