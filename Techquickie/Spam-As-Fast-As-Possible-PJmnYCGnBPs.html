life's little pleasures at least
according to some people anyway but
while that weird canned meat product is
beloved by millions worldwide something
that's not so lovable is email spam
which for years has clogged people's
inboxes worse than real spam will clog
your arteries so why exactly is spam so
prolific and what have we done to try
and fight it well it probably isn't
surprising that people found ways to
take advantage of a means of sending the
same message to tons of people
electronically long before of the
mainstream internet was invented the
first spam message was actually sent all
the way back in 1978 over the old
ARPANET a US military network that was a
predecessor to the modern Internet
although the sender was promptly rebuked
that technique
sadly doesn't work today to stop spam
spam messages continued to proliferate
through news groups users who sometimes
people say named these sorts of messages
span after a famous Monty Python sketch
but it really exploded in the mid to
late 1990s as more and more people
started using email anyone who's ever
sent a message to more than one person
before knows how easy quick and cheap
it's to send the same message to a large
number of people so easy in fact that at
one point it was estimated that over 90%
of email traffic was spam although more
recent estimates have indicated that the
number is now closer to 50% still a ton
an email and that's not counting the
spam that is popping up on places like
say for example social networking sites
dating sites video sites and the
infamous comment sections of the
aforementioned places but even though
sending lots of emails is easy how the
heck do spammers get their hands on so
many people's email addresses often
spammers will actually just test
millions of random addresses that
contain dictionary words or common names
and numbers to see which ones work
or they can use BOTS to crawl the public
web and look for email addresses that
people have posted in various places say
for example on a forum dubious
advertisements can also lead people to
malicious websites that convince them to
sign up for stuff using an email address
which is then harvested after a spammer
compiles a large list of working email
addresses they can actually make matters
worse by not only emailing all those
people but by selling the list to other
spammers and then suddenly you've got a
deluge of emails asking you to buy pills
to enlarge a certain part of your
Anatomy say for example your nose but
Linus I just don't get why these people
send out spam at all doesn't everyone
just delete spam and move on to the next
real email well almost everyone does the
response rate for spam messages is
indeed extremely low so spammers use
tools such as dedicated servers and
botnets of infected computers to send
out as many pieces of spam as they
possibly can so even if only one in a
million people is gullible enough to
believe they can buy a real Rolex for
the price of a cheeseburger it still
leads to a pretty good-sized profit for
the scammers back to remember they're
super cheap to send out so then how have
we tried to fight back against this crap
Vilanch of junk mail well most of the
popular email services today employ some
kind of spam filter which scans emails
for suspicious words formatting and
deceptive headers the part of the email
containing address information and
checks emails against a known blacklist
of spam addresses to keep that stuff
from reaching your inbox numerous
countries have also tried to legislate
against spammers as well and although
these efforts haven't been
extraordinarily effective several more
notorious spammers have served prison
time for defrauding people but with that
said perhaps the best thing you can do
is watch who you're giving your email
address to unless that is to say you
enjoy getting business propositions from
exiled Nigerian royalty speaking of
payments online except actually

building a mobile app for example and
