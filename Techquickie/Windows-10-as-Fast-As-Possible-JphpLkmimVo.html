and elaborate water-cooled computers
nothing screams excitement like a new
operating system release right anybody
now well elated as you may or may not be
Windows 10 is already available for user
testing and feedback and it brings some
big changes to the table so big in fact
that Windows 9 was skipped entirely for
reasons unknown now for those of you not
using tablets the biggest addition will
be the appearance of something very old
indeed the Start menu windows 10 gives a
much appreciated nod to keyboard and
mouse and trackpad users for that matter
by keeping the full screen modern UI as
an option but otherwise making live
tiles and also optional part of what
otherwise looks like a much more
traditional Start menu
speaking of tiles it's also much easier
to title different windows on your
desktop with Windows 10 when the Aero
Snap feature was introduced with Windows
7 it allowed users to quickly see two
things side by side windows 10 improves
on this concept by giving you the option
to tile windows and quadrants making
keeping your screen organized a snap oh
come on I've done worse than that anyway
you'll also be able to manage and switch
between apps more easily metro or modern
UI style apps will allow you to change
settings and execute commands from the
title bar instead of relying only on the
charms menu and windows 10 also
introduces a new task view that will
clearly show everything you're working
on side by side kind of like Mission
Control on Apple OS 10 tasks you will
even allow you to have multiple desktops
open at once so you can switch between a
number of different workspaces quickly a
huge productivity booster for notebook
users or anyone else who is limited to a
single display but what else is going on
besides UI enhancements
don't worry Windows 10 has got some
stuff going on under the hood as well
most notably Cortana and I'm not talking
about that weird holographic chick from
halo although I guess kinda I am since
she's like named after her and stuff but
no she's different
Cortana was originally meant to be a
personal assistant that was Microsoft's
answer to Siri she first debuted on
Windows Phone and
now be waking your way to the desktop to
help you find things quickly organize
your life voice control your PC and she
even promises to preemptively give you
info before you even search for it by
digging around in your personal details
not that she can know anything you tell
her not to know very cool stuff you can
manually turn stuff off like don't know
about my fetishes also Microsoft is
shifting its focus away from Internet
Explorer and will be including an
entirely separate browser in addition to
Internet Explorer with Windows 10 its
codename Spartan and features a new
design philosophy better compatibility
with modern websites a new rendering
engine that they're saying is like
blazing fast and support for browser
extensions finally but wait there's more
Windows 10 will ship with DirectX 12
which is designed to allow games to
communicate more directly with your
graphics hardware resulting in
theoretically better performance and
more realistic visuals and to delight
your other senses Windows users are
finally getting native support for flack
lossless audio as well as a TV see a new
video codec that can support 8k video
the good news with all of this stuff is
that you won't need any additional
hardware to run Windows 10 if your PC
already supports Windows 7 or 8 but
Linus how much is all of this going to
cost me well although Microsoft has been
known to charge relatively high prices
here's my feeling with the golden in
Microsoft please give me Windows um that
looks to be a thing in the past an
upgrade to Windows 10 is going to cost
you nothing if you have Windows 7 or 8.1
you can upgrade to ten for one year
after its release for the low price all
free though you'll still need to buy a
full version if you're building a new
rig but if you're upgrading your
existing PC the extremely low cost
interface enhancement DirectX 12 and all
that great stuff makes Windows 10 about
as interesting as an operating system
release can be speaking of interesting
