you're sitting in complete darkness I'd
like for you to do me a favor take a
look around the room you're in
and notice us spot on the wall then draw
a line out of your eyes towards that
spot and then follow it on the angle
that it would take towards the light
source in your room congratulations
you've just done the same thing that
happens in ray tracing a graphics
rendering technique that's been in the
tech news quite a bit lately on the
heels of the launch of Nvidia stirring
family of GPUs which tout real-time ray
tracing as a way to get better-looking
games but what exactly is ray tracing
well to understand ray tracing it helps
to know why it's considered a step up
from the traditional method by which
games draw or render scenes onto your
screen most games today use a technique
called rasterization where the game code
will direct your GPU to draw a 3d scene
with polygons these two-dimensional
shapes usually triangles make up most of
the visual elements that you see after
the scene is drawn it gets translated or
rasterized into individual pixels which
are then processed by a shader which
effects colors textures and lighting
effects on a per pixel basis to give you
a fully rendered frame then you do this
30 or 60 times per second depending who
you ask and you've got yourself a fully
responsive video game to enjoy but while
rasterization has served us well for a
long time trying to approximate an image
by translating 3d shapes onto a 2d
screen and then using shaders to
estimate what the lighting should be has
inherent limitations because this method
of rendering has a hard time tracking
exactly how light should travel and
bounce within a certain scene ray
tracing does a much better job of this
and you've actually probably been
enjoying it without knowing it for years
if you've gone to any recent movie that
features CGI effects what made this
possible in movies though is that big
bug
productions had the luxury of lots of
money to render those effects on large
server farms a process that can take
months and uses much more
computationally intensive techniques
with many bounces for each photons and a
huge number of light rays coming from
each source just check out this still
life created with a ray tracing program
you would be forgiven for thinking that
it is a real photograph at first glance
okay so ray tracing is amazing right
let's use it for everything well not
quite
the downside of ray tracing is the
computational cost and the average
twenty-something gaming at home doesn't
have millions of dollars or a rendering
server and on top of that games have to
be rendered at at least 25 or so frames
per second not one frame per day as has
been the case in some Pixar films so
instead of tracking however many
trillions of rays that come from each
light source consumer grade ray tracing
lessens the computational load by
instead tracing a path from a virtual
camera that represents the users eyes
through a single pixel then to whatever
object is behind that pixel and finally
back to the in scene light source for
added realism if whatever that ray
bounced off of absorbs or diffuses the
light like a rough rock or a tree trunk
the ray tracing algorithm can take these
additional rays of light into account as
well so that any refraction effects our
shadows are displayed accurately and
because lighting is such an important
aspect of achieving a convincing 3d
render once this process is completed
for each pixel your GPU can throw out
some insanely detailed images like any
new GPU feature though it'll come down
to industry support now on the hardware
side given AMD's professional-grade ray
tracing solutions will probably see both
teams add support in the future as for
the game developers well there's no
guarantees so all we can really do is
hope that you won't end up paying a
premium for some feature that you'll
never actually use like that time that
you were planning to get ripped on your
new Wii Fit speaking of things you'll
actually use check out private Internet
access
not only does private Internet access
work on up to five devices at once
hiding your true IP address and allowing
you to bypass geo restrictions and
censorship by making you appear as
though you are connecting from somewhere
else it also blocks unwanted connections
to help prevent attacks Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects it keeps
your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other snoops and even
includes mace P is built-in malware
blocker PIAA supports multiple VPN
protocols and encryption levels allowing
you to dial in the exact level of
protection you need they've got apps for
Windows Mac Android iOS Linux and a
Chrome extension and they've got over
3000 servers in 28 countries with no
user activity logs so check them out at
