I'm here to tell you guys to stop having
wasteful batteries and stop having a
wasteful life disposable batteries like
these are convenient you can pick them
up anywhere and they have a longer
lifecycle per charge of which they only
get one then rechargeable batteries like
these sanyo eneloop eneloop batteries
for example can be recharged as many as
1500 times making each one of these
batteries equivalent to a lot of these
ones let's do some pretty simple math
here each one of these disposable
batteries costs about a buck and each
eneloop costs about five dollars based
on our painstaking internet research now
let's say the eneloop lasts for its
entire 1800 charge lifecycle but let's
say over time each of those charges
starts to count for a little less
because rechargeable batteries do
degrade if we do very conservative math
and give the in loop maybe 50 percent of
the overall life over a you know an
averaged 1800 charge cycle compared to
the disposable that is still going to
work out to a cost of less than one
percent as expensive as disposable
batteries not to mention the fact that
now you've got 900 of these taking up
space in a landfill somewhere versus
only one of these so it is much less
wasteful so it basically comes down to
being a long-term play yes you can just
buy tons of these disposable batteries
and honestly there's a time and a place
for disposable batteries I use them from
time to time too they are very
convenient it's not always the best
thing ever to carry a charger around
with you and have it sit on the wall for
eight hours in order to power something
up once you just buckle down and go okay
I'm going to blow 100 bucks in one shot
I'm going to outfit everything I own
with rechargeable batteries in this case
we're using n loops as an example
because that's what we use personally
here at tech tips I think that at the
end of it you'll be saying WOW every
time because these batteries are awesome
and okay I'm done ripping off the
ShamWow guy down thanks for watching
