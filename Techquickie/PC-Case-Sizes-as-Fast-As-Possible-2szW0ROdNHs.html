different sizes of motherboards I have
received one metric but ton of requests
to cover the same topic but for computer
cases the issue with this is that the
way they're classified has actually
changed over time once upon a time it
was all about how many five and a
quarter inch bays the case had then it
changed to be based on the overall
height of the case but even now those
standards are really more like the
pirate code than actual rules no one can
decide on a standard with an Tek
abandoning the categorization on their
site entirely course they're throwing
their own ideas into the mix and
Coolermaster doing random things like
putting the half XB in the mid tower
category on their North American website
when it's more correctly classified as a
land box on the global site but we're
going to do our best anyway so here goes
starting with the main traditional PC
case sizes a mini Tower is a great
compromise between size and expansion it
has one or two external base stands 14
to 16 inches tall and hosts an M ATX
motherboard usually but a large ITX case
that used a lot of its internal space
for liquid cooling or drive mounting
could also be classified as a mini tower
most mini towers are only suitable for
use with a single graphics card with
adequate cooling while some are okay for
two mid towers are the most common PC
cases for custom builders and have three
to four external expansion base stand 17
to 21 inches tall and can almost always
hold a full sized ATX motherboard but
without a ton of extra space for drives
and whatnot expect to find
six to eight hard drive mounts in a
typical mid tower and enough cooling in
space to comfortably handle two graphics
cards in crossfire sli full towers are
the suv's of the computer case world
more on that in a moment they can have 5
or more external 5 and 1/4 inch bays and
range in height from 22 inches to 27
inches they always support full sized
ATX motherboards almost always support a
ATX and sometimes support the only sort
of a real standard XL ATX form factor as
well the funny thing about full towers
is that other than accepting more drive
expansion providing better cooling
for hot running inefficient setups like
three-way and four-way graphics configs
and having ample space for superfluous
EP and stuff like custom liquid cooling
loops they don't bring much to the table
in terms of performance over a mid Tower
but they do tend to be easier to work in
particularly if you've got big hand so
back to the SUV analogy it's a luxury
item not a must-have only two more to go
now before we get into some of the non
tower stuff and neither of them is
really a well-established standard a
super or ultra Tower is loosely defined
as anything taller than 27 inches and a
mod tower is a case system whose height
is actually difficult to determine
because you can actually adjust it by
stacking multiple cases on top of each
other to add cooling capacity or drive
mounting options desktops are our first
non tower size case and while they used
to be the dominant style and yes they're
slightly different they have feet on
what would be the side panel of the
other one anyway these days they've been
relegated to the HTPC case niche where
we'll find them in a variety of sizes
from ones that are so small they need an
external power brick two huge ones that
can hold server class motherboards and
large raid arrays of hard drives small
form-factor or s FF cases can come in
almost any shape from cubes to like
equal sided towers to desktops to normal
towers but the one thing that they
generally have in common is support for
a mini ITX motherboard Mac's with
minimal drive mounting options and only
sometimes support for an add-in graphics
card and certainly only one of them our
last case type the cube case is
typically characterized by is roughly
cube like shape rather than look that's
what they are if you think my job is so
easy you try to do it anyway
there is no real standard with respect
to size and they're available in a wide
variety of configurations look they're
shaped like cubes deal with it that's
all I can say about them anyway speaking
of a wide variety of configurations this
is just the beginning there's other
stuff out there but these are the main
ones but I guess that's a topic for
another day so before we wrap up as
usual I'd like to take a moment to thank
our episode sponsor coolermaster for
giving us the precious resource
we need to make these videos for y'all
if you've been researching PC cases the
odds that you've come across
Coolermaster at some point is pretty
good given their wide range of cases for
gamers and enthusiasts and regular folks
as well but if you appreciate what we do
maybe you'll consider checking out the
sponsor link in the video description
and browsing their selection of cases to
see if there's anything that tickles
your fantasy
