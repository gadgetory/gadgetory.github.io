constant strife between me and my
siblings was touching the white weight
why'd you bleep that I said computer
screen anyway fingerprints not only
reduce image clarity but they also have
the potential to be super disgusting if
we consider for a moment the average
personal hygiene of an eight year old
and even a lot of adults I know and
since someone is going to have to clean
it off and that someone always ended up
being me and I mean we're even ignoring
the potential for damage from impactors
skin oils yeah people touching the
screen was a bulletproof way to set me
off
well fast-forward over a decade and even
I have accepted the touchscreen
lifestyle now now most touch devices
have glass fronts making damage less of
a concern but image quality degradation
and assuming you don't have fancy
antimicrobial glass gross Ness is
definitely still a factor so what's the
correct way to clean your screen will
start with mobile devices because they
mostly use Corning Gorilla Glass panels
more information about those available
here for a deep clean I recommend a
microfiber cloth and some 99% isopropyl
rubbing alcohol to help remove gunk and
kill unwanted microscopic nasties
another option when you're out and about
is the classic pants wipe or shirt wipe
because these screens aren't fragile nor
are they easily damaged when it comes to
desktop monitors TVs are really anything
that wasn't designed to be constantly
touched the rules change a lot you're
still going to want that trusty
microfiber cloth to do it properly
because this keeps annoying paper fibers
off your device but instead of you know
any cleaning solution you should use
plain old water it might take a little
bit longer but water used with a
polishing motion as you make your way
around the screen will get you a clean
screen without streaks not at all like
Luke's TV which a former however
well-intentioned girlfriend cleaned with
Windex destroying the anti-glare coating
ok Linus sounds great but I don't have
these microfiber cloths as you say can I
just use TP sure I guess
if you want to be wiping paper fibers
off with something else when you're done
no a better bet would be coffee filters
no one wants unnecessary contaminants in
their coffee so these are a clean and
fiber free alternative also they're very
inexpensive now before we get into
another sponsor segment from fractal
where I get abused for your viewing
pleasure I'd like to give a shout out to
Lifehacker for featuring our videos all
the time and writing the articles that
were the basis of this episode isn't it
great when everyone gets along on the
internet like hypothetical great things
that never happen no really it happened
this time speaking of getting along
instead of having me tell you guys about
high-quality cases and power supplies
and PC cooling products and minimalistic
Scandinavian design and all that good
stuff fractal design offered to match my
$500 ALS research contribution if I did
the ice bucket challenge as part of a
fast as possible video so here goes okay
well I wasn't so bad there's no big deal
Oh
okay no second bucket with women up a
little work so do you know audio can you
hear me
supposedly this mic is waterproof but
the point of the matter is I'm
challenging Lee Han from fractal designs
marketing to also complete the ice
bucket challenge also uh guys uh oh
thank you for watching like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you just
liked it leave a comment letting me know
things like future episodes you'd like
to see and as always don't forget to
subscribe to tech quickie for more fast
as possible videos just like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
