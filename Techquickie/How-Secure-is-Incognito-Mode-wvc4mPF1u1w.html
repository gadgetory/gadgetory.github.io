the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so we've
all been there it's time to handle
something sensitive embarrassing or
seedy and you definitely don't want it
in your browser where your roommate your
boss or your aunt Gertie might stumble
upon it so you fire up your browser's
trusty incognito or private mode which
promises to keep your activity secret
from anyone else who uses your computer
or phone but is it that trusty what
exactly does incognito mode do well
here's the basic principle of operation
incognito mode works by keeping your
history the browser cache that contains
the contents of pages you visit cookies
that track your activity and form data
that you enter only temporarily the idea
is that once you're done with your
session and you close your browser this
information all gets deleted making it
invisible to the next person who uses
the browser this makes it not only
useful for keeping your browsing habits
away from prying eyes but also for
getting around website features that
might make using them irritating because
it doesn't use cookies from your main
browsing session you can use incognito
mode to log into a website under a
different account stop advertisers from
snooping on what you're looking at and
even get around website paywalls
on sites that use cookies to track how
many articles you've viewed before they
start charging you newspaper websites
are notorious for this last one however
you've probably seen the warnings that
pop up in incognito mode telling you
your employer or Internet service
provider might still be able to keep
tabs on your online activity how would
they do that
well because incognito mode only affects
what's being stored locally on your
computer all of that traffic is still
being routed through the servers at your
ISP and also perhaps your school or
office so it can still be intercepted
and tracked you can learn more about
that right up here so that means that if
you really want to anonymize your web
traffic you'll need to consider using a
VP
as well possibly over a network like tor
to further conceal your identity also
remember that just because a browser
deletes the information about your
session doesn't mean it will keep a
determined snoop from finding out what
you've been up to
for example features that can run an
incognito mode such as browser
extensions or Adobe Flash can still
leave visible traces on your computer
unless you make sure that those are
disabled as well and browsers also don't
necessarily delete any data that you
built up during an incognito session
securely so some of it could still be
found with a software recovery program
or inside your PC's DNS cache which
matches the urls of the sites you visit
to the IP addresses so you'll need to
make sure that you clear your DNS cache
with this command if you're really
worried about privacy finally things
that go wrong on your PC can also
compromise the effectiveness of
incognito mode since many browsers
delete the data from your incognito mode
session once you close your session an
unexpected error like a computer crash
could keep that data from being deleted
normally and then of course any malware
or spying software like a key logger
could easily be keeping tabs on your
incognito browsing if your PC is
infected now we're not trying to scare
you or make you think that private
browsing is useless it's still a
powerful tool and an easy quick layer of
security but just like any tool it only
works if you take the appropriate
precautions so make sure that your boss
isn't standing over your shoulder while
you're using incognito mode to send out
resumes speaking of employment are you
