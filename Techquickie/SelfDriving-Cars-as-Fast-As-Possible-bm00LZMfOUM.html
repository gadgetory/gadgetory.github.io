annals of history taking note of our
technological advances since the
invention of fire they might note
automation as one of humanity's primary
goals I mean what are heaters and stoves
if not fires which don't require all the
fuss and muss of wood gathering and
stoking if one looks back at the history
of automated automobiles though it
appears very stunted and brief while
scientists have technically been working
on driverless vehicles since the better
part of a century now the first
successful attempts at these
technologies didn't emerge until
somewhere around the mid 1980s on top of
this the technologies that will
ultimately allow cars to operate
themselves didn't really gain much
public attention until much more
recently that is of course until Tesla
blew everyone's freaking minds by
suddenly announcing their line of
vehicles which will be going rogue this
July many car companies have been
implementing technologies like cruise
control GPS tracking and cameras for
functions such as rearview monitoring in
both business and personal vehicles for
decades now but it wasn't until
basically the last decade or so that we
began seeing more autonomous functions
like lane departure warning and
correction systems or even stuff like
blind spot monitors being implemented
widely by manufacturers beyond these
individual capabilities the need to
couple all these features with a list of
others such as collision avoidance
systems and complex maneuverability for
things such as emergency stops or
parallel parking seems to have
perpetually confined the advancement to
this realm of near but far-off future it
seems that while we've all been
blissfully waiting in patience for the
future to arrive technicians on behalf
of many many entities have been
diligently working to bring it to us
ahead of schedule and although there has
been an increased rumblings from those
such as Audie who successfully drove
their autonomous Delphi model vehicle
from California to New York it seems
they were caught sleeping as Tesla
announced they will be rolling out
limited automation to all of its Model S
and above lines with the simple addition
of a software update this has been so
exciting
not simply due to its timing
but also because this will be the first
public offering of level three
automation which is the ability for a
vehicle to control itself under certain
conditions in this case only allowing
drivers to engage autopilot on highways
and interstates and then returning
manual control for in town driving is
this technology going to end up being
legal where I live or am I just
investing in something that I'll never
be able to use like an ubisoft game will
this lead to roads being actually safer
or simply low people into a sense of
security which slows their reaction in
emergency situations leading to a higher
rate of really bad accidents or maybe
the largest question of all due to the
legal and monetary implications who's
responsible when the car self drives
into another the driver or the
manufacturer with these questions and
many more still unanswered it seems that
the verdict for how useful autonomous
vehicles will end up being is still set
off in that slightly intangible future
rest assured though they will come
speaking of good stuff little bits
little bits let's everyone use
electronics as modular building blocks
with modules ranging from simple LED and
power setups to complex programmable
even wireless capable modules it's
perfect for kids parents coders hardware
hackers kids at heart makers artists
designers engineers students you pretty
much name it the modules snap together
with magnets you can create your very
own circuits in seconds with little bits
you can do I mean really the sky's the
limit you can get your dog to send a
text not that he's gonna say anything
too thought-provoking or you can make a
robotic snack server so the idea is why
go out and buy electronics and toys when
you can invent them and reinvent them
over and over and over again there's
over 60 modules that can be used in
virtually limitless and having actually
there would be a number for you know 60s
you could duplicate so much okay
virtually limitless creative
combinations and in this tech driven
world I can see for my kids personally
getting them into that kind of stuff at
a young age is going to be beneficial so
if you're a new customer to little bits
head over to little bits comm slash tech
quickie to let them know that we sent
you and so you can save twenty bucks off
your first order plus free shipping
anywhere
in the US and after you make something
by the way take me on Instagram love to
check it out thanks for watching this
episode of fast as possible like it if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment if you have any more
suggestions for future fast as possible
episodes just like this one and also
leave a comment of what you thought of
my hosting I know this is the first time
I've done this also don't forget to
subscribe follow and all that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
