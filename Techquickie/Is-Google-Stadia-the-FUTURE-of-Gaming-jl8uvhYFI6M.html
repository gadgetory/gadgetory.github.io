a shiny new gaming PC or unwrap a lovely
new console on Christmas morning
there's no denying how convenient it
would be to be able to just load up and
play your games from anywhere even if
you're using a system that isn't all
that powerful and all those simple
browser games have been around for a
long time
remember addicting games.com a Miniclip
running anything more immersive or
powerful has typically required some
kind of dedicated hardware but now there
are a number of services that are trying
to alleviate the load that your computer
has to handle by streaming games
directly to you
that is to say that most of the
computationally intensive work is done
on a server somewhere far away and then
the completed rendered frames are
delivered to your PC via the internet
and with rising internet speeds and
games taking up more and more space on
your computer's localstorage game
streaming is becoming an increasingly
crowded marketplace especially with
google announcing of their new streaming
service called stadia which will work
with nothing more than a browser or a
smart TV an internet connection and then
optionally Google's own game controller
but as much buzz as there's been around
it there are a few things that we'd like
to see from stadia to help propel game
streaming more to the forefront first
off is of course the elephant in the
room latency for obvious reasons when
you're playing a game you expect
something to happen on the screen as
soon as you press a button or click your
mouse and while this is basically never
an issue if you're gaming on a local
machine it's a real concern if you're
expecting a server hundreds of miles
away to respond instantly to you moving
a targeting reticle now Google is hoping
to mitigate the latency issues that have
plagued other streaming services part of
the solution will probably come from the
fact that they just have more cloud
infrastructure I mean think about it
it's freaking Google so the fact that
they have more servers in more places
should help to reduce both ping time
inherently the latency of your
connection so like stadia gamer might be
connecting to a server 50 miles away
instead of one that is 500 miles away
hopefully this will keep games from
lagging out but another major hurdle is
going to be image quality and I don't
mean to say that Google is you know
gonna be using weak graphics cards to
render stadia games in fact they're
apparently using arrays of custom AMD
Radeon chips that sound pretty freakin
powerful the issue though is that like
the vast majority of digital video
online the rendered frames will almost
certainly need to be compressed before
they're sent across the internet so that
a standard connection actually has any
hope of handling them so that means
there could be some degradation in
quality by the time they hit your screen
now Google is expecting a 25 megabit
home internet connection to be good
enough to stream games at 4k resolution
60 frames per second and that's a speed
that's certainly within reach of many
users but in order to keep the game from
lagging well 25 megabit 4k 60 the image
quality may not be as good as some
gamers would like so we're gonna have to
see if google has a solution to this
issue in the works that said all the
tech in the world isn't gonna matter
unless it's actually easy to access the
games that people want to play and it's
still a bit of an open question as to
how libraries are going to be handled on
stadia now PlayStation now Sony
streaming offering only offers a
rotating list of games so it's never
clear if you can rely on a certain title
being on the platform for too long
GeForce now from Nvidia only supports
certain games from Steam you play an
battlenet and has been in an invite-only
beta from very long time and blade while
fairly slick has a fairly expensive
monthly fee with the amount of storage
and connectivity in Google's Arsenal
however the hope is that stadia will not
only have a large library of games to
pick from at a reasonable price be it on
a cart or by subscription but that it
will also give people the ability to
bring their own games in and run them
off of Google servers or at least grin
access to those same titles so that
gamers won't have to pay again for a
game that they already own one thing
standing in the way though is the fact
that unlike PlayStation now or GeForce
now where games will run just natively
as is on the server's stadia is an
entirely new platform built on Linux
meaning that many titles will have to be
ported over in order to work and game
ports take both time and resources to do
properly you can actually learn more
about that up here what that means in a
nutshell though is that it's possible
that this issue will affect what kinds
of games will be available as well as
which previously owned games users will
be able to bring to the service and of
course we'd also like to see streaming
platforms other than YouTube get
supported it's an open question at this
time as to whether stadia will allow
gamers to stream to twitch since it's in
direct competition with YouTube which is
of course owned by Google but to be fair
there are some cool YouTube centric
features in the works including the
ability for a stadia user to start
playing the game being streamed with the
click of a button or even join the
streamers game even with all these
questions yet to be answered though it's
certainly exciting for an absolute Titan
of cloud computing like Google to
finally throw its hat into the streaming
ring my only hope is that it's not so
good that people will just stop building
gaming rigs altogether otherwise we're
gonna run out of video ideas pretty
quickly
speaking of streaming things over the
Internet check out private Internet
access VPN PIAA hides your true IP
address and allows you to bypass to your
restrictions and censorship by making
you appear as though you're connecting
from somewhere else and what's cool is
you can use it on up to five devices at
once with a single account PIAA helps
prevent attacks by blocking unwanted
connections and keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and other
activity tracking snoops and it's got
all kinds of great features including
preventing DNS leaks and even mace P is
built-in malware blocker it supports
multiple VPN protocol so you can dial in
exactly the level of protection you need
and we've got apps for Windows Mac iOS
Android and even a Chrome extension
finally PIAA does not
your activity and they have over 3,000
servers in 33 countries so what are you
waiting for check them out today at the
link in the video description so thanks
for watching guys like dislike check out
our other videos leave a comment with
video suggestions and don't forget to
subscribe and follow so that you can
spend more of your time admiring this
fantastic new sweater I'm actually
trying out don't have it available on
our store yet but I think it's pretty
cool oops shilling the LTTE merch on
tech wiki how narrow John's gonna beat
