ultrawide monitor with an IPS panel
10-bit color adaptive refresh in an
attachment for keeping your drinks cool
maybe you've even used some calibration
tools to get things looking just right
but then when you have a friend over for
counter-strike he starts complaining
that the colors seem a little off how
could that be
well considering that people vary wildly
in everything from musical ability to
whether or not we find spray cheese
appealing it might not be surprising to
learn that people perceive colors
differently as well and I'm not talking
about really obvious things like color
blindness or needing glasses because
everything's blurry without them what
I'm referring to instead is of
variations between people's cone cells
the things in your eyes that allow you
to see color
you have three normal types of cones
each sensitive to a different range of
wavelengths one kind four colors in the
red to yellow range one for greens and
one for blues and violets this
arrangement of cones actually inspired
the RGB color model that you see in
monitors TVs and basically every gaming
keyboard for the past couple of years
since red green and blue match up well
to the three kinds of cones we have RGB
ends up being a great base for
reproducing lots of different colors but
because some people have small
variations in cone composition our
sensitivity to these different colors of
light will also vary greatly from person
to person so to get an idea of how a
regular person sees color a test was
conducted back in 1931 on a handful of
people and the results were averaged and
have been used as a baseline for much of
color science ever since including the
way that we think about display design
so modern flat panel displays will give
off different amounts of energy in the
red green and blue parts of the visual
spectrum but they don't exactly match
the proportions that were found in the
1931 experiment
to complicate things further monitors
can differ wildly from each other in how
vividly they show each of these colors
which you can see clearly on spectral
power graphs which show very different
amounts of energy per color between
displays and even though modern screens
have better picture quality and lower
power consumption than old bulky CRTs
those old monitors were actually better
at producing uniform colors flat panel
displays have narrower band color
meaning that they give off pure reds
greens and blues which show up as point
ear bumps on a graph like this but
because of the variations in people's
cone cells that I mentioned earlier this
makes it easier to pick up on small
variations between monitors and also
easier for two different people to be
looking at the same monitor yet see
different colors a phenomenon called
metameric failure so when you put this
together with other factors such as
different color spaces and backlight
types which you can learn about in these
videos it's really no wonder that
different people notice such drastic
discrepancies in current generation
displays one solution which is already
being used in higher-end laser
projectors is to use two different
shades of red green and blue as your
primaries giving you six base colors
instead of three this helps spread out
the color energy and make things look
more uniform but differences between our
eyes will continue to make this a tough
problem to tackle for some time until
then though we can continue to enjoy our
arguments about whether mullberry
magenta and passion pink are actually
the same color thanks once again by the
way to our friend Tyler from spectracal
for helping us out with this video he is
like a color wizard some sort
speaking of wizardry are you a wizard
with accounting
do you enjoy dealing with the books of
your small business yeah I didn't think
so so you might want to check out fresh
books fresh books is on a mission to
