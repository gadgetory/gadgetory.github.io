noticed it meant renting a billboard
taking out an ad in a newspaper or
failing that just standing on a soapbox
in the park and pontificating but now
with large search engines being the
go-to fonts of information for most of
us to make themselves heard people
companies and other organizations have
been seeking ways to fight and claw to
the top of search results using a
process called search engine
optimization or SEO but what is that
well you see giant search engines like
Google use algorithms to try to push
relevant results to the top of the page
so that when a user types in computer
mouse they'll get links to buy a new
input device rather than pictures of
Stewart little trying to use a PC now
how exactly these algorithms work are
usually closely guarded trade secrets
but there's enough public knowledge for
webmasters to attempt to tune their
pages to boost their position in the
search results in fact Google even puts
out a search engine optimization starter
guide to help website owners improve
their chances of earning the coveted top
result so then for starters it's a good
idea to optimize your pages metadata
metadata is all the stuff other than the
actual content people will see in their
browser window and accurate metadata
things like descriptive page titles or
embedding a short explanation of what's
on the page into your HTML which you can
often end up seeing underneath the
Google result can help push your site up
to the top a more recent development is
making URLs themselves more informative
you've probably seen this on news sites
which have started to use file names
that indicate what the article is about
like tasteless youtuber where socks and
sandals dot HTML which is a lot more
helpful to a search engine than just
assigning some random number
another pro tip is to nest your pages in
some sort of sensible directory
structure organized by things like
topics and dates but what about the page
itself
well since most modern search engines
use how often a page is linked to as a
key metric of its importance
providing descriptive text links in the
body of a webpage to other pages on your
site can be very helpful and search
engines are also aware of things like
topic headers and alt text for images to
help categorize the site the key as with
any metadata is to keep these as short
but also as informative and descriptive
as possible to make it easier for a
search engine to determine that your
site is relevant to a particular topic
of course though everything we've
outlined so far is a legitimate SEO
strategy there are plenty of other
tricks that might be employed by
unscrupulous site owners these
collectively are known as blackhat SEO
or spam dexing and their goal is to try
to make the page seem more relevant to a
topic than it actually is and these
tricks can take the form of anything
from citing keywords in invisible text
that a user would have to highlight to
see to buying link backs or even traffic
from other sites for using irrelevant
keywords that might just be trending at
the moment or even just overusing the
relevant ones this kind of behavior has
resulted in a bit of a digital arms race
between search engine developers who are
trying to weed out these pages for their
users and spammers or site owners who
are desperate for clicks and aren't
above using shady tactics so who will
ultimately win well let me put it this
way as search giants like Google deploy
more sophisticated methods to separate
the signal from the noise my advice is
if you want your website to be around
for a long time
stick to the honest tried-and-true
tactics even if your website does
feature material of ill repute
speaking of SEO tricks if that's just
yet another thing that you don't want to
deal with when you want to build your
own website
Squarespace actually does a lot of this
stuff automatically Squarespace is the
