quarter of almost every power supply box
that says 80 plus and then has some kind
of a precious metal attached to it we're
going to tell you what you need to know
about 80 plus as fast as possible
the original 80 plus was really simple
80 plus logo goes here the power supply
at 20 percent of its maximum load 50
percent of its maximum load and a
hundred percent of its maximum load had
to be at least 80 percent efficient
converting power from AC wall power to
the DC power that your computer uses
after a while it got to the point where
it was becoming easier and cheaper to
build power supplies that were 80 plus
efficient which is which is great I mean
power was being saved money was being
saved trees are being saved there's all
good things but consumers were looking
for ways to continue to differentiate
even more efficient power supplies so
over 2008 and 2009 80 plus bronze silver
gold and platinum were all introduced
now some of these particularly 80 plus
platinum is almost more like a 90 plus
certification because it requires 90
percent 92 percent and 89 percent
efficiency at 20 percent 50 percent 100
percent loads but the branding of 80
plus remains power supplies that are
extremely efficient but for example have
large voltage drops under load or
exhibit a lot of ripple can cause
long-term damage to your components even
though they might be quite efficient
with that said most 80 plus gold and
platinum power supplies these days do
tend to also be very well built inside
it just should be noted that you've got
to watch out for those other things as
well and it's important to still read
reviews for power supplies for those of
you who were paying really close
attention before there's no 80-plus
requirement for efficiency under 20%
load so that's why it's important to buy
a power supply that is appropriate for
your system if you have a mid-range
gaming rig that only draws 80 to 100
watts from the wall at idle buying a
1200 watt power supply for it is
inappropriate because that's less than
10 percent of the overall power supplies
capacity that means this 80 plus
Platinum power supply could be 90%
efficient at 20% load but it could drop
all the way down to 70% efficient at a
five percent load you don't know I'm not
saying
this one does in fact the ax 1200 I is
one of the best-built power supplies on
the market but as a general rule you
want to get something that is going to
be somewhere near that sweet spot so you
want at least 20 percent load at idle
and then under load you want to be
around 50 to 75 percent to take
advantage of the most efficient part of
the efficiency curve which is not on
this particular power supplies box but I
think you guys get the point thanks for
