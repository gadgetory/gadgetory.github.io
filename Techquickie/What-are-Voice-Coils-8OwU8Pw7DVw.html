those twisty cables on an older style
telephone that you always seem to hit
stuff with as you moved around the room
no while voice coils are indeed coils of
wire the term is typically used to refer
to one of two things the wires that
actuate the arm of a hard drive or the
wires that make your speaker's go boom
boom boom boom you know both of those
applications benefit from the main
strengths of voice coils extreme
accuracy and high movement speed you see
voice coils move by using something
called the Lorentz force which is
created by placing a coil of wire in a
fixed magnetic field when current is put
through the coil it turns into an
electromagnet making it either be
repelled or attracted to the fixed
magnetic field giving you a force this
force can actually be quite strong
meaning that voice coils can speed up or
slow down extremely quickly speakers for
example can accelerate at rates in the
ballpark of 800 meters per second
squared or 80 G's put into context that
is 16 times the acceleration required to
make you lose consciousness 27 times
quicker than a space shuttle launch and
211 times faster than my Lamborghini but
how exactly does that make your speakers
and your microphones work well for a
microphone as we've covered in more
depth here there's a membrane that moves
back and forth as sound waves hit it
these vibrations are turned into an
electrical signal as a coil of wire on
the back of the diaphragm moves over a
magnet to turn this electrical signal
back into sound the process is reversed
so the electrical signal goes
to the coil which moves the speaker to
create your sweet sweet beats and it's
the extraordinary acceleration and
precision that we mentioned before that
makes it possible for speakers to
produce such a wide variety of sounds on
demand
what about computer hard drives then
well you can learn more about them in an
upcoming video because we realize we
have to actually done one yet but in a
nutshell on one side of the arm that
hovers over the spinning disk like a
record needle is the head which is
responsible for reading or writing data
on the platter and then on the other
side is a voice coil this coil of wire
is surrounded by a permanent magnet that
yadda-yadda yoake giving you everything
that you need to get your Lorentz force
on so to move the arm current flows
through the coil creating a force that
causes it to pivot then just before the
arm of the hard drive reaches its
desired location the currents reversed
bringing it to a stop exactly what
exactly where it needs to be in fact
thanks to this lightning-fast
deceleration the arms of hard drives are
able to be positioned within a millionth
of an inch or 1/4 thousandths of a human
hair Wow I got like 5 so now you might
be thinking why not just use voice coil
for everything that needs to move why
don't we replace the Pistons in a car or
use one to throw a ball for the dog well
here come the downsides excessive
magnetic force and excessive heat are
kind of problems if you make a magnet
too large it can be difficult to tame
the magnetic field it generates I mean
our massive voice coil wouldn't be that
great if it ripped all the fillings out
of your teeth or more realistically like
not in a cartoon wiped the data off of
everything in a 10-foot radius also
anything that has a bunch of
current going through a wire will tend
to be a bit toasty if you've ever had
your speakers emit the magic black smoke
that's most likely why but this also
doesn't mean that the applications and
voice coils are limited to our two
examples from before one of my favorite
uses for them that you'll hopefully see
more of in coming years our voice coil
actuated camera stabilizers these are
similar to gimbal image stabilizers but
instead of using several rotating motors
they use you guessed it voice coils to
position the camera the two got it again
extreme speed and accuracy this thing
Wow uses badass voice coils and is so
fast and so precise that it can create 2
30 FPS videos from a single 60fps camera
repositioning the camera between each
frame to give the illusion that there
are actually two separate cameras pretty
cool so to say that I'm amped to see
where we're headed as they continue to
develop voice coil technology would be
an understatement though I can't say
that I have my hopes up about a new
speaker that will make Nickelback sound
any more palatable do you enjoy your
freelance work or you're running your
small business but do you find the
challenge of like managing your time and
your expenses and invoicing clients and
accounting overwhelming well you're in
luck because in the age of the internet
