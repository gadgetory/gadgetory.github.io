spoiled by digital data storage if you
put something on your hard drive SSD or
a writable CD if that's still your thing
for whatever reason you can expect to be
able to pull it up again whatever you
want with every bit exactly where it's
supposed to be but despite the relative
reliability of digital data storage
compared to the days when we consumed
everything on cassette tapes and VHS
data stored our modern media can still
decay degrade and disappear so
alliteration aside how does this happen
and what can you do to prevent it let's
start by a look at mechanical hard
drives which although more economical
than solid-state drives can fail due to
the moving parts on the inside wearing
out or through damage to the platters if
something like a head crash happens but
suppose you've got a dependable hard
drive that you take good care of by not
subjecting it to shock moisture or your
pet ferret how could data on the drive
decay without any kind of physical
damage or mishap you see hard drive
stored data as clusters of magnetic bits
that are pointed in a certain direction
that have the potential to flip to the
opposite direction over time however
since modern hard drives have built-in
features to periodically refresh those
bits of data and they also have error
checking algorithms that can often
detect and fix flipped bits this kind of
data rot is mostly a problem for drives
that have been sitting around unplugged
for 5 or 10 years at a time so the
average user probably won't have to
worry about this all that much but it
can matter if you're using hard drives
for very long term archival style
storage SSDs on the other hand can be
quite a bit more fickle with retaining
data for long periods of time
although SSDs are often regarded as more
durable than hard drives through their
lack of moving parts they don't hold
data as well because they rely on
trapping and electrical charge inside of
a small transistor these charges can
weaken over time and while making
transistors smaller and smaller have
increased
capacities it has also decreased data
longevity although you can fight this
off by making sure to not leave your SSD
unplugged for long periods of time and
just powering it on regularly they do
tend to not last as long as hard drives
went unplugged if you live in a warmer
climate your SSD might not even hold
data for more than like a year if you
aren't using it as heat can accelerate
data decay in those transistors so make
sure you're not doing stuff like leaving
a laptop with an SSD in the back of a
hot car for long periods of time like
you go on a trip or something but luke
what if I just store all of my super
important stuff on optical discs you
don't exactly have to turn on a CD so
isn't that a better idea well yes and no
optical discs unfortunately are also
susceptible to degradation and a number
of ways just different ways such as
oxidization of the metallic layer that
actually holds the data when air seeps
in through imperfections in the outer
plastic layer of the disk adhesives that
hold the different layers of a disk
together can break down over time as
well even making it possible to
physically pull apart of the disk like
some kind of weird sandwich however you
can get archival quality discs
engineered with more durable materials
that can reliably store data for between
20 and a hundred years depending on how
exactly they're manufactured and there's
even a relatively new type of optical
disc called the M disc that claims it
can store data for a thousand years whoa
but since no long term storage solution
is perfect the best way to make sure
your important stuff lasts as long as
you want it to is make sure that you
have independent redundant backups
whether that's your home or with a
cloud-based archival service and
remembering things like not to leave
your drive sitting around or using them
as paper weights if something's really
that important I hear that stone tablets
might be making a comeback fresh books
is on a mission to make freelancers less
stressed and more organized through
their easy-to-use tool for crafting and
sending professional invoices in seconds
fresh books allows you to keep track of
your hours so when it comes time to
create said invoice helix
exactly what you did when you did it and
who you did it for and you can even
accept deposits through their platform
so said people can pay you on your
schedule they also have a tool to manage
your expense reports and their mobile
app lets you take a picture of receipts
and pretty much handles the rest of it
anyways getting started on fresh books
is extremely simple even if you're not a
numbers person and fresh book says
especially if you're not a numbers
person you try fresh books for free for
30 days by going to fresh books calm

there will be other terrible jokes but
probably not about buttons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
