the subscribe button then enable
notifications with the Bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos if you're
an iPhone found one advantage you've had
for a long time in your fanboy battles
with Android users is the existence of
iMessage it's not only faster than in
traditional SMS but it also allows you
to add tons of effects and options to
your text if your chat partner is also
on iOS Androids default message wrap is
by contrast your basic SMS client and if
you've ever received so much as a small
photo over it you know that it can make
56k modems from the ancient 1990s feel
fast but all of this is about to change
now that Google is set to push an SMS
alternative to the masses it's called
rich communications services or chat not
to be confused with the instant
messaging components of hangouts that
people often call Google Chat or any the
other galactically confusing brand names
that Google has created for text based
communication services over the years
the main idea behind chat is to add
functionality that SMS doesn't currently
support not only will it remove the
annoying 160 character limit but it'll
come with plenty of other iMessage like
features you'll be able to chat with
multiple people in one session share
videos and gifts see when the other
party is typing and has read your
message share files and more and it'll
work over a data connection instead of
the much slower SMS Network unlike
iMessage though which is a supplementary
service provided by Apple's servers
remember your iPhone can still send
normal SMS to your scrub green bubble
friends chat is meant to be a
replacement for SMS and therefore has to
be supported by your wireless carrier
and although Google appears quite
serious about billing its base of
partners adoption by mobile networks has
been relatively slow but like why is
Google getting involved with this in the
first place they have their own database
communications apps already so why
aren't they focusing on those instead
well quite simply they did but whatever
the issues were branding bugs a lack of
enticing features Google's various chat
apps haven't become hits with mobile you
users in fact hangouts is going to
become more enterprise focus in the near
future with Google conceding that
competing alternatives like Facebook
message er have simply become more
popular with smartphone users I guess
they just couldn't block Zuckerberg
style so by backing chat instead Google
can make rich messaging an integral part
of the Android experience for its
billions of users even the ones who
aren't tech savvy or don't think that
they should have to install a
third-party app for that as long as the
carrier supports it and just like
iMessage if you send a message to a
phone or through a network that doesn't
support chat the message will simply
send as SMS similar to the popular iOS
experience sounds good then right so
when can we expect to start chatting
well Sprint and t-mobile in the United
States already support it with carriers
in the EU and Latin America expected to
follow relatively soon and Google says
is going to aggressively roll it out to
the rest of the world over the next
couple of years but exact timelines will
depend on the effectiveness of Google
sales pitch to carriers that chat is a
worthwhile investment for their
customers because of its broad device
support and that's a pretty cool pitch
because apparently it's not even out of
the question for Apple devices to
support it down the road but what would
that mean for iMessage personally I have
no idea but don't let that stop you from
engaging in the usual Android versus iOS
flame wars with an extra helping of
baseless speculation down in the
comments section and speaking of
baseless are you skeptical of the
justification ISPs and advertisers use a
keep an eye on your online activity then
check out private Internet access VPN
not only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once by hiding your true IP
address and allowing you to bypass your
restrictions and Center ship by making
you appear that you're connecting from
somewhere else it also blocks unwanted
connections to help you prevent attacks
Auto block traffic if the VPN
disconnects keeps your data out of the
hands of advertisers and other snoops
who are tracking your activity prevents
DNS leaks and even includes Mase P is
built-in malware blocker they have apps
for Windows Mac Android iOS Linux whoa
and a Chrome extension and P ia has over
3000 servers in 28 countries and does
not log user activity so what are you
waiting for check them out today at the
