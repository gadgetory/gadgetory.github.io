if you're the proud owner of a fancy
Samsung phone TV or washing machine you
might be expecting a five star
experience due to Samsung positioning
itself as a premium tech brand with
price tags to match but expensive
gadgets weren't what Samsung was always
known for in fact the companies started
all the way back in 1938 in the Korean
city of Teague as a trading firm that
dealt in foods like dried fish and
noodles and then later expanded to Seoul
Korea's capital after World War two
ended this period of prosperity was
short-lived however as after the
invasion of that city during the Korean
War
samsung nearly went under only surviving
thanks to its diversification the
company actually established a sugar
refinery in the port city of Busan which
was the only major city in Korea that
was untouched by communist aggression
Samsung also got involved in textiles
and wood milling and as war economies
are often kind to the manufacturing
industry Samsung's new businesses helped
them not only stay afloat but continued
to expand after the war with insurance
being one of their first divisions that
didn't involve commodity trading in fact
Samsung is actually the largest
insurance company in Korea to this day
all of this growth led Samsung to become
one of the chapel's
or massive Korean companies that are
primarily family-run rather than mostly
controlled by shareholders who have
bought stock meaning that they became
very influential in national politics in
Korea but it wasn't until 1969 that
Samsung started making electronics and
perhaps unsurprisingly their first
product was a small black and white
television they continued to expand in
the early 1970s by cranking out home
appliances but there was an obstacle in
their way
Samsung was relying on imports of small
components in order to assemble their
products so in 1974 they decided to buy
a domestic semiconductor company in
order to have greater control over their
supply chain although this decision
wasn't unanimous among the Samsung brass
it played a huge
role in Samsung's future fortunes having
its own semiconductor manufacturing arm
allowed the company to make more
electronics and ship them to more
distant parts of the globe bringing in
more money and helping them grow Samsung
then ventured into heavy industry
defense construction chemicals and even
a theme park and hotels in fact they
still run a chain of luxury hotels in
Korea with the original location once
serving as the official guest house for
the Korean government but getting back
to electronics samsung started producing
drm in the early 1980s a product they're
still known for thanks to its earlier
investment in manufacturing with help
from micron and sharp now the timing for
this was great as more and more devices
were starting to use DRM but not all was
well in samsung land unlike today where
Samsung products are generally viewed as
higher-end it's electronics from the
1980s and early 90s were poorly received
and ironically this was especially true
for their mobile phones in fact they had
such a reputation for poor quality that
Japan based Motorola dominated the
market even in their home turf of South
Korea for quite some time which is
interesting when you consider that Korea
and Japan have historically had pretty
frosty relations this actually nearly
led Samsung to abandon the phone market
completely but instead of giving up they
decided to spend time figuring out how
to make higher quality consumer goods
instead of just churning out cheapo
bargain-basement offerings so Samsung
underwent a huge transformation in its
electronics division 24,000 workers were
laid off and huge parts of the company
totaling around 2 billion dollars were
sold
then instead of trying to rush the next
big thing to market Samsung focused on
making quality components both to sell
to other companies and to help them
improve their own consumer devices down
the road and of course as a massive
cheville they had quite a bit of money
to pour into development this ended up
paying huge dividends and Samsung of
course did
ultimately become a premium brand for
example they started making LCD displays
fairly early on in the 1990s that meant
that by the time they really started
catching on with consumers Samsung had
already spent years perfecting them
which set the stage for them to become
one of the world's largest manufacturers
of flat-screen TVs and monitors this
same strategy also helped Samsung become
a leader in the Android mobile phone
market now although their galaxy
obviously wasn't their first Android
phone it was one of the first to
showcase more advanced features than the
iPhone helping Samsung become a real
rival to Apple to the point where they
ended up doing some pretty clever
marketing poking fun at the hype
surrounding new iDevice releases which
really got consumers to start
considering Samsung as a serious premium
alternative Samsung's success in the
mobile market did come with some
unexpected consequences though and the
hospital that they run in Seoul actually
has to give out discounted treatments
for swipe induced carpal tunnel these
days that last bit was a joke
there's no discounted treatment although
they do actually run a hospital in Seoul
this video is brought to you by mass
draw featuring the Sennheiser PC 37 X
gaming headset it features angled
drivers and an open back design so it's
got a nice natural sound in fact the
drivers come from the same family as the
HD 598 and HD 600 series audiophile
headphones and that means you get better
stereo imaging and locational accuracy
it comes with the noise cancelling
microphone and you can join the drop
