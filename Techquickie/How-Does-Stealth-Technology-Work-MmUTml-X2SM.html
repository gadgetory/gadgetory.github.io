whether you're trying to prank a friend
play some paintball or just avoid a
meeting you'll want to stay at a site
and for folks in the military
staying concealed can be a matter of
life and death and that's why billions
of dollars have been dumped into
researching and developing stealth
technology but how does this work I mean
that's a still fighter and I can see it
just fine also I'm sure if they fired it
up it would make a lot of noise so it
must be pretty hard to hide right well
remember that radar works by firing
radio waves at an object to determine
its position velocity and shape based on
how those waves are reflected back to a
radar station so stealth technology is
focused not on trying to build a Star
Trek cloaking device though I'm sure
someone actually is working on that but
on either absorbing those radio waves or
deflecting them in different directions
so let's look at some materials that
absorb radio waves starting with paint
yeah paint one strategy is to use a
special paint that contains tiny balls
of iron oriented in a way that creates a
magnetic field and although radar
normally reflects off of metal and
returns to the radar station the special
orientation of the paints magnetic field
instead causes the waves to be absorbed
and then dissipated as heat this tactic
was notably used on the f-117 Nighthawk
a well-known US Air Force stealth
attacker that was recently retired next
up we've got stealth enhancing pyramids
because of their shape radar waves that
hit specially configured pyramids
reflect off of them repeatedly losing
energy each time they do these pyramids
can be placed underneath the aircraft
skin or really really
all ones can even be combined with paint
helping direct radar waves to the iron
particles that I mentioned earlier
weakening them even more other solutions
include using carbon-based materials
underneath the skin with a higher
concentration of carbon the deeper you
go this helps slowly rob incoming radar
waves of their energy this strategy was
used on the b-2 spirit stealth bomber
and new materials are constantly being
developed such as nanotubes that can be
grown into a layer of fibres which can
absorb radar beams in different ways
depending on how they're engineered this
strategy is rumored to have been used on
the new f-35 Lightning that was just
introduced in 2015 but most kinds of
radar absorbing materials developed so
far presents significant engineering
challenges and can be expensive to
maintain meaning that the trend in
stealth these days is to focus more on
the aircraft's shape to help deflect or
scatter radar beams in different
directions earlier designs like the
aforementioned f-117 as well as stealth
ships relied heavily on having flat
sharply angled surfaces a stark contrast
to the rounded bodies of commercial jet
liners that make them easy to pick up on
radar since a perfectly flat surface can
deflect a radar beam in a single
predictable direction as opposed to a
rounded surface that scatters waves
everywhere this design philosophy made
it possible for engineers to use the
aircraft's body kind of like one of
those big suntan mirrors and deflect
signals harmlessly away from the enemy
radar the problem is that one of the
biggest weaknesses of the old f-117 was
that its sharp edges made the plane
unstable and more difficult to fly
safely so looking at newer crafts like
the b-2 f-35 and f-22 Raptor you'll see
rounded surfaces but how did they do
that well by keeping the low profile
squashed design they actually rid
what's called the radar cross-section
then because these aircraft were
developed after computers became
powerful enough to run more complex
simulations the engineers were able to
reduce the detect ability of those
curves that are oh so important for
aerodynamic reasons by determining
exactly how radar beams would interact
with all surfaces of these fighters and
bombers and other design considerations
are also important burying the engines
within the interior of the craft for
example not only limits their radar
signatures but also serves to hide the
planes from infrared or heat tracking
and engineers even think about the way
in which the bay doors open to deploy
missiles and bombs so they won't produce
too much of a return signal of course
with military technology being an arms
race both literally and figuratively new
stealth designs and materials be they
for planes ships trucks or even infantry
and ways to defeat them will continue to
be devised now if you'll excuse me I
have to go try and find a way to hide
from my CEO duties around here yeah no
I'm not actually leaving are you the
boss at your work do you find yourself
racing against the clock as a freelancer
or small business owner
well it's challenging but with the
growth of the internet there has never
been more opportunities for the
self-employed even those of you who
don't have a fancy-pants
accounting diploma and that's where
FreshBooks comes in fresh books cloud
accounting software is the simplest and
easiest way to be more productive more
organized and perhaps most importantly
get paid more quickly you can create and
send professional-looking invoices in
