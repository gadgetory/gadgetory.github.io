into this exciting selling point we've
seen it with movies video games movies
again and any number of other random
things as well and as tired as it is
Samsung and the rest of the flash
industry are using this classic
marketing buzzword for their new NAND
flash technology design which hold on a
second wait don't go it might actually
be worth paying attention to this time
alright so let's get started now
historically the NAND flash that lets
your SD cards USB drives and SSDs or
solid-state drives actually store data
so quickly and reliably has been made up
of memory cells strung horizontally
along a flat plane and the primary way
that we would reduce the physical size
of it limiting production costs or
increase the number of cells improving
storage space and/or performance was by
squeezing the space between these lines
ever and ever closer but unfortunately
quantum physics is a bit of a harsh
mistress and shrinking all these
elements past a certain point with
modern materials anyway while one we're
quickly approaching by the way creates
little issues like corruption or
complete and total data loss caused by
signals jumping between neighboring
cells at random so while we were on our
way towards this inevitable outcome like
an asteroid headed towards the Pacific
Ocean which would create a tidal wave
three miles high some bright roughneck
had been thinking of a way to turn the
old design model on its side to save us
which is actually pretty much the
solution in a nutshell you see a typical
man cell looks a little something like
this
consisting of an electrical source drain
and both float and control gates all set
over semiconductive silicon when the
float gate becomes highly charged it
causes electrons to spill into and
become trapped in a layer of oxide this
in turn causes the charge to build up
inside the flow gate until it meets a
required voltage threshold and is washed
out the drain this would be considered
the binary one state
some viewers may recognize as being a
bit backwards from traditional CPU
transistor and bit code relationships
well anyway in the new three-dimensional
models they take a typical style line
segment and bend it into a square
u-shape at the middle then flip it
vertically this has allowed for
engineers to implant several vertical
cell segments in the same width of a
traditional horizontal one or in other
words we can drastically increase
storage capacities and access speeds
without the drawbacks that come with
further miniaturization of the
components so at this point you're
probably waiting for me to say something
like sounds great right
too bad it's horribly expensive well but
that would actually be dead wrong this
time you see the main attraction to both
manufacturers and consumers alike is
that this process actually allows the
cost per bit to go down as sizes
increase you see the old flat chips
required heavy amounts of lithography
which is the altering and shaping of
materials whereas the new full-bodied
ones obtain their properties mostly
through the more basic deposition or
building process so as it turns out less
really is more in this case so you can
rest easy knowing that the days of
affordable and expandable memory are
right around the corner we have
absolutely nothing to worry about going
forward well that is until we run into
the exact same problem again once we've
used up all the extra space we freed up
by flipping everything vertically -
there's that speaking of that buying
razors at the store that doesn't seem
like a very good idea at all maybe
there's a less expensive and more
efficient way to buy things to shave
your face that you can use all that
extra space that you freed up on your
SSD which okay this Segway made no sense
whatever it doesn't matter
Dollar Shave Club is what it's all about
right now get razors and other bathroom
supplies shipped directly to your door
for only a few bucks a month we're
talking razors dr. Carver's shave butter
there one wipe Charlies peppermint
scented bought wipes for men which by
the way I would have been pretty glad
have it's in some of those bathrooms in
Southeast Asia and I totally forgot to
take a pack of them with me which would
have been a great idea they've also got
their post-shave moisturizer and travel
sizes of some of those things as well
they've got a variety of razor styles
all the way up to the six blade
executive and it's just pretty simple I
guess the concept is you sign up for the
club they ship you the razors your face
looks good your wallet feels good and
it's dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus if
all of that sounded good to you it's
available in the US Canada Australia and
New Zealand so thank you guys for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have a suggestion
for a future fast as possible episode
just like this one and as always don't
forget to subscribe and follow in all of
that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
