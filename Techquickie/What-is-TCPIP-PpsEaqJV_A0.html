watching tech quickie with nothing but a
television antenna your TV was able to
pick up a signal that just kind of
emanated from a station somewhere that
broadcasted the signal and a big kind of
like bubble that anyone in range with a
TV and bunny ears could watch but of
course videos on YouTube and other sites
don't work this way instead internet
traffic actually has to be routed to the
correct place directly and unlike an
old-school TV or radio signal online
data has to know where it's going so how
then does it do this well this is where
something called tcp/ip comes in which
stands for transmission control protocol
and Internet Protocol then you may have
seen some vague references to tcp/ip in
your network card or browser settings
but what exactly is that you can
actually think of tcp/ip as a cake or a
club sandwich since the way it works is
often conceptualized the in little
layers it's just that those layers are
made up of computer code instead of
icing or delicious corned beef the
topmost layer is called the application
layer which is what programs like your
web browser directly interact with this
layer has protocols like HTTP if you're
visiting websites or SMTP if you're
checking your email the next layer down
is called the transport layer where TCP
lives along with another schema called
UDP there's a bit faster and useful for
low latency applications like online
games after the application layer gets
the data from whatever program you're
using it talks to the transport layer
through something called a port now each
port can be assigned to a different
protocol in the application layer so
that TCP knows where the data is coming
from for example most activity in your
web browser will go through port 80
which is what HTTP always uses once TCP
gets the data it chops it up in small
chunks called packets so that they can
be disposed
stuff in a nearby lake so no one will
ever find no sorry what were we talking
about where they can be where they can
individually take the quickest route
over the internet to get wherever it is
they're going to make sure that the
receiving computer can put the packets
back together properly dental records
are included sorry to put it back
together properly into driving
directions a tech quickie episode or an
advice animal meme TCP slaps a header on
to each packet that contains
instructions on what order to reassemble
the packets into as well as error
checking information so that the
receiving computer knows whether the
packets data arrived without any mishaps
after this is done the packets are
pushed onto the creatively named
Internet layer which uses the Internet
Protocol or IP to attach both the origin
and destination IP addresses so the
packet knows where it came from and
where it's going the data is then sent
through the final network layer that
handles things like Mac addressing so
the packets go to the right physical
machine as well as converting the data
into electrical impulses that will
actually pass through the proverbial
series of tubes and although every
single packet of data has to go through
all of these layers packet switching
actually makes the internet faster than
it would otherwise be since it allows
each packet to individually avoid
congestion and bottlenecks that would
occur if all the data had to travel
along the same route during each session
tcp/ip also streamlines things further
because it can deal with packets from
all your computers applications so that
your browser or game doesn't have to do
that by itself so all this stuff going
on behind the scenes means that you're
usually not kept waiting for too long at
least not anymore
since tcp/ip didn't exactly save us from
blocky videos back when we were all
using phone modems it sounded like a
couple of droids trying to have a
conversation would that be funny like a
sci-fi movie set 30 years from the
future where instead of the droids being
like Boop
they actually sound like modems I know
that's what they're doing that's damnit
Tarun speaking of what modems are doing
they are telling the sites that you
visit where you're visiting them from
and Tunnel Bayer VPN lets you hide that
data so it allows you to tunnel through
up to 20 different countries allowing
you to browse the Internet and use
online services as though you are in a
different country effectively making it
so the websites and services that you
visit don't know what your destination
IP was it instead gets replaced as soon
as you turn on that tunnel bare switch
with an IP somewhere else in the world
wherever you select in fact they've got
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac as well as a Chrome extension and
all you've got to do is just pick a
country and hit the switch your
connection will get encrypted and your
public IP will be switched and you don't
have to deal with any of that nonsense
like configuring ports or DNS server is
simple enough that my mom could do it
they also have a top rated privacy
policy and they do not log user activity
the best part is you can try out tunnel
bear for free with no credit card
required with 500 Meg's of data at the
link in the video description and then
you can save 10% when you decide to sign
up for an unlimited data plan by heading
over to our link tunnel bear calm / -
speaking of turns complaining guys liked

you disliked it check out our other
channels like channel super fun over
