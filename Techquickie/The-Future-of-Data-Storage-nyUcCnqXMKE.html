computer data storage I mean we've gone
from two gigabytes to two terabytes
being a typical amount of PC storage in
less than 20 years a thousandfold
increase so are things just going to
keep becoming exponentially more
capacitors why don't we start answering
this question with a look at our old
friends the mechanical hard drive
already there are a number of
technologies in the works that will make
hard drives more spacious while still
allowing them to fit in that familiar
three and a half inch enclosure hard
drive makers like Seagate and Western
Digital are working on technologies such
as shingled magnetic recording which
overlaps data tracks to essentially make
them narrower bit patterned media which
can encode one bit of data to just one
magnetic grain instead of a group and
heat assisted magnetic recording or
hammer which heats up small areas of the
hard disk allowing the magnetic grains
themselves that store the data to be a
lot smaller and you can learn more about
hammer in this video here these
technologies are expected to help push
hard drive capacities to 50 terabytes by
the year 2020 Wow but aside from
changing how magnetic platter data
recording works manufacturers are also
looking at using more exotic materials
hard drives filled with helium instead
of good old-fashioned air are already on
the market since helium is less dense
than air there's less fluid resistance
when the drive platters spin meaning
more precise positioning of the
read/write head with lower power
consumption and all of this without
making your mp3 sound like the singer
just sucked air from a balloon of course
by this point you may have moved off of
hard drives in favor of SSDs in which
case you might be more interested in
Intel and microns 3d crosspoint which
features very dense arrangements of
memory cells that don't require
transistors leading to higher capacities
3d crosspoint will also
have Layton sees up to a thousand times
lower than traditional meant and will
last for much longer than a conventional
SSD meaning we could see drives much
bigger and faster than what we have
today and Samsung is also working on a
competing technology called zine end
though they're being quite tight-lipped
about how it works but we're not just
restricted to making traditional hard
drives larger or making smaller and
smaller transistors for our SSDs there's
holographic data storage that takes the
concept of a dual layer optical disk to
a completely new dimension instead of
just storing data in a two-dimensional
pattern of what are effectively pits in
the surface holographic discs can store
data in three-dimensional patterns using
nearly the entire thickness of the disk
in fact multi terabyte single disks may
be available at some point though
progress on actually getting holographic
storage to market has been agonizingly
slow and unfortunately the Jedi Council
only existed very far away and very long
ago so they're not really around to show
us how holocrons work but although none
of us actually have midi-chlorians in
our blood the farther flung future of
data storage might be inside our own
bodies I'm talking about DNA the
chemical that stores your entire genetic
code down to that weird mole on your
butt so if you think back to high school
biology you might remember that each
base pair of your DNA is either a t or
GC meaning that DNA could be used as a
digital storage medium with each base
pair corresponding to a one or a zero
biologists have been synthesizing DNA in
the lab for quite a few years for tons
of different applications so perhaps it
shouldn't be that surprising that
scientists are looking at it as a way to
store data other than your genome a
single cubic millimeter of DNA can hold
over six hundred and eighty-five
terabytes
of data so just think of how many games
videos and dank means a DNA drive could
hold one day even if it were only the
size of a modern SD card DNA is also
very stable and could hold data for
millions of years making it potentially
a great choice for archival storage down
the line but hold on a minute Linus how
do you retrieve information from a
puddle well although scientists work
with DNA in liquid form don't scoff at
the concept of liquid state storage
researchers have recently used clusters
of nanoparticles only about 5 microns
wide about the same size as your typical
bacterium suspended in a fluid to hold
huge amounts of data I'm talking 1
terabyte in only a tablespoon this works
by using small temperature changes to
rearrange these nanoparticles to
different states and since each cluster
of these particles can have millions of
different states not just the binary 0 &amp;amp;
1 we're all used to liquid state storage
could reach capacities that just aren't
possible with present-day tech no word
though on when liquid drives might hit
the market or if you'll have to buy them
in a bag like those weirdos from Eastern
Canada already seem to do with milk are
you tired of hearing me try to sell you
other people's stuff you're in luck kids
because today I'm going to tell you
about the exclusive Linus tech tips
merch we have on sale right now our
store over at T Spring calm has a wide
selection of t-shirts including tech
quickie shirts if you're a big fan of
this channel and our new hash tag out of
ideas shirt if you haven't gotten tired
of saying it in the comments you can
even get a tote bag a sticker or a
coffee mug if you want to start your day
with a nice hot cup of Linus who wrote
this cheese and on crowd made you can
pick up your all new posters we have one
for each of our channels perfect for
your living room dorm room or your
mother's room they come in two different
sizes that are printed on high quality
poster stock so if you'd like to support
us directly by pick
up some awesome swag check out our
stores at teespring and crowd made in
