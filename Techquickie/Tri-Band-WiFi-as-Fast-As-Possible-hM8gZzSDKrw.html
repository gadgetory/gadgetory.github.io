and they all seem to be more or less the
same you're getting kind of bored and
just gonna grab the one with the
prettiest box of the whoa look at that
Wireless 3200 are you freaking kidding
over three gigabit Wi-Fi speed with
tri-band technology time to throw it all
your wired devices that are limited to
will see one gigabit connections right
actually no and I'll explain why but
first let's get our terminology straight
a wireless router is a bit of a misnomer
but the term is so universally used that
we're kind of stuck with it inside that
box is actually three discrete
components each of which can usually be
turned off if you want to use a
standalone appliance for that
functionality instead so the first one
is a router the traffic controller
between the whole network all of your
devices are connected to and all the
other networks out there on the internet
number two is a network switch the
traffic controller between all of your
devices and number three is a wireless
access point or ap a radio with antennas
that are sort of like a mini cell tower
in your house that communicates with all
your wireless standard compliant devices
over the approved frequencies usually in
the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz ranges all right
so with that out of the way the
important piece of the puzzle for this
discussion is the access point how can
it use the same wireless AC standard
that we've already had for a couple of
years and achieves so much more than the
1900 megabit max that we've seen
advertised on dual band wireless ApS up
until now well a big part of the problem
actually lies in the marketing for these
devices a dual band AC 1980 never
actually achieves a 1900 megabit link
speed to anything literally never that's
an aggregated value for both the
wireless AC 1300 megabit 5 gigahertz
connection and the wireless and 600
megabit 2.4 gigahertz connection when
they're being used concurrently but an
individual client like your phone or
computer would not be designed to
utilize the two at the same time so what
would be the point of tri-band or even
duel them for that matter if true max
connection speeds are still stuck at
1,300 megabit think of it like adding
more lanes to the highway rather than
increasing the speed limit more bands or
radios means smoother operation with a
greater number of connected devices
because Wi-Fi is a polite communication
protocol every other device in a given
frequency has to wait it's turn while
another one is talking so if you move
some of your devices onto one frequency
and others onto a completely separate
non overlapping frequency you're
dramatically improving the overall
amount of data you can throw through the
air more bands also helps address
overall Wi-Fi slowdowns that occur when
a legacy or slower client connects to
the network using band steering
technology and to separate 5 gigahertz
radios each supporting three spatial
streams the AP can sort the device is
connected to it according to their
capability with all the slow clients on
one radio or going being scrubland on
that radio by themselves and the faster
ones on another improving performance
for your shiny new gadgets sounds cool
Linus but if adding more bands or
discrete radios doesn't increase
point-to-point connection speed then how
can we ever replace our wires well the
way it's been done up until now has been
to utilize more and more of the
available wireless spectrum per radio by
transmitting and receiving on more
frequencies concurrently like a wireless
802.11 AC compliant device must support
at least two antennas operating together
for example but there are some issues
with that number one is that more
spatial streams increases power
consumption and heat output which is a
big deal on the client side where you
might have a phone or a laptop and if
your clients don't support the faster
link speed then you'll get no benefit
anyway and another is that with the
limited number of five gigahertz
frequencies or channels available
creating new link speed standards that
can only be achieved by sprawling across
more and more of the available spectrum
will result in interference from the
overlapping networks of your neighbors
very soon just like we already have with
2.4 gigahertz
by speaking of neighbors our friendly
neighbors over at lynda.com are the
sponsor of today's episode lynda.com is
a great online resource for learning you
can pick up a new skill for a hobby like
photography or you can pick up new
skills for a profession like photography
or video editing in fact we've got a
couple of people working here at Lynas
Media Group that have got some of their
online education from lynda.com their
plans are extremely reasonable they
offer a 10 day free trial so you can try
it out before you commit and their
courses are updated constantly with
great content from industry experts so
head over to lynda.com slash tech wiki
to try out the free trial and to
potentially sign up just like actually a
lot of our viewers have already Linda's
told us that their feedback is great the
feedback that I get from people on
Twitter is great good stuff all around
thanks for watching guys like this video
