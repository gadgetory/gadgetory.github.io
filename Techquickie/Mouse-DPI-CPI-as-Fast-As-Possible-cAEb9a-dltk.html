you'll often have someone try to sell
you on based on how many dpi it's rated
at but this is actually one of the most
overused overhyped words in the gaming
peripheral industry but before we get
into that I should probably explain what
dpi actually means dpi is a misnomer
when referring to mouse sensitivity it
stands for
dots per inch meaning the number of dots
that can fit in a straight line which is
one inch in length on a screen or
printed image the proper name for
measurement of mouse sensitivity is
actually CPI or counts per inch
this is the number of counts or virtual
pixels that the mouse sensor will be
able to display and register on a
surface in 1 inch of physical space
optical sensors have a maximum native
resolution or native CPI based on the
size contraint sub a mouse usually
somewhere between 800 and 1600 CPI so in
order to raise the CPI beyond that level
manufacturers actually have to split
each virtual representation of a pixel
into four or more virtual pixels which
is why dpi technically CPI measurements
given by manufacturers are usually in
multiples of 800 well split away you
might be saying higher CPI must always
be better and let's not go that far
splitting these virtual pixels actually
causes some significant issues with
sensor accuracy as having more virtual
pixels creates more noise or
interference and therefore more errors
when reading mouse movements the main
message here is that just because your
mouse has 80,000 c-p-r does not mean
that it's actually able to read more
information than a mouse with 800 CPI
CPI is only a measurement of the
relationship between how far your mouse
moves on the surface and how far your
cursor moves on the screen not a
measurement of precision or accuracy so
then why do mouse manufacturers insist
on releasing these mice with monstrous
dpi numbers attached to them the main
reason is as usual marketing and
branding being able to say our brands
new Mouse now featuring a 10 billion dpi
sensor sounds much more impressive than
you know our new Mouse with like
you know better quality switches inside
there any number of other features that
might actually make a difference and
it's not helped by the fact that the
industry created hype around this then
gamers created hype around it thinking
it was good in this creates a positive
feedback loop around this feature that
doesn't actually improve the product
necessarily and in some cases even makes
it less accurate the second reason is
that there are some people out there who
enjoy using their mouse at some
ridiculous high sensitivity whether they
use very high resolution displays they
move their mouse with little micro
movements or they just like to whip the
mouse cursor around on a screen faster
than most people's eyes can even move
and third there are some people who
legitimately do believe that they are
more accurate and shooters in other
games while using an extremely high
hardware CPI and lowering their
sensitivity and software but as I
mentioned before a higher CPI usually
leads to more noise and a higher error
rate for mouse movements so let's just
say the jury is still out on that last
one all right so it's conclusion time is
there a proper or best dpi the short
answer is no as is the case with most
computer peripherals it's going to come
down to personal preference so there
isn't necessarily a CPI that is better
than the rest the good news is that most
mice come with adjustable CPI so all you
need to do is experiment with a few
different ones play around with your
software sensitivity and cursor speed
and find out what works for you what we
can say for sure is that for the
foreseeable future we've pretty much
reached the top end of what we need in
terms of CPI so it's time for Mouse
manufacturers to work on features that
will actually improve the user
experience something some of them are
actually starting to do these days
speaking of improving experiences Josh
from fractal design seems to feel like
the best way for me to improve the
experience that you're having watching
this video you know rather than
listening to me talk about you know how
they've got you know great cases and
power supplies and cooling products and
all that stuff you know some kind of
sales pitch about their fractal design
scandinavian design would be to instead
show you guys my debut performance of
milkshake while wearing this ridiculous
wig so here it is My milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard and they're
like it's better than yours and damn
right it's better than yours I could
teach you but I have to charge alright
Josh are you happy now do you see what
you've done to me I'm a grown man I'm a
grown man with children and I wear this
wig because you make me do this anyway
sure the boys in the yard enjoyed it so
good for them guys be sure to check out
the fractal design link in the video
description of to give them some kind of
thanks for sponsoring us although I'm
not sure that I want you to like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment letting me
know if you have suggestions for future
fast as possible episodes we really do
read them and as always don't forget to
