usually a frustrating experience when
something begins to stutter you don't
want to happen while you're trying to be
able to post tech quickie
when you're shifting gears in the manual
car or worst of all in the middle of a
big match and while it seems like PC
gamers are locked in the constant battle
with their bank accounts to buy the
hardware that will give them the highest
frame rates possible many people still
experience stutters and hitching even on
high-end systems that seemingly should
be able to run just about anything
without breaking the sweat so why does
this happen well it turns out the frame
rates aren't the only factor that will
determine how buttery smooth or salad
the choppy your gaming experience will
be you also need consistent frame times
to avoid game breaking lag in the form
of stuttering think of it this way
suppose you're driving between Atlanta
and Charlotte a 240-mile trip and you
want to get there in four hours
one way to do it would just be to drive
it as smooth easy 60 miles per hour but
if you have a death wish and a lot of
money to give to the cops
you could try for two hours going one
mile an hour and the other two going a
hundred and nineteen assuming you
arrived in Charlotte alive you took the
same amount of time to get there either
way but the second option was probably
far less pleasant unless you really
loved just stomping all the pedals in
your car so this is what's happening
when you get inconsistent frame times
your graphics card could be spitting out
the nice smooth 60 frames per second you
covet when you check fraps but instead
of each frame being displayed on your
screen for the same amount of time some
frames might stay on the screen for far
longer than they should so why do these
huge variations happen even on powerful
hardware well spikes in frame time that
caused noticeable stuttering are usually
because of high latency with some tasks
your graphics card is trying to
accomplish and I'm not just talking
about trying to render a C that suddenly
become more processor intensive because
an explosion just happened or something
that usually manifests as a drop in
framerate that makes your game look less
smooth but not as stuttering instead
things that can cause actual
see include problems to drivers not
being optimized well for a certain game
your GPU having to suddenly pull a bunch
of assets at once from your video memory
issues with a PCI Express bus that can
be caused by poor motherboard design or
something like an adapter putting also
data through it or even delays while
your GPUs talk to each other to attempt
to sync up properly if you're rocking
two or more video cards on that note
inconsistent frame times are an
especially common issue with SLI and
crossfire setups and because poor frame
times are a direct result of how
difficult it is for your GPU to crunch
numbers and render the frame simply
turning down your in-game settings may
not help in the same way it would if
you're just trying to get more FPS so
then is there a way to fix this problem
well it's difficult to recommend a
universal solution since poor frame
times are often specific to a certain
game on a certain model or brand of
graphics card but some gamers have have
success limiting the frame rate outside
of their games using either the default
settings program or a third party
utility this can be helpful if your high
frame times are being caused by Hardware
bottlenecks like a busy GPU they can't
handle all the requests your CPU is
making but this also means you may have
to settle for a less visually appealing
experience meaning this problem can be a
tough nut to crack especially if your
Nutcracker costs $500 and is
aggressively overclocked so if you ever
had to control multiple computers at
once but hated dealing with the T is
switching between different keyboard and
mouse combos well then check out synergy
2 it's designed to be easier to use and
more seamless than synergy 1 synergy is
a mouse and keyboard sharing software it
works on Windows Mac and Linux computers
you get features like the ability to
share from anywhere where you can
automatically control any other computer
without reconfiguring it SSL encryption
to protect your keystrokes for attackers
and dynamic networking which detects the
best route automatically based on your
setup it always runs in the background
on all operating systems so you can set
it and forget it you also get a cloud
bridge which allows you to use synergy
across VPNs and tricky home networks and
if you get the pro version you get
access to other cool features like
clipboard sharing drag-and-drop files
copy paste lock screen sync and lots
more
so check out synergy 2 today at the link
below ok guys thanks for watching tech
