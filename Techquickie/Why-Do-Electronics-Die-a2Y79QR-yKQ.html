things having a lifespan whether it's
your own body that discount pack of
chicken legs or that zesty new mean that
we'll be dead all over again within a
matter of weeks and your electronics are
no exception to this
even keyboard key switches rated for 10
million presses or military class
motherboards won't last forever but why
I mean especially with so many modern
electronics not having any moving parts
why can't they last indefinitely just
like how people can die from anything
from lupus to a Godzilla attack to a bad
ham sandwich electronics have many
points of failure that can lead to their
untimely demise let's start with a
common one capacitor failure capacitors
are those little cylindrical things that
look like water towers sticking out of
your PCB city and since their job is to
store and release electricity which you
can learn more about up here they
contain electrolytes that conduct
current and although many capacitors can
last for decades without any problems
some especially cheaper ones and
especially ones that use liquid
electrolytic chemicals instead of solid
ones can leak or burst over time as
happened during the infamous capacitor
plague of the early 2000s and while it
didn't wipe out a third of Europe's
population it did result in the untimely
failure of thousands and thousands of
devices but even if your PCB city is
functioning correctly he can ultimately
be the undoing of your fancy gadgets you
see when temperatures fluctuate
materials tend to expand and contract
think about how sidewalks crack when the
weather changes certain things on a
circuit board can act similarly
especially the soldering points which
are crucial for keeping everything
physically connected over time many
cycles of heating up and cooling down as
your electronics turn on and turn off or
go from idle to load can
cause these connections to weaken
increasing resistance or break outright
heat can also result in nasty
consequences on a microscopic level it
can cause silicon atoms in your GPU or
CPU to actually relocate over time and
it also accelerates a naturally
occurring phenomenon known as electro
migration that happens in the nano scale
copper traces that are found on your
processors you see I'm about to blow
your mind even though we often think of
electricity as a form of energy moving
somehow through wires current is
actually the physical flow of electrons
that means that even though they're
subatomic they still do have mass they
don't visibly spin like a fan but even a
wire has tiny moving parts that means
that over time they can displace or
damage the copper or other metal that
they spread through resulting in cracks
are voids that can inhibit performance
or even break a processor completely and
although electronics don't often die
this way as they become smaller and
smaller mitigating electro migration has
become an increasingly important area of
research now to be fair these problems
don't usually surface before you'd want
to replace your device anyway but
misbehaving electrons can cause more
pressing problems they have a tendency
to accumulate in certain materials and
scrip the voltages they need to operate
this is why SSD is not only don't have
an infinite lifespan but they
essentially have a countdown timer on
them electrons build up in the
transistors inside them that are used to
store data so after enough read/write
cycles enough electrons get stuck in
these transistors to decrease the
required voltage to the point where the
data becomes stuck and you can no longer
write to that part of the drive now of
course for the average user things like
corrosion factory defects mechanical
wear on parts like USB ports and hard
drives or user error are much more
likely to bring down your system than
electron shenanigans but there's also
planned
so lessons where companies intentionally
design products to fail shortly after
the warranty expires or the issue
software updates that make them less
useful over time forcing us to go buy
new ones but our corporate overlords
wouldn't do that mean so right
speaking of non mean stuff there's
tunnel Bayer VPN which lets you tunnel
to up to 20 different countries allowing
you to browse the Internet and use
online services as if you're in that
different country if easy to use apps
for iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
have a Chrome extension just choose a
country in the app turn til they're on
and watches your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so you show up as
if you're in that country they also have
a top rated privacy policy and do not
log user activity you can try out tunnel
their VPN with 500 megabytes of free
data and no credit card required and if
you do choose to get a year of unlimited
data you can save 10% by going to tunnel
bear comm / Linus thanks for watching
guys if you liked it liked it if you
dislike it dislike it let me know in the
comments down below if there's other
stuff you'd like us to cover
check out channel super-fun because they
do super cool things there but as for me
I think my capacitor has expired so I'm
going to go get some maintenance done at
the local electronics shop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
