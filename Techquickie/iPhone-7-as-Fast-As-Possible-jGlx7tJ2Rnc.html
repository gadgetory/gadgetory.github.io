event you know that's your signal to
hold your breath and see which one of
your AI devices will be rendered no
longer cool by an updated version that's
a little thinner and has a slightly
higher pixel dish so behold the iPhone 7
so what has Apple done to differentiate
it from the iPhone 6 and 6s which
released to great fanfare due to the
long-awaited 4.7 inch screen well the
most obvious change is Apple's decision
to ditch the conventional 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack in favor of a single
lightning connector but why get rid of
such a mainstay of portable electronics
no the answer isn't courage despite what
Apple said in their product reveal and
got roundly lambasted by basically
everyone with a social media account
apple claims that removing the headphone
jack saves space inside the iPhone
making it easier to include as many
other features as possible such as the
barometric vent that they added to
determine altitude or perhaps to make
the 159 US dollar Wireless air pods and
easier sell now of course there's a
great deal of speculation that Apple
might have done this since it now owns
beats which is a huge player in the
bluetooth headphone scene or that they
might have done it to boost the
popularity of lightning headphones which
third-party companies would have to pay
royalties to Apple in order to
manufacture whatever the real reason may
be you'll need to use an included
adapter if you want to keep listening to
3.5 millimeter analog headphones
charging and listening to music through
wired headphones at the same time will
require purchasing a third-party adapter
not the most elegant solution
and speaking of removing features the
physical home button that can actually
be pressed downward is a memory as well
as Apple has switched to a touch only
home button that incorporates apple's
taptic engine that will give the user
haptic feedback pretty cool and likely
less prone to failure though some folks
will definitely miss a physical button
but a change much more likely to
be welcomed by all is the addition of
stereo speakers so not won't sound like
the audio is just awkwardly coming out
of one side of the phone when you're
watching a video in landscape mode Apple
is also claiming that the speakers will
get twice as loud as an iPhone 6s so
hopefully you won't have to say you know
sorry that's as loud as it goes to your
friends nearly as often as before the
camera also gets an upgrade with the
iPhone 7 including both image
stabilization since many of us aren't
that good at keeping our hands still
when snapping pictures myself included
and a larger aperture for better
low-light performance if you opt for the
larger phablet style iPhone 7 plus you
actually get two rear cameras with the
extra lens featuring real actual optical
zoom so it can act as a telephoto lens
so what's under the hood to power it all
Apple's new a 10 SOC features the first
quad-core CPU we've seen in an iPhone
with two cores assigned to everyday
tasks well the other two consume more
power and are leveraged when you're
pushing the iPhone while doing things
like gaming throw in some water
resistance a new glossy jet-black finish
that could either look cool or be
inevitably a fingerprint magnet and a
slightly longer battery life and the
iPhone 7 ends up being a not
insignificant upgrade from the 6 and 6s
but is it worth the premium that Apple
charges especially with even many
diehard Apple fans lamenting the loss of
the headphone jack keep an eye on the
