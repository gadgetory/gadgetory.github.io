helicopter from Independence Day that
got super wrecked by those aliens who
weren't that friendly we've been using
visible light to communicate with each
other in a lot of different ways for a
long time but imagine this for a second
data flowing out of your living room
light fixture like water from a
showerhead it's real and it's called
Wi-Fi the lie of course standing for
lightest because I invented no just
kidding
I've standing for light but aside from
the novelty of it how would this be
better than existing standards like
Wi-Fi that use radio waves
great question well unlike the RF
signals that make up a Wi-Fi connection
which tend to spread out everywhere from
the access point visible light is easier
to focus and concentrate in one area I
mean just go outside with a magnifying
glass on a sunny day if you don't
believe me this makes it possible to fit
a lot more data into a life I signal but
then it raises even more questions
how would visible light transmit data
anyway well Wi-Fi uses LED bulbs which
can be switched on and off very very
quickly they don't have that warm up
time or that warm up time of an
incandescent or a fluorescent so quickly
can this be done in fact that the human
eye cannot even detect it but special
receivers that can connect to your
computer or other device can translate
this flickering into actual data and
here's another cool thing visible light
is also much less susceptible to
interference than radio waves so you add
all that up and you end up with a
communication standard that could be
much faster than Wi-Fi in fact
researchers at Oxford achieved speeds of
224 gigabits per second in the
laboratory that's over 200 times faster
than even a Google Fiber internet
connection and beyond just raw speeds
life.i promises to offer a number of
other advantages since it only uses
visible light life
by signals can't penetrate walls
offering a higher degree of privacy a
malicious user who wants to snoop on
your network traffic would actually have
to be physically in the same room or at
the very least creeping outside your
window making it nearly impossible for
someone outside your home or office to
eavesdrop on your wireless signal and
since life I uses relatively inexpensive
LED bulbs which consume less power than
a Wi-Fi access point visible light
networks could be deployed relatively
cheaply using mostly existing technology
the power savings also potentially could
have significant implications for global
energy consumption if life.i becomes as
ubiquitous as Wi-Fi has one day
especially as life.i transmitters can be
dimmed to reduce bandwidth if you don't
need to download 15 movies in one second
but although the technology has great
potential it is still very experimental
and we probably won't be seeing it hit
the mainstream market for several years
at best and it isn't without its
limitations either for example life.i
offers greater privacy but the
disadvantage of obviously not working in
the next room over unless you've you
know got your lightbulbs synched or
whatever else and it could also be
disrupted by excessive light pollution
though maybe we're ignoring the biggest
advantage of all not having to shop for
routers and light bulbs in a separate
aisle at the store anymore you guys
should definitely check out the link in
the video description to FreshBooks it's
designed for freelance workers or small
businesses and it's basically an online
tool that makes invoicing getting paid
and tracking your expenses easier all
the little details about cash flow are
in one place so you know where you stand
it shows a full history of each invoice
and allows you to check if your client
has viewed the invoice and paid directly
through fresh books by credit card and
this is cool they actually just launched
their deposits feature so if you're a
house painter or a plumber or any kind
of work where you might do you know a
deposit and then half the work and then
you know some more work and then they
pay the rest at the end or whatever else
those more complicated payment schemes
are now support
in pretty cool stuff so all you got to
do to try out fresh books for free is
head over to freshbooks dot-com slash
tech quickie and don't forget to enter
tech quickie and how did you hear about
us section so thanks for watching guys
if you liked this video hit that like
button if you just liked it well
whatever I guess you can't hit the
dislike button too that's another
reaction also check out our other
channels of run Linus tech tips we've
got a great video that just went up
recently of Wow oh yeah Brandon reviewed
a camera pretty sick the a7s mark 2 or 2
or R 2 or whatever it is Sony calls
their second-generation follow ups we
can never keep track of these things
also leave a comment below if you have
suggestions for future videos and don't
forget to subscribe and follow tech wiki
for more videos just like this one
or maybe unlike this one maybe like the
one you suggested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
