the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so do you
feel like whenever you type personal
information into a webpage it probably
ends up in the hands of an executive
with dollar signs in his eyes holding
court at a mad tea-party of advertisers
and people with agendas well sadly
that's less for paranoid delusion that
I'd like and it's exactly the kind of
thing that the European Union's to you
general data protection regulation is
trying to stop and because it was
implemented so recently plenty of large
tech firms have been scrambling to make
sure they don't get caught on the wrong
side of the law but what exactly does
the law do so the basic idea is that any
organization or business that either
operates in the EU or handles data
relating the people in the EU has a few
responsibilities me the even of business
here in Canada like Linus Media Group
can find itself in hot water with the
European authorities if I use something
like let's say sell your email address
to a company that makes explosive
discount power supplies but I wouldn't
do anything like that to you guys wait a
minute but that doesn't mean your data
can't be sold one of the biggest
linchpins of the GDP are is consent if
you're the EU you have a right to be
informed about what type of data is
being collected and why it's being
collected before you hit OK and this
pertains to lots of different types of
data a single photo a comment you made
on a public social media post and even
your name are covered GE PR requires
companies who specifically lay out each
piece of data they're collecting from
you for your consent to be valid after
you've given your consent and the suck
or whoever else gets their mitts on your
sweet sweet personal information there
are some more rules concerning how they
have to store it specifically it has to
be protected in some way whether it's
through encryption or by keeping the
data separate from other data that could
be used together to identify an
individual person so for example a
national ID number should be sequestered
from other information that could enable
an attacker to work out who it belongs
to and if the attacker does breach a
database or if someone was just careless
with the USB stick the organisation has
to inform a Data Protection Authority
within three days of when it found out
and they'd also be on the hook to know
too
you yes you Auto from Berlin in the
case of a really serious breach but it's
a mere notifications isn't enough for
you and you just want the data off their
servers the GDP are also obligates
companies to give you access to an
on-demand or to delete your data upon
request
partly stemming the tide of the Internet
is forever with a right to be forgotten
though bear in mind that if one of your
terrible hot text gets retweeted a
million times there's nothing you can do
to force private Internet users to
delete their screen caps but back to
businesses why would they comply with
this well as it turns out there are
serious consequences for businesses that
don't handle your data with respect for
willful violations or for repeat
offenders the files can be as high as
four percent of annual turnover and that
may not sound like much but for large
enterprises like Google that could
amount to billions yes billions of
dollars so this sounds pretty good if
you're an EU resident but what if you
live in the US Japan or Guinea Bissau
well some tech firms like Facebook and
Microsoft are implementing GD P are
compliant features worldwide giving
users outside the EU the same level of
access and control but don't imagine
this is out of the goodness of their
hearts in reality it probably has more
to do with it being more streamlined
than having different policies for
different locations and it's also not a
great look from a public relations
perspective to give you there's a
certain places less robust stated
protections just because they can so
that's a great step towards a more
global internet because I for one have
had just about enough of geo blocking
and are you interested in computer
science well then check out brilliant a
problem solving website that teaches you
to think like a computer scientist
instead of just passively listening to
lectures you get to master concepts by
solving fun and challenging problems and
brilliant provides the tools and
framework you need to tackle those
challenges
brilliant stop provoking content based
around breaking up complexities into
bite-sized understandable chunks will
lead you from curiosity to mastery and
you'll be in the company of over five
and a half million members who share
your curiosity and love for math and
science so what are you waiting for you
