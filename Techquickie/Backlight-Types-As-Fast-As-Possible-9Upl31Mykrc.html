stereoscopic dual screen systems like
the 3ds weren't the order of the day and
portable gaming meant enjoying your
original Gameboy and all its monochrome
glory well that was only glorious until
the Sun went down because it was
impossible to see the screen without
shining a light on it because it was an
LCD display with no backlighting you see
LCDs whether they're the simple ones and
things like a gameboy or a calculator or
the more complex ones in modern flat
panel monitors and televisions cannot
actually produce their own light Oh LEDs
are different you can learn more about
those here but conventional LCD screens
solve this problem by putting a light of
some sort behind the panel which shines
through the LCD illuminating the image
so you can actually see what's going on
and even though older CRT monitors
didn't have this issue because they used
phosphorescent materials that glowed on
the screen
LCDs quickly became more popular due to
their lower weight and power consumption
not to mention their smaller size and
eventually higher image quality so back
lights became a fixture in modern
displays earlier flat panel monitors
used back lights called cold cathode
fluorescent lamps or see CFLs these were
basically just tubular bulbs like the
ones you'd find installed in an office
but smaller installed behind the LCD and
they're actually pretty similar as well
to the cold cathode tubes that modders
use for case lighting see CFLs were
cheap and easy to install and displays
but had a number of limitations they
were heavy they consumed a lot of power
and they couldn't regulate the
brightness of small areas of the screen
with any precision whatsoever since it
was only a few bulbs that would
illuminate the entire screen resulting
in issues with black levels and image
accuracy that left a lot to be desired
see CFLs also had the issue of taking
several minutes to achieve full
brightness at
you turned them on much like a lightbulb
can take some time to warm up and even
though some see CFLs were marketed as
wide Gannet meaning they had different
phosphors inside the bulbs that could
produce more colors LED displays quickly
displaced see CFLs when they hit the
market due to their lighter weight lower
power consumption and greater black
levels but even with these advantages
there were still some kinks to work out
a run-of-the-mill LED monitor replaces
those bulbs with LEDs which is cool but
it uses blue LEDs with yellow
phosphorous to create white light which
makes a nice enough looking picture but
because the LEDs themselves are blue the
backlight still emits a lot more blue
energy than red or green making colors
inherently a little lopsided so for a
while wide gamut see CFLs for all of
their flaws still offered better color
reproduction than LED backlit panels
until more recently when these wide
gamut see CFLs were dethroned by either
RG phosphor monitors which use red and
green phosphorus combined with blue LEDs
or the higher-end RGB LED displays which
have red green and blue LEDs in the
backlight both of these technologies
enable the monitor to emit more pure red
green and blue energy making for more
accurate color without the drawbacks of
C CFLs but LED backlights differ in more
ways than just color as some consist of
a full array of LEDs behind the screen
while others are only edgelet with LED
bulbs around well the edges of the
display edgelet displays use a special
layer called a diffuser to spread the
light out over the entire screen area
and are commonly found in smartphones
and less expensive desktop and
television displays full array LED
backlights tend to give higher picture
quality but are a little bulkier not to
mention more expensive than their edge
it counterparts some LED displays use
their full array nests to enable a
feature called local dimming which means
that they can actually adjust the
brightness of small portions of the
screen on the fly for more accurate
black levels and color saturation but
regardless of exactly what type of LED
screen you end up buying try and find
out whether it uses PWM or DC for its
backlight dimming whether it's for local
dimming or just for turning down the
overall brightness of the image coming
out of the display now you might be
familiar with these terms if you've
shopped for case fans for example but
what they mean for monitors is this a
PWM display dims itself by making the
backlight flicker a certain number of
times per second the light is always on
at the same brightness it's just
actually off some of the time and so
you'll perceive it as dimmer and while
PWM is easy for manufacturers to
implement some people do find this super
fast flickering distracting and
fatiguing on their eyes which is why
some companies market their DC that is
voltage control backlight monitors as
flicker free but hold on a second line
is cut back length that's old technology
OLED generates its own light and is
becoming increasingly popular well
that's true but for now the vast
majority of displays out there use
backlighting of some sort and they tend
to be cheaper than Oh LEDs without some
of the longevity and burning concerns
that come along with OLED technology so
while uh you know getting a fancy OLED
screen might seem kind of appealing to
you you got to make sure that you
monitor just how much money you have in
your bank account before you go for it
and speaking of terrible jokes
audible.com is not a terrible joke that
the leading provider of audiobooks with
more than 180,000 downloadable titles
across all types of literature including
fiction nonfiction fanfiction actually I
don't know how much fanfiction they have
unless you count like
fifty shades but they've got periodicals
and audiobooks are great to listen to
when you are oh I don't know let's say
assembling computers it's kind of a
mindless activity at a certain point
once you get pretty good at it so having
some earbuds in you can catch up on your
reading all day at work without actually
missing out on getting any of your work
done
cool right or if you have a long commute
you can run it in your car you can run
it off your phone it is pretty much
freaking awesome for anyone who is time
challenged but still wants to enjoy
whether it's classic literature more
contemporary stuff even something like I
don't know like power of habit by
Charles Duhigg which is all about like
changing habits in your life to breed
success in your life in your business
