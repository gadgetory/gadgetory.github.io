you're sitting there minding your own
business and you don't what's that
strange ticking noise oh my geez it's a
log so you call your friend who happens
to be an expert in Ordinance Disposal
for some reason and you scream into the
phone quick a bomb was planted by
Canadian separatists over the rising
cost of maple syrup how do i defuse it
your buddy tries to take a picture of
page 62 of his junior bomb defusal
guidebook with his smart phone but hold
on there's a problem the year is 1970
and his phone vanishes in a puff of
logic what now luckily your friend has
the presence of mind to dash over to his
Minolta facts 11:14 and jam the
instructions in a few minutes later you
defused the bomb and Canada is once
again safe from the scourge of syrup
obsessed extremist thanks to the power
of everyone's favorite office companion
the fax machine but as much as we all
love them very few people know that fax
machines have actually been around since
the 19th century this was truly a piece
of technology that was way ahead of its
time especially considering that the
next widespread way to send scanned
documents electronically email wouldn't
come along until nearly 100 years after
the first device that could send 2d
scans over phone lines which was
invented in the 1880s but how was the
underlying technology for fax machines
developed so long before the internet
age well a big part of this is the fax
machines inherent simplicity
although faxes generally do use a
charge-coupled device or CCD to read
patterns on a piece of paper like a
modern scanner which is a process you
can learn more about here your typical
fax operates in an even more
straightforward manner fax machines
actually see each piece of paper has a
large grid of squares
as they scan the document they determine
whether each square is black or white
they do this one line at a time
converting each line in two tones
corresponding to black and white spots
then they send these down the phone line
to a receiving fax machine which uses
its integrated dot matrix inkjet or
laser printer to spit out the image so
if all of this sounds a bit crude well
that's because it is well then why do
people even still use these things well
there is still some appeal to the
one-step approach of putting a hard copy
into a box and then having another hard
copy get spit out of a box on the other
end without having to download and
rotate and resize and print attachments
or whatever the case may be and this is
especially true for organizations that
often need to send and receive physical
documents such as law firms or medical
offices that also need to have physical
copies on hand for legal reasons
and since fax machines can completely
bypass the internet they can be seen as
a more secure alternative that's less
prone to hacking in fact some Hollywood
businesses started using fax machines
again after the infamous Sony hack back
in 2014 but this simple approach does
have some drawbacks for starters it's
limited by how quickly data can be sent
down the part of the phone wire that
carries voice signals so instead of
modern multi megabit speeds fax is
limited to what you'd see with an old
dial-up modem or even slower which might
not seem like a huge issue if you're
trying to send a few pages but even in
that case the black and white scanning
combined with low resolution means that
fax machines are notoriously bad at
transmitting detailed images fax
machines can't send shades of gray and
typically have resolutions that max out
at below 4
100 dots per inch way lower than what
many modern flatbed scanners can do but
while these disadvantages may make fax
feel like a relic today it still has its
place in the modern world
plain old phone lines tend to be more
reliable than internet connections so
fax machines are a pretty good backup if
your Wi-Fi is on the fritz and you
really need to send something just make
sure that you can trust whoever's on the
other end
speaking of tools that are great for
businesses fresh books if you're a
freelancer or a small business owner
there has never been an easier way to
keep track of your expenses I mean and
it's like paper complicated accounting

the cloud on their desktop and even
their mobile app and it lets you track
your expenses log your hours and send
professional-looking invoices in just a
