picture the captain as a seasoned pro
with years of experience who will have
your aircraft solidly under control at
all times and in most cases you wouldn't
be wrong except that the captain might
not actually be flying the plane wait a
minute what well there's a tremendous
level of automation that goes into
modern jet liners from redundant safety
systems that kick in automatically to
fly-by-wire controls that don't directly
connect to the planes control surfaces
these turn the yoke into something less
like a steering wheel and more like an
Xbox controller and prevent the plane
for making maneuvers the system deems
too dangerous but even aside from all
this you may have heard that modern
planes can basically fly themselves and
to a large extent this is kind of true
you see after the plane takes off a
computerized autopilot will usually take
over it works by linking two sensors
attached to the aircraft that track
everything altitude wind speed direction
how much the aircraft is banking or if
there's turbulence it's kind of like an
airborne version of Lane Assist features
on newer semi-autonomous cars
additionally most modern airliners have
a computer called a flight management
system which allows the pilot to enter a
flight plan before taking off which
includes the destination Airport as well
as which waypoints the plane should
reach on the way so after takeoff the
autopilot will take all this information
and control the planes speed pitch and
direction by quickly calculating how to
safely move the plane's control surfaces
with no input from the human pilot
required and if air traffic control
needs the captain to make changes in
flight the autopilot can help with that
too for example to change the aircraft's
heading or direction all the captain has
to do in many cases is to turn a knob to
the desired heading and the plane will
turn itself newer planes can even land
themselves using the same information
and while the thought of rapidly
approaching the ground under the control
of a machine is a little scary the idea
is that this kind of automation actually
makes planes safer decisions about how
the plane should maneuver can be made
more quickly and with more precision
than if a human pilot had to manually
fly the entire time in fact some people
have said that they can feel that a
plane ride gets bumpier when a pilot is
flying manually
and of course fatigue is a real factor
think about how easy it is to zone out
on a half hour drive now imagine doing
that on a twelve hour flight
six miles off the ground hi Caramba
however auto pilots aren't perfect
obviously they can't react to most
emergency situations or make unexpected
adjustments that responsibility still
falls on the captain who is required to
monitor what the auto pilot is doing and
make sure it's carrying out the correct
instructions many pilots don't think of
an auto pilot as an entity that flies
the plane rather the human pilots still
fly the plane through an automated
system and despite the high levels of
automation part of the reason jet pilots
still have to go through thousands of
hours of training and flight time is
that they need to understand of a
miscommunication between the autopilot
and the captain's intention is happening
for example the recent crashes of a pair
of new Boeing 737s appear to be related
to an issue where an automated system
pushed the plane nose down because it
misread sensor data about the planes
angle of attack leading the system to
possibly think the plane was about to
stall and in 2013 the well-publicized
crashed landing of an Asiana flight in
San Francisco was determined to be the
result of the pilot misunderstanding
what mode the planes autopilot was in
leading the plane to touchdown short of
the runway so it may not be surprising
that on something as complicated as an
airplane computers are capable of
becoming confused just like their
fallible human pilots but the hope is
that as we learn from mishaps and pilots
become more accustomed to using
automation flying can continue to get
progressively safer speaking of safety
