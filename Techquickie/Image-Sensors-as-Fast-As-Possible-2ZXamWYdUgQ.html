family member to share on social media
recording footage to upload for
co-workers or just taking a selfie for
fun with the girls having a night on the
town it cannot be disputed that digital
photography has become standard to our
modern way of living and while we take
for granted but pretty much anyone can
produce a phone that is spilling over
with pictures of small humans and
animals they adore have you ever stopped
to think what makes all of this possible
well even if you didn't the answer is
image sensors and thanks to them we are
now able to capture high-quality photos
and videos more directly into a digital
format for easy usage and instead of
going through the cumbersome extra steps
that we did historically you see kids
back in the days of the ancient
Pharaoh's cameras used a specialized
light-sensitive plastic substance to
capture images projected onto it through
a lens known as phlegm excuse me film
you took a roll of it to the local
chemist who developed it and gave you
physical pictures which if you wanted to
upload to your geo city site needed to
be scanned in a scanner now instead of
using film to capture images today's
digital sensors work hard to
artificially mimic the transduction
process of a biological eye in order to
do all this in a much more simple
fashion well sort of simple transduction
simply defined is the conversion of one
energy form into another and whether
this comes as a result of an organic or
mechanical means is actually completely
irrelevant so the human eye rod and cone
receptors work in combination with
ganglion cells to convert photons into
an electrochemical signal which the
occipital lobe in your brain can then
process in the case of an image sensor
though photons are captured as charged
electrons in silicon and converted to a
voltage value through the use of
capacitors and amplifiers then later
transfer it into digital code which can
be processed by a computer while there
are many ways of going about this most
sensors operate in a similar manner to
one another with the big difference that
splits them being the way in which they
process stimuli all these many types
there are two more readily available in
mature forms of sensors CCD and CMOS
charge coupled device sensors work by
regice
during photon rays in silicon which
contains a grid array of pixels after
electron charges are captured in this
pixel array they're then processed from
the bottom to the top of the grid into a
serial shift register and pushed out a
single charge at a time to be converted
into an analog voltage that is then
transformed into coding by way of an
analog to digital converter since these
sensors operate by processing charges
individually across the lines of an
array this system utilizes a respectable
amount of power to function but this
also gives it the benefit of being
extremely low noise due to the minimized
use of voltage amplifiers often making
them better for particular types of
photography such as aerial or space this
of course brings us to complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor x' which are
the type of image sensor most commonly
found in consumer grade products as I
stated earlier most image sensors
operated in a generally similar fashion
so what makes these different from the
CCD sensors just described is that
instead of shuffling electron charges
along an array to then be modified extra
circuitry has been added to each pixel
which allows it to do more or less all
the processing individually with the
signal then being sent directly down the
line to the CPU since there's no
gridlock to be managed in this operation
the power usage is actually reduced
simultaneously with the added benefit of
an increase in processing speed now well
both of these sensor types have done
well and continue to develop in their
own sort of respective specialized
fields that's not to say that there
isn't any room for future improvements
though modern sensors have been wise in
taking their inspiration from biology
the processors which reconstruct the
coded images sent to them have a ways to
catch up if they want to give our brains
a run for their money I mean you see the
current answer to improving image
quality in electronics is to increase
pixel counts and fine-tune photo or
sensor sensitivities when the fact is
that the eye that we use to sit in
judgment of all this stuff is correctly
focused in a whopping 2% of our visual
field or about twice the size of your
thumbnail at arm's reach meaning our
brain is doing a lot of the work at
picking up the slack but unless we want
to resort to care
around Xerox machines with us whatever
we wish to share our important images
then they'll just have to serve us in
the mean time speaking of important
images if you want to create a site to
host your important images of your
family or your business or whatever else
you should check out Squarespace their
templates are simple it's powerful to
manage they're absolutely beautiful
looking you can end up with a great
looking site without a whole lot of
technical know-how
they've got 24/7 support via live chat
and email it's only 8 bucks a month and
you get a free domain if you by
Squarespace for a year and they've got
their whole responsive design concept
going on so when you pick out a template
instead of just looking great on just a
phone or looking great on just a
computer they scale intelligently
according to the size of the screen that
your viewer is viewing it with which is
great because who knows how important
the traffic coming to your site might be
they've got a commerce module so you can
put a store on your site you don't want
to miss out on a customer because they
go and they you know see something great
when they're browsing on their laptop
they go and they check it out on their
phone and they can't even figure out how
to check oh that kind of thing is a real
problem you can start with a trial with
no credit card required and start
building your website today you get two
weeks and when and if you decide to sign
up for Squarespace permanently you can
use offer code Lynas to get 10% off your
first purchase so thanks to Squarespace
