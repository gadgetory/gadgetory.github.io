wireless networking technology is rocky
at the best of times because it's slower
than wired and often flaky as balls but
the alternative is plugging Ethernet
cables into phones so yeah since we're
stuck with it I figured I'd give you
guys some quick tips on making the
experience as painless as possible
though we'll start with the stuff that
costs nothing number one position your
access point usually built into your
router correctly the coverage area is
sphere shaped so Center your access
point within your intended coverage area
as best as you can avoid putting it
directly on the floor on a thick wall or
next to a large object nearby dense
materials like stone metal and concrete
will reduce your wireless signal
strength number two check for software
and firmware updates for routers go to
the website of the brand on the box but
for many adapters instead of going to be
links website you can actually find
newer drivers on the wireless chipset
manufacturers website directly examples
of chipset makers include Broadcom and
Ray link number three choose the right
channel for your access point to run on
using a free tool like Wi-Fi analyzer
for Android gives you a visual
representation of the other wireless
networks in your area on the 2.4
gigahertz band there are only three
usable non-overlapping channels 1 6 and
11 and in a perfect world you would want
to pick whichever of these is open
unfortunately in apartment buildings and
even dense suburban areas this is
unlikely to happen and even with the
tool like this there will be some trial
and error because things like cordless
phones security cameras and baby
monitors are examples of products that
might not even show up on a Wi-Fi
network map but can cause serious
interference so play around with a
little bit to see how you get the best
results number 4 and this is where we
start getting into tips that cost money
is to grab a more sensitive antenna if
your access point has external antenna
support they come in two main flavors on
you directional antennas will keep the
spherical network shape but make it
bigger
while directional ones can be great if
you have a long thin coverage area that
you're trying to reach just make sure
you aim it properly
number 5 is
to get a repeater repeaters can be
configured with the same SSID or network
name and password so you can roam
between them pretty much without
noticing as long as you're not doing
something like streaming a Skype call
that's likely to get disconnected as you
move over a boundary I don't recommend
repeaters that connect to both your
device and to your access point
wirelessly I haven't had great
experiences with those so make sure you
get one that either connects through
powerline or Ethernet finally if all of
that stuff didn't cut it it might be
time for an upgrade an 802.11 AC access
point can deliver real-world throughput
over 500 megabit with a strong client
and even a dual Bend n1 gives you access
to the much wider range of 5 gigahertz
channel that also generally suffer from
less random interference both of these
things are very good things what's great
too is that you don't need to upgrade
all of your stuff immediately legacy
devices that can't be upgraded such as
phones or tablets can connect to the 2.4
gigahertz network on your new access
point and newer or upgraded devices can
connect to the entirely separate 5
gigahertz network to enjoy a totally
different Wi-Fi experience I just moved
my notebook to AC wireless with a cheap
intel mini PCI Express card from Amazon
real world bandwidth is about twice as
good as my old card so I'm pleased as
punch with the snap here file transfer
speeds and more reliable movie streaming
experience speaking of better streaming
experience hotspot Shield hotspot Shield
VPN is easy to set up inexpensive and
with their elite service you can access
all kinds of streaming services that
otherwise wouldn't be available to you
u.s. Netflix will work anywhere in the
world which I guess is less of a big
deal for me because Canada has Netflix
too but I was in a real bind when Hulu
reached out to me about doing a sponsor
spot on my other channel and I had never
even used the service before since it's
not available to me fortunately for me
my other sponsor hotspot Shield this one
saved my bacon
and I was able to use Hulu to do my
sponsored spot so I was able to like try
it out and actually like make sure it's
great before I go talking about how
great it is the point here though is not
necessarily access to Hulu specifically
but more privacy and more freedom in
general when you're browsing the web
since a VPN on top of high
your region from the websites that
you're visiting also makes it more
difficult for them to find your IP and
any information about you that they can
track down with that so try hotspot
Shield today we recommend picking up an
elite trial rather than the ad-supported
free one it really is a much better
browsing experience and if you like it
