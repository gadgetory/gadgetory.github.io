won't miss any future videos so it
wasn't that long ago that any mention of
fingerprint scanning with conjure up
images of James Bond breaking it to a
supervillains evil lair these days it
seems like everyone from secret agents
to travel agents is carrying around
fingerprint scanners built into the
smartphones that are paying 30 bucks a
month for but how exactly do they work
and how are they found their way onto so
many consumer devices well as it turns
out typical fingerprint readers use the
same principle of capacitance as track
pads and touchscreens so if you check
out our other episode on touch screens
you'll know that they typically function
by detecting the difference in charge
between the lower layer of your skin
which is conductive and the phone screen
itself fingerprint readers adapt this
concept for personal identification by
cramming loss of tiny conductive plates
into the space just below the scanner
surface they're narrower than the ridges
that make up your fingerprints when you
place your finger tip against the reader
the sensors can tell which portions of
your finger the ridges are touching the
sensor and which are not because the
small valleys are further away from the
sensor which decreases the capacitance
the tiny place will pick up the reader
can use these differences in capacitance
to form a virtual image of the ridges of
your fingerprint now these scanners have
actually been on phones since 2007 but
only you really took off when Apple
released touch ID with the iPhone 5s in
2013 however there are other types of
fingerprint readers too optical scanners
use visible light to capture a more
traditional image of your fingertips but
these are uncommon at least imported of
Isis due to their bulk and ultrasonic
fingerprint readers have the potential
to be the next big thing these works
somewhat similarly to a bats
echolocation the way they work out the
shapes of objects in the dark ultrasonic
pulses emanate from the reader and hit
the ridges of your fingerprints then
variations in the return signal are used
to construct a scan ultrasonic sensors
not only have the advantage of a cool
marketing friendly name but they can
also work through other materials
allowing them to be seamlessly embedded
underneath the phone surface for a
slicker look or it appeared through the
crud of moisture on your hands for
better reliability than there are
capacitive counterparts sounds great
right but while many people originally
the fingerprint sensors is a highly
secure technology perhaps because of
their association with spy films they
certainly aren't foolproof no matter
exactly which variety you're using think
of how the scanner on your phone will
work even though you don't place your
finger on it in exactly the same
position every time this is because they
only require a good-enough
partial match to decided this your
finger now this allows it to recognize
you from many different angles but it
also means there's a small chance of a
false positive
and even though master fingerprints are
typically secured in some way like how
Apple encrypts the touch ID fingerprint
and stores it locally it's still
possible to defeat fingerprint readers
using artificial moles that can be
created if say some miscreant gets to
hold a fingerprints that you left on a
wineglass so while the technology is
super convenient there are holes that
have led most smartphone operating
systems to also require a password or
PIN which is especially important if
you're one of the few dozen or so people
in the world that were born without
fingerprints mmm well speaking of
fingerprints are you trying to leave a
unique impression on the world as a
freelancer but you're always racing
against the clock it's challenging but
with the growth of the Internet there's
never been more opportunities for the
self-employed to meet this need check
out fresh books cloud accounting
software designed for the way that you
weren't it's the simplest and easiest
way to be more productive more organized
and most importantly get paid quickly
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds so if
all my payments with just a couple of
clicks and get paid up to four days
faster see when your client has seen
your invoice and put an end to the
