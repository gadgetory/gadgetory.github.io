while browsing movies is the one you get
when you discover that your favorite
film has been remastered and re-released
then you purchase it rush home with your
new blu-ray of Bladerunner or whatever
and force your significant other to
watch it with you pointing at all the
menu little differences but despite how
often we fork over large sums of money
for better versions of movies or music
we already own rarely if ever do studios
explain what makes a film or music more
mastery let's start with what master
means in the first place so in the
worlds of film and music it's a remnant
of the old days of vinyl and a -
borrowed from the manufacturing
community referring to an object's
original mold from which many copies can
ultimately be mein oftentimes though the
final versions of records and then later
films wouldn't be directly copied from
the master anyway but instead from a
small run of high-quality copies of the
master known as mother's but nowadays
when we hear the term remastered often
times what they mean to say is
transferred from an older analog medium
to a newer digital one while meeting all
the necessary requirements to be
certified as DVD blu-ray laserdisc or
whatever you see back in the days of
analog there was a lot of contention as
to which type and size of film was best
so there ended up being quite a wide
range of film using an even wider range
of color grading and aspect ratios so
oftentimes the first step in remastering
a film is scanning the master copy with
a specialized digital camera usually at
a minimum of 2k resolution to meet DVD
and blu-ray standards but actually going
up as high as 8k and more resolution
once technicians have scanned the
original work at their desired
resolution they begin restoring the
digital print by using software which
does things like remove film impurities
that have been transferred such as dust
spots and cigarette burns an industry
term for the corner blip on screen which
indicated to the editor where splice
points between reels went they will also
likely adjust the color fill and
contrast
- try walking that line between the
modern standards that viewers expect and
the film's original intended appearance
from there it's just a matter of cutting
it down to the proper aspect ratio
remember that hold warning on films all
the time
bla bla bla it's something has been
formatted to fit your screen so it'll
most likely be sixteen by nine these
days for now anyway and then after the
visuals have been settled technicians
turned towards the audio once again they
utilize specialized software along with
a lot of time and care in this case to
help them remove sound impurities like
background mosquito noise or to boost
dialogue or edit audio levels as needed
and more importantly if you've got a you
know fancy surround sound speaker set up
adding effects like surround for the
modern movie watcher and pretty much
there you have it if a studio says that
they've done something more than that
well it's one of two things either
they're just trying to get you hyped up
to get your nostalgia and therefore
pocketbook flowing or they actually have
done more than that something that
upsets a lot of people some of which get
upset about the mere act of you know
colorizing a film saying it takes away
from the purity of the viewing
experience while others are it takes a
lot more to get them upset and you know
things like adding dewbacks so now we
can buy Star Wars in its fifth form
since its release or however many they
have now probably too many to count
I can't count very high speaking of
counting fresh books why are you doing
all of your accounting when you get home
at the end of the day when you're tired
after you've been doing you know I don't
know contract work or plumbing or
whatever the case may be no no you guys
should be using an online tool that lets
you do your invoicing get paid and track
all your expenses much more easily you
can keep details like cash flow and you
know the history of each job in each
invoice all in one place and it offers
cool tools like being able to send the
invoices to the client through fresh
books see if they viewed it and then
accept payment right through it no more
oh I didn't get your invoice or
I didn't see it no more excuses glad I'd
added to did this enough of that if
you're your own boss you should be using
stuff that makes you feel like a boss
