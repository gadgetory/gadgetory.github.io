stones if you live in glass houses and a
Dodge that only really works because
normal glass is highly shatter a bowl
but these days we use glass for a heck
of a lot more than Windows we interact
with our phones tablets and even some
laptops through touching a glass screen
and considering these are all portable
devices that we drop hit and generally
mistreat you'd think it would be far
easier to shatter them now don't get me
wrong the Internet is full of stories of
people who've cracked their iPhones but
many people go years and years without
anything happening to their glass
displays this is at least partially
thanks to toughened glass which is
nearly ubiquitous on modern mobile
devices but how exactly does something
as thin and lightweight as modern
smartphones stand up to your cat's claws
or drops onto hard concrete floors many
kinds of toughened glass such as
Corning's ever-popular Gorilla Glass
work because they have been chemically
toughened intuitively it might seem like
chemical toughening is no substitute for
just making the glass thicker but
certain chemicals can have a massive
impact on materials think of how strong
and light carbon fibres are but
toughened glass like Gorilla Glass that
might be in your smartphone is made by a
process called ion exchange you see the
glass that corning uses as a base for
Gorilla Glass has sodium ions embedded
in it which can be easily displaced by
larger potassium ions sheets of this
sodium containing glass are dipped into
a bath of liquid potassium salt that's
heated up to 400 degrees Celsius or over
750 Fahrenheit for our American viewers
the heat allows the potassium in the
bath to displace the smaller sodium ions
because the potassium ions are larger
they actually compress the glass on a
molecular level giving it much greater
strength and resistance to scratches and
other kinds of damage now if you'd like
to learn more about Gorilla Glass
specifically including what it can
actually do in the real world and some
of its other various limitations
you can learn more about it in this
video but even though Corning currently
has a huge share of the touchscreen
glass market with Gorilla Glass that
doesn't mean it's the only technology
out there specifically sapphire glass
has been tossed around quite a bit as a
possible replacement for silicon based
glasses the aluminum oxide molecules
that make up sapphire gems bond together
in a trigonal crystal structure that
makes it extremely strong and hard to
the point where it's almost impossible
to scratch and because the typical blue
color of sapphires is due to impurities
that can be removed synthetic sapphire
can easily be made to be colorless it's
also even more transparent than current
types of common smartphone glass so why
isn't everyone using it yet well a huge
part of the reason is simply cost
according to estimates from corning
sapphire glasses about 10 times more
expensive to make than Gorilla Glass in
fact Apple invested around a billion
dollars in a sapphire factory in Arizona
that ended up failing partially due to
manufacturing difficulties
I guess producing a quarter-ton cylinder
of sapphire in a furnace reaching
thousands of degrees is no small task
sapphire isn't perfect either because
while its hardness means it's tougher to
scratch it also means that it's brittle
so it might not provide much better
shatter resistance than current
technologies but in a world that's
increasingly reliant on mobile devices
that we want to be thin light and
portable sapphire screens may become the
more popular choice in the near future
just don't present a sapphire iPhone on
a ring when you're proposing to your
future spouse that would be weird but
what you could do along with presenting
a ring to your spouse in order to get
married is set up a cool website for the
two of you with Squarespace they have
24/7 support via live chat and email so
if you have any problems you can contact
them and it only costs $8 a month and
when you sign up for a year you get a
free domain they have responsive design
so your website can scale to look great
on a computer a tablet or even your
sapphire glass
phone they've a commerce module so you
can sell tickets to your extremely
exclusive wedding and they have cover
page modules so that once everything
fails you can make like a dating resume
of sorts
they even have new accelerated mobile
pages also known as amp which makes your
site load faster on mobile devices on
average they load four times faster than
non amp pages saving your visitors and
possible suitors much valuable time
start a trial with no credit card or
spouse required and start building your
website today alright guys thanks for
