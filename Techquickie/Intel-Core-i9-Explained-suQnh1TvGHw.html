Hadron Collider was fired up for the
first time there was an hist√≥rico
lection in the US we were all treated to
that incredible Olympic ceremony in
Beijing and M night Shyamalan olan olan
made another horrible movie wait this is
a tech channel oh right yeah it also
marked intel's adoption of a brand new
naming scheme for its cpus with the high
end of its processor range becoming Core
i7
for the first time although curiously
these chips contained four cores and
eight threads which anyway nine years
later Intel is expanding this scheme
again with the I 9 and I'm not talking
about an extensive Bavarian concept our
Intel is now calling its highest end
consumer processors core I 9 so once
again there won't be a nine core model
in the mix the first core ions are part
of the skylake X family continuing with
Intel theme of releasing enthusiast
level CPUs with a one generation older
microarchitecture than the mainstream
processor family
however unlike mainstream parts core I
nine SKUs feature 10 cores on the lowest
end with models with 12 14 16 and even
18 cores forthcoming as well and they
all feature hyper threading meaning
you'll get anywhere between twenty and
thirty six threads so it's not
surprising then that Intel is pushing
these new chips as solutions for what it
calls mega tasking a term defined by the
Intel marketing department as
simultaneously running multi-threaded
hard hitting workloads like gaming
streaming and recording on multiple
monitors at once content creation like
video audio and image editing for the
same project at once or you know what to
hell with it we've got 18 processors why
not do both at once Intel is also
boasting of performance improvement
- in lightly threaded workloads in
addition to the usual claims of slightly
boosted raw IPC over the previous
generation they've also updated turbo
boost 3.0 now all core I nines and the
core i7 78 20x will feature two
preferred strongest cores for turbo
frequencies and overclocking that is
better than the others instead of just
one strongest core which could benefit
applications like CPU bound games that
might use more than one core but won't
take significant advantage of more than
two but whether you're getting a core i9
and updated core i7 or even for some
reason a KB Lake X Core i5 or Core i7
these new chips will all use the new LGA
2066 socket so they won't be backwards
compatible with any older boards the
good news go is that thanks to the shiny
new X 299 chipset you'll get support for
up to three PCI Express 3.0 x4 SSDs with
a total of up to 44 PCIe lanes directly
off the CPU so then depending on which
CPU you choose that can mean tons of
bandwidth for more graphics cards more
nvme storage and other expansion cards
that need lots of throughput - like
Thunderbolt 3 for example of course all
of this is going to come at a price with
core I nine CPUs starting at a cool one
thousand US dollars all the way up to
two grand for the top-end 18 core model
yikes and even though KB Lake X
processors will start at the mid 200s
they lacked quad channel memory support
and have fewer PCIe lanes so folks will
effectively be paying extra for features
on pricey high-end motherboards that
they won't even be able to use unless
they upgrade their CPU down the line but
whatever you choose to buy or not buy
all of this is definitely
good news in that competition is finally
ramping up in the CPU industry for the
first time in over half a decade so you
know what I say go red team and also go
blue team
I just want faster computers in general
I don't care who wins
speaking of who wins you can win by
installing tunnel there VPN tunnel bear
lets you tunnel through one of 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
services as though you are in a
different country
they've got easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac also a Chrome
extension and all you got to do there's
like no configuration whatsoever you
just choose a country press the button
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
your connection gets encrypted and your
public IP address gets switched so you
show up as some anonymous person from
some friggin country somewhere they also
have a top rated privacy policy and
don't log user activity so try out for
free with 500 Meg's of free data at the
link in the video description and when
you sign up for an unlimited plan make
sure you go to tunnel bear comm / Linus
so you can save 10% so thanks for
watching guys dislike or like check out
our other channels and subscribe so you
don't miss any videos here on tech
