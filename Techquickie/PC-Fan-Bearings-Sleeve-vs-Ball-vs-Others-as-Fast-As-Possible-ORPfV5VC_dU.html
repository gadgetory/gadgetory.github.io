element that constrains relative motion
and reduces friction between moving
parts in cooling fans specifically the
purpose of a bearing is to allow the
blades to spin around inside the frame
as efficiently and reliably as possible
but there are so many kinds of them and
the pnn bearing hasn't been invented yet
so until that happens how do we know the
pros and cons of each kind let's kick it
off with sleeve bearings the most common
bearing type and PC cooling fans the
main advantages are easy they are
inexpensive and quiet especially at
first but they should only be mounted
vertically for best results and compared
to other bearing types their performance
especially over long periods of time is
unexceptional a sleeve bearing is what
is known as a line contact bearing which
means that the contact surface area
between its moving parts is actually
quite large
this isn't inherently a catastrophic
problem but it makes them more
susceptible to failure due to changes in
lubricant viscosity from higher ambient
temperatures and from lubricant loss
over time this combined with the way
that they often die quite suddenly makes
the less suitable for industrial or
mission-critical environments which
leads us nicely into the second most
common pc fan bearing type ball bearings
they're more expensive than sleeve
bearings and in louder at the beginning
of their lives but they make up for it
because their point contact design
reduces friction and allows them to last
longer especially in hotter environments
like say for example in a server off to
used gaming PC and they stay closer to
their out-of-the-box performance over a
longer period of time like sleeve
bearings the main cause of failure of a
ball bearing is lubricant loss but
because of the way they operate and the
fact that they tend to be found in
better design products that are
manufactured with tighter tolerances
overall this will take longer to occur
add to that that a ball bearing fan will
fill in a slower more graceful manner
and you've got yourself a fan that's
much more suitable for cooling a
component that won't take kindly to a
sudden lack of cooling like a CPU or
power supply but not all ball bearing
fans are created equal
cheaper single ball bearing designs will
use one ball bearing and one sleeve
bearing at each end of the shaft while
more expensive dual ball bearing designs
use ball bearings throughout for
improved LAN jet
and performance consistency so depending
on how much reliability you need you can
plan your budget accordingly now I don't
want this video to come off as a PSA
about the dangers of sleeve bearing
things in non demanding environments or
where extreme silence or longevity
aren't really needed a traditional
sleeve bearing may be perfectly adequate
and on top of that not all sleeves are
necessarily inferior fluid dynamic or
hydro bearings are the last common
bearing type and are fundamentally a
modified sleeve bearing compared to
normal sleeve bearings and even ball
bearing designs they are the most
expensive due to the Matsushita
licensing fees that they must pay in
order to sell them the genuine ones
anyway but the way that they use the
fans own rotation to create a pressure
field that stabilizes the fan and
dramatically improves lubrication
performance results in an extremely
quiet bearing that generally lasts
longer than either of the first two that
I talked about the thing to watch out
here though for is that the fluid
dynamic bearing name isn't trademarked
so many manufacturers have created their
own sometimes inferior variants that
sell under the same name buyer beware
our last bearing type is the other
category I mean you see hydro bearings
aren't the only enhanced sleeve bearings
rifle hydraulic and SSO are a few more
examples with each taking a different
approach to the goal of improving sleeve
bearing performance I'll use SSO
bearings as my example the main problem
with sleeves is that if they're not
adequately lubricated they wear out
extremely quickly this proprietary
design among other changes adds magnetic
stabilisation and fluid dynamic bearing
design elements to improve stability
longevity and silence especially at
lower speeds and they can be mounted in
any orientation to boot
not that it so that's pretty much it or
wait there's two more things actually
first factor into everything I just said
that the design and quality of the
construction of the rest of the fan
plays a major role in its performance
and it's reliability regardless of
bearing type and second here's a handy
little fan maintenance tip it's never a
bad idea to consult the manufacturer for
the best possible method but using a
drop or two of a high-grade synthetic
lubricant under the sticker on the back
will improve the lifetime of even the
worst sleeve bearing fan in the world so
give that a try if you want to save a
couple of bucks and keep
fans out of the local landfill speaking
of saving a couple bucks if you enjoyed
this video about fan bearings be sure to
check out the fans from today's episode
sponsored Coolermaster they produce a
wide variety of PC cooling components I
mean it's right there in the company
name with everything from CPU air and
liquid coolers to standalone fan
upgrades for your case that ranged from
plain-jane black ones to fancy LED ones
