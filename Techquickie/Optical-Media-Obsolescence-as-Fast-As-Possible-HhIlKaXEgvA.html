were a staple and present in virtually
all pcs nowadays you could be forgiven
for forgetting about your old loyal
friend entirely since most laptop
designs omit them in favor of slimmer
form factors many custom builders leave
them out to save a buck and Apple no
longer sells a single Mac with an
optical disk drive but how did such a
popular format go from near universal
adoption to being suitable for nothing
but protecting tabletops history lesson
time in the 1980s the most popular
existing format for music was the
cassette tape an analog technology that
you couldn't copy without losing quality
managed only mediocre sound fidelity
required manual fast-forwarding and
rewinding and always seemed to get
tangled up in your player at the worst
possible time CDs changed all this by
allowing music studios to use digital
recording for much better sound quality
and easier reproduction and thanks to
their low production cost and greater
data capacity CDs also made a huge
splash in the PC world with most
software moving from multiple floppy
discs to a single CD in the box then
when CD burners or writers became
available
they were the bee's knees for data
backups since they held nearly 500 times
as much data as a standard high-density
floppy disk and only about an order of
magnitude less than hard drives at the
time and it didn't stop there by
switching from infrared to lasers that
use shorter wavelengths of red light on
DVDs and then devising methods to cover
the entire surface of a disc with data
then have another layer under it for
double the capacity and then finally by
switching to the blue light used on
blu-ray discs optical made it possible
to jan up to 100 gigabytes of
high-quality movies with surround sound
onto a disc the same size as an original
CD not to mention that they're so cheap
to produce that even Moore's law hasn't
been able to make USB drives or SD cards
competitive so we're all the way into
this video we still have an answer
then why did such a versatile medium
lose so much ground to things like
online streaming services are we really
just too lazy to take our discs with us
and stick them into a player well maybe
but that actually isn't the whole story
first of all optical discs while
definitely better than tapes do
deteriorate moisture from the air can
get into the metal layer that contains
the data and cause a reaction that
damages the disk not to mention that
user-created discs are written using
dyes that break down over time unless
you're shelling out for archival grade
media and the discs aside the drives
they go in are fragile too like
mechanical hard drives an optical disc
has a lot of moving parts but unlike a
hard drive which sits in a sealed box
inside your computer optical drives have
to constantly open and close making them
susceptible to user error
and wear and tear especially compared to
solid state drives or SSDs with no
moving parts at all but even if all your
precious equipment stayed intact nearly
all other modern data storage mediums
are faster than optical disks anyway
with even high-speed internet catching
up and surpassing them thanks to
services like Google Fiber ok Linus I
get it they suck so then why do I still
see these things all over the place
well optical discs haven't gone away
completely despite these drawbacks
because content distributors still like
optical discs thanks to physical media
being easier to lock down with DRM which
you can learn more about here CDs and
DVDs are still much cheaper than putting
things on SD cards or flash drives like
I mentioned before gamers can sell
optical disc copies of games between
each other much more easily than ones
they downloaded making it preferable
especially for console gamers and audio
files can enjoy lossless movie audio on
blu-ray for example something that even
if streaming services did offer would be
way more than the average u.s. internet
connection could handle anyway so while
comparisons to other modern technology
might make it look like shiny discs are
dead it may actually be a while
yet before we're all making disco balls
out of our old CDs but if you were going
to make disco balls out of CDs maybe
you'd want to make a website about doing
that with beautiful pictures and so you
want to use Squarespace
they offer simple powerful beautiful
templates they've got 24/7 support via
live chat and email it costs only eight
dollars a month for a basic plan and you
get a free domain if you by Squarespace
for a year the sites look great whether
you're looking at them on you know a
computer or on a smartphone that's
there's another reason that optical
drives have kind of we've had to find
alternatives for them you certainly
can't put a disc in those and unloved
all the Sony PSP I guess tried to do
small discs anyway
the point is that you can start a trial
with no credit card required and start
building your awesome website today
whether it's for a blog or a store or
like Luke's mom she's got a store on
there actually he's raising the roof off
camera right now and when you do decide
to sign up for Squarespace make sure you
use offer code Lynas to get 10% off your
first purchase so thanks to Squarespace
for supporting tech quickie and to you
guys for watching I guess that's pretty
much it like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible and don't
forget to check out some of the great
videos that we've got on our other
channels Luke for example just finally
did a review of the r9 390x why did it
take so long well maybe it has to do
with our excitement level I guess you'll
find out check out that video now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
