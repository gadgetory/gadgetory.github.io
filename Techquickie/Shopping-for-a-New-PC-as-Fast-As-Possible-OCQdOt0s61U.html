to build your own PC or buy a prebuilt
we'll be answering it once and for all
and here it is some of my regular
viewers actually might not really like
this but um well anyway I really feel
the answer is do whatever you want
there's no absolute right way to buy a
PC let's start by taking an objective
look at some of the advantages to
pre-built tier 1 pcs you know the ones
that guys like HP or Acer make number
one is discounted Windows licenses for
big system builders mean that
particularly at the low end pricing is
just plain better than what you can
achieve building it for yourself number
two is that some people just want a
warranty yes I know your CPU comes with
a warranty and your memory comes with a
warranty but lots of people don't want
to deal with that you might as well tell
them that their new car has individual
warranties on the muffler and shocks an
engine remote entry system and if they
want anything fixed they'll have to
diagnose it pull that part out ship it
to the individual manufacturer and then
reinstall it what's the new one arrives
they'll be all like what are you high
I'll just take my Mac to the Apple store
and they'll fix it for me
number three is closely related to
number one support not everyone has a
tech-savvy niece or nephew to help them
diagnose issues they just want it to
plain work out of the box and if it
doesn't they want to call someone to
help them the next option is getting a
rig from a custom or boutique system
builder the advantages here are pretty
simple number one is customizability
many boutique builders offer extensive
options for the different components
that you can have them install and if
you're willing to do a little bit of
learning about the parts you can get
something that's just right for you even
if you don't want to deal with the
hassle of actually assembling it number
two ties in pretty closely to the last
one and its quality if you're buying a
mid-range to high-end custom system from
a reputable builder they are using
better components than any tier one
commodity system your PC will likely run
cooler be quieter and last longer
number three is time I know I know I've
heard it over and over what what time it
doesn't take that long to build a PC and
you know what those people
our right actually but this is my
response you know what does take a long
time troubleshooting a PC this is
especially true if you don't have a
garage full of spare parts to use for
diagnosing an issue lots of people don't
have a bucket of graphics cards on hand
and they just don't want to deal with
that crap
speaking of buckets of graphics cards
the reason that many of us have such
things is related to benefit number one
of picking everything for yourself and
building your own PC you can save a few
bucks and you can have fun doing it it's
great I've been a PC tinkerer and
hobbyist for the better part of my life
now I even made a career out of it and I
do all kinds of stuff that I know isn't
that practical because I just plain love
it water cooling is a great example it
just doesn't make much sense from a
performance standpoint anymore but I
take pride in knowing that my system is
faster runs quieter and looks better
than what anyone who isn't willing to
put in the time and effort can buy
benefit number two of DIY is infinite
customizability and upgrade ability
because you've been through the gauntlet
of actually building it in the first
place you never have to be afraid of the
guts again and upgrading is easy just
set aside some cash and some space in a
closet for a graphics card bucket and
then you're all good benefit number
three is community the PC enthusiast
community is a great one to be a part of
over at Linus tech tips comm we talk
shop about PCs all day and we love it
being part of it is amazing there are
risks associated with building it
yourself and you'll have no one else to
point to if you break something but at
least you'll have other folks who have
been there before to help you through it
and for me personally the benefits
outweigh the risks if you want to get
over the fear of opening up your PC case
and building a PC for the first time you
can check out our build guides on Linus
tech tips it's my other youtube channel
this last one is one that I'm not a
hundred percent sure how to classify
some PC parts retailers also happen to
offer assembly service you might not get
the same degree of TLC that you do from
a boutique builder that's marking up the
system by several hundred dollars just
to put it together for you and test it
and do all that stuff but you're also
saving a ton of money my old employer
NCIX for example allows you to pick
anything you want on their site pay the
same price as someone buying individual
parts would then pay only 50 bucks
assemble your system for you that
includes any troubleshooting involved in
getting it working right installing an
OS for you and a one-year return to
Depot warranty on the parts and labor on
top of that you also still get the
individual warranties on the components
it really is a great service and it's a
great way to get a truly custom grade PC
without getting your hands dirty and
without spending a bunch of money that
last option actually sounded pretty
awesome didn't it they should probably
be paying me to make this video because
I make them sound like the obvious
choice here well they're not and it's
not necessarily the obvious choice
personally on the DIY guy they're just
my bros but there is someone else who
did help me pay to make this video and
that's hotspot Shield without sponsors
like hotspot Shield fast as possible
wouldn't be possible hotspot Shield is
the fast easy way to set up a VPN they
have a free service that like most ad
supported services has a lot of ads in
it isn't my favorite but their elite
service which you can get a free trial
of has been used by yours truly quite a
few times for various things a VPN if
you don't already know makes you more
difficult to identify and track online
and allows you to circumvent pesky
geographical restrictions on online
services video streaming or Google
services are very common ones that
hotspot Shield can help you get access
to if you don't already have it the best
part is you can save 20% on hotspot
Shield by using offer code Lynas after
you click on the link below thanks again
hotspot Shield for making this video
possible anyways I hope you guys enjoyed
this episode of fast as possible like

you disliked it let me know in the
comments which option you think is best
