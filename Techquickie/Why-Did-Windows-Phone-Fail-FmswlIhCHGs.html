the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so unless
you've gone against the tide and use a
Mac or some flavor of Linux you probably
have a desktop or laptop or any windows
for better or for worse but how is it
the Microsoft managed to be V dominant
player on pcs yet be almost invisible on
smartphones that we're all carrying
everywhere well believe it or not it
wasn't too long ago that the windows
mobile OS was actually the market leader
on smartphones wait what yeah about that
so before the original iPhone was
released in 2007 the smartphone market
was a mishmash of lots of different
devices without any real must-have
models among them and many of them ran
Windows Mobile so many in fact that
microsoft owns nearly half of smartphone
OS market share before Apple got into
the game so what happened well even
though Microsoft's presence in
smartphone lands was very significant it
was still a company whose bread of
butter was software for traditional PCs
and their management at the time wanted
to be cautious about throwing themselves
headfirst into mobile skeptical as to
whether it would catch on as a result
Microsoft didn't devote enough resources
to Windows Mobile which quickly became
dated while at the same time Apple's iOS
rapidly gained popularity making matters
worse the Windows Mobile experienced
folks a little different depending on
which phone out of that mishmash of
devices I mentioned earlier you were
using something that makes a software
product very difficult to market to
users but hold on a minute
Android does this so why a Google
succeed where Microsoft didn't well by
the time Microsoft decided it really
should be focusing more attention on the
mobile market Android had already become
widespread and not only was it
technologically superior to Microsoft's
outdated offering but it was also free
by contrast Microsoft charged phone
manufacturers for Windows Mobile slices
just like you have to pay for a Windows
license for your home PC today now
Microsoft justified this because they
thought Android was too bare-bones and
would cause fragmentation of the market
sound familiar but what actually
happened is that it gave the phone
industry a freely available base they
included tons of Google services that
people actually
wanted to use so in 2010 Microsoft
realizing the PC was losing ground to
mobile devices decided to take us mobile
competition seriously and replace
Windows Mobile with Windows Phone OS
but while reviews of the OS were
actually pretty good one of the main
issues was that by this point half
developers were already focused on iOS
and Android
so it became a chicken-and-egg problem
there weren't enough Windows Phone users
for app developers even big ones like
Instagram to bother to support the
platform and it's hard to attract users
without like a YouTube app all this came
to a head in 2014 when Microsoft bought
Nokia's phone division hope either named
a market power would give Windows
throwing the boost and show the world
Hey look
Windows Phone is worth something it's
going to be all over Nokia devices but
this backfired catastrophic ly there was
still no incentive for non Nokia
manufacturers to pay for Windows Phone
licenses because now not only was it not
free like Android but their Windows
Phone models would also have to compete
against Nokia's phone division which was
now owned by the same flippin company
the one they were paying so in 2017 the
Windows Phone project was finally put
out of this misery and Microsoft is now
focusing its mobile efforts on cheaper
laptops the Internet of Things and
Gaia's digital assistant Cortana onto
more devices so there may be an
important place yet for Microsoft in
this new worlds where it seems like
everything needs to be connected to the
Internet but don't expect your friends
to be impressed by it or Windows Phone
unless they also love your dope HD DVD
player and your litte Flip HD video
camera and speaking of being impressed
do you want an impressive solution for
protecting your privacy and getting
around geo blocking well then check out
private Internet access VPN not only
this P ia work on up to five devices at
once by high your true IP address and
allowing you to bypass geo restrictions
and censorship by making you appear that
you're connecting from somewhere else it
also blocks on one of the connections to
help prevent attacks although blocks all
traffic of the VPN disconnects keeps
your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other snoops who are
tracking your activity
prevents DNS leaks and even includes
Mase P is built-in malware blocker PIAA
supports multiple VPN protocols and
encryption levels allowing you to dial
in the exact level of protection that
you need they have apps for Windows Mac
Android iOS Linux
and the Chrome extension with support
for more platforms coming soon and P ia
has over 3000 servers in 28 countries
and does not log user activity so what
are you waiting for check them out today
