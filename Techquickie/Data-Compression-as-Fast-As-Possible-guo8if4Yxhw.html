has probably known the frustration of
trying to cram almost a suitcase worth
of stuff into a backpack I mean sure we
could suck it up and leave a few items
behind or haul around our bulky luggage
with us if they're so important but if
we did that then our bag won't fit in
the overhead compartment anyway and all
we're trying to bring is a few extra
pairs of underwear just in case we eat
some bad tandoori chicken well that got
gross but other than that was pretty
much a perfect analogy for why data
compression became so important to
reduce storage requirements and to
improve transfer speeds over standard
connections these packaging services are
kind of like our roommate who catches us
standing on our bag trying to zip it up
and says you know you can't just roll
your laundry and save like a ton of
space right and as it turns out when we
try it for ourselves the smug little
turd is right not only does all of our
stuff now fit but we even have more room
to crammed with stuff will never use
like that copy of ET the
extra-terrestrial that we definitely
don't watch every night and cry back on
topic obviously data can't be rolled in
quite the same manner as slightly
pre-warn laundry so coding engineers
devised algorithms capable of breaking
down longer strings of data into shorter
ones then reassembling them later using
what they've retained an easy way to
describe this would be like breaking
down the equation 2 times 2 times 2
times 2 times 2 into 2 to the fifth
power which is much faster to write and
simpler to articulate but Linus I
actually know a thing or two about
coding and one of those things is that
the use of exponential symbols is simply
not possible
well first off thankfully we weren't
roommates in college I mean talk about
smug second
you're correct as well while it is
possible to write a command string which
describes an exponential function it
usually isn't much of a space saver so
maybe a better way to demonstrate how a
compression algorithm works is to use
something like a string of X's and O's
or zeros and ones if you're catching the
similarities here let's say we have a
string of eight digits which is spelled
out as X X X X X X now an algorithm may
look at this and decide that every time
it comes across a new digit it will
replicate it and then note how many
times it's been repeated this would
cause our string to transform into the
smaller X 3 o 2 X 3 while this did
reduce overall size it only managed to
do so by 25% which isn't exactly going
to allow us to cram our drives full or
transfer large files over the internet
more efficiently that's where more
specifically designed algorithms will
come in to strip the code to its most
basic form instead simply adding all the
X's together by treating each as a value
of 1 then listing all the O's followed
with a digit count as before then we end
up with a string that would look like
302 3 which we can now see as half the
size of the original code now obviously
this example is rudimentary at best but
it gives an idea of how mathematicians
are able to achieve and then further
improve upon this feat as time goes on
now this example would be known as
lossless compression all of the original
data remains intact and is a requirement
for programs or documents but if you're
willing to give up some detail in the
original file lossy compression
algorithms can be used for media files
like music and movies as long as you
understand that the tighter you cram it
the lower the playback quality you'll
experience what you can actually learn a
little bit more about here in our video
specifically about video compression
speaking of compression no no not
compression ok whatever we've got a new
sponsor today on tech wiki freshbooks
it's a cloud accounting service and
basically the kind of thing that any
freelance worker or small business is
going to want to know about it's all
about making your life easier when it
comes to invoicing getting paid and
tracking expenses because it's done
online
it makes invoicing simple your clients
can pay you online your expenses are
automatically tracked as you spend all
the little details about cash flow or
all in one place so you know exactly
where you stand and it shows a full
history of every invoice allows you to
check if your client has viewed the
invoice and all kinds of cool stuff like
that you can even update your FreshBooks
timesheet from your phone and pull
project hours right into an invoice so
you can send that off so you get paid if
you're your own boss you
be using stuff that makes you feel like
a boss and freshbooks is an incredibly
easy way of doing all of your billing
online so you'll have more time to do
the work you actually want to be doing
or maybe you don't want to be doing it
maybe you just need to do it to eat or
whatever the case may be to do your work
head over to freshbooks comm slash tech
quickie and don't forget to enter tech
quickie in the how did you hear about us
section because that's important all
right thanks guys for watching this
video like it if you liked it dislike it
if you thought it sucked check out our
other channels Linus tech tips and
channels super fun where we do super fun
stuff comment on the video with
suggestions for future videos and as
always don't forget to subscribe /
follow and all that good stuff if you
