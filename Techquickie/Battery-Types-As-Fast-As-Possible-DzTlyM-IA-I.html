everything from cruising down the
boulevard in your car or cruising for a
date on tinder possible but have you
ever wondered of how those little
cylinders you can buy at gas stations
and grocery stores all those blocky
things that you put in your laptop can
store so much energy well despite the
massive diversity in battery types they
all rely on the same sort of chemical
reaction to create energy which is
actually very similar to that breaking
bad episode where Walter White builds
his own freakin battery out of coins and
Tupperware what a badass a typical
alkaline battery you can buy it the
store to put into your remote or
whatever else contains an anode on the
negative end a cathode on the positive
end an electrolyte paste which contains
ions which are electrically charged
molecules different materials make up
the anode and cathode in a plain old
alkaline battery the anode is made of
zinc like what you'd find in coins while
the cathode is comprised of manganese
dioxide which may have actually been
used as a fire starter by cave people
but anyways the ions in the electrolyte
can combine with the zinc resulting in a
reaction that releases electrons when
you close the circuit by putting the
battery inside of your favorite
electronic device negatively charged
electrons leave the zinc anode go
through your device providing electrical
power and flow back into the positively
charged cathode these chemicals are
readily available and cheap making
alkaline batteries readily available and
affordable and convenient and etc etc
but because chemical reactions used up
all the different substances inside of
the battery and are hard to reverse
they're usually useless once they die in
fact trying to recharge a regular
alkaline battery precisely results in
the opposite chemical reactions meaning
you could wind up with dangerous
byproducts leaking everywhere so don't
do it fortunately many other types of
batteries are rechargeable because they
use different chemicals that react in a
way that make running the discharging
reaction in reverse both easy and most
importantly safe today the most common
type of rechargeable batteries that you
can buy in double-a or triple-a sizes is
the
nickel-metal hydride battery or ni MH
not only our ni MH batteries
rechargeable but they also tend to last
quite a bit longer than their alkaline
counterparts on one charge making them a
good choice for things like digital
cameras that suck battery life fairly
quickly however they can be a bit tricky
to recharge so make sure you're getting
a quality charger approved for the use
of NI MH batteries don't try to use
older chargers designed for largely
obsolete nickel cadmium batteries which
could leave your ni MH batteries under
charged or even damaged not not good
well okay Luke that's all fine and dandy
for my digital camera but what about the
batteries in my laptop our smartphone
are those ni MH actually those are
usually lithium ion batteries not ni MH
batteries lithium ion batteries are the
kind of power source of choice for many
rechargeable electronics not only
because of their high energy density and
longer run times but they don't suffer
from issues such as the memory effect
which can affect other kinds of
batteries and caused them to lose
capacity if they aren't fully drained
before being recharged since we're are
ways unplugging and re-plugging in our
laptops tablets and phones lithium ion
batteries are a great choice currently
since they don't care how much juice
they have inside themselves when you go
to plug them back in they will just
charge all the way up some newer devices
have even taken lithium ion batteries a
step farther with lithium polymer
designs that contain electrolyte gel
making it possible to fit the battery
into a small flexible package ideal for
thin higher-performance devices like
high-end smartphones but even newer
rechargeable batteries aren't perfect
over time all those charged and
discharged cycles will cause batteries
to wear out due to chemical reactions
proceeding not quite perfectly and of
course most of us are still frustrated
with our batteries dying after just a
day's use or just a few hours with
something like a laptop so as we
continually demand faster mobile devices
with longer battery life there are a
number of experimental battery
technologies in the work
that could one day make charging your
phone every night a thing of the past oh
please make that happen
these batteries could be things such as
ceramic cathodes or glass electrolytes
and are not only more durable but could
last several times larger than current
rechargeable battery tech due to higher
energy densities Apple has been heavily
rumoured to be looking at ceramic
batteries for some of its future
products so in the near future you might
only have to remember to charge your
iPhone once every few days especially
important if your usual activities
consist of walking around Las Vegas with
like a selfie stick you know who hasn't
used batteries bears but these bears can
tunnel you in to up to 20 different
countries for your internet so you can
like browse as if you're from that
country which is pretty cool and you can
use online services as if you're from
that country as well
they have easy-to-use apps for iOS
Android PC and Mac and a Chrome
extension just in case you you go that
way just choose a country in the app
turn tunnel there on and watch as your
bear tunnels your internet connection
into your new location when you turn
tunnel bear on two things happen your
connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so you show up as
if you're in that country to other
people
Tunnel Bearer lets you bypass all the
annoying details that are typically come
with VPNs for personal use there's no
need to mess around with like port
configurations DNS or any other router
mumbo-jumbo
just let the tunnel bear tunnel they
also have a top rated privacy policy and
do not log user activity you can try out
tunnel bear for free with 500 megabytes
of data and no credit card required but
if you are interested upgrade to
unlimited data you can save 10% by going
to tunnel bear comm slash line I so do
that tunnel over to tunnel bear to do
the thing and then you can tunnel into
other countries thank you guys for
watching this video if you liked it like
it if you just liked it dislike it
comment down below if there's something
else you'd like us to check out and
don't forget to check out channel
super-fun where there's a mystery video
this week come on down click the screen
see what's happening I don't know no one
knows do you know I don't know maybe you
know I don't know yet maybe you've
already clicked there and figured it out
and
video still playing so you can hear me
talking and now you know I whatever
don't forget to subscribe to check
quickie see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
