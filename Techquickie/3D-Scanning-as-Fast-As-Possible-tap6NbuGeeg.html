is proved to be useful for making
everything from spoons to medical
devices to even supercool Lynas action
figures but there's another side to this
three-dimensional coin so to speak that
will make sense to anyone that's ever
bought one of those clunky office
printer copier things and I'm talking of
course about 3d scanning which is
exactly what it sounds like the process
of scanning three-dimensional objects or
models into a computer now you can
probably guess that it's a little more
complicated than your old flatbed
scanner but the general principle of
operation is actually fairly similar the
scanner takes many samples of whatever
it's looking at and stitches them
together to spit out a coherent image or
in this case a 3d model also somewhat
similarly to regular 2d paper scanners
many 3d scanners use light in some way
such as with laser scanners which can
acquire the shape of an object by firing
you guessed it freakin laser beams at
their targets but instead of burning and
eating them some laser scanners capture
shapes by calculating how long it takes
for the laser beam to leave the scanner
hit the object and reflect back to the
scanner others use lasers in conjunction
with a camera to figure out the laser
marks exact location which the scanner
uses to construct an image but not all
light based scanners use laser beams for
example you might have one that 3d
scanner on top of your TV right now I'm
talking about the Kinect for Xbox which
shines infrared light invisible to the
eye on your body while you're playing
just dance or whatever then it uses a
small infrared camera to determine your
body's position and whether the club
just can't even handle your moves right
now there's also something called
structured light scanning which can use
plain white or blue light not lasers by
the way
fired at the object in thin lines to
figure out the shape based on the
distortion of the lines from other
viewing angles however light based 3d
scanning has its limits
remember optical mice well we still have
them but you know optical mice they have
a hard time tracking on glass
or shiny surfaces and 3d scanners that
use light can have issues scanning
objects that are transparent or made of
highly reflective material in these
situations it's often better to use a
contact scanner these scanners actually
touch whatever it whatever it is that
you're trying to scan in order to figure
out what it can get get off to figure
out what it looks like using different
kinds of probes attached to either
hinges or joints that can send a
position back to the computer to
generate a super precise image of an
object surface but how is all this
technology put to use well when combined
with a 3d printer you're basically one
step away from your own Star Trek
replicator complete with databanks full
of all your favorite 3d foods but thanks
to the imaginations of people there's a
lot of uses Gene Roddenberry didn't
think of video game developers are using
3d scanning to capture accurate models
to be used in their games instead of
designing them from scratch doctors and
dentists use them to fit orthodontics
and historians are using 3d scanning to
preserve and document old artifacts
statues and even buildings also a huge
amount of mechanical parts used in
industry are 3d scanned to verify the
quality and structural integrity so
there's actually a decent chance that
your car was scanned at the factory to
make sure the engine won't explode and
on the subject of explosion doesn't
shopping for clothes to make your head
wanna explode personally I hate it try
this on no no try this one that looks
good that doesn't I don't know I just
isn't there an easy way to just do this
online so I don't have to deal with the
hassle of crowds and balls yes there is
Jack threads they've got a curated
selection of brands both known and
diamond-in-the-rough II unknown ones for
the stuff I have here is known brands I
think next level Oakley and Under Armour
and they've got plenty of summer styles
available like short-sleeved shirts in
prints summer sneakers and board shorts
it's a great value so you can get the
most bang for your buck on the things
that you love and need not to say that I
guess you really need clothes I mean you
guys can't even prove that I'm wearing
pants for example in these videos we
always shoot me from here down in fact
today I'm not wearing
pants because I'm wearing shorts which
strictly speaking are short pants but
the point is you can get an additional
20% off by visiting jack threads.com
slash tech quickie which is linked in
the video description and entering
coupon code tech quickie at checkout
don't buy what everyone else has skipped
them all and shop Jack threads you can
even shop on their iOS and Android apps
if you want to shop where you want when
you want so I guess that's pretty much
it guys like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have suggestions
for future fast as possible and if
you're looking for something else to
watch right now check out the Linus tech
tips channel where we recently did a
painting tutorial for your computer
monitor is bueno good go watch thanks
for watching and as always don't forget
