family and why not they're better
conversationalist than anyone in my
family and you don't even have to pay to
send them to college but unlike or
perhaps exactly like humans their
natural curiosity can often lead them to
stray too far from home without knowing
how to get back now old school callers
with the name and address of the owner
where once the only real solution but
now thank you technology many pet owners
are opting to inject a microchip inside
their pet as well but what are the
benefits over just having information
written on the collar I mean that seems
simpler
not to mention less painful well one of
the biggest advantages of the microchip
is that it's more or less a set it and
forget it solution while callers can
obviously get damaged come loose or even
end up caught in a tree branch leading
to a slow painful death by strangulation
microchips are injected by a shockingly
fat needle under the fatty layer of your
animal's skin and since they have no
moving components or batteries they
typically don't need to be replaced as
long as the animal lids just like the
NFC pads that we showed off here the
chip receives enough energy from the
Machine used to scan it that it doesn't
need any kind of internal power source
another reason they can just hang out
under your pet skin indefinitely is that
microchips are usually enclosed in an
inert material such as glass so that
your pets body won't react to it
negatively
in fact some enclosures are even made of
a special polymer that can induce tissue
growth around the microchip helping to
hold it in place which I wish they had
done on my cat whose microchip migrated
to his sternum forcing me to get a new
one for his fancy cat door oh yeah
there's another benefit I didn't cover
yet a microchip reader equipped pet door
lets you keep raccoons and strays out of
your house while saving you the headache
of listening to your pets whining or
scratching at the door mine can even be
programmed
let both of my cats in but only one of
them out and I'd imagine that future
models will even add functionality like
scheduling that can keep them in at
night or especially around Halloween
time that would be a useful one of
course small RFID chips like these can't
hold enough information on their own so
instead each chip gets a unique ID
number that is linked to contact
information for both the owner and the
regular veterinarian this ID number and
contact info are registered with one of
several different agencies meaning that
the owner of the lost pet can be
contacted quickly before shelter has to
spend money to house and feed your pet
or worse have it euthanized some
databases will even store your pet's
medical history so if your pet gets lost
whichever shelter picks it up can check
to see if your furry friend has any
special needs and at thirty to sixty US
dollars for a microchip that's good for
as long as your pet will live it's
generally a pretty economical option for
some long-term peace of mind but
microchips aren't infallible for one
thing microchipping technology hasn't
been fully standardized yet meaning that
not all shelters or veterinarians have
the correct scanners to read your pets
microchip there have even been isolated
cases of animals being put to sleep
because a shelter couldn't find a
microchip when the real issue was that
the chip was in fact present but their
scanning equipment just wasn't
compatible owners also need to be
vigilant about contacting the
appropriate microchip registry to update
their pets information if they change
addresses or contact information or if
there's a significant change with their
health issues as none of that is done
automatically so for that reason many
humane societies and animal welfare
organizations recommend that you use a
microchip as a backup to a traditional
collar with human readable contact
information but the high reliability of
pet microchip technology with a failure
rate of less than one in a million means
that many places are even also mandating
but newly adopted pets that be
microchipped so be sure to have
it's done if you have a dog or a cat or
I don't know turtle can I do that
especially if you think that your pet is
a flight risk because it resents your
new robot dog or whatever microchips
might have issues with being read by
different readers but you know what
