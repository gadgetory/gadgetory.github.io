won't miss any future videos to buy or
to rent whether we're talking a home a
car or a furniture I mean anyone who's
driven by one of those no credit no
problem banners has probably thought
about this and if you're a fan of having
maximum control over your home's
computer network you might be
considering buying a modem instead of
renting one from your ISP but is it
actually a good idea
and why do ISPs even rent modems in the
first place I mean they don't rent iPads
and computers so what gives well there
are a few rationales behind those rental
fees that you pay every month one is
that since the modem connects directly
to your providers network the boxes that
your ISP provides are validated for
compatibility with that specific ISP
signal for the ISP this is not just
about you but also about lowering the
risk of your random equipment causing
security issues or other problems that
could muck up the network for other
users fiber-to-the-home providers for
example keep things particularly locked
down and a DSL is becoming less common
so our focus today is really going to be
on cable modems of course the sweet
sweet paper that those rentals fees
bring in every month from millions of
customers doesn't hurt especially from
customers who don't consider themselves
tech savvy enough to buy and install
their own modem or even realize that
it's an option so the biggest reason you
might want to consider buying your own
modem is to save money
although buying it upfront generally
requires of course a bigger upfront
investment than your monthly rental cost
anywhere from about thirty to over a
hundred and fifty US dollars it will
inevitably pay for itself over time
especially if you're not sharing your
modem rental with your roommates but
more money in your pocket isn't even the
only perk oftentimes aftermarket modems
can be of higher quality than what your
ISP would provide especially if your ISP
has given you one of those modem
wireless routers which combo units which
sometimes come with underperforming
Wi-Fi buying a modem yourself
means that you can pick something with
more channels and simply put the more
channels and modem supports the more
data it can carry per second so if you
think that you might want to upgrade
your internet speed down the road you
want to find a modem with a high number
of channels current-gen modems can get
about 42 and a half megabits per second
per channel so find a 24 channel model
if you're looking at a gigabit
connection down the line once you've
done that you can hook up a separate
wireless router that's more powerful
than whatever's built into that Rental
combo unit which can dramatically
improve performance if you're trying to
get coverage for a larger house or if
you've got a ton of devices on your
wireless network now if you're a
tinkerer an aftermarket modem can allow
you to keep an eye on and prioritize
your network traffic much more
effectively than the options that your
ISP might give you just remember that
before you buy you'll want to make sure
that the modem that you fancy is
compatible with your ISPs network and
that it can also deliver the speed that
you're paying for most major ISPs do
allow you to buy your own modem and they
keep a list of tested approved models on
their website now if you buy something
outside that list it might still work
but there are no guarantees and some
ISPs might even see that you're using an
unapproved device and refuse to provide
service also pay attention to the DOCSIS
version of the modem that you want this
is the specification that indicates
among other things the modems maximum
speed most modems these days are DOCSIS
3.0 which can deliver speeds of over one
gigabit per second but make sure you
aren't buying a docsis 2.0 modem because
you saw it in a bargain bin somewhere
for five bucks those can only get up to
40 megabit a pretty slow speed limit by
today's standards with some ISPs not
even supporting them anymore
now you might be tempted to future-proof
with a shiny new DOCSIS 3.1 modem this
standard should allow for speeds of up
to 10 gigabits per second in each
direction but we don't know how long it
will be before the cable companies can
actually pull off a connection that fast
but I mean you might have to wait until
the next inevitable rebrand speaking of
inevitable if you
like Internet security you will
inevitably find yourself getting PIAA
not only does P ia work on up to five
devices at once by hiding your true IP
address and allowing you to bypass geo
restrictions and censorship by making
you appear as though you're connecting
from somewhere else it also blocks
unwanted connections to help prevent
attacks Auto blocks all traffic if the
VPN disconnects keeps your data out of
the hands of advertisers and other
snoops and even includes mace P is
built-in malware blocker P ia supports
multiple VPN protocols and encryption
levels they have apps for Windows Mac
Android iOS Linux and a Chrome extension
and they have over 3,000 servers in 28
countries and they don't log user
activity so what are you waiting for
check out p IA VPN at the link below so
