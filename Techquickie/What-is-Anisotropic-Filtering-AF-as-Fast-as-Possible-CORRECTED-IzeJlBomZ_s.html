experience filtering can enhance it and
make it better we're going to be talking
about bilinear trilinear and anisotropic
filtering options for improving texture
appearance in games as fast as possible
many surfaces and games are covered in
what are called textures this is what
avoids that effect where you just have
like a flat surface with a bunch of red
squares on it being called a brick wall
this is what makes them actually look
realistic but the problem with textures
is that if you don't apply any kind of
filtering to them whatsoever you'll
usually end up in a situation where
what's up close to the player character
the camera looks great and what's a
little ways off looks absolutely
terrible and a sharply defined line
between great and terrible by linear and
trilinear filtering aim to reduce the
visibility of that line so when you're
walking down a gravel path or next to a
brick wall with a repeating pattern it's
not noticeable that oh hey I'm in a game
because I can tell right there looks bad
and right there it looks good
anisotropic filtering is more advanced
than bilinear and tri linear and seeks
to reduce jaggies within the textures
themselves or aliasing and make them
appear much higher quality especially
when viewed at extreme angles so in this
example on the left it looks terrible
past the immediate vicinity of the plane
that is presumably coming down on the
runway whereas on the right with
anisotropic filtering enabled it looks
great even further on into the distance
or at least much better compared to
other visual quality improvement
techniques texture filtering is
relatively non-demanding on your gaming
hardware and many games these days even
come with it enabled by default so
remember guys enable texture filtering
on your games for the best possible
