you've probably noticed that Google
seems to be trying its hardest to be a
company that does seemingly everything I
mean they're working on a space elevator
but closer to home they've recently
rolled out their first ever smartphones
the pixel and the pixel XL whoa hold on
a second what about that Google Nexus
sitting in my pocket right now well
although Nexus devices carried Google's
branding they weren't designed by Google
rather Google intended for them to be a
reference for what the vanilla Android
experience should be like but phones
themselves weren't all that different
from other devices available from the
manufacturers contracted to produce a
nexus companies like LG or Motorola but
this time is different man
Google designed the pixels in-house
intending for them to be the first
smartphones they could truly call their
own even if it is contract manufactured
by HTC and looks suspiciously iPhone
like from the front the hardware while
upper-tier mostly isn't anything we
haven't seen before
1080p AMOLED screen or 1440p if you opt
for the larger pixel XL quad-core
Snapdragon 820 one either 32 or 128
gigabytes of internal u FS 2.0 based
storage but no microSD slot and USB
type-c it does however come with some
really next-level stuff like a non
exploding battery and a headphone jack
all joking aside there is at least one
Hardware feature that does legitimately
set the pixel apart
google has hyped the pixels camera quite
hard even going so far as to call it the
best smartphone camera ever and while
Google might not be the most unbiased
source of such a statement most
independent reviewers have already had
high praise for the pixels wide dynamic
range solid low-light performance and
accurate color it also packs 4k video
240 FPS slow-mo and image stabilization
to round out its feature set and there's
more the fingerprint sensor is on the
back of the phone which is supposed to
make it easier to access when you're
holding the phone in your hand and it
also comes with full support for
Google's upcome
daydream VR headset aesthetically the
pixels are a little polarizing the upper
third of the rear is covered with
Gorilla Glass which google claims helps
with cell reception and the phones are
available not only in the more
traditional black and white but also in
a very intense shade of blue that google
literally calls really blue they got
that right but color choices aside where
google has really tried to set the pixel
apart from its competitors is its
software the pixel does as you might
expect run Android seven but there are
some interesting touches that are as of
now pixel exclusive something that we
never saw with Nexus devices the most
prominent of these is the new Google
Assistant a competitor to Siri and
Cortana that is based more around having
conversations with the user instead of
just spitting out search results Google
even went as far as to hire writers from
the onion to give the assistants some
personality and while the pixel doesn't
come with an iPhone like
pressure-sensitive screen you can learn
more about this up here it does feature
apps shortcuts which are quick context
menus that show up when you long press
on an app icon then another big selling
point is support for what Google calls
seamless updates where a separate
partition of your phone storage is
updated in the background and the pixel
just boots from that partition the next
time you turn it on meaning no more
absurdly long wait times just to use
your phone after a system update which
is pretty cool in my opinion so the
focus on solid usability rather than
possibly extraneous bells and whistles
it'll be interesting to see how Google's
first real foray into smartphones
ultimately goes but no matter what
happens it can't be worse than the
Windows Phone or Windows Phone tunnel
Bayer VPN lets you tunnel into 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as if you're in well a
different country they have an
easy-to-use app on iOS Android PC and
Mac and also a Chrome extension just
choose a country in the app turn tunnel
bear on and watches your bear tunnels
your internet connection to your new
location when you turn tunnel there on
two things happen your connect
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and your public IP address
gets switched so you can show up as if
you're in a different country tunnel
bear also has a top rated privacy policy
and do not log user activity you can try
tonal bear VPN for free with five
hundred megabits of data and no credit
card required and if you do choose to
get in a year of unlimited data you can
save 10% by going to tunnel bear comm
