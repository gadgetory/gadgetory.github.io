stands for advanced technology extended
and a components compliance with the
standard tells us that it will be
physically and electrically compatible
with other ATX components like computer
cases and power supplies now because
most desktop computers use ATX that's
what we're gonna focus on but there is
other stuff out there anyway ATX family
motherboards are available in several
different flavors the most common of
which are standard ATX micro ATX
extended ATX and XL ATX now I'm also
going to include mini ITX
but don't worry about the different name
it's basically interoperable and gets
treated these days like an even smaller
ATX although unlike the ATX standards
which were developed by Intel Mini ITX
was developed by via technologies now
I'll give you more details on each in a
moment but if you're trying to figure
out compatibility and that's all you
care about for power supplies it comes
down to the connectors on your
particular power supply and the
motherboard that you want to plug them
into just make sure that the power
supply has at least as many 24 pin 8 pin
and 4 pin connectors as you need for
cases on the other hand any case that
accepts a motherboard equal to or larger
than the motherboard that you're looking
at will work so for example a mini ITX
board will work in a case designed for
any of the standards here because
they'll all be bigger than that whereas
an ATX board will not fit in a case
design for em ATX or mini ITX boards but
will work for the larger cases the
exception here is XL ATX check
specifically for XL ATX compatibility
before buying a case for your XL ATX
motherboard so ATX ATX motherboards have
a wide range of costs but tend to be
more expensive than em ATX and less than
e ATX they are 305 millimeters tall and
244 millimeters wide they have seven
expansion slots allowing for up to seven
single slot expansion cards or up to
four dual slot expansion cards if
installed in a case that has at least
eight rear expansion card openings and
that makes ATX the minimum motherboard
size to accommodate a 3-way or four-way
graphics card configuration with modern
cards ATX motherboards typically feature
a 24 pin and an 8 pin power connector
combination but performance oriented
boards may
have an extra CPU power connector or an
auxiliary connector for configurations
with lots of graphics cards because they
are physically larger they can have up
to eight RAM slots and tend to have more
SATA ports and front panel header ports
like USB compared to micro ATX boards
micro ATX ports are less expensive and
our 244 millimeters squared they are
available with nearly equivalent
performance and features to their bigger
brothers with a couple of exceptions due
to their size micro ATX boards usually
only have 2 to 4 memory slots and can
have a maximum of 4 single slot
expansion cards or too little slot
expansion cards with a single slot card
in between that means that while a
multi-core Extreme Edition processor can
be installed in a compatible an ATX
board the maximum memory and graphics
card capacity will be about half of an
ATX equivalent they typically feature a
24-pin connector and either a 4 pin or
an 8 pin CPU connector mini ITX
motherboards are less expensive yet and
are a mere 170 millimeters squared in
recent years they've gone from lower
power quiet computing oriented products
to high performance small form-factor
gaming capable devices they are limited
to desktop rather than workstation CPU
platforms though and to a maximum of 2
memory slots and a maximum of one
expansion card but that still allows
them at the time of filming this to have
up to a quad-core CPU 16 gigs of
inexpensive ram and a high performance
dual slot graphics card all at the same
time they have fewer SATA slots and
front panel connectors than even em ATX
boards due to their small size but they
often have integrated extras such as
Wireless and Bluetooth connectivity to
compensate for their lack of expansion
options they usually have a 24-pin
connector and a 4 pin connector for the
CPU power on the bigger and better
things extended or EA TX motherboards
are more expensive and larger than ATX
and add up to 305 millimeters tall by
330 mm years why they are big they still
have only a maximum of seven rear
expansion slots but their width allows
them to accommodate dual workstation or
server class CPUs and up to twice as
much RAM as their ATX equivalents now
because they are geared towards
professional or
server use they tend to have fewer bells
and whistles like better rear i/o and
wireless connectivity but more robust
connectivity internally with things like
SAS ports replacing SATA ports that are
more common on the desktop they need a
24-pin connector and will usually have
two eight pins as well sometimes more
ex-lax motherboards are a bit of an
oddity they don't even have a standard
size but they're usually 240 more 4
millimeters wide and the size increase
actually comes in the form of additional
height it's right in the name but it's
more like an extra large ATX motherboard
than anything else
pricing wise they are similar to premium
ATX boards and when it comes to
performance they have the same CPU and
RAM and rear slot configurations as ATX
boards which is weird they're extra
height should allow them to have eight
or nine expansion slots but board
manufacturers typically have used the
extra space to give more room for large
beefy power delivery systems and cooling
around the CPU socket rather than to add
more expansion card slots what a weird
standard the one good thing that did
come out of it I think was that cases
are now being delivered to market with
more than seven slots at the back for
better ventilation with multi wave
graphics card configurations on even
standard ATX boards I mean honestly it's
amazing to me that excel ATX even still
exists you know it's not amazing to me
