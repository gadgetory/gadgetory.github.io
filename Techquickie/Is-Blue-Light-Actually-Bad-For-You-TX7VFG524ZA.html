associate with blue light we tried to
think of some funny stuff and kept
coming up with police lights in the
rearview mirror just kept popping up
guess that says a little something about
mine and John's driving records speak
for yourself John know what we're really
here to talk about is blue light apps
that filter blue light have been
available for PCs and smartphones for
years and it's gotten to the point where
I OS and Android now even offer the same
functionality built in but why is blue
lights suddenly something to avoid I
mean it's just regular light and it
isn't like you're staring into the Sun
and exposing your retinas to all that
lovely UV radiation and like mutating in
developing superpowers
well the main concern about blue light
is its ability to disrupt your sleep
cycle also called a circadian rhythm
specifically when blue light hits your
eyes it can inhibit the body's ability
to produce melatonin a hormone that
regulates sleep now scientists aren't
sure exactly why this happens but they
think it's because blue light is
relatively high in energy compared to
other colors that is to say it has a
shorter wavelength than red yellow or
green light and when you're up and about
during the day because you have to go to
work or go to school or head off to a
CrossFit class blue light from both
natural and artificial sources can help
you feel energized and focused but at
night when your body naturally wants to
start shutting down blue light instead
tricks the part of your brain
responsible for sleep into thinking it
needs to stay awake this problem has
been amplified in recent years as more
and more of us stay up late staring at
gadgets that give off lots of blue light
such as our computer and phone screens
doubles hooligans if you think back to
grade school physics white light that we
see lots of in our web browsers and
mobile apps contain all the colors of
the spectrum including blue and modern
LED displays often use a base of blue
LEDs combined with different chemicals
called phosphorus to produce white and
of course if you're looking at an AMOLED
phone display you're directly exposed to
plenty of blue pixels to make matters
worse those fancy new LED lights were
all installing in our lamps and
seedling fans also put out light that's
more skewed towards the blue side of the
spectrum than those old incandescent
bulbs were so just having the lights on
in your room before you go to bed might
keep you from falling asleep as quickly
as you did in the good old days and mom
used to read us a bedtime story of
course all this can not only cause
tiredness but the attendant health
problems that accompany chronic sleep
loss such as a weakened immune system
poor memory and weight gain there are
some studies that even suggest that the
higher energy blue light can trigger
chemical reactions that permanently
damage your eyes photoreceptors
irreversibly degrading your vision over
time though more research on this
specific issue is needed as the links
between blue light and actual eye injury
are much less clear than the ones
between blue light and poor sleep
there's good news though the solution
looks to be rather simple move to Amish
country just kidding you don't really
need to change your habits that much so
if you're like me and tend to lay in bed
with your phone late at night turn the
brightness down and enable your phone's
blue light filter this will make your
display appear much warmer so your body
won't be trying to tell you to stay
awake if you're on your PC instead there
are blue light filtering glasses and
monitors with built-in filters or
failing that Windows 10 has a built-in
nightlight in its display settings that
will reduce the amount of blue light
emitted by your display and another
trick is to try and use light bulbs
advertised as warm with lower color
temperatures on the box
these will push your ambient lighting
back towards the red end of the spectrum
as well it might be annoying to not be
able to see things in quite their
correct colors before bed but it will at
least keep you from having to explain to
your boss why you keep yawning during
that meeting he makes you sit through
every Monday morning I'm glad we don't
do one of those that calls for a punch
into the face no missed thank goodness
