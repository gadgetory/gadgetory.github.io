be a really satisfying experience
whether it's a recipe a toolshed or of
course your own PC but ordering parts
from your favorite website and slotting
them together is really as far as most
people go I mean you can't exactly whip
up a CPU from scratch can you well you
can't
but fortunately companies like Intel
Global Foundries and tsmc do it every
day but how believe it or not the main
ingredient in that fancy core i7 sitting
in your rig or that Snapdragon sitting
in your smartphone is sand I mean it
isn't exactly the same stuff that you
find on the beach it's specially mined
in order to be more pure than what you
would make a sand castle out of and this
sand is heated to thousands of degrees
and chemically purified to produce a
virtually flawless cylinder of silicon
hence the name Silicon Valley for
California's high-tech region now the
reason that purity is so important is
that as processor technology has
continued to advance the tiny
transistors on CPUs have gotten smaller
and smaller so that more of them can fit
on one processor die making it more
powerful and because chip makers are now
packing as many of these transistors as
possible onto CPUs the margins for error
are extremely slim making precise
manufacturing and ultra clean
environments absolute musts so after the
silicon is purified it's cut into what
are called wafers which resemble mirrors
more than the cracker kind of wafer that
wafer is then polished a photosensitive
chemical is applied a kind of like
what's used in film then ultraviolet
light is shone through a stencil that's
shaped exactly like the transistor
layout that the engineers created for
the CPU because wafers themselves are
usually quite large the process of
shining light through the stencil can be
repeated many times
fitting hundreds of CPU dies onto a
single wafer after the UV light step is
complete the wafer is washed and a
solvent that dissolves the
most areas leading a pattern that
another machine edges into the way for
itself these edges are then bombarded by
ions charged atoms that embed themselves
into the silicon changing the way that
they conduct electricity to create
transistors that only allow current to
flow in one direction which means they
can function as tiny switches or gates
that make your CPU able to understand
instructions which by the way you can
learn more about here in fact the whole
reason we use silicon as the base or
processors is because of its ability to
accept these ions that form the
foundation for modern transistors so
after these transistors are created the
next step is to connect them together to
make a functional processor die this is
done with rigid copper interconnects
essentially tiny wires that are applied
on top of the transistors with a similar
ultraviolet and etching process to what
I explained earlier exactly how they're
connected depends on what CPU
architecture the engineers are using
whether it be something like skylake
codename skylake for Intel or codename
Zen for AMD this is done in many many
layers to prevent any of these wires
from accidentally touching and causing a
short-circuit or any other kind of
defect the dyes are then tested and the
good ones are placed into a CPU package
and is what allows it to plug into the
socket on your motherboard you add a
heat spreader on top of that and voila
you've got the beating heart of your new
PC phone or anything else that requires
a CPU but is silicon always going to be
the core ingredient in the buffet of
CPUs of life well because of the
chemical properties of silicon actually
the answer is probably no we're very
close to the physical limit of how small
transistors can be made on silicon
meaning that we may see CPUs made from
something completely different by the
end of this decade but silicon will
remain very useful for quite some time
and besides renaming the bay area indium
gallium are
tonight Valley just doesn't really roll
off the tongue but you know what does
roll off the tongue fresh books fresh
books fresh books the irony being that
well the idea is fresh books are really
not what we're talking about because
it's all in the cloud I mean okay it's
doing your accounting book so
figuratively at there but anyway the
point is fresh books is all about small
business owners who want to get more
organized be able to make more money
because they can spend their time doing
actual work instead of you know chasing
down invoices and figuring out how many
hours they build on that job and whether
you're you know dance instructor yoga
teacher a plumber a house painter a
computer a technician or whatever it is
that you're doing as a small
self-employed person
fresh books is going to make your life
less stressed out and more organized you
can track all of your hours in one cloud
managed place you can create invoices
you can send them to clients you can see
when they viewed your invoices and they
can pay you directly through invoice
they've even got a new feature that
allows you to accept deposits through
their platform so you can make sure you
don't show up on a job site with a bunch
of you know pipes and toilets and have
the client be like yeah so we went with
someone else
deposits are a much bigger thing then
you might necessarily think now getting
started on fresh books is extremely
simple even if you're not a numbers
person actually especially if you're not
a numbers person and you can try fresh
books for free for 30 days by going to
fresh books calm forward slash tech
quickie and entering tech quickie and
now how did you hear about us section
it's linked in the video description so
thanks for watching guys you liked the
video like it if you disliked it well
I'm sorry to hear that
I guess you can dislike the video check
out our other channels by the way we
have a video coming very soon on Channel
super-fun you're gonna want to get
subscribed to channel super fun because
it's awesome where we like actually oh
this is kind of a oh it's kind of like a
spoilers thing okay well whatever we
build lightsabers it's really frickin
cool guys leave a comment under this
video if you have suggestions for future
fast as possible videos and as always
