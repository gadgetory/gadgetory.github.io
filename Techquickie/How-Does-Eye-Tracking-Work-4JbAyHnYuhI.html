the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so wouldn't
it be useful if you could instantly know
where people are looking without having
to stare back at them maybe you're
wondering if your crush is checking you
out from across the room or maybe you're
just hoping that no one can see you
picking your nose inside the car
well we haven't invented 360-degree
Bionic vision implants yet but there are
a number of eye tracking technologies
out there that can at least hope your
computer know exactly what you're
looking at which has applications and
feels from gaming to marketing to even
psychology but how exactly do they work
well it turns out there are a number of
different ways to keep an eye on your
eyeballs and the modern history of eye
tracking goes all the way back to 1908
when psychologists Edmund Huy developed
a contraption that looked like a contact
lens with the lens part attached to a
needle that would measure where the
Iowas pointed of course it wasn't
exactly comfortable to have a gadget
physically touching the users eyes so
while we patiently waited for the Cubs
to win another World Series um other
inventors push the field forward and
funnily enough it was in Chicago in 1937
that another method of eye tracking was
developed that involves shining light
onto a subjects eyes and exposing the
reflections onto film to understand
human reading patterns
now obviously modern eye tracking
systems have dispensed with physical
film but this strategy of examining
light that reflects off your eyes is key
to how consumer eye trackers work today
you see eye trackers like Toby which are
gaining popularity with PC gamers fire
infrared light instead of visible light
at your eyes
so the tracker will disturb your vision
while you're in the heat of battle now
this light is usually shown in this
specific pattern which lands on your eye
making it easier for the infrared
cameras built into the tracker to keep
tabs on changes in how the light is
being reflected so many times per second
this camera will take infrared snapshots
of the patterns on your eyes and process
these images to determine where you're
looking for gamers eye tracking is
supported and quite a few popular games
from indie titles to big-budget triple-a
releases and can be used for everything
from looking around the cockpit to
determining where your target
radical will go in a shoot-'em-up game
and the technology is also showing
promise for players with disabilities
who might find traditional controllers
difficult to use or even VR gamers who
owns the more realistic experience of
the headset display adjusting to where
their eyes are looking rather than just
head movements and this for outside the
gaming world eye tracking has also been
used across disciplines to figure out
what people are most interested in
meaning it has obvious applications for
advertisers eye tracking Tech has
already been used in studies that have
revealed things about which elements of
an advertisement or a webpage best hold
of viewers attention and what things
might just be taking up space or even
turning the viewer off so this has
raised concerns about how the technology
may be used in the near future for
example if you look at the digital
display the shopping mall containing an
ad is there an infrared camera watching
your eye movements without your
knowledge
is it being logged somewhere well
websites end up being able to watch you
through an eye tracker connected to your
PC so that they can cook up even
sneakier ways to serve you ads but even
though I tracking has plenty of
applications in somewhat in the various
fields other areas like medical research
also stand to benefit from it
tremendously so you won't need a fancy
IR emitter and camera system to know
that I'll be keeping an eye on it and
speaking of keeping an eye on things are
you tired of people keeping their eyes
on you online
