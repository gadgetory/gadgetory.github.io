together a high-end computer capable of
doing everything from running games at
4k to trying to find the grand unified
theory often times you probably find
yourself just needing something to check
your email or post a video selfie about
how much you hate people who take
selfies and even though you can do these
things with a tablet or with a
smartphone
there's no denying the convenience of
being able to use our good old-fashioned
physical keyboard
well Google jumped on this idea a few
years back by rolling out the Chromebook
a line of lightweight laptops tightly
integrated with Google online services
and pushed as an alternative to
windows-based laptops but how exactly
are they different than from the
traditional notebook PC and are they
actually a compelling buy for people who
don't need the you know peasant
destroyer over 9,000 gaming laptop
well Chromebooks differ from regular
laptops in two main ways
one they ship with Google's own
operating system the Linux based Chrome
OS instead of Windows this OS relies
heavily on web applications such as
Google Drive and is essentially built
around the Chrome web browser - because
they are so tied to the Internet and
specifically to cloud storage they tend
not to come with a whole lot of on
device storage capacity most Chromebooks
only pack 16 to 32 gigabytes of internal
storage though at least they are SSDs so
while you won't get a whole lot of space
your read and write speed should still
be quite a bit faster than a traditional
laptop with a mechanical hard drive
well Linus that actually sounds pretty
dumb why would I want a laptop with a
tiny drive that basically needs to be
connected to the Internet all the time
great question although Chromebooks
aren't as feature-rich as Windows
laptops there are some distinct
advantages the most prominent of which
being caused Chromebooks are generally
cheaper than traditional laptops and
while prices do depend on the hardware
inside you can get them new for as low
as a hundred and fifty bucks although
250 is a more common price point
Chromebooks also try to blur the line
between laptop and mobile device with
long battery life most Chromebooks can
get between 8 and 13 hours on a single
charge
not to mention that they're lightweight
usually in the 2 to 3 pound range
unsurprisingly though the focus on
web-based applications and ultra
portability comes with some compromises
Windows applications won't run on Chrome
OS meaning you'll have to find
alternatives for things like Skype and
iTunes it may come with a hundred
gigabytes of cloud storage for two years
but after that you'll have to start
forking your cash over to Google
negating some of those cost benefits
that you've got for yourself by spending
less than your laptop and because most
Chromebooks have Celeron or even
arm-based processors you won't be able
to do a lot of that computationally
intensive stuff that we alluded to at
the beginning of the video unless you
purchase one of the few higher-end
models that support an Intel Core i3 or
better processor but even with these
limitations developers are coming up
with tricks to make the Chromebook a
more capable machine for instance adobe
has come out with a version of photoshop
for Chromebooks that actually offloads
the processing to Adobe's servers so you
can still edit photos even on a
low-power CPU cool right and Google does
include functionality for things like
creating memos and Google Docs without
an internet connection from a less is
also capable of running most Android
apps natively and can even connect to an
Android smartphone and even though the
OS is designed to be a secured walled
garden of sorts including storing boot
code in a ROM chip to ensure the system
can't be modified by an attacker
Chromebooks do include a developer mode
that enables you to install a different
operating system on them altogether if
you'd like so even though power users
probably won't be conquering cyberspace
with the Chromebook anytime soon it's
certainly an interesting alternative if
your digital life is mostly centered
around sending out tweets pretending to
send important emails and of course
watching tech quickie while you're on
the go speaking of being on the go so
