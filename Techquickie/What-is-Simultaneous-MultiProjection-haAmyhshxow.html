gaming is a bit of a misnomer sure in
many modern titles your character is
moving around a three-dimensional space
as opposed to the side scrollers of
yesteryear but at the end of the day
we're gaming on flat two-dimensional
monitors unless you happen to have one
of those newfangled curves displays but
you know what I mean showing a 3d image
on a 2d display has long been an issue
think for example about looking at a
flat map of the world on Google Maps
which uses a map projection that makes
land masses near the North and South
Pole look way bigger than they actually
are because translating a 3d sphere the
earth onto a 2d monitor or map is an
imperfect process somewhat similarly
your pc's graphics card has to project
portions of 3d objects onto your screen
a certain way so that they appear to
have the correct perspective and depth
just as real-life objects do computers
do quite a good job of this in most
modern games if you're only rocking a
single monitor setup but if you're
running three monitors where the two
displays on the side are tilted toward
you you may have noticed that some of
your games look distorted and skewed on
the side monitors to understand the
reason for this it can help to visualize
your GPU as a projector behind a set of
translucent screens if all three of them
are lined up straight on one plane the
image will look correct but setting up
your monitors like this takes up a ton
of space and limits your field of view
so most people tilt their two-side
monitors inward but this would make a
hypothetical projector display a
stretched incorrect image on those same
in displays enter simultaneous multipe
rejection or SMP a new GPU technology
featured on invidious new GeForce 10
series that alleviates this problem by
essentially showing a different camera
angle on each screen going back to our
projector analogy this is like having a
separate projector behind each screen
instead of just one for your entire
setup ensuring that the shapes and
objects look realistic
instead of like poorly constructed
play-doh models but Teheran doesn't that
mean that my GPU has to render the same
screen three
different times won't that kill my frame
rates and make my $600 graphics card
next to useless actually most of the
really heavy rendering of things like
geometry and lighting are done only once
after that the multiple projections are
created by using simple transforms that
clip or squeeze the stuff that has
already been rendered which is much less
compute intensive so you won't see a big
dip in framerate the current version of
the text supports up to 16 different
projections so you can have good looking
visuals even if you have some sort of
monstrous monitor arrangement a similar
concept is used to push to slightly
different projections to each lens of a
VR headset so that the 3d effect looks
correct technologies that Nvidia is
calling single pass stereo and lens
matched shading the compensate for the
fact that there are two lenses and the
fact that the lenses are curved instead
of planar and if you've noticed that I
keep talking about Nvidia that's because
right now SMP is only a thing on their
new GTX 1080 and 1070 on supported games
however as VR headsets and surround
gaming become more popular I wouldn't be
surprised to see something similar on
AMD cards in the near future especially
with their new Polaris architecture
right around the corner so like the
North Star
hopefully SMP and related technologies
can point you towards a more immersive
gaming experience if you just can't get
enough screens in your battle station
speaking of screens mass drop has
another one of their pretty killer deals
going on today the LG 34 um 57 34 inch
ultra wide freesync monitor I hope I
said that correctly is currently
available over there at an exclusive low
price this monitor not only features
free sync technology to prevent screen
tearing in your favorite games but also
has an IPS display for greater color
accuracy for screen split so you can
output an image from multiple devices at
once and black level stabilization to
help light up dark scenes of course this
product is available only through mass
drop at the significantly
discounted price thanks to their group
by model essentially the more people buy
the more the price goes down to a set
minimum with its minimum price being
just under 30% below the MSRP you can
check out this drop and many others at
the link in the description draw dot
slash text quickie so head over there
now if you're interested that link
doesn't give us a kickback or anything
but it does let them know that we sent
you got it
okay thanks for watching guys like it if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it and leave a comment if you want to

videos that we've got linked up wherever
you know check out maybe some channel
super fun if you if you like fun things
and we'll see you next time
