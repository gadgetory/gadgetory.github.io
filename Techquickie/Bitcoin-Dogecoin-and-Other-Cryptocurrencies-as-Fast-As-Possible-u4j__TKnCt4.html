for food shelter clothing and clean
water theoretically if everyone had the
perfect amount of each of those things
we would have no need for money and
everyone would live happily ever after
in the real world some people have more
water than others but perhaps less
access to food or clothing and trading
or bartering for a better balance has
always been necessary but picture this
the local mall with every shopper
carrying around like bolts of cloth or
construction grade lumber to each
shopkeeper one by one trying to find the
one who both has what they need and
needs the thing that they happen to be
carrying kind of ridiculous that is why
we need currency compared to cattle for
instance it's easier to use more durable
and more compact not to mention it
smells better metals notably gold and
silver were used as currency for
thousands of years then widespread
adoption of government regulated
centralized banking in the 19th and 20th
centuries brought about money
this currency exists in the form of
promises stored electronically and
printed on paper handy sure but unlike
metals whose value we all agree on with
money we rely on someone else to tell us
what it's worth which leads us to why
there are people who want a new
alternative to centralized banks
regulated currencies are ultimately
controlled by people and are therefore
more easily manipulated for gain by
those in a position of power with a deep
understanding of the system with Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies like anything
it's possible to gain the system for
personal gain but they are not centrally
controlled supply and demand are the
main drivers of their worth and the
built-in limit to how much can exist
just like precious metals should in the
long term prevent mass devaluation and
the inflation that's caused by central
bank's printing money that they don't
have okay so if we want to be more like
metals why not just go back to gold well
there are other advantages too unlike
gold which is inconvenient to move
around Bitcoin is stored and transferred
digitally in a virtual wallet and unlike
cash each bitcoin has a public
transaction history that makes
theoretically impossible to counterfeit
all right so how do I get them well
method number one is to use a computer
to solve cryptographic problems you can
get more details on this in the Bitcoin
sub form online as tech tips comm method
number two like any other type of money
is to exchange goods or services for it
or even other currency using an exchange
so sounds great right I sure think so
the obvious question though at this
point is what can go wrong and the
answer is lots at the moment not to many
merchants accept bitcoins so it's kind
of hard to spend without regulation or
predictable demand valuation can swing
up and down wildly some governments
notably Russia and China at the time of
filming are resistant to cryptocurrency
and have gone as far as to ban the use
of Bitcoin and like anything new the
security of the system is still largely
unproven can i truly buy something
anonymously can it be easily stolen from
me digitally
can anyone promise me that this will
still exist in one ten or a hundred
years currency relies on trust and only
time will tell which cryptocurrency
if any we can trust for our retirement
funds what can we count on Bitcoin Lloyd
dogs don't do each coin dogecoin
whatever you want to call it well I
don't know but I'll tell you what we can
count on Linus telling us what a great
idea it is to head over to audible.com
slash tech wiki to learn about their
monthly audiobook subscription
audible.com is the number one spot on
the internet for audiobooks you know
books that read themselves to you with
your smartphone or other device they
have over a hundred and fifty thousand
choices including a personal favorite of
mine the secret diary of adrian mole by
sue townsend i read this as a kid and
the only complaint i had about it was
that a lot of the diary entries hid
shockingly close to home making it the
kind of thing that would be awkward to
read alongside my parents maybe that's
an idea give audible.com a try the first
one is free and listen to it together
with your pre adolescent or adolescent
son just for a lark anyway guys thanks
for watching like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment and let me know your
thoughts on Bitcoin or other crypto
currencies and of course you can
exchange comments with each other
because the new youtube comment system
is so much better than the old one etc
etc etc thank you google for the large
sums of cash that
gave me for saying that actually they
didn't and I was being ironic anyway and
as all these guys don't forget to
subscribe to tech quickie from our
fastest possible videos just like this
