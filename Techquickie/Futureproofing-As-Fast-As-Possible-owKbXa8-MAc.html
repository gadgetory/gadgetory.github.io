agonizes over every component you select
to make sure that everything you have is
the latest and the greatest it can be
really frustrating when you hear about a
new product release a couple months
later kind of like when Apple announces
some incremental update at a press event
right after you finally bought the did I
thing to your so you feel like part of
the in-crowd well technology does indeed
move very quickly so many people wonder
if trying to future-proof their pcs is a
good idea to try to stay ahead of the
curve I mean when you think about it the
future is going to happen at some point
so in that sense future proofing makes
about as much sense as trying to death
proof your body or tax proof your income
but does it really extend the lifespan
of your PC and by how long to answer
that question let's take a look at some
strategies that people who try to
future-proof their PCs use many are
interested in being early adopters of a
just-released platform that supports
something like a new type of memory
others might invest in a super beefy
power supply for example under
motherboard with lots of expansion slots
for a future multi GPU setup or a type
of expansion card that doesn't exist
today the idea seems to make sense
on the surface put together the most
powerful thing that you can to keep it
from being hopelessly out of date in a
few years but is that really the best
way to go what we usually recommend
instead of buying the most high-end ball
or stuff out there because you want to
future-proof your computer is to get the
best stuff that you can afford that
represent a good price to performance
ratio today without blowing the entire
budget but why here are some examples of
why our philosophy is to be more
concerned about value for the money than
future proofing let's start with your
builds CUDA grass the graphics card
well GP
technology tends to advance pretty
quickly so unless a new architecture
that promises significantly higher
performance is right around the corner
it makes more sense to buy the best
thing you can afford comfortably now and
only prepare for SLI or crossfire with a
pricier power supply if you know that
you'll be able to afford a second card
soon after and actually have the monitor
set up to take advantage of it otherwise
you might end up like a lot of people
who dropped a bunch of money on an
expensive power supply and more
expensive motherboard but never ended up
adding a second graphics card after all
because you probably won't be buying a
second graphics card that's identical to
what you have two years down the road
unless you're comfortable buying
something used anyway which if you're
the sort of bleeding edge type person
doesn't really fit into your customer
profile to think about that but how
about your CPU let's suppose you want to
somehow make sure that your CPU will
trade punches with whatever comes out in
three or four years well the nice thing
is that processors these days are
generally very efficient so as long as
you're buying a mid or an upper tier CPU
like an unlocked k processor from Intel
you'll have a chip that will probably
last you for a few years anyway
regardless of whether you're actively
thinking about future proofing and since
CPU sockets change quite frequently it
is highly likely that you would end up
locked into whatever processor
architecture you're buying or at best
the next one coming making your future
proofing of your motherboard and CPU
pretty pointless
it's also worth thinking about whether
trying to future-proof your PC with the
newest stuff will result in a real-world
performance boost for example faster
memory speeds or PCI Express speeds look
good on paper but often result in little
to zero performance gain in the real
world which you can learn more about
here and by the time games or other
programs mature to the point where they
might be able to take advantage of it
she'll probably be wanting to upgrade a
a lot of your other components anyway
really high-end Ram with the absolute
fastest speeds also typically comes at a
hefty price premium making it a galactic
waste of money for most people the point
here is that instead of worrying too
much about how viable your rig will be
in a few years compared to what everyone
else is building at that time instead
focus on having a reasonable upgrade
path for a system you can afford today
for example I would spend the extra six
dollars or whatever it is on a
motherboard that has a couple of extra
RAM flaws because memory upgrades are
something that are likely to occur over
the lifespan of a computer and another
thing for example if you're a person who
tends to eat through hard drive space
maybe make sure that you buy a case that
has a quite a few well-placed drive
slots that are easy to get at so that
your future expansion will be relatively
easy the thing I don't recommend is
spending a fortune on something that's
marginally better when you could have
just pocketed the money waited a couple
years for Moore's law to continue its
onward death march and get something
equivalent or better than what you would
have been able to afford with the money
that you saved effectively getting what
you did get and what you're able to get
later for the same amount of money
because the cold hard truth of it is
there's pretty much nothing that you can
do to future-proof a computer and often
the better value a to go about it is to
actually trade in or sell your old parts
every two or three years and upgrade
that way if you want to stay on the
bleeding edge speaking of keeping up
with things fresh books fresh books is
the cloud-based accounting solution that
allows small business owners to save
time destress off' i their lives and get
more organized it allows you to craft
and send professional invoices in
seconds lets you track your hours lets
you keep track of your expenses it
basically does all that boring
accounting stuff for you so that you can
spend your time developing
your business whatever your business is
if it's small-time computer repair or
you you know run a mechanic shop or you
paint houses for example FreshBooks even
supports taking deposits for your work
ahead of time fresh books is going to
make it so that you don't have to go
home at the end of a frankly very tiring
very busy day and stare at your
accounting software and kind of go hoc
how much does that how much should I
quote that customer all that stupid
stuff no forget it
try fresh books for free for 30 days by
going to fresh books calm forward slash
