the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos so have you
ever worked on a group project where you
did all the work but you're lazy partner
put his name on it too and got an easy a
or maybe it would be more relevant to
ask if you've ever written the paper
that someone else paid you for well
while the latter would get you kicked
out of most universities for academic
dishonesty something similar is actually
a widespread and perfectly accepted
practice in the technology industry I'm
talking about the use of original
equipment manufacturers or OMS so here's
how it works
think about the last time you visited a
fast-food joint like McDonald's chances
are if you walk around back you'll see
some dumpsters and a few teenagers with
nowhere else to be not a patch of land
where McDonald's is raising its own cows
growing its own potatoes and refining
its own sugar for the soda fountain well
I'm sure it seems obvious now that we
mentioned it but McDonald's buys all
that stuff from outside companies cooks
it and then Marcus it as the Big Mac
value meal that you happily gobble up
the reason for this is that it's far
cheaper and easier for them to outsource
farming and even some other processes
like baking buns than it is for them to
build a thousand barns and raise
millions of chickens by themselves so
bringing this back to the tech world
many of the companies that you think of
as businesses that make electronics
don't actually make electronics at all a
great example of this is Apple Apple
doesn't use its own factories to produce
the iPhone rather they're all made by
companies like Foxconn and Pegatron
headquartered in Taiwan who used to
spec's the Apple sends to them and
indeed many different electronics are
manufactured this way a design team at
company a will come up with a product
idea and design a schematic but then pay
Company B to actually make it even
though company B's name never shows up
on the products you end up buying I mean
can you imagine that the Foxconn iPhone
X another thing that makes the iPhone
such an interesting example is the fact
that Apple could afford to build their
own factories but they don't the reality
is that supervising the process but
leaving a manufacturing specialist to
actually build the devices saves them
tons of money they save on the upfront
cost of building the facility they save
on labor and they can leverage the
supply chain expertise and the overall
volley
Bellus large manufacturers acquire raw
materials in bulk at great prices
remember Foxconn makes a lot more than
just iPhones other manufacturers even
take things a step farther and make
their own product lineups without any
speck from any outside company then sell
these wholesale to companies who will
slap their own badge on them and maybe
provide a few extras like additional
warranty support or aesthetic
improvements this variation makes the
manufacture of more of an OD M with the
D standing for design and is a frequent
practice with power supply brands for
example to our knowledge ROS will and
fractal designs aren't evolves for the
technical design process of their own PS
use at all instead buying and rebranding
units designed by ODMs
now to be clear this isn't me that
they're bad at all and sometimes there
can be a benefit see sonic for example
both bills and sells their own power
supplies but often their prices are
higher than the brand's who are
rebadging what is in some cases
fundamentally the same units but Jon why
do I keep hearing people refer to
companies like Dell and HP as OMS when
they use lots of third-party components
and their pre-built computers well
that's a good point
maybe a better term would be original
equipment assemblers but regardless
people do use the term OAM when they're
talking about companies that sell pre
bills as well which is why om versions
of Windows cost less although the
software is the same that are meant for
businesses that sell pcs and provide
their own support to customers meaning
Microsoft won't give you any warranty
support if there's a problem well let's
get back to our original definition
though because OMS are so common in the
tech world sometimes we'll see a problem
affect many different brands because
they were using the same OAM this was
speculated to have happened during the
infamous capacitor plague of the early
2000s when several well-known brands had
widespread issues with faulty products
due to bad capacitors provided by an
outside manufacturer so if you really
want to know what's inside that shiny
new power supply or monitor you just
bought do your homework and see if you
can identify which OMS if any were used
you don't want to get reeled in by a
fancy looking box only to find out the
gadgets inside were actually made by mr.
Sebastian's budget PCB kitchen
speaking of budgets can you
not budget the time to sit down and read
well then check out blinken an app that
condenses the best info and insights
from thousands of non-fiction books it's
just 15 minutes of either reading or
listening you can read or listen to some
of the best books on the go and you
could take the most valuable parts from
them without having to invest too much
time I mean it's easy to spend 15
minutes on Facebook just browsing
passively so why not listen to the key
insights from that book that you've been
meaning to read and not only is plinkus
and affordable and great investment in
yourself
they have yearly monthly and even free
options and if you want the
recommendation right now check out
getting things done by David Allen on
blankest if you want to be more
productive and right now they have a
special offer just for tech rookie
