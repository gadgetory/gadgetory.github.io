things more difficult than trying to see
your surroundings in a pitch-black room
and while you can always feel your way
around and hope that you don't trip
ahead first into the toilet there are
times that actually being able to see in
the dark is a must
fortunately night vision isn't just a
thing in your favorite first-person
shooter it's present in everything from
surveillance cameras to military
periscopes to ordinary smartphones in
fact part of the reason night-vision has
so many applications is because it's not
just one specific piece of technology
rather it comes in several different
forms that can be deployed depending on
use case but what many people think of
when they hear the words night vision is
something called image intensification
or image enhancement this is that
stereotypical green form of night vision
that you might associate with the
military or what you see in action
movies speaking of which that green
color is used on purpose because your
eyes are more sensitive to green than
other colors image enhancement works by
being able to detect low levels of light
and then amplify it when photons the
tiny particles that make up light enter
an image enhancer they first hit a
special layer called a photo cathode
which releases electrons these electrons
then hit a second layer called a
microchannel plate which multiplies the
electrons before they hit the
phosphorous Crean why are these things
also epic well that then converts them
back into light because there are now so
many more electrons you get a brighter
image so you'll have an easier time
getting into someone's base and killing
all their nudes but hold on a second
what if there isn't enough light for
thermal enhancers to see at all this is
where thermal imaging comes in instead
of detecting light thermal cameras
detects heat coming off of different
objects since they can see infrared
light you see heat causes things to emit
photons in the infrared or IR spectrum
and although humans can't see infrared
light these special cameras take
advantage of it in a number of different
ways they are cameras produce images
called thermo grams which sometimes look
rainbow-colored where the different
colors represent different temperatures
Therma grams are useful for everything
seemingly from medicine to construction
but they're very specifically handy for
night-vision since it's really easy to
pick out different objects such as
people or animals due to their different
colors standing out on the screen
thermal cameras often can't achieve the
same level of detail as their image
enhancing counterparts but they have a
big advantage of being able to pick out
things that might be hard to see with a
normal image enhancer for example a
firefighter trying to locate people that
need to be rescued in a burning building
a hunter picking out prey deep in the
woods hiding behind foliage or cops
trying to locate that hiding fugitive
and speaking of thermal imaging some
cameras can even create their own
infrared light in a process called
active illumination where they actually
light up their surroundings with IR
radiation because this additional
infrared energy reflects off of whatever
the camera is pointed at this strategy
can result in much higher resolution
images great for things like
surveillance cameras where you really
want to get a positive ID on that perp
that tried to steal your slushie machine
what a downer audible.com is the leading
provider of audiobooks with more than
180,000 downloadable titles across all

to audible.com slash tech quickie and
browse the over as I've already said
180,000 audio programs there might be
some audiobook about stealing a portable
slushie machine but I've been listening
to Game of Thrones it's absolutely
fantastic
no spoilers the current movies are the
current show is kind of running right
now so there's a lot of spoilers online
too so just a heads up to avoid those
but yeah if you're like
old enough I I'd listen to I'd listen to
Game of Thrones audiobook speaking of
things I do like the video or you know
dislike the video if you want to like be
the other side in a game of Thrones war
you know that analogy sucked gonna roll
with it don't forget to go to channel
superfund they're pretty cool don't
forget to leave it on below if you're
like wow you should probably have better
analogies and segues that would also be
fine or you could be like here's an idea
for another video that would be even
more fine and yeah if you want to see
more just come back it's cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
