computer you might think of things like
DVR modules vram on your graphics card
or most likely just hard drives and SSDs
but there's actually another type of
memory that's incredibly fast and
essential to the speed that we've gotten
accustomed to with modern computers I'm
talking about your CPU cache no not the
money that you blew on that processor
with hyper-threading that you didn't
really need what we're talking about is
cache with an e it's a specialized type
of memory that's built into your CPU but
why the heck would your processor need
its own memory aren't that 16 gigs of
ram or whatever the heck you already
have in your computer good enough well
not really to be honest
you see those Ram modules are a heck of
a lot faster than say a hard drive in
terms of data transfer like a lot faster
but your CPU actually wants data much
faster than your Ram can even provide it
and on top of that as CPUs have gotten
faster over the years they continue to
outstrip typical Ram modules by wider
and wider margins meaning that without
faster memory your CPU is going to be
sitting around doing nothing like kind
of unproductive employee as it waits for
RAM and you'll run into bottlenecks as a
result this is where cache comes in
unlike system memory which consists of
dynamic RAM or DRAM your CPU cache is
static RAM or SRAM which is more
expensive and takes up more space but is
much faster than DRAM because it doesn't
have to be constantly refreshed in order
to hold data the way that DRAM has to be
an average CPU will only have a few
megabytes of cache but it makes a
tremendous use of this small amount of
memory you see when a CPU accesses
something from your main system Ram it
generally stores it in its cache then
uses complex algorithms to guess as to
what other instructions or data it might
need next and it fetches those from your
system Ram as well since these guesses
aren't perfect CPU suffer from things
called cache misses where it searches
its own cache can't find what it needs
and has to access your system memory
directly instead which slows things down
fortunately however modern processors
have gotten pretty good at deciding what
to put inside their caches as they'll
typically have a cache hit rate of
better than 80 percent meaning that most
of the time your CPU is only processing
what it finds in cache and doesn't have
to bother talking to your slower system
memory at all and as you may have
guessed more cache is advantageous so
when you're shopping for a processor the
product page will indicate how much
level 3 or l3 cache is built-in with
higher-end modules having a few extra
megabytes and if you're wondering what
the heck happened to levels 1 &amp;amp; 2 these
are smaller even faster parts of the
cache that your cpu will try and hit
before looking for data in your level 3
cache okay look that's cool and all but
will better cache actually give me more
FPS in games or faster speeds and my
other stuff well this can depend on the
specific application but you can see
performance increases kind of overall on
CPUs with larger caches fortunately
though if you're buying a higher-end
processor because you need more cores
higher IPC's or better overclocking
potential in general it'll probably come
with more cache as well so it's not
really something that you have to really
think about too much of course if you
really want that high-end silicon make
sure that you're paying attention how
much cash with an S that your wallet has
left are you trying to program payments
into your app and it's just not that
easy if you're building a mobile app and
searching for a simple payment solution
check out Braintree brain trees V 0 SDK
is one amazingly simple integration away
from giving you simple payments every
time developers around the world have
embraced the Braintree VI 0 SDK is the
easiest way to add secure mobile
payments to their apps and web site once
integrated Braintree supports a bunch of
different ways to pay like Apple pay
Android pay PayPal venmo credit cards
and even Bitcoin and if something new
pops up Braintree will support that too
it's used by uber Airbnb github it's
scalable it integrates into your app
easily just a few lines of code try it
in the sandbox learn more about
Braintree in the video description down
below
and get your first 50,000 in
transactions fee free at Braintree
payments comm slash tech quickie but are
you cashed out if you are be sure to
like the video dislike the video
subscribe do all those fun things then
on your way out the door be sure to
check out channel super fund right
across the street there fantastic
highly recommended and as always leave a
comment on the little book as you as you
leave with the suggestions that you
might have for how we could make your
stay even more better next time and
anyways thank you for enjoying tech
quickie we'll see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
