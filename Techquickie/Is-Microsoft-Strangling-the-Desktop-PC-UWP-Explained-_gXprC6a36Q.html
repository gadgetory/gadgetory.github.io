the subscribe button and enable
notifications with the bell icon so you
won't miss any future videos by now you
probably expect to be able to run
software and services on lots of
different platforms Facebook works on
your smartphone and on your PC and you
can watch netflix on your 4k TV your
computer or your tablet
but of course supporting all of these
different devices means more work for
software developers sometimes to the
point where they won't even bother
rewriting a program that you like for a
different operating system or if they do
it ends up being buggy and inferior as
we discussed in our episode on Windows
Phone excuse me I mean video game ports
but fear not the ever merciful Microsoft
has come to our rescue with its
Universal Windows platform or UWP an API
that sits between the operating system
and the program to make it much easier
for developers to code programs just
once for a number of different devices
even if they aren't using traditional
x86 processors from Intel or AMD that is
as long as those devices are running a
Microsoft operating system so uwp will
work on Windows 10 the Xbox one and
hololens if that thing ever makes it to
market
so uwp achieves this by having a number
of core api's that work behind the
scenes to allow code to be understood
and executed properly across these
devices and it's also got some features
that are more visible to you the
consumer at home like an ability to
scale visual elements properly depending
on whether you're using an app on a
large screen with a keyboard mouse or on
a much smaller device with touch and if
a developer wants to add additional
features that are only available in a
certain platform like touchscreen
toggles or keyboard no support he or she
can use adaptive code that will only run
if the uwp app is running on that type
of device or even restrict the app to
one platform
you see this actually with certain games
that are only intended to run on Xbox
for licensing reasons or apps that are
locked to touchscreen devices because
their UI design requires it
but while Microsoft's rationale is that
making you WP apps only available
through the Windows Store
allows them to screen them for improved
user security this move has opened the
program up to a number of criticisms one
huge one is that this u WP + Windows
Store system is a walled garden meaning
that this platform that Microsoft is
actively encouraging developers to code
for originally could not be updated or
even loaded outside of the Microsoft
Store making it a fairly closed
ecosystem this generated concern that
Microsoft might be demanding too much
control over what programs can and
cannot be run on their devices and how
they can be run and although standard
versions of Windows 10 obviously allow
you to run compatible programs from any
source and Microsoft has updated windows
to allow loading of you WP apps directly
from publishers without going through
the Windows Store Microsoft is still
trying to find creative ways to
encourage users to fulfill all of their
software needs from the Windows Store as
with the stripped down Windows 10 S
which you can learn more about here and
the more recent s mode for regular
Windows that prevents outside
executables from being installed in fact
the CEO of Epic Games wasn't shy about
sharing his disdain for uwp despite the
fact that his studio produced Gears of
War for a major uwp title speaking of
gaming though although uwp does have the
benefit of allowing you to play the same
game on both PC and Xbox without needing
to buy it twice in many cases
enthusiasts have noticed that UWP has a
tendency to lock down games in some ways
preventing them from being modded
working with multi-gpu setups or even
simply not managing to play nicely with
frame counting programs and these are
just a
you examples so combine all of this with
the fact that UWP is strictly for
Microsoft operating systems and won't
improve the seamlessness of your
experience if you don't use an Xbox or a
Windows Phone it isn't too surprising
that it hasn't thrilled either its users
or developers ting is the mobile carrier
that is focused on customer service and
satisfaction first when you call ting
you do not speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and you
don't pay extra for the privilege with
ting you pay only for what you use and
the average bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device if you're stuck in a
contract and switch to ting they'll
cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to
75 bucks and they've got lower mobile
data rates than ever it's now just $10 a
gig beyond the second gig so head over
to tech quickie ENCOM we're gonna have
that link below and try out their
savings calculator to see just how much
you'd save with ting and when you sign
up using our link you'll get 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
