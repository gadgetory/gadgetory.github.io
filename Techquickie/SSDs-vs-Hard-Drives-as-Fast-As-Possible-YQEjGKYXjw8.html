honestly it's sort of like asking which
is better a motorcycle or a semi-truck
alright so you might be sitting there
going that's a weird thing to say Linus
why would you say something like that
and the answer is because they're really
not that comparable they're just
different let's start with performance
when it comes to raw speed SSDs are
faster
I see many folks comparing the
sequential speed of an SSD to the
sequential speed of a hard drive and say
oh well they're kind of similar but the
reality of it is unless you copy large
files back and forth all day this
specification is pretty much meaningless
I'm serious it has nothing to do with
the way that they will do that you will
perceive the performance in the
real-world SSDs are all about little
data transactions that happen all the
time all over the place when you're
running something like an operating
system on them you know an instant
message comes through a program launches
it needs to access a ton of little files
all over the place these are the times
when not having to physically move ahead
across a disk allows an SSD to utterly
destroy a hard drive in terms of
performance in system responsiveness any
modern SSD will be easily several times
faster than any hard drive and sometimes
much more than that ok that's great but
what if you have lots of data to store
and that's your main concern it's not
like playing back video or music files
or looking at your archive of pictures
requires blazing fast performance so
this is where hard drives still excel at
the time of filming this 160 dollars
buys you either a 256 gigabyte SSD or a
4 terabyte yes a 16 times larger hard
drive for that kind of difference in
price per gig you could literally build
two hard drive based storage boxes and
have one of them set up as an off-site
backup with the money that you saved by
not using an SSD based backup solution
so yes folks for mass storage of data we
are a long way away from hard drives
being replaced by SSDs okay but what
about reliability now this one's a
little bit complicated hard drives are
pretty reliable these days but as
devices with moving parts they will die
eventually the good news is they usually
give
warning signs like if your hard drive is
making clicking noises right now for
example first check to make sure it
hasn't turned into a dolphin then
replace it if it is still a hard drive
but the bad news is that any kind of use
will wear them out for SSDs reading from
them a lot won't really wear them out
very much especially if you keep them
running cool but if you write to them
heavily you can kill a consumer-grade
model relatively quickly so I guess I'd
put it this way in an environment where
shock is an everyday occurrence such as
in a notebook or tablet I would choose
SSD every time in an environment where
that's not the case then reliability to
me is a secondary factor after I
determine my performance and storage
needs which leads us to the in-between
solution hybrid drives these leverage
the technology of hard drives and SSDs
at the same time but that's a topic that
I've covered separately so I'm just
gonna leave a link here for you for that
now speaking of hybrid solutions an
audio book is kind of like a hybrid
between reading a book and riding a
motorcycle you know because it's
informative and exciting ok I was
reaching a little bit there but my
segways can't always be perfect the
point is that if you go to audible.com
slash tech quickie you can browse the
Internet's leading audiobook service
with over a hundred and fifty thousand
titles to choose from you can go right
now and pick up a great read like the
art of procrastination by John Perry or
if you don't feel like it at the moment
ah right you can sign up for a
membership to get a credit for one
audiobook per month to use whenever you
see fit and the cool thing about that
option is that the first one is on the
house
so head on over to audible.com slash
tech quickie to sign up guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it share it if you thought that
the information contained within it was
useful and as always don't forget to
subscribe to tech quickie for more fast
as possible episodes just like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
