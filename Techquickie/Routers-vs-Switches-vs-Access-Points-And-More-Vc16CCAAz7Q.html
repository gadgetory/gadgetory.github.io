mediocre buy because you've got some
stuff in your house but you need to
connect to the internet the slackjaw
dude at the entrance points you to aisle
nine and three-quarters so you spend 10
minutes wandering around trying to
figure out what that means until finally
you find yourself staring at a wall of
modems routers switches and access
points but all look more or less the
same plastic boxes with some Ethernet
ports on them in maybe some antennas
what is the difference between all these
gadgets well let's start with the most
fundamental piece of equipment you need
to get online
the modem this processes the signal from
your internet service provider or ISP
that's being carried over a phone cable
fiber or satellite link and interfaces
with your own home network if you're
just connecting one wired device to the
Internet a modem is all you need
plug your computer into the Ethernet
port on the modem and you are ready to
rock with no configuration required in
most cases but these days it's far more
likely that you have multiple things you
want to get online a whole host of
computers phones tablets and game
consoles not to mention that smart
fridge that you're having second
thoughts about this is where a router
comes in our router will create your
very own local network with each device
you want to connect assigned its own
local IP address kind of like unit
numbers in an apartment building but all
share the same street address so your
router then makes sure that web traffic
gets to the appropriate device within
your home so your data packets don't end
up going to your parents instead these
days most of us tend to think of routers
as wireless but there are plenty of
routers that operate only to hook up
wired devices to your local network so a
router isn't actually Wireless by
definition we only think this because
modern wireless routers are a
combination device consist
thing of a router a switch sometimes a
modem and a wireless access point or AP
this is the piece that actually
communicates with your mobile devices
over-the-air all those standalone access
points that plug into the router aren't
all that common for home networks they
are often found in public places where
many people need to connect wirelessly
to the same network such as in airports
or hotels if you have a lot of wired
devices and the few ports on your
wireless router aren't enough the
solution for you is an additional
network switch these can turn one
Ethernet port into many but usually need
to be connected to a router to handle
assigning IP remember those local
addresses to all the devices on your
local network something you can learn
more about here and if you've ever
wondered what a network bridges it's
simply a device that links devices
together by having inbound and outbound
Ethernet ports so a switch is just a
bridge with a lot of outputs bringing us
finally to our old friend the network
hub and yes I do mean old as you might
have one collecting dust in your attic
and it's kind of hard to find them in
stores anymore
you see hubs are sort of like switches
but instead of analyzing incoming
traffic and deciding which device it
should go to hubs are essentially
glorified splitters that just blast the
same network traffic to all outbound
ports usually resulting in lots of
network congestion that seriously limit
speeds because of this significant
shortcoming hubs were phased out in
favor of more intelligent switches as
Network and internet speeds increased so
if you do happen to see one on sale
somewhere it's almost always better to
opt for a switch instead unless you
really like old tech and you store
everything on zip drives just to be
contrarian
are you self-employed or running a small
business I guess that's sort of the same
thing do you find yourself running
around like a chicken with your head cut
off trying to sort out all that
paperwork and accounting and expense
reports and in
voicing loud stop sucks and freshbooks
is all about making it not suck any more
fresh books actually recently launched
an all-new version of their cloud
accounting software that is designed to
make your life more organized more
efficient and therefore easier fresh
books is designed for people who aren't
necessarily numbers people it allows you
to track expenses track your hours send
professional-looking invoices in seconds
and accept payment on your terms so you
could take deposits upfront if you were
a painter for example or you can take
the whole thing at the end but eliminate
that stupid guessing game where you send
someone an invoice and they're like oh
yeah I didn't get it or whatever because
freshbooks
lets you see when they've seen your
invoice and they can even pay through
the platform they've also got a card
reader now as well so check them out at
the link in the video description and
put an end to spending your time
accounting for the work you did instead
of doing your work and enjoying yourself
