to know how computer a compared to
computer be all we had to do was look at
the little tag under it and if you know
number a was 20% more than number B we
knew that give or take computer a was
gonna be 20% faster than computer B but
then as architectural designs of
different processors diverged and a CPU
that ran at two gigahertz could suddenly
be as fast at performing a given
real-world task as another one that ran
it three gigahertz we needed a new way
to measure performance benchmarks no I'm
not talking about those kinds of
benchmarks I'm talking about software
programs designed to evaluate the
performance of PC components or complete
systems they fall into two main
categories the first main type is
synthetic benchmarks examples of these
include I 264 S cache and memory speed
testing module and SuperPi a small
lightweight program that tests how
quickly a processor can calculate pi to
a predetermined number of decimal places
now synthetic benchmarks are great for
certain things because their creators
are focused on obtaining results with
maximum repeatability a key
characteristic of any test that is to be
used for scientific style comparisons
and minimal potential bottlenecks
elsewhere in the system to simplify
comparisons across different test
benches and prevent a situation where
say you're trying to I don't know test
the speed of your shiny new lightning
fast SSD by copying data from a hard
drive a much slower device in the first
place which would make all SSDs appear
to perform identically to each other the
same speed as a hard drive the problems
with synthetic benchmarks are several
though first up is that because they
work to ignore system bottlenecks they
often deliver results that don't reflect
the end-users experience because just
because one component is getting twice
as fast doesn't mean that the rest of
the system improved in any tangible way
and second because benchmarks run highly
specialized workloads they are
notoriously misused by hardware
manufacturers who might manipulate their
hardware or drivers to perform better in
industry standard benchmarks even if
this comes with no date
they benefit or even with reduced
performance in real-world tasks which
leads us to the other mean type of
benchmarks real-world benchmarks simple
versions of these like Cinebench or the
benchmark drop down built into 7-zip
take a predetermined but otherwise
totally real workload in these cases 3d
rendering or a file compression and
decompression and have the computer
process it as fast as possible then spit
out a number to tell you how well it
went
while more complicated real-world
benchmarks often need to be custom
developed by PC hardware publications
like anon Tech with their storage
benchmark suite that was created by
recording the actions of the user
performing everyday tasks on a computer
then running that IO trace on every new
drive that enters the lab but some
benchmarks don't really fall cleanly
into either of these two categories
future marks PC mark and 3d mark series
are great examples here
they feature components that are purely
synthetic like measurements of in-game
physics performance on a CPU components
that are real-world based like web page
loading times and then they spit out a
score that in theory quantifies the
performance of the machine alright Linus
then so which one should I believe
synthetic or real world or like the
hybrid model the answer is we'll kind of
all three if a real-world benchmark is
available for your exact given workload
let's say a 4k video editing then go
with that first but if it's not
available or you're planning for a
future hypothetical workload a hybrid or
synthetic benchmark may be your only
choice so just make sure that you
educate yourself about what the numbers
you're looking at mean before making a
purchasing decision and speaking of
educating yourself about numbers before
making a purchasing decision
dollarshaveclub.com
you got to educate yourself about the
numbers in this case price tags before
you make a purchasing decision in this
case raisers Dollar Shave Club delivers
high-quality razors straight to your
door for much less and it's amazing
because they're actually like it
includes shipping in the fact that they
cost less than the ones that you
actually have to get off your butt go to
the store get them to unlock the stupid
and by in person I mean this is more
work for you and you're spending more
money great little program there save
money and save time actually I think
their slogan is shave time shave money
which is very funny they're funny guys
and those funny guys also have other
products they've got their dr. Carver's
shave butter which goes on clear so you
can see what you're doing while you're
shaving they've got their one wipe
Charlies which also help you see what
you're doing when you're wiping your
butt with peppermint scented wipes and
head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash
linus to join the club and start looking
good without having to go out of the
house looking like a scrub in the first
place to get the supplies you need to
look good when you leave the house
thanks for watching this episode of fast
as possible guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment letting me know if you
have suggestions for future fast as
possible and as always if you aren't
