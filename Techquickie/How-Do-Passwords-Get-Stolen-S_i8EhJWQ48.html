your house are never too far from your
site since having them stolen would mean
breaking a window to get back in or
calling a lockout service at best
or I guess there's the worst case
scenario of having someone be able to go
into your house rifle through all your
stuff and drive off in your VW bus or
whatever it is you use to get around
fortunately keeping track of a single
physical key or a few on a keychain
isn't too hard but online passwords can
be a little bit trickier to manage as
the fact that many users have tons of
them to keep track of and the fact that
they're stored on a bunch of servers
somewhere instead of being a physical
thing you carry around in your pocket
gives miscreants more opportunities to
pry into your online life but how
exactly do passwords get stolen I mean
very supposed to be encrypted right well
yes but you might be surprised to know
that many times passwords aren't stolen
by some crack group of cyber criminals
using super fancy hacking techniques but
are instead harvested through social
engineering methods where the bad guys
will straight-up ask for someone else's
password this usually takes the form of
a phishing attempt where some malcontent
will send you an email or a steam
message that claims to be from your ISP
or your bank or valve asking you to send
your login credentials for some vague
security related reason there's a
similar concept - called tab napping
where you will actually get redirected
to a fake website that's built to look
as much like the real thing as possible
where you well enter your login
information because the page looks
official even if you're tech savvy are
smart enough to realize what's going on
when you see a phishing attempt it's
actually still quite easy to
inadvertently click links in scam emails
or dodgy websites that install key
loggers onto your system and send every
you type including passwords back to an
attacker that's how I got nabbed
keyloggers don't require a whole lot of
technical expertise to use making them a
popular choice for amateur online feeds
and then once someone unscrupulous has
your username and password combo it's
quite easy for them to use automated
tools that will try your credentials on
lots of different websites and since
statistics have shown us that over 1/2
of all Internet users reuse the same
password on multiple sites there is a
distinct possibility that if your
password for one site is stolen your
other accounts could be compromised as
well but let's suppose you're quite
careful about phishing and suspicious
links and you use a unique password for
every site exactly how safe are you well
if an attacker exploits vulnerabilities
in a server security and is able to find
encrypted passwords they could break the
encryption if it's not sufficiently
strong or if the password themselves
aren't very long a common way that
password dumps that leaked your
credentials to the entire Internet can
happen even a mid-range modern home
computer can guess millions of passwords
per second and billions if it uses a
discreet graphics card meaning that many
passwords can be cracked within just a
few days or even hours if you're using
commonly used words or phrases but you
obviously don't have much control over
how the sites that you use store your
passwords so we're planning a follow-up
video coming soon on what you can do to
make your own passwords as secure as
possible and keep prying eyes away from
your stuff spoiler alert passwords like
QWERTY and one two three four five six
our terrible ideas and yet they're used
all too often and are very easy for
attackers to guess so maybe don't put
those questionable conversations you had
with your ex behind a password that week
and with all this talk of encryption
tunnel there seems like an appropriate
thing
to bring up tamil Bayer VPN lets you
tunnel to up to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the internet and
use online services privately as though
you are in a different country they have
easy-to-use apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they also have a Chrome extension
and it's as simple as just hitting a
switch telling tunnel bear what country
you want to tunnel through and boom with
no tomfoolery or technical DNS bla bla
bla your connection gets encrypted and
your public IP address gets switched you
can bypass all that difficult to use
stuff they've got a top rated privacy
policy they do not log user activity and
you can try it out for free with 500
Meg's of data and no credit card
required at the link in the video
description also at that link you can
save 10% if you upgrade to an unlimited
account thanks for watching guys if you
like this video like it if you just
liked it dislike it if you want to check
out our other channels boom up there if
you want to comment with a suggestion
for a feature of us as possible its down
