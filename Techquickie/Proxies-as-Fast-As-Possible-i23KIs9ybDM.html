function of a proxy server there's a
good chance that the mere mention of
them brings up images ranging from that
of your friendly network engineer to
those of steampunk-inspired hackers
brandishing ridiculous looking headgear
and while these two extremes are not
totally incorrect as far as examples go
they don't exactly represent the
entirety of the spectrum either now
originally proxy servers were
instrumental in allowing multiple
computers on a local network to access
the internet without their IP addresses
conflicting but the invention of an IP
remapping method known as network
address translation allowed this
capability to be inexpensively
integrated into routers but just because
proxies are no longer needed to connect
to the internet doesn't mean they have
fallen completely out of use it turns
out that there are still quite a few
functional roles that proxies can serve
for those operating on a network one
such role is squid style caching which
can be used to store things like
frequently accessed online files
downloads and updates eliminating the
need for a networks worth of users to
download said materials individually
this not only has the benefit of greatly
increasing transfer speeds because files
are now taken from a private network
instead of over the Internet but hey if
you're in Canada it might also have an
impact on your overall bandwidth limits
as well and proxy networks can be used
in conjunction with special tunneling
protocols to act as a security
gatekeeper verifying or encrypting
packets routed through it depending on
their direction of travel recent demands
for increased security among businesses
and individuals alike has led to greater
use of these services known as VPNs
which business is used in an effort to
shield things like their customers
monetary information or internal company
data that they need to be able to access
remotely and individuals use for well
similar reasons and also things like
accessing online services that are
region locked or skirting around
overzealous governmental intrusion and
censorship so to better explain this
spective proxy server functionality will
turn to one of my ever popular analogies
let's say your PC IP address sitting at
your local internet bar whatever when
suddenly you spy this beautiful - tech
tips forum site - doors down the street
in the window of a foreign bar now
although theoretically you should be
able to walk down and take a peek at
that foreign websites content in reality
there is a bouncer named the Great
Firewall who prevents you from entering
so what you have to do then is go next
door to your boy the proxy servers place
who is able to let you slip into the
foreign club through a side door because
they can't tell that you came from you
know scrubland internet cafe or whatever
the case may be you can score that
websites binary digits and sneak back
out without them ever knowing where you
came from but with all of that said
we've painted proxy servers with our
rainbow colored brush so far and they're
not purely used as a force for good
while most people have honest intentions
when using proxy services to discreetly
prove the web a small percentage of
users including the fashionably
challenged hackers I mentioned before
use them for attacks including what is
referred to as a men in the middle
attack which disguises an intrusion into
a system as legitimate IP traffic
originating from a proxy this is
particularly worrisome because it can
end up painting a very large red target
on those servers which contain copious
amounts of valuable information because
as the old saying goes one man's cash is
another man's treasure or something
along those lines so while automated
data caching can be tremendous for
reducing little headaches the big
headaches that can result if your IT
staff isn't on the ball and some
compromised files slip through and push
to an entire network of pcs is a clear
potential downside speaking of clear
potential downsides I can't think of one
for Coolermaster they make great cases
power supplies fans they've got laptop
coolers they've got all kinds of great
stuff and probably the best thing though
about coolermaster is just like this
series of videos they're all about
actually legitimately educate
they're users so if you check out
coolermaster University on their website
they've got great information that helps
you make an educated decision about
whether it's something like CPU cooler
or whether it's something like a case or
a mouse they've got lots of great
peripherals like mice and keyboards and
though also they do a bunch of community
outreach as well so stuff like their
casemod world series which was running
very recently and allowed anyone with a
dremel or I mean really even if you just
had a screwdriver if you could use it
really creatively to enter their case
modding contest cool guys there's a link
to them in the video description so if
you're considering a PC upgrade
definitely check them out and I think
that's pretty much it guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it was trash leave a comment if
you have suggestions for future fast as
possible just like this one and as
always don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
