is your domain it's powerful it's got
all your files your shortcuts are laid
out perfectly and you always feel
comfortable but then you have to take a
trip out of town space is out of premium
and you're forced to make a call do you
bring your desktop or your two-year-old
well as cute as your desktop may be if
you have a toddler the odds are
excellent that the person who carried it
around for nine months to make it will
have some say in the matter so out comes
the laptop you haven't touched in the
last six months if you want to be
connected in any way to the world
however unoptimized that experience
might be but is there a way that you
could take that desktop experience with
you won't yes actually
great question viewer by the way there
is and it's pretty darn awesome in this
magical world of technology we have a
plethora of applications that allow you
to control a computer remotely via
another computer or even a mobile device
whether you're on site or off but what
is the best application to use well if
you're using Windows there's actually a
built-in option for remote desktop
called remote desktop connection though
it's only available with
professional-grade editions are higher
in the security isn't the greatest thing
ever
the main benefits of the integrated
solution are that it allows for a high
level of control you can manage all your
applications and transfer files between
pcs with ease and it doesn't require any
additional software to set up some
downsides however are that you can only
connect ROM a Windows machine to a
Windows machine using this software none
of that
freaky deaky Mac Windows cross-platform
nonsense going on and while if you're
connected within your local network it's
pretty easy it's just a matter of
enabling it on the host computer
configuring your settings only computers
that you control can access it remotely
and then typing in the name of the
computer when you want to real control
hit enter it becomes a little more
difficult when we're loading in from the
outside of your network as you'll have
to manually open up some ports on your
router full details on how to do that
can be found at the Lifehacker link in
the video description but of course
there are also plenty of third-party
solutions that fit the bill as well if
you're looking for an extremely simple
option than a program like TeamViewer
has you covered it takes minutes to set
up an account and you can even use it
with
out an account if you prefer you just
need the connection ID and password from
the computer that you're trying to
access you can use TeamViewer at no
charge for personal use the definition
of which you can find on their website
and you can get full access to all your
programs share files kind of slowly but
it works between your PCs and switch
between monitors if you have a multi
monitor setup all within a very simple
interface and they even have a mobile
app so you can access your home PC no
matter where you are
TeamViewer hosting works on Windows Mac
and Linux and you can get clients and
those and Android iOS and even Windows
Phone so much cross-platform love man
there are other cross-platform options
too like LogMeIn although LogMeIn now
charges a subscription fee even for
personal use which pretty much takes it
out of the running for very casual users
and then there are a ton of awesome
solutions for Linux like putty but they
all accomplish pretty much the same goal
accessing your home computer or your
work computer from any other computer
allowing you to feel comfortable when
surfing the web creating presentation or
doing whatever it is you want to do on a
computer with only very short delays
because yes there's always a gotcha
isn't there the quality of your
streaming experience over the Internet
will be heavily dependent on your upload
speed at your base station and download
speed wherever your travels take you
with a great connection I've been able
to edit videos on a remote workstation
even play them back but with a poor one
you can see delays as long as a second
or more making it quite difficult to
enjoy speaking of things that are easier
to enjoy when they don't have much delay
ddr4 memory and more specifically XP gz1
ddr4 from a data the sponsor of today's
video this is the memory that we use in
our ddr3 vs ddr4 apples-to-apples
comparison video on my other channel and
the whole lineup is pretty darn spiffy
if you're looking for memory for your
new LGA 2011 3 system with a 6 core or 8
core processor it's available in speeds
of up to twenty eight hundred megahertz
with transfer speeds of up to 22
gigabytes per second and does that while
being more reliable and while consuming
20% less power than comparable ddr3 kids
so if you're looking for some ball and
ran to go
you're ballin new CPU check out a data
is XP gz1
