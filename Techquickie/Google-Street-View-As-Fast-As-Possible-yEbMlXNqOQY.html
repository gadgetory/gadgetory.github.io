information universally accessible took
an incredibly ambitious turn in 2007
when they launched the Street View
project to give users a glimpse into
what places all over the world actually
look like at street level everywhere
from New Delhi to that deli down the
street but how are they able to capture
images from so many places the idea
actually started out pretty simply a
special camera attached to the top of a
car and lots and lots and lots of
driving Google initially worked with a
company called immersive media to use a
12-sided camera that could replace early
clunky prototypes that looks something
like luggage sitting on a rack on top of
your uncle's van shortly thereafter
Google was able to create its own
cameras which look like small spheres
with lenses all over the outside
allowing Google to capture 360 degree
views of streets and landmarks as the
vehicle was in motion
these cameras also contained no moving
parts to allow them to be more reliable
out in the field especially important
for driving through areas with extreme
climate conditions they also feature
lasers that scan the environment to
create 3d models that allow people using
Street View to double-click on a spot
that they want to see and have the
service show them that particular point
accurately after these cameras take
pictures of their surroundings images
from the individual lenses are stitched
together to create one continuous
panoramic shot that you can scroll
around in easily in Street View
while most shots come out looking decent
you do occasionally see instances where
the stitching didn't exactly work as
intended which come out as street signs
that are cut in half or even people that
appear to be missing arms or heads
yikes but despite the minor hiccup
Street View continue to expand both its
camera technology and its footprint
around the globe currently Google not
only has a standard fleet of cars to
capture street view images but also a
special back
pack with a similar camera attached to
allow users to see views of
hard-to-reach places
trolley that's been used to provide
looks inside places like museums and
stadiums tricycles for narrow streets
like you might find in Europe and even
snowmobiles that have been used at the
Winter Olympic Games partly due to the
versatility of Google's camera
technology they've been able to add more
and more locations around the earth
every year and although the project
started out just covering major urban
areas in the United States
Street View now has images of public
streets and roads in over 80 countries
and dependencies and views of landmarks
in many many more users are now also
able to submit their own panoramic shots
adding to street views presence
especially in areas where Google hasn't
taken their cameras yet
Street View also now works with Google
cardboard allowing you to experience
locations around the world in virtual
reality with your smartphone not a bad
idea if you really wanted to see some
far-off location but can't afford to get
on a plane but as useful as tree view
has been many have expressed concerns
over privacy after all the whole project
is based around recording everything
that it can in public view generally
speaking people have little to no legal
expectation of privacy when they're
driving or walking on a public street
although Google has had to settle legal
disputes in a few places over this issue
they had a long-standing policy of
trying to blur things like faces or
license plates that its cameras capture
especially with Street View getting
looks at people engaged in some
questionable activities but even with
Google's attempts to at least somewhat
protect the privacy of the people its
cameras see I still wouldn't recommend
you know being out on your lawn nude
sunbathing if you know that there's a
Street View car in the neighborhood
speaking of the neighborhood freshbooks
let's say for example you cut lawns in
the neighborhood or do yard work or
you're a plumber or you make small arts
and crafts projects or you paint mural
or whatever else it is you do for your
small business fresh books is on a
mission to make your life more organized
and make you more how's about to say
more stressed no that would be the
opposite less stressed but they're easy
to use tool for crafting and sending
professional invoices in seconds and
that feels like a real old talking point
because fresh books does so much more
than that it allows you to track your
expenses by taking pictures of your
receipts and it basically does the rest
it allows you to collect deposits from
customers like if you're a painter for
example and you need to purchase
material before you show up on the
jobsite you want to make sure you don't
get screwed over on something like that
it allows you to not only send the
invoices but see if the customer has
viewed it and request payment directly
through the app and just generally
continues to improve over time and the
best part about it is you can try fresh
books for free for 30 days by going to
