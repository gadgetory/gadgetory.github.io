two-part series we tackled a handful of
common problems that new computer
builders face and even some things that
those of you with experience would do
well to remember you can check that out
right there but obviously there was no
way we were going to be able to cover
everything that could go wrong in just
one five-minute video so what are some
other things that you should be looking
out for let's start small and talk about
those annoying little front panel
connectors unlike most of the
connections inside your PC the front
panel header isn't keyed in any way so
it's possible to plug things in in the
wrong orientation and considering how
many pins there are on the header it can
be one of the most frustrating parts of
any build to make this as painless as
possible
look at the diagram on your motherboard
near the front panel header or in your
motherboard manual you'll usually see
plus and minus signs to indicate which
way to plug in your leads but sometimes
this isn't clearly indicated on the
leads themselves very frustrating if
this is the case the colored wire is
usually positive and failing that you
can look for a little tiny embossed
arrow which indicates the positive side
but you shouldn't worry about it too
much
anyway if you plug something in
backwards and it doesn't work you won't
damage anything just turn it around and
try again and the orientation for the
pins for your power and reset switches
doesn't matter anyway since all those do
is complete a circuit by shorting the
pins when you press the button but now
let's go from talking about small stuff
to something big
namely that tower style CPU air cooler
that's beefier than a porterhouse steak
if you're going with one of these pay
close attention to your K specs a lot of
people assume that if your CPU socket is
listed on the box as one that fits the
cooler will sit but
how bulky some higher-end coolers are
and the fact that even standard ATX
cases aren't a uniform width you could
end up not being able to fit ram into
your slots or your side panel on if you
aren't careful
fortunately memory manufacturers list
the height of their modules and many
case manufacturers give a max cooler
clearance spec that takes into account
the height of the motherboard itself so
have a look at that if you don't plan to
use a water cooler and speaking of huge
CPU coolers you probably have one
because you're trying to overclock your
processor right and if it's an Intel
well you've made sure to buy an unlocked
K or X series right you should be ready
to go not so fast
aside from needing an unlocked processor
your motherboard chipset also needs to
support overclocking an easy way to make
sure it does before you buy is just to
look at the letter in the chipset name
if it contains a Z or an X such as Z 270
or X 99 then you're all set to overclock
but if it's something else like an H B
or Q you'll probably find that unless
your motherboard manufacturer has an
experimental bios available which is
quite uncommon you can't change your CPU
multiplier ouch okay then so you've got
the right motherboard cooler in case and
you're ready to put it all together but
wait there are two things you really do
not want to forget the first is the i/o
shield at the back of the case which I
would strongly recommend putting in
before doing anything else
countless builders even very experienced
ones have installed all their components
without realizing until they were nearly
done that they forgot the i/o shield
forcing them to take everything out and
put it all back in unless they want to
live with an awkward gaping hole in
their case or even worse they might have
missed one of the little tabs that you
have to bend up sometimes ending up with
it stuck in a port shorting it out and
killing it
the second one not to forget is when it
is time to install that CPU cooler don't
forget to peel the protective film off
the bottom of the heatsink
since you don't actually look at that
part of the heatsink the part that
actually contacts the CPU very often
it's easy to mount the cooler without
removing this plastic if you do that not
only will you experience abnormally high
CPU temperatures but the plastic can
melt leaving an ugly mess for you to
deal with later as well as wasted
thermal compound and time speaking of
avoiding messes what are some of your
top tips for preventing issues with your
shiny new build let us know in the
comments and you might see your ideas in
a future tech quickie episode also let
us know if you'd like to see more
avoiding PC building traps videos just
like this one but if you were thinking
to yourself gee I just avoided all these
PC building traps and I've got this
great PC but I can't get on frickin
websites because their country blocked
then I have a solution for you tunnel
bear it's easy to use and lets you
tunnel your internet connection to one
of 20 different countries whether you're
using iOS Android PC Mac they also have
a Chrome extension they make it as
simple as just picking a country
pressing a button and boom without any
of the rigmarole that goes along with
other VPN solutions your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
it's so easy to use they have a top
rated privacy policy and you can try it
out for free over at tunnel bear comm
slash Linus with five hundred Meg's of
data thrown in for nothing and no credit
card required then if you decide to try
out an unlimited plan you can save 10%
