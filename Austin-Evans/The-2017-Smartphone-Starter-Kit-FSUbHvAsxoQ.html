interesting year for smartphones gone
are the days of having a headphone jack
on every device screens been getting
bigger while the bezels are shrinking
instead of having a removable battery
you're oftentimes getting something like
fast charging or wireless charging but
if you are picking up a flagship this
year what do you actually need to get up
and running the first thing you're
probably going to want to have is a pair
of wireless headphones and big shout out
the Sennheiser for sponsoring this video
and sitting over there HD 450s for me to
take a look at what makes these really
interesting is that not only are they
going to be a wireless pair of
headphones with bluetooth support but
you're also getting active noise
cancellation now in a pair of headphones
that cost less than $200 this can
actually be really helpful especially if
you spend a lot of time on stuff like
trains buses or planes
you should also expect a good battery
life anywhere between 20 to 25 hours
depending on if you have active noise
cancellation on and they also do fold up
if you want to make them just a little
bit more portable in addition to
bluetooth 4.0 they also have support for
app decks which deliver even better
sounding audio and of course since their
Sennheiser you should expect quality oh
man it is always such a trippy feeling
when you put on the active noise
cancellation like it just feels like the
whole room just got super dead what is
that I hear actually oh it's a plane I
couldn't hear it because I had my
awesome active noise cancellation
headphones on it's crazy I actually
didn't realize I had been listening to
these on an iPhone before and they sound
good actually being able to take
advantage of app decks on something like
the pixel there's actually a noticeable
difference in audio quality it really
does sound like I'm listening to a wired
pair of headphones okay so before ken
has to watch me dance anymore
this isn't good these sound solid but
one of the nice things is in addition to
being wireless you actually do have the
option of plugging in a standard
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack or headphone cable cable to be fair
both the iPhone and pixel do come with a
headphone adapter in the box but the
issue is is that if you want to plug the
headphones in and also do something like
charge your phone you can't do that at
the same time until now companies have
started making adapters that not only
allow you to listen to your music but
also charge your phone at the same time
so let's start with the USBC adapter
which special bear high temperature
sign the superficial dent design
maintain the best conjunction I mean you
do need the best conjunction after all
oh wow that's actually really terrible
Wow first step will this catch our phone
on fire
oh man that's that's not a good fit if
we plug it into the phone it is not
charging okay so in theory you can pick
up a USBC adapter that actually works
but in this case confirmed garbage town
let's try the iPhone now I do at least
like the design at this one a little bit
more so you can plug it into the phone
on the top and then on one side you have
lightning on the other you have a
headphone jack plug it into the phone
okay nothing's on fire yet good sign so
it actually does show up as a USB 2.0
device so this actually might just work
it sounds about like a normal headphone
adapter so you're not expecting any kind
like hi fight DAC or anything but the
real test is can we actually plug this
in in it not catch on fire alright here
goes nothing oh hey charging and the
light is turned on hey guys this is
Austin and welcome to using a smart
phone in 2017 basically everything that
supports a wireless charging these days
is using the Qi standard now thankfully
this has actually been around for a few
years there are plenty of accessories to
choose from so the first is really
straightforward it's the power port Qi
10 from Anchor no one might not look too
impressive what you're getting here is
something that not only supports
standard wireless charging but it also
supports fast charging it's also super
thin
none of the iPhone 8 and 10 support
wireless charging something that this
could work not only for these devices
but also for other phones to support up
to 10 watts but the idea is we just drop
it on and in theory it will start
searching in theory charging will happen
oh it helps when you plug the charger in
protest drop the phone on and it
immediately starts charging so with this
you can prepare for the 2018 feature of
having 0 ports of any kind on your phone
there are also some cool options like
the mobile pal wireless charging bank so
the idea here is that not only this a
portable batteries that will charge your
phone via qi wireless charging but you
can also use qi to charge the battery
bank means
theory you could never plug this thing
in Oh interesting it's not like can you
if you want use USB to charge it you
also can use a lightning cable
that's actually really unique I don't
think I've ever seen that before so the
first step is to see if we drop our
phone on there we go
Amelie starts wireless charging that's
actually kind of cool one of the
problems with carrying around a battery
bank isn't you have to keep all the
cables that becomes a mess but this this
is pretty easy but if you have a
wireless charging pad not only can we
drop the charger on to start charging it
then it will pass current up to the
phone so essentially we have a chi
sandwich this is cool though this is
really cool I mean maybe not the most
practical thing but I can actually
imagine a scenario in which say you have
this by your bed you leave the battery
on it at all times you just drop your
phone on top and when it comes time you
take your phone but if you also want to
take the battery take it to super simple
as always links to everything I talked
about including those dopes Anheuser
headphones will be linked in the
description I'm curious what you guys
put in your smart phone starter kit let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
