episode of d3 live Jen wouldn't be
talking a little bit about why why why
you should or should not build yourself
a computer now I am good just recently
ordered Mike parts i'll be happy
starting my full computer build series
showing you exactly how to build and how
to pick your parts malecon stuff i'll be
beginning that next week but you can
consider this the unofficial beginning
of that and i want to talk about is
whether or not building a computer is
actually going to be right for you so
there's a lot of pros and cons about
building your own computer so i want to
talk a bit about that before you decide
whether or not that's the way you want
to go so the first thing i want to talk
about is some of the pros now there are
quite a few and when you build yourself
a computer you have total freedom over
the entire computer now let's say you're
big into gaming you want a really nice
GPU you want to really fast cpu that
kind of stuff let's say you're
individuating well you might want not
that big of a GPU but you might want to
spend that money instead on a nice cpu
you know big hard drives destroy your
video I mean there's a lot of different
pros and cons about you know like
building this computer compared to this
and all that kind of stuff but that's
one of the great things is you can
customize it as much as you like I know
another really great thing about
building your own computer a lot of
times is that's going to be cheaper than
what you might buy it you know your
local store I'm sure you could buy a
computer there and then you know add
some parts where typically once you do
that and get up to exactly what you want
it's going to be more expensive and it's
really not going to be as good
performing as what you would like so
building computers have a lot of its
pros on that site however on the con
side there are definitely some that you
do need to keep in mind now especially
if you really have no idea what you're
doing it can be a little bit of an
intimidating experience well it's not
like you need a ton of tools and years
of experience I mean it's not that
difficult most computer and when you
build a computer it's very simple you
put this into slot a you put four screws
in here you you know plug this wire into
that I me it's not extremely difficult
and it's certainly if you take a look
some of the guys of course I'll be
creating one and there are many other
others around the internet she can take
a look at you can figure out how to do
it pretty easily but there's always a
chance that you could you know cause a
problem example if you tried to put like
one part in the wrong slot or you try to
force something in a breaks or perhaps
you you know stock it with a little bit
static electricity or whatever there are
definitely some things that you do need
to keep in mind but overall
hold of it I think for most people if
you're wanting something really specific
like you know a gaming computer or
editing or for whatever reason bill you
know computer is a great way to go okay
so for the second segment of d3 live I
will be taking live questions from
everyone in the chat so as always every
episode of d3 life is filled in front of
a live audience on blog to be so we'll
go ahead and take some questions and
today I have a little bit of a special
guest house or Gwen introduce yourself
seven years old awesome and if you guys
ever come to d3 live live if you ever
watch the show live you'll know him he's
one of the ops the great ops in the chat
who keep everyone nice and orderly just
going to just take a couple of questions
I windows 2000 windows seven whew that's
a tough one windows 2000 is an excellent
armed key windows seven 'it's that's
that's no printer all right what is the
best case for a custom computer aha so I
think you're probably better at that
what are some of the cases that you
really like lately really nice gud mus1
antic I don't like the left boy here oh
you don't mean no just too much dust oh
ok they're good point yet about the
fractal design a lot of times they don't
have the greatest air flow though do
they I mean I don't I haven't actually
used to you myself but from the looks
they just don't look like they're really
too friendly to really good big gaming
rigs what do you think which one sx none
of the fractal design most of their
cases anyway well they do guy in there I
mean you can install two phantoms from
so ok you kinda have to do that when you
are going I act sounds good to me ok
let's hear should I be a video editing
computer is a core i7 2600 and 32
gigabytes of RAM um the processor looks
really good for video editing uh the GP
might be a little overkill but 32
gigabytes I don't know what do you say
cause I mean neak don't you think 32 is
a little bit overkill it's
little bit overkill I mean you would
just be fine with this 16 gig so or
maybe eight yeah I put a little too guy
in that extreme yeah I mean I I use
video editing on like I all of my video
editing is that like four gigs of ram I
you should have to me problems so 88 I
like eight yeah maybe 16 but 32 might be
a little bit much but force mean you do
everyone hello you edit 4k video I can
definitely see 32 actually buddy I and
either baby 16 32 yeah 60 yeah but all
right um can you install OS 10 now that
actually is a decent question what what
I'm sure they're asking is can you build
a computer that runs mac OS 10 an answer
is yes under certain situations so
unlike windows where you and of course
linux as well you basically install it
on whatever you want there's not a whole
lot of restrictions as long as you get
something that's you know made obviously
for windows which practically everything
is and you're good to go go over with OS
10 you basically need to do something
called a hackintosh now there are
several guides all around the internets
doing this you basically do have to pick
select parts not everything will work no
matter what I'm also do you have any
experience building a hackintosh yeah
see I never never built one myself ivan
but it is possible of course what the
best dubstep is just go online find a
guide to know exactly what parts and
what process and all that kind of stuff
but yet you absolutely can do it you
just did of course need to find the
correct parts and everything how
important is a good cooling system now
that's I think that question has your
name all over the hostler very important
of course I mean if you want to do
overclocking you shouldn't stick with
the stock cooler mm-hmm absolutely i
mean an itch 770 or age 15 is perfect i
wouldn't go for EK unless you're going
extreme absolutely another thing is case
fans like what what what is the general
like i know a lot of people like when
they buy cases like 10k spans like to
fill it up what do you think for like
most like moderately gaming computers
like how many fans do you think is a go
thing of course is bridging all the
different types of fans and everything
like that but what do you think is like
a good baseline that people should
support including the cpu cooler I think
about four or three for a normal game
system but for something high ends you
should go for way more maybe just to
maximum amount that will fit in the cage
absolutely sounds great so no guys
that's about it for this week's episode
of d3 life I had to give a big thanks to
hustle house if you want to give
yourself a shout out or tell anybody
where they can find you go ahead all
