today I'm here with the tablet wars now
I'm sure if you guys have been following
the news you'll see that tablets are
huge right now recently that Apple iPad
was announced on there's been the juju
Dell has the mini five and even HP has
their own slate
there's tons of tablets going on now so
I'm going to go ahead compare that all
of them what we know what we don't know
and what we think they're really going
to be all about so it should be pretty
interesting anyway let's get this one
started
so obviously the newest is definitely
the Apple iPad which was just announced
a couple days ago so let's go over that
now the first thing obviously is that
this has been the Apple tablets as
everyone's been going crazy over for a
long time but there's a lot of well not
everyone's exactly happy with it and
it's easy to see why there's a bunch of
big downsides no multi tasking that's
that's a pretty big deal it runs
basically iPhone OS and it really does
it's 3.2 and there's a few new features
in the iPads version but not likely we
brought it over to the iPhone and iPod
touch so it's really not a whole lot new
there either but that said we're
comparing it against other tablets not
the iPhone so that's not a such big deal
some of the big big pluses have got to
be that it's access to the app store all
of the over 140,000 iPhone and iPod
Touch apps are available on the iPad so
that's a big big plus the nine point
seven inch screen looks fantastic and
it's got a really nice resolution of
1024 by 768 now if you don't know what
that roughly means it's basically about
the size most monitors are a good amount
of monitors so you figure that that's
about the same resolution is
monitor that's that's pretty good for
just a small 9 inch tablet there are
also some more cons as well that a lot
of the others have such as USB ports all
it pretty much has is a 30 pin connector
just like on any iPod and really there's
no camera and there's no SD card storage
so there's a lot of bad things but
there's a lot of good things the iPad
will be launched in March sometime in
March probably late March or between 499
and 829 dollars depending on what size
we want 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage
and if you want 3G or not so the iPad
looks pretty solid okay so the next and
our tablet war has got to be the Jew
tube if you guys remember correctly the
juju was really talked about a lot and
people were right kind of excited it was
one of the first tablets and it
definitely was the first to be announced
well it's kind of gotten a little older
now still we're still waiting on it to
come out and in the meantime a lot of
other tablets that come out that said
the juju still has its perks probably
the best thing about it is just the look
of the device it really really looks
solid it has a 12.1 inch full capacitive
multi-touch screen which and well the
whole thing together actually is
personally I think is better-looking
than the iPad it's got a larger screen
less bezel looks like about the same
thickness and so it's a really nice
looking device unfortunately it's a
different kind of device rather its
tablet obviously but it really doesn't
have anything besides web browsing if
you guys know Chrome OS which should be
coming out by the end of the year the
juju runs something very similar there's
nothing else to it besides the Internet
we turn on it opens up the browser and
all you have instead of apps you just
have Web Apps which basically just
websites so really it doesn't have a
whole lot beyond just the web browser
that said all these tablets are going to
be mainly focused on the web
entirely bad thing unfortunately there
are a lot of legal problems with the
juju as well as the fact that it's the
same price as the iPad or at least the
same price base iPad a $500 so really
unless you really really really don't
like the iPad and you just think that
all you're ever gonna do is web browsing
I really don't think that you geez
probably be the right one but it's still
not a bad device and if you are only
doing web browsing it looks like one of
the best okay so the next tablet has got
to be the HP Slate the HP Slate actually
looks pretty impressive I got I got to
be honest it's going to be a 10 inch
full multi-touch capacitive screen just
like the rest but it's going to be a bit
different it's going to instead of
running like the iPhone OS or something
specifically for a tablet face you're
going to run for Windows 7 and that's
got a lot of benefits and a lot of
downsides the benefits obviously are
that it runs anything that our compute
with so it's a lot closer than to a
normal computer then you know something
like the iPad obviously you can pick any
browser you want obviously it's got
flash support and it's got support for
one of the thousands of thousands of
Windows programs and apps are out there
so you know that you're going to be
covered there but some of the downsides
are that Windows 7
while it's taking strides to be a better
Apple I'm sorry that better tablet
device it's still not made specifically
from tablets you know it's got a new
on-screen keyboard a lot of icons are
now bigger and easier to touch but it's
still an OS that's made for a keyboard
and for a mouse so you know you're going
to run into a lot of like smaller
dialogues and different things obviously
it's not going to be made to be a tablet
but the HP Slate does have a lot going
for it well we don't know all the specs
right now so I can't you know I don't
know we don't know battery life and some
other things like that but it does have
some cool features it has a camera which
is something the iPad doesn't it we
don't know for sure what processor is
going to run but most likely it's going
to be an Intel Atom which
just purely author the clock speed is
going to be quite a faster than iPad but
considering that they're running
different things and and a lot of other
things like Windows 7 is probably going
to be a lot bulkier than iPhone OS it's
going to kind of come down to once we
actually see them and actually use them
but I kind of got to give the edge the
atoms a pretty decent little chip so it
probably do pretty well anyway so the HP
Slate we don't know the price yet but
it's rumored to be five or six hundred
dollars once it comes out sometime later
in the year
now if seeing the slight for the sec
same price as the ipad on a lot of the
HP slate looks pretty impressive I like
the fact that I can run full Windows 7
on it but you know it might have some
downside so we'll have to just wait and
see ok so the last tablet we'll be
covering is a bit different than the
others and it is the dell mini 5 if you
know the dominie 5 it's almost less of a
full size tablet than it is maybe like
something along the lines of the very
large iPod touch it's also got some
different features like it actually
works as a phone although it still it's
5 inches so if you know it would be
pretty large but it does still function
as a phone but the dell mini 5 is should
be pretty cool the pre cool little
device it runs a custom dell version of
android 1.6 but they put their own
custom scan which looks quite nice it
uses a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor
which is a pretty powerful processor it
should you get the job done very nicely
um there's a lot of cool things like I
said it has a phone built-in and but the
main purpose of having 3g is to actually
use it as for web access so it's going
to be a smaller device it's not going to
be still not going to be pocketable but
it's going to be decent enough where you
know me it's not going to be large where
you need a bag whatever you know you can
have it you know plus it in a large
pocket maybe or like a linear bag or
something
he says but one of the really cool
things I like about the domine 5 is that
it runs Android and I think Android has
a lot of potential on tablets it you
know it has a lot of love apps putting
it to only second to the iPhone OS and
all these apps are going to run really
nice on the nice 5 inch screen um now is
good it's not going to be quite as good
compared with the screen obviously you
know if like the iPad you've got full
nice 10-inch screen if the djinns you've
got a 12 inch screen so going down to a
5 inch screen it's not going to be quite
as good of an Internet experience that
said though it's still going to be
pretty nice 5 inches is quite a bit
bigger than you know what you would
think of in like an iPhone or something
like that or a droid so the dell mini 5
has a lot of good things now one thing
we do not know is the price now people
personally I don't know why people have
been saying stuff like it's going to be
$1000 now if it was $1000 I wouldn't
look twice at it but I really don't see
whether they're coming from the mini 5
it's going to be a very small device
it's not like it's using anything
revolutionary it's using pretty much
standard parts so I don't see why I
should be needing more than three maybe
$400 but we'll see anyway guys that
those are my four tablets that I think
you definitely look for it's really hard
to pick a winner of considering that not
one of them are out yet so we're gonna
have to wait and see some hands on time
and actually start to use them a bunch
but looking at them now the iPad looks
pretty strong then shoot you could have
its niche but I don't really see it
really catching on the HP Slate looks
really really pretty good to me I mean I
like the idea of running full Windows 7
on a tablet and the Dell v5 could be a
bit of a different kind of animal but
really has a lot of potential I really
think it can be a good device and I guys
what do you think are you interested in
tablet computing are you are you
planning on maybe buying one of these
tablets this year or are you going to
white maybe wait until next year see how
all this plays out see what the markets
headed definitely let me know in the
comments anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
