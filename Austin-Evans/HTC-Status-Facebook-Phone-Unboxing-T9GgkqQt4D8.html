the HTC status so you guys may have
heard of this phone it's been talked
about in the everything for quite a
while it's mostly known as being a
Facebook phone is it's got a dedicated
Facebook button of course we'll take a
look at that and everything else but for
now let's just go ahead and jump right
on into the box so around the box
there's not a whole lot of anything I
just kind of highlight a few things
social networking touch screen QWERTY
keyboard but of course we're gonna find
out all about that now let's just open
it up welcome to AT&amp;amp;T little pamphlet
thing there we got some information
Quick Start Guide connect 18 to Wi-Fi
status like 18 T on Facebook and all
that kind of good stuff so here we go we
had the phone itself and of course we'll
take a look at that in a second yeah
talk some about that but for now let's
just get into what exactly comes in the
box so we can figure out how to pull
this now folds back and we have a
microUSB cable so we'll just open that
up later and we have a HTC AC adapter
also sat that side and that probably was
where the battery came in and we also
have a couple of other things limited
warranty SiC and regulatory guide all
the kind of fun stuff that you get when
you get a new phone anyway guys this is
the HTC status so wild got out here I'll
give you guys a little tour of it front
of course we have our speaker grille we
have our two point six inch I believe
this is yeah WVGA so that's gonna be 480
by 320 it's actually not a bad
resolution at all it's a little bit
smaller than what you might find on
something you'll brand new like a you
know super phone or whatever but of
course since there's a small phone it's
not gonna be a big a deal as of course
the screen is smaller if you have your
for Android capacitive touch buttons so
it's pretty much all Android phones you
also do have a couple of odd keys here
so you guys probably haven't seen these
in a while
but these are your send and your in keys
of course if you guys are well if you
guys bad so phone more than a couple
years old you know that all phones used
to have these so I'm definitely kind of
interested to see how it's going to be
with with a new phone with these we also
do have a full QWERTY keyboard and this
is not a slide or anything like that so
socially going to be kind of a unique
device there are definitely not a lot of
Android phones with another standard
keyboard like this and from first glance
this actually is a producing keyboard
there nicely
you guys can see there I mean you also
can see it's got kind of a little bit of
a bevel or it's a little bit curved so
Julie should be pretty interesting for
when you're in your honor on a call or
whatever get up to your ear might want
to contour a little better and of course
right here if you guys can see here if I
can Karen focus we do have a Facebook
button so I'll be have to definitely
test exactly how it works but from what
I know for me pretty much anywhere you
are and apps or whatever you can click
on that and allow you to instantly send
something to Facebook which is
definitely pretty neat I'm up here I do
believe we have a VGA front-facing
camera and in fact let's go ahead and
continue the tour here we do have not a
whole lot on this side now we do have a
lock button I believe and I'm not sure
what that little thing is perhaps it
might be a microphone and we do have a
3.5 millimeter audio in we do also have
a volume rocker there it's a little bit
small but I think it'll be just fine in
that micro USB port pulling nothing down
there except maybe a microphone or so
and we bet on around on the back here we
actually have a rather nice design so
you guys can see here a bit reminiscent
of some of HTC's the latest phone so
they've got a flash book that's a 5
megapixel camera it does have I believe
VGA no actually I don't actually know
what the video capability of this does
capture video but I'm not sure top that
up a little bit later you do have this
nice metal band which kind of gives it a
nice little look like I said it's very
similar to some of HTC's latest phones
we do have with HTC Sense certainly guys
well I've got this here let me run over
some of the specs it does have a
Qualcomm 800 megahertz processor so
certainly not anything brand new dual
core or anything blazing fast but since
this is not a high-end or incredible
phone certainly a maker just going to
get you by just fine in fact several
phones I've reviewed recently actually
have some fairly similar specs and no
problem as far as performance wise goes
it does run Android 2.3 Gingerbread
which I believe this is actually 18 T's
first phone with gingerbreads definitely
interested to see how Gingerbread works
on the smaller display I just have 512
megabytes of RAM and it does come with a
2 gigabyte microSD card slot which are
micro SD card rather which I'm sure is
somewhere I'd crack it open but I take
forever oh we also do have like I said
the 2.6 inch display of course Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and all that kind of good
stuff so anyway guys that's about it for
my unboxing of the HTC status also known
as the HTC ChaCha if you're from Europe
definitely stay tuned to the channel I
will be doing lots more coverage of the
phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
