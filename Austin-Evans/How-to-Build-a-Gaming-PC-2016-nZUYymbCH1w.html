to building your own computer it's
surprisingly easy and you still get all
the benefits of getting the exact PC you
want gives yourself a decent sized
workspace and I Phelps screwdriver and
we're good to go start by pulling the
case out of the box unscrew the side
panel and pop it off so we have some
room to work inside you'll find the
accessories like the hardware along with
the power supply this case comes with a
pre-installed but it's easy enough to do
yourself just make sure the fan is
pointed in the direction where it can
pull on air in this case it's mounted on
top but some pcs have it on bottom the
regards to slide it in and thence as
simple as using the four included screws
to tighten it down while we're here
guide the bag of hardware that came in
the case and pull out the small brass
standoffs sometimes these are
pre-installed but it's as simple as
screwing them in for whatever
motherboard you have in this case it's
micro ATX if you have any doubts you can
test fit the motherboard to measure
where the screws need to go here we need
six standoffs for now set the case aside
and pull out the motherboard it's
wrapped in an anti-static bag so be
careful to pull it out by grabbing it by
the plastic pieces and set it down on
the cardboard box there are also a few
accessories included that you'll need
like the SATA cables and i/o shield this
is installed in the rear of the case it
can be a little fiddly but just pop it
into place with the audio ports on
bottom before we continue let's take a
quick look around the motherboard
basically everything in the bill
connects here for example this gray
socket in the middle is where the
processor is installed to the right of
that of the RAM slots for memory and on
the bottom are the PCIe slots which is
where we'll be installing the graphics
card a bit later on on the bottom corner
you'll find two of the four SATA ports
to connect hard drives and SSDs most of
your ports are on the backside which
will be where you'll plug stuff in at
the rear of the case right beside the
RAM slots is the 20+4 pin connector
which delivers the main power for the
board there's also a smaller 4 pin
connector near the CPU socket which
provides power for the processor
speaking of let's crack open our CPU
inside you should find the processor
itself along with the heatsink and fan
this is essentially the heart of the
build and it's fairly fragile this AMD
chip has lots of delicate pins on the
back which you want to be careful with
if any of these get bent you're in
trouble if you look at the bottom of the
heatsink you'll see a thin layer of
thermal paste this is fine to use as is
for this build but try not to touch it
before applying pull the lever by the
socket back and find the tiny gold
triangle on the corner of the CPU this
matches a corresponding triangle on the
socket so gently set the
processor down and pull the lever to
lock it into place now it's time to
install the heatsink
set it down square on the processor and
for AMD there's a latch to press down
that locks everything in place
grab the four pin fan connector and
connect it to the CPU power on the
motherboard and that's it the CPU is
installed and we're ready to move on now
grab the memory this is super easy to
install you'll see a notch about
two-thirds down this is what you want to
line up on the slot on the motherboard
and firmly press into place until it
clicks that's all there is to it now
it's time to grab the case and drop the
motherboard in on the brass standoffs we
installed earlier just make sure all the
ports are properly lined up with the i/o
shield around back grab the small screws
out of the bag of hardware that came
with the case and screw the board into
place starting at the corners and making
sure you tighten the board down nicely
flip the computer back upright and we're
well on our way to having a working
gaming PC next up let's install our SSD
since this is smaller than a normal hard
drive you want to mount it to the bottom
of the case instead of using one of the
drive cages but you've got plenty of
room to install multiple drives in this
case now it's time to start cabling
first up grab the cable running from the
rear fan and plug it into the system fan
header on the motherboard next you
should find a four pin CPU connector
from the power supply hook it up to the
motherboard on the top left
next grab the long 20+4 pin cable and
plug that into the corresponding
connector on the board while we're here
let's power the SSD which has two
connectors on the end
grab a SATA cable from the power supply
and hook it up using the larger of the
two ports on the drive next there's the
SATA data cable that came with the
motherboard
you'll see it as a notch on one end so
it only goes in one way hook one into
the cable into the motherboard SATA port
and the other into the SSD it's as
simple as that going back to the cables
inside the case you should see an AC 97
and HD audio connector grab the HD audio
and plug it into the matching plug on
the board
you'll also see a USB cable for the
front ports on the case it's the same
story here and as before it only goes in
one way thanks to a knocked out pin
along the bottom you'll also find the
front panel connectors these are a bit
fiddly but they're marked on the board
as well as in the manual just plug these
in individually make note of which side
is positive and negative it's easy to
mix up so if you have any problems
turning the PC on later this is a great
place to double-check grab your
screwdriver and remove the two PCI slots
on the back of the case to make room for
the graphics card like the motherboard
this comes in an anti-static bag and
while it isn't incredibly sensitive
you should still handle it by the
plastic instead of the board this is
fairly small card but they're typically
pretty similar you'll find your video
outputs on the rear and the PCI
connector on the bottom which connects
into the motherboard slide it into the
top slot on the board until it clicks
into place then screw it in to keep
things secure most power supplies have a
6-pin pci II power connector by since
this doesn't we'll need a molex to PCI
adapter molex might be a weird-looking
connector but it'll get the job done
connect two cables into the adapter and
then plug it into the six pin on the
graphics card and it's powered and ready
to go at this point we're nearly done
especially with a budget bulb like this
cables aren't going to be the neatest
thing in the world but don't worry about
that just yet
grab a monitor mouse and keyboard and
plug everything in if all is good it
should come right to life when you hit
the power button if not unplug and run
through your cables and connections to
make sure everything is right if it
doesn't automatically go to the BIOS hit
delete or f9 on the keyboard to quickly
run through to make sure everything is
present and working correctly as long as
everything looks good you can turn it
off and clean up what cables you can and
you'll be ready to throw a copy of
whatever operating system you'd like on
it Congrats did you build yourself a
gaming PC if you need any more info on
the parts I used I did a video about
that as well as the performance if you
guys enjoyed this tutorial definitely
consider subscribing for more videos
like this even guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
