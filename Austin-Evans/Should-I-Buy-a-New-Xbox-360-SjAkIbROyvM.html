the new Xbox 360 was just announced this
morning at e3 I'm so guys I'm gonna go
ahead and answer a question I'm sure a
lot of you guys are asking should you
buy it or in addition should you buy any
Xbox 360 so guys I'm gonna go ahead and
help you decide if you have a Wii of
PlayStation 3 if you already have an
xbox 360 guys there's a lot of different
you know things about this so I'm going
to go ahead and try to help you guys out
okay so the first one I'm just gonna go
ahead and tell you guys a little bit
about Kinect as well as the new Xbox 360
and in case you were wondering guys the
new Xbox 360 that is actually the name
it's not Xbox 360 slim or anything else
it is officially the new Xbox 360 and
likewise this Xbox 360 that they've been
selling for about five years almost now
is now called the original Xbox 360 so
no new names or anything it's just the
original one and the new one pretty
simple than that and remember I guess
guys so the newest box 360 will be on
sale within the week they did not give
an actual day they said that they were
shipping them to stores right now so
probably yeah guys within a week or so
so it will be very very soon um some of
the new features are that it will be
thinner not dramatically so but it will
be thinner and not quite as tall I'm so
guys you can see in the pictures here
it's an improvement um it's kind of hard
to get an exact sense of how much
smaller it is but guys you know it's
nice huge deal as big as the Xbox 360 is
it's you know you should still be able
to find a room for it it's not big deal
but what is a big deal is that it looks
like they have improved the cooling and
the reliability yes guys finally no more
red rings a prior other place with blue
rings not good but no so guys um the new
one has a lot better cooling on the CPU
and GPU are combined on one chip
basically what that means guys is that
there's a lot you know if you look at it
inside like a normal Xbox you know what
puts off the heat is obviously the CPU
and GPU well those are both separate
things and they're quite large well now
they both been put onto the same guy and
they're much smaller so guys this should
result in much much cooler before
which hopefully will result in better
lot reliability it also has 802 dots in
I'm sorry 802 dot 11 in Wi-Fi so you
guys already have Wi-Fi built in and has
a 250 gig hard drive which should be
pretty good especially because they say
it is removable so it's not going to be
you know like the normal hard drive you
can't take these hard drives you will
have to get a special connector to sync
your data from your old one to the new
Xbox 360 but still it's not that big of
a deal
there's also Kinect Kinect is the motion
control you should be called natal and
basically what it's about is that it
will you know track you I won't get into
the whole deal but I will tell you guys
the pricing on the pricing is $150 which
is a lot of money and that's half the
price the console but you do get some
pretty cool stuff and if you're
interested you can get for a little bit
cheaper so once it's released I believe
I said November 4th once it's released
you go ahead and be able to get in a
combo pack with the new Xbox 360 what
looks like to be $400 so guys you're
gonna save a little bit of money but
it's still gonna be quite a bit on that
guy's want to say this about Kinect they
do not actually announce it but I got
several places such as Game Stop
eventually you know showed it off and
you're actually listed on their websites
how much they are so it's a pretty good
indicator although it's not a hundred
cent official so guys now let's go ahead
and quickly go over should you buy it so
guys it depends okay you're gonna be
probably in one of three categories the
first one is do you have a Wii or a
Playstation 3
yeah if you have a Wii the Xbox 360 is
probably a good match especially the new
one you know it will of course still
play the same games so you can still
play call of duty and play Halo and play
Gears of War
Mass Effect a lot of the really really
good Xbox games you can of course play
now you know it's gonna be a really good
fit especially if you know your teenager
older because that's generally where
that the bulk of Xbox 360 gamers are so
if you have a Wii the new Xbox 360 is
probably something you should go for if
you have a ps3 however you probably will
not want to buy the new Xbox 360 you
know it might have a few new features
but really guys if you have a
Playstation
three you gotta play I mean almost all
the games are shared between them they
look very similar some look a little bit
better on PlayStation some will look a
little bit better than Xbox but really
guys if you already have a PlayStation 3
unless you really want play maybe Halo
or some one of the Xbox 360 exclusives I
would go ahead and just pass on your
your console just fine as is you already
have Xbox 360 well it's kind of hard to
say it's really gonna be up to you if
you maybe have like an early console so
maybe you got one in 2005 doesn't six
doesn't seven maybe the first few years
of it you've still got it still working
you might want to consider it those
models are constantly getting red rings
I know mine does as well that one should
be much much more reliable so guys if
you have an older Xbox you might
consider it because if you just bought
one maybe you bought one past few months
maybe in the past year or two
go ahead stick with it guys I mean
unless Wi-Fi is a huge deal or unless
you're already getting red rings go
ahead stick with it guys it's not a huge
upgrade you're just working right now go
ahead and stick with it I mean Kinect
will still work with the normal Xbox 360
all your games will look identical on
both consoles it's not going to be a big
difference it's mostly just if you have
an older one and it's about - don't you
know die you know I have this one it's
already gotten to red rings lately if it
gets a third one it's gonna cost me a
bunch of money to fix I might get the
new one but guys this one works just
fine that's a little bit noisy but it's
not a huge of a deal to me so I'm
probably gonna stick with mine
but anyway guys definitely let me know
in the comments what do you think about
the new Xbox 360 are you interested in
getting one this finally gonna get you
in to get into getting Xbox 360 or maybe
are you just happy with your PlayStation
or your Wii or maybe your original Xbox
360 definite let me know in the comments
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
