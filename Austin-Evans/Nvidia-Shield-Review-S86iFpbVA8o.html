here with a review of the Nvidia shield
now the shield is an interesting mix of
a game console and a way for nvidia to
show off Tegra 4 but the question is is
it for you
take one look at the shield and you'll
realize it's big really big the best way
to describe it is to throw a folding
screen onto an Xbox 360 controller and
call it a day and that's not really a
bad thing it has nearly all the same
buttons as the Xbox controller and
because of that it feels rock-solid when
gaming my only minor complaint is that
the home and back buttons are a little
too easy to accidentally bump while
gaming but everything else from the
triggers to the thumb sticks feel
console-quality that's good because the
trade-off is that it's really too big to
be pocketable easily an Nvidia even
sells a carrying case for it so you can
toss it in a bag it's not something I'd
really worry about though the shield is
well-built and feels like I could take
some abuse even though it's basically
all plastic its sturdy with no crashing
there flex anywhere and it does have a
definite heft to it that's mostly to do
with the big battery inside which makes
it a bit heavier than I'd like but it
really wasn't a big deal the hinge for
the screen is also solid which is I'll
get into in a minute is more important
than you might think there are lots of
nice little touches around the device
including an LED to show when it's
charging the shield logo on the power
adapter and USB cable and the
interchangeable shields or tags as
Nvidia calls them it comes with a silver
one which attaches neatly with magnets
however you can customise your shield
with other tags it's a nice little touch
but too bad they cost 20 bucks each
something I didn't realize until I got
it is that there's a fan to keep the
Tegra 4 cool along with a pair of vents
you can't hear normally unless you're in
a very quiet room and it does do a good
job of keeping the shield cool it also
comes with a stereo speakers which are a
lot better than most phones and tablets
and do a great job when gaming listening
to music or watching video
rounding out the hardware you'll find a
mini HDMI which will even work over 4k
micro USB for charging a headphone jack
and a micro SD card slot
unfortunately the shield only comes with
16 gigabytes of internal storage and you
can't use the microSD card to store
games just yet although it should be
coming soon the screen comes in at 5
inches with a 1280 by 720 resolution and
it's
pretty good 1080p would just be a strain
for gaming and the panel gets nice and
bright with good color and contrast
however considering the size of the
shield I feel like they could have made
it a bit bigger there's no camera at all
which really isn't a problem for me but
you will find a microphone for using
apps like Google now the main reason the
shield exists I feel is for Nvidia to
demo what Tegra 4 is capable of and it
is definitely capable inside we're
looking at a quad core cortex a15 setup
clocked at 1.9 gigahertz with a v low
powered core 72 core GPU and 2 gigabytes
of RAM in normal use it absolutely
screams I've never seen Android running
as smoothly before which is awesome to
see the benchmarks back this up it
easily Cleaves the fastest phones and
tablets I've ever tested which is
exactly what I want to see in a gaming
device there are three main ways to game
on the shield the first or native
Android games and while the selection is
hardly anything amazing there are
definitely some good games in here
shadow gun is a good example of a game
that's made to take advantage of Tegra 4
as well as use the physical controls and
with Google Play games real-time
multiplayer is actually pretty seamless
and fun for games like Riptide GP the
only problem is that a lot of games are
made to work for a touchscreen only and
it gets awkward holding the shield by
the screen although it is definitely
nice that the hinge can't hold the
weight of the handheld where it gets
more tricky is with games like temple
run which has to be used in portrait
which is nearly unplayable since it runs
basically stock Android 4.2 you can also
use any other Android app you like which
is a huge plus over something like a 3ds
or Vita however a lot of things are a
bit weird to use in landscape the second
way to play games with the shield is
with emulators put simply this is the
killer app for me as we've got plenty of
power to emulate everything from the NES
to the Nintendo DS on here I can never
really get behind playing old console
games with virtual keys on phones and
tablets but the shield has all the
buttons you need for playing even ps1
and n64 games the huge catalog of
awesome older titles you can play is
basically enough to keep me busy with
the shield
lastly you can stream PC games this
requires you to have a gaming PC with an
NVIDIA GTX 650 or better which limits
you to only be using a new Nvidia card
but if you've got one it's a
sweet deal not all games will work but
it's a surprisingly seamless experience
dishonored ran smoothly with only the
occasional hiccup and practically no lag
which was awesome
the shield streams everything over Wi-Fi
so you'll want to make sure you have a
decent dual band router as well as stay
within 10 to 20 feet of it to keep a
good signal the quality is really
impressive though instead up is almost
entirely automatic the only problem I
had was with Metro last light which
while a supported game ran at a poor
frame rate even at 720p with the
power-hungry CPU cores and a fan to run
battery life was really impressive
thanks to that huge 73 50 milliamp hour
battery I was able to get five to six
hours of mixed Android and emulator use
and slightly more when streaming PC
games the shield is an interesting
device it's by far one of the best ways
to play games on Android especially if
they are able to use the physical
controls being able to stream games from
the PC is a nice feature it's well built
has good battery life and is absolutely
screaming fast unfortunately it's going
to run you with steep $300 and because
of the design of the shield of a game
isn't made to take advantage of physical
controls it's going to get awkward to
hold and if you don't have a new Nvidia
card in your PC the game string is going
to be a no-go it might not be perfect
and the cheaper Nexus 7 is probably a
better choice for a lot of people but if
you're looking for a badass little game
console the shield is absolutely worth a
look however what do you guys think
would you go for the shield would you
prefer something like the 3ds or Vita
