use the first am I must have mac app
series now the app will going to be
starting with today is cinch now as many
of you guys know I recently did pick
myself up a mac and while there's a lot
that I do like about it was 10 the
window management is definitely not part
of it so of course you do have some
things so for example you can use launch
control other mission control launch
control on not quite the same thing but
of course you can use Mission Control to
kind of organize your windows and go
into different spaces and well that
works for some things sometimes I just
want to have a really simple way of
getting my windows the right size
without happen to manually resize and
that's what a cinch comes in cinch is a
paid program basically it is seven
dollars normally I believe it's about
four dollars right now on sale for the
next couple days on the Mac App Store
and if you don't want to just buy it you
can go ahead and get the free trial
however i will mention that the free
trial will pop up at you all the time
saying hey you want license hey everyone
license it I definitely gets annoying
but let me just show you guys what's
inches all about so it's very very
similar to what arrow snap is to windows
so if I want to resize this window we
put on the right side BAM if I want to
take another this text edit and make it
fill up the left side just put it over
the corner and it's just as simple as
that and again if I want to maximize
something you push it up to the top and
it will automatically resize there it's
a very simple very easy little things
nothing all that complicated believe
it's about a megabyte but it is
absolutely very very helpful and I
couldn't see myself using OS 10 without
it it's one of the top things I love
about Windows so again if you guys are
interested definitely sure to pick it up
soon because it is going to be going up
to seven dollars you can try the free
trial and I recommend doing that before
you buy it but you won't want to use a
free trial for long because like I said
it pops up all the time asking you to
license it anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely surely a thumbs up
and if you're interested in more mac
