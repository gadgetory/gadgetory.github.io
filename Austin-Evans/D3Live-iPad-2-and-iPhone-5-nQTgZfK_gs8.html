another episode d3 live so today we're
going to be talking about some of the
new rumors and some of the new
information we've got about the iphone 5
as well as the ipad 2 and now of course
Apple products are you know always
really huge and it looks like this
year's gonna be really good for apples
I've got a lot of really cool things in
store for us with the iPhone the iPad so
since the iPad will be coming out before
the iphone let's let's start with it so
a lot of the rivers and you know the
speculation everything has been talking
about that it will have a better screen
and i absolutely believe this your ipad
has a pretty nice screen the current one
but i definitely think they will be
upgraded in the next generation now as
far as the screen size goes i think
they'll probably stay the same if not
maybe just slightly tweaked but i think
it'd be pretty much the same well what
should change is the resolution so a lot
of people will be saying that it's gonna
get the retina display which of course
would be kind of ridiculous and size the
ipad i just got to put it into
perspective you know I would have
resolution higher than you know the LED
cinema display which is over thousand
dollars just to the screen so while it
will be retina display I do think it
will be improved and shouldn't look a
lot clearer and crisper and so moving on
to a couple of other things the ipad 2
also should get both front and rear
facing cameras it's pretty you know
pretty safe bet is there i'm going to
addition to that i think it will also go
ahead and get an SD card slot so this is
gonna be really huge especially for
people like me who do a lot of pictures
and video to actually go ahead and not
need a dongle or anything like that to
plug in deal with that but just go ahead
and take your camera memory card your SD
card and just slide it straight into the
ipad you know go ahead and pull all your
pictures and video off very simply i
think it'll be a really really nice
thing now in addition to that i also do
things that they will be doing a couple
of things internally so it should be a
little bit thinner it should be a little
bit you know the maybe the bezel might
be shrunk there are a few things they
should bow they will be tweaking as
always with every redesign but another
thing is that hopefully we'll have the
new apple 85 or AAA or whether they
decided call it but hopefully it will
have a new dual core processor so of
course the current iphone ipad and ipod
touch all has the apple a4 chip which is
very competent yes it's pretty fast
however with the ipad 2 more than
they will have a dual core processor so
just you know put put very simply this
means that it is going to be much faster
going to be able to go through video
faster it's going to be able to be
snappier overall just going to be a
better pretty much everything including
battery life so with anything up we will
it will be able to you know watch 1080p
video perhaps you can edit 1080p video
because I do believe they will get
iMovie finally and I just kind of put it
all together I really think that would
be a great thing for people again like
me just because this is here kind of
what I've been thinking about and I
think would make a lot of sense whether
the ipad 2 can be a really good tool for
people who do mobile photo editing
especially video editing because with
the SD card slot you can take it
straight off your camera i'll put on
your ipad and then go ahead and add it
with the dual core cpu and either I
movie or some other app maybe it's like
a photo shops type at now don't expect
full Photoshop or anything but you have
some really cool photo and video apps
will allow you to do everything certain
my iPad in addition the ipad 2 also
seems to be set to have incant stretchy
capabilities so you should be able to
blend by the current of the standard
Wi-Fi version which of course will do
pretty well for a lot of people however
the 3g version should be compatible with
both gsm and cdma networks so it's going
to be a hybrid baseband chip which just
you know put simply would be able to
allow you to go ahead and use it both on
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon as well as many many
carriers globally so this would be
really cool you don't have to like the
current iphone for you not to buy one
for this carrier that carrier should be
able to buy one iPad and use it on
multiple characters so overall I think
the ipad 2 is going to be a really
really solid tablet really going to be a
really just nicely done especially a lot
of these rumors are just going to go
ahead and tighten up what is already an
excellent package now let's go to move
on to the second half which is the
iphone 5 now the iphone 5 abortion
that's attentive name they very well
might call the iphone 5g or what but are
they gonna call but the next-generation
iphone should be a pretty sizable
upgrade so foresters going to be near
the verizon iphone 4 in the current
iphone 4 however probably june july the
same kind of time frame they always do
we should go ahead and see the brain
new iphone and with it you should have
an all new redesign so why did touch on
the up with the ipad 2 but i do think it
does apply is it some people have been
saying that apple actually might remove
the home button now to me this seems a
little bit not 107 sold on this as i
think that you know the home button is
what really apples really focused on
it's really clean elegant however what a
lot of people the rumors been saying is
that they will remove the home button in
the ipad mini iphone with something like
a touch sensitive part of the bezel
where you can just touch it you won't
see a physical button but it will go
ahead and register again i don't really
want to say whether this is going to
happen or not cuz honestly I'm a little
skeptical but this is very possible to
go ahead and see this on the iPhone and
the iPad so we'll have to see anyway
going ahead and focusing a little bit
more on the iPhone itself we should see
an Alden wheezes redesign perhaps going
ahead and getting rid of the standard
30-pin dock connector and replacing it
with a micro USB port for both charging
and syncing now this would be kind of
unique there's never really been an
iphone that didn't have the 30-pin dock
connector there could be some problems
especially when you know using a lot of
third party accessories such as docks
and everything like that now however
this could also open up some different
things such as allowing you to go ahead
and use it you know pretty much is the
standard for all phones and all that
kind of stuff so let's say about that
but moving on to some of the more
important things i do believe it's to
keep the same size screen they might
change the retina display a little bit
but to be honest i don't think there's
going to be a whole other they can
update the overall phone i wouldn't be
surprised if they change the antenna
design even more perhaps they just scrap
it all together or they kind of get some
kind of nice integrated antenna but will
I say about that now moving on to the
internals of the phone it should
hopefully have the Apple a5 or whatever
they decide to call it the dual-core
chip from the ipad i have this of course
all the same benefits the juice find in
the ipad should go and bind their way
over to the iphone should be a lot
faster should be able to do a lot more
things perhaps even recording 1080p
video using the back-facing camera in
addition to this also with any luck it
might actually have a full
high-definition front-facing webcam so
you know when you're using Skype or
FaceTime whatever you actually go ahead
and do this
high definition so that's pretty much it
all the rumors and all this everything
we know about the iphone and ipad the
next generations okay so for the second
segment of d3 live i'm taking live
questions for everyone in the check so
as always every episode III line is
filmed in front of a live audience we've
got a lot of people I feel a record
amount of people on here today so I just
take some questions okay is it all right
is it for sure about the SD card slot on
the ipad 2 well no i want to say this
upfront nothing is for sure and she'll
Steve Jobs walks up on stage says here's
the new iPad or here's a new iphone so
take all the stuff the stuff I said
stuff you hear online everything take it
with a grain of salt however from what
I've heard from what everyone has heard
I think there's a pretty good likelihood
of seeing an SD card slot on the iPad to
do I think I bet you will have a 7 inch
version one do I think it will be
cheaper as far as a 7 inch version no
Steve Jobs is going on record as saying
that 7-inch tablets you gotta change
your fingers down to use them they're
too small I don't necessarily agree with
that but just based on that alone I
don't think we'll be seeing a smaller
iPad as far as a cheaper version that's
kind of up in the air I don't think I
think that will always be just be that
one standard my laughing can be able to
get like an iPad and iPad that you know
doesn't have features a writer I think
they'll always just kind of keep stick
with teams you know the single kind of
ipad it's part of the price goes mmm I
don't know I can see them may be
lowering the price a little bit from
what the current iPad costs but if they
do it won't be that much um Dustin here
do I think the iphone will come to
sprint and t-mobile uh you know I really
hope so now that they go ahead and you
know got rid of exclusivity in the
United States I definitely do think that
the door is open for the iphone to
spread to more carriers now or for
sprint I think it would be fairly easy
there's already a cdma and same goes for
tmobile you know technically they could
do it without any major issues but we'll
just have to wait and see I think a lot
of it's not going to come down to
whether or not they can make an iphone
who will do it that's going to come more
to how they can negotiate and you know
how much the carriers will pay to get
the iphone is it possible to unlock a
verizon iphone for sprint now you know I
really that's kind of a hard question I
bet should we try to look into it a
little bit but I'm not a real big
expert in to cdma networks for what I
can tell I don't really think it will be
just because I don't believe that sprint
watch Lee accept it now do keep mind
that I might be totally wrong so you
know it's best to do your own research
for that but when I know I don't think
you actually be able to unlock a verizon
iphone right but we will see well I bet
have a Retina display oh yeah I kind of
talked about that just a little bit
earlier it will have a better display
now I don't think they will call it
Retina display and I think it will
technically be a Retina display however
it will be a better display will look
crisper clear and be higher resolution
is I bet you're going to have a home
button again I kind of talked about a
little bit about this in the main video
personally I think it will I I can see I
mean if it doesn't I won't be totally
surprised but if I had to make a bet
whether it will or won't I'm going to
say it will because well you know having
no buttons and being really minimalistic
is definitely very you know that's how
Apple Lux to do it I think that a home
button makes sense and I think that if
they decide to remove it that's fine but
my money's on it stay or it remaining
well the ipad to have a touch screen yes
well the Sprint iPhone before genie well
actually that kind of brings up a good
question now as far as when or if we'll
see a sprint iphone that's come hard to
tell but as far as when the iphone will
get 4G is actually a good question that
i did not get to mention they're
actually i don't think the iphone the
next one that will be coming out the
iphone 5 what are we going to call we'll
be getting 4g anytime soon now i can
definitely understand this if you go
back to when the original iphone came
out it did not have 3g and that was at a
time where 3g was pretty much everywhere
I mean was not like if some brand new
tech cutting-edge technology mean 3g was
pretty much everywhere but one of the
main reasons that Apple is going to be
holding back on 4g partial is just
because of the technical you know it
takes a little bit more it's just not
quite as new or as a proven technology
but the major thing is that it actually
takes a lot more battery life so anyone
has ever used in evo 4g and HTC evo 4g
on sprint can definitely a test 4g eats
up battery is really fast and until the
technology is there to keep that bad
rating and just keep it from blowing
through your battery ineffable hours I
don't think apple is actually going to
go for the 4g networks
I don't think the iphone five will have
an SD card slot as far as iphone 5 no i
don't think so i don't really see that i
think this probably much is going to be
remaining on the ipad 2 ipad you have a
back facing camera yeah i think the ipad
she will have both the front and rear
facing camera as far as what qualities
will they obey whether it be 720p or
1080p same goes for the front-facing
camera on that Harrison sure but I would
be out strongly believe that we will at
least have a front and rear facing
camera some quality on the ipad 2 don't
think that they're going to have 4.3
firmware come out at the apple event i'm
actually if you guys have been following
you know the farmers and everything iOS
4.3 the bases have just started coming
out believe the first day that came out
a few days ago I believe that will be
what the verizon iphone will come with
so when we have it next februari either
this Cobra where attempt I think that
februari tip will probably be februa
attempt on or around that day will be
when iOS 4.3 comes out so no I don't
think that they're having a special
event or anything like that think you'll
just come out just like any other
firmware update but ipad 2 or motorola
xoom in my opinion which is better
that's a good and difficult question now
how little boy get a hands-on in the
motorola xoom at CES last week you guys
to check my chance you want out you know
i see that video um I like the motorola
xoom a lot that is a really really good
tablet I mean it has the new gingerbread
OS Android which is really really nice I
mean I was really not expecting it to
anything like that but Google is really
done a great job of redesigning the
whole thing to make it look really
really solid so as far as I go I am
really impressed with the zoo I actually
can't wait to get my hands on that to
test that out because that's going to be
excellent now let's part of the ipad 2
um it's a little we don't know quite as
much about it you know i don't remember
like we don't really know exactly what
features I'm again like I said earlier
all this stuff well I think it's pretty
likely take it all with a grain of salt
there's a pretty good chance that one or
two things might not be a hundred
percent accurate so based on that it's
kind of hard to say um from what i know
i think the zoom is going to be really
good but the ipad is just such a just a
tremendous success i think even with
these incremental updates apple still
gonna do really well with it so maybe we
guys that's it for this
