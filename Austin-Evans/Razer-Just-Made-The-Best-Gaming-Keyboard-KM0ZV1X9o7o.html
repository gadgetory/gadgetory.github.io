familiar with the wonderful wonderful
sound of a mechanical keyboard over the
last few years mechanical keyboards have
absolutely taken over the gaming market
and for good reason know when they first
came out they were very very expensive
but now on Amazon you can pick up
something like this for 40 bucks no no
you're not going to have any of the
bells and whistles but importantly
you're still going to be getting the
sound and you're also going to be
getting that feedback like I just had to
type on it to give you sort of an idea
of the sound the feedback kind of on you
so when Razer drops off a box with their
brand-new keyboard and all in the
mechanical switches I've got an it I'm
definitely curious cat Phil awesome so
this is the eraser huntsmen now it's a
little bit different with this keyboard
the idea that's got an opto mechanical
switch the main difference between this
and a standard mechanical switch is that
it opposed to when you press the button
and you're actually pressing a little
sort of physical button on the bottom of
the switch instead when you hit that key
there's a beam of light that's going in
to cross so once it starts to depress it
actually cuts off that beam of light
which immediately sends a signal from
the keyboard to your computer that that
key has been hit and because razor is
Razer they had to go completely over the
top with this a giant model of what the
actual switch looks like I've already
seen this and it is totally and
completely ridiculous I mean just look
at this
so for scale this is what the real
switch looks like versus the giant
massive switch that they provided so
this is actually 3d printed but it does
give you a good idea of how the switch
works so as you press this down it
breaks that beam of light and as soon as
that light is broken it will send an
immediate signal so you don't have to
wait for the spring to compress you
don't have to wait for the button to go
and fully depress itself and you also
don't have to wait for any sort of
built-in delay to sort of avoid any kind
of double presses it's actually a really
cool design and it sounds cool so the
switch comes in two models right now the
standard Huntsman as well as the
Huntsman elite now the main difference
here really isn't to do with the actual
key switches but this guy is going to
have a couple of extra features like
some media keys as well as a wrist rest
so if we pop this guy open it's going to
be the same size keyboard you still get
all of your number
but you've got your hmm you've got your
full RGB wrist rest Mele is this guy
going to be patted to give you a little
bit of extra comfort when you're typing
but it also does have full RGB underglow
which especially when you pair it with
the very RGB of five huntsmen it's gonna
look kind of ridiculous now that is some
RGB action so we attach the wrist rest
which should all be magnetic here we're
gonna get the under blow as well
can we actually kill the lights yeah
that is so cool so especially with the
LED under goal as well as every single
key being fully RGB that looks do the
way this works is similar to the bloody
keyboard and that what you've still got
the nice responsiveness and you still
have that nice click you're also not
having to deal with any sort of lag or
latency that has to do with actually
pressing a physical button all you do is
press the key down hard enough to sort
of block that beam of light and you're
gonna be good to go no reason is
actually not the first to making a key
switch like this
the bloody switch has been around for a
little while and my bloody switch sounds
like a really bad name it is a very
similar concept except that razor is
sort of taking it to the next level at
least in theory with stuff like adding a
stabilizer bar which if I bring up our
super hopeful model is this bar right
here which will help the switch from
sort of leaning either side when you
actually press it so for example I press
it on the edge versus in the middle it
should still feel the exact same so
razor quote a ton of really nerdy specs
like how this is supposedly 30% faster
at response time versus a standard
clicky switch and you've got a very
light 45 grams of actuation force but I
really care about is how it actually
feels to use you actually I've got to
say that this does feel pretty decent so
supposedly you're cutting up to 20
milliseconds of delay off by using this
key switch as opposed to a standard
mechanical and while I really can't
judge that for myself it does feel
pretty much instant I mean when you
press a key it is right there now there
are some other things that you're not
losing here as opposed to a standard
mechanical switch obviously you got the
sound if you got the feedback it is a
little bit of a lighter touch so a lot
of mechanical key switches sort of feel
like you're kind of pressing down on it
until it finally compresses whereas this
is sort of very light to the touch but
honestly I don't hate it at all it is a
kind of a nice sort of different feel
now there are a couple of major
differences between the Huntsman and the
Huntsman elite so on the smaller side
you're going to be getting media
controls on the elite
as well as a digital dial which can you
can use for volume or other features on
the computer but the wrists dress is
going to be the big one now it's
actually pretty well designed it is
going to be attached with magnets as
well as these poco pens and right now it
does require you to use a second USB
port from the keyboard to be able to
power this guy and send data but because
you do have that full RGB control in
theory you could actually attach
different accessories to the keyboard so
say something like a maybe a wireless
mouse a pad or a wireless charger for
your phone or something it could be
attached with these pogo pins in the
future oh wow that actually feels pretty
good so it definitely does help that I'm
playing on a high refresh rate monitor
like 120 frames per second what I mean
there actually is I don't it's hard to
say could be placebo I'll totally admit
but it does feel like the responsiveness
actually is pretty much right there
I don't know I'm actually kind of
curious to see how big of a difference
this is compared to a normal mechanical
keyboard now this is definitely not a
scientific test but I'm going to put the
$40.00 mechanical keyboard side-by-side
with the razor to see if I can actually
tell any kind of real difference so
because we do have the high refresh rate
monitor hopefully that should sort of
take any other latency out of the way
and obviously the mouse is quick but can
actually see a difference here because I
do feel like there's a legitimate chance
this could be placebo right but it feels
like the razor does cut down a little
bit of latency oh dude you would date
the razor actually does feel a little
bit faster wow that's actually kind of
surprising I will say though that I
definitely do like the way the razor
switches feel it's sort of at least for
my personal preference it feels about
right with the level of clicking this as
well as how light it is I don't like
something that's going to be like I've
got to really shove it down to actually
get any kind of click on it now mind you
I'm not trying to say that everyone
should go drop your $40 amazon special
and spend 150 or 200 dollars on a razor
keyboard but I will say it does actually
feel like there is a real difference and
besides that you are still getting stuff
like the RGB chroma stuff you're getting
a nice feeling keyboard and also getting
something that honestly I feel like kind
of looks pretty nice too especially if
you want to fully customize the lighting
but
that's nice I'm kind of surprised I
actually didn't think it would be a
noticeable difference at $150 for the
razor Huntsman and $200 for the elite
with the wrist rest it definitely
doesn't come cheap but if you're looking
for the ultimate gaming keyboard 2018
this actually kind of feels like it's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
