great year for smartphones but it's time
to kick off 2018 right with the new view
10 this video is sponsored by honor so
I've had the chance to check out the
view 10 just a little bit early last
year was all about pushing phone designs
to the next level and introducing AI
with smart features like a camera that
can actually figure out what you're
taking pictures of as well as smart
battery management that's a big part of
the view 10 with a cure in 970 processor
with a dedicated neural processing unit
you're actually going to be able to get
some pretty impressive AI features with
this guy so if we crack open the box
here we see the phone itself and
actually a pretty nice looking shade of
blue you can also get the enormous power
brick so this is not actually going to
be us spec so I imagine that ours might
be a little bit smaller up here but the
idea is it with supercharged you're
gonna be able to charge the phone it's
like 50% in 30 minutes which is nice we
also get a USB H USBC cable take a
closer look at the phone and it's an all
aluminum bill with the dual cameras
around back when you take a look up
front it's a pretty close to bezel as
display so six inches and pretty much
all you're gonna get here is just a
small fingerprint sensor on bottom but
other than that it's all screen up front
something else you're getting is not
only a USB C port on bottom but
thankfully we also still have the
headphone jack with the cur√© 970 onboard
now you're getting an octa-core
processor backed up with either 4 or 6
gigs of RAM but you also have 64 or 128
gigs of storage which can be expanded
with micro sd and it also has a potent
12 core GPU over the last couple years
honors done a good job of making sure
their phones don't slow down that much
over time so of course being brand new
everything is super snappy and
responsive as you would expect but
they've actually done a lot of work on
the back end to make sure that it will
stay snappy even after a couple years
something that this helps with this with
gaming simili do you have that powerful
processor but you also have games like
modern combat versus that will support
the two by one aspect ratio now yes not
all android games are going to support
this just yet but the ones that do like
this actually look pretty good on
display and I didn't die cool you've
also got the game suite which gives you
some options depending on what game
you're playing so for example when I'm
playing modern combat versus maybe I
want to switch it over to gaming mode
give me maximum performance or I don't
care about that and I just want to save
some battery I can do
as well now you also have some options
for making sure that your gameplay isn't
interrupted by notifications and you can
also hide the navigation keys the view
10 has a nice-looking six inch panel
with a resolution of 2160 by 1080 the
screen is nice you're getting good color
getting good contrast and again with
that screen resolution being a little
bit wider than normal it means that you
actually get a little bit extra at a
video that especially it has been shot
in widescreen this guy is rocking dual
cameras a 16 megapixel sensor as well as
a 20 megapixel sensor and they both have
an aperture of f-18 there's actually
some cool AI features that go along with
the camera so for example if I try to
take a picture of some text here it's
actually automatically gonna see that
and pop up and optimize it for that text
it also can recognize other scenes for
example it knows when I'm trying to take
a picture of Ken and will get me the
most beautiful shot possible I mean you
know given what it's got to work with of
course you also get a surprisingly
good-looking portrait selfie mode so if
I snap a shot here that is really not
bad at all so even though it only has a
single camera up front it's still able
to do a really good job of detecting
what is me what's the background and be
able to blow that out you also have
other features that take advantage of AI
including the built-in Microsoft
translator so using some wonderful
translations from our good buddy Ken you
can see there actually does a pretty
good job of recognizing that this is
Japanese and translating even the small
text there's also a built-in smart
assistant which will do its best job to
be able to give you notifications when
you say you're late for something or
when it thinks that you actually might
want to reminder for something there's
also the screen split mode which a lot
of other Android phones have and this
will allow you to run a couple apps such
as YouTube and say the Play Store at the
same time especially useful considering
just how big this screen is you're also
getting a sizable 30 750 million power
battery which is a lot bigger than most
other flagships today and combined with
the super charge to allow you to charge
it up to 50 percent in 30 minutes should
mean that battery life is not going to
be a problem the bottom line is that AI
is absolutely going to take over
smartphones soon and the view tin does a
good job of giving you a glimpse into
the future so I'm curious what do you
guys think about the new honor of you 10
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
