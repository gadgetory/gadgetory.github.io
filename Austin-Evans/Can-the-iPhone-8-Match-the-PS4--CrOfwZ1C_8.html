I compared the Xbox 360 to the then-new
iPhone 6 and the results were
surprisingly close but with the iPhone 8
coming out today how does it stack up to
a modern console like the ps4 first
let's take a look at what's inside the
iPhone 8 as well as the iPhone 10 the
Apple a 11 Bionic chip the a series of
SOC s have kind of been on top of the
game for a while now and the a11 is no
exception so compared to the iPhone 7
which only had a pair of high
performance cores that were available
for games the iPhone 8 as well as 10
both have not only upgrade high
performance cores you also have for low
power cores that can all be used
together essentially what this means is
that when you're gaming the iPhone 8 in
the iPhone 10 have a 6 core processor
that's not the entire story though the a
11 is rocking a brand new Apple design
GPU now this is the first previous
iPhones going all the way back to the
original use some sort of imagination
design whereas here they've designed
their own triple core GPU all this is
built on TSM C's latest 10 nanometer
process which means that the a11 has a
fairly impressive 4.3 billion
transistors now compare this to the ps4
which I designed it was originally
launched in 2013 so this is using a
custom AMD based APU which it only has
eight CPU cores but also a fairly
sizable GPU on the processor side the
ps4 and the Xbox one have very similar
designs so essentially well you do have
eight cores they're pretty weak so based
on ambe's Jaguar tech they're going to
be fine from normal use sort of on their
own but when you combine eight of them
in a single console it gives you pretty
good performance the ps4 also has a
still impressive radeon GPU which is
backed up by eight gigabytes of fast
gddr5 memory so back of the envelope
math shows that the iPhone CPU is
significantly quicker than the ps4
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
40 percent faster however when you take
a look at graphics it is a very
different story the iPhone only has
about 20% of the graphics power of the
ps4 that is a huge difference now the
iPhone is outputting to a much smaller
display which does give it a little bit
of leeway as far as the graphics power
but you do have to keep in mind that all
this is inside a seven millimeter thick
chassis so with only about five watts of
TDP it has to dissipate all that through
the metal and glass design compare that
to the ps4 which has about 90 watts to
work with and it has
heatsink fans vents a lot of stuff that
essentially means that the laws of
physics are in the ps4 favor of course
on paper specs are one thing but let's
see how actual games compare first off
we have the witness a ps4 game that was
recently ported to iOS take a look to
see the differences between the two
systems what you should notice is that
it is essentially the full experience on
both devices iPhone version is running
at a noticeably lower resolution which
should be a huge surprise considering
that's on a phone screen and well yes
the graphics settings are not to the
same level of the ps4 but the content is
absolutely there and honestly it doesn't
look hugely different now I did notice a
couple of rendering issues on the iPhone
8 but honestly once it gets an actual
patch to support the eight hopefully
these will be eliminated next we have
transistor which is another game that
will run cross-platform here again the
iPhone resolution is a bit lower and the
graphics have been bumped down a notch
but it's still totally playable and
honestly not a huge difference between
the ps4 version now especially when you
do pair it with a gamepad it really is a
very similar gameplay experience
now minecraft runs on basically
everything on earth but how did the ps4
an iPhone version stack up this is one
of the better comparisons for the iPhone
not only is a resolution a lot closer to
what you're getting with the ps4 but the
graphics settings are similar and
especially once you pair it with a
controller it feels very similar
especially with that locked 60 frames
per second continue on the minecraft
train we have minecraft story mode a
classic telltale game that of course is
going to be running on both the iPhone
as well as the ps4 you can notice some
differences here so now are the settings
going to be lower but also is definitely
not running at that full 1080p of the
ps4 but yet again is completely playable
on both systems although with this one I
would definitely take the ps4 if I had
the option to really see what both
systems can do let's take a look at some
exclusive games that just simply take
better advantage of the hardware so when
the ps4 horizon zero dawn is a huge leap
over anything that's available on the
iPhone
the level of detail actual graphics of
course the gameplay is seriously worth
that $60 on the other hand there are
certain games that simply are better
suited to the iPhone stuff like Monument
Valley now it looks great but also takes
great advantage of the touch controls
and games like oz broken Kingdom do a
really good job of leveraging the power
of that a 11 check like I mentioned
earlier one of the downsides to having
this much power in such a small device
is always going to be heat you don't
have those fans and vents
be able to pull it away as you have to
fully rely on the glass metal build to
dissipate all the heat from the device
now I'll have to do some more thorough
testing but at least based on first
impressions the iPhone 8 does pretty
well here she wondered an extended
30-minute gaming load the back of the
device actually doesn't even get that
warm so is the iPhone 8 as powerful as
the ps4 no to be fair it is catching up
surprisingly quickly and for some games
the experience isn't far off but the
laws of physics mean that for this time
the dedicated game console is going to
win out so what do you guys think about
the power of the iPhone 8 let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
