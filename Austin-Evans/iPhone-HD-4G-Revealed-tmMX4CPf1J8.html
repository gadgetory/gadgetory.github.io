today I'm here with a video on the new
iPhone 4G / HD whatever they're going to
call it we have a ton of new information
on it literally guys in past 24 hours
it's been I mean literally just constant
more after more after more we've thought
it's fake guys real does fake again and
now we pretty much definitely know that
it's real something go ahead and you
guys a full rundown everything we know
and everything we expect looks like the
iPhone 4G is finally coming anyway guys
let's get this one started
okay so let's go ahead and give you guys
a rundown of what we know so far this
all began with the post on Engadget last
night who basically got a scoop that the
iPhone 4G / HD we're just going to be
calling the HD for the purposes of this
video they had some pictures of the new
iPhone HD as well as the story of how
someone actually got it supposedly the
way it goes is that someone found it in
a iPhone 3G case in a bar and picked it
up like hey this looks new so they went
ahead and sent some pictures to engage
it and some information so what we know
about it is that it has a front-facing
camera so I think we've been waiting for
for a long long time it also has a
really kind of cool-looking design its
kind changed from you know the kind of
plastic and all the kinds of things that
the previous iPhones had to a case
pretty similar to the iPad it's all on
aluminum it also has a few kind of
interesting things such as like an 80
gig storage capacity which really kind
of seems odd but hey I guess it's
believable so that happened last night
and it looked really real then a couple
hours later some more pictures came up
from a few weeks ago and they looked
like they were faked they had some
pictures out of it with the back casing
off which obviously we all know the
iPhones don't have removable back
so all sudden everybody's like god this
is faith this is faith
well then earlier today they got some
more pictures or rather someone tipped
them off that it actually was real and
actually everyone had had the proof for
over three months so if you look back
the night before the iPad was announced
a picture linked to everyone basically
showing the iPad bolted down in that
case well everybody of course the iPad
was about to come out so everybody was
focusing on the iPad but when no one
paid attention to was the fact that two
of the brand-new iPhones were sitting
inside that picture and no one ever
noticed it so basically there are two
eye buttons in the picture there was one
sitting on top of the iPad and we really
can't tell a whole lot from this one
other than the fact that it looks like
just to be in a normal case but on the
bottom you can tell that it looks like
it's aluminum instead of this standard
sort of look of the normal iPhone in
addition it's sort of blurry but you can
see on the top right of the picture you
can see that the there looks to be
another iPhone and comparing this to the
iPhone pictures we got earlier is an
absolute dead ringer they look they have
the same sort of odd-looking volume
rockers and it's got the same sort of
aluminum case design now so putting all
this together guys it really looks like
we have finally found the iPhone HD some
more pictures in addition to this came
out just about 45 minutes ago showing
actually someone had dissected this
supposedly I don't know how they did it
but someone actually had the same iPhone
and they had taken it apart and we have
four or five pictures of it now this
looks the course we can't guarantee any
of this is real but these pictures look
identical to the ones and they look like
they're going to fit up just right you
can see the front-facing camera and the
same sort of case so yeah guys that's
about all we know about the iPhone HD so
far spent tons and tons of rumors it's
been really really hectic a few hours so
try to condense it down
but pretty much as far as I can tell the
guys this is not a fake this is not a
hoax whether it looks a hundred real
they've got so much information so many
pictures and they all will
do seem to match up massively rapidly
developing guys I mean literally today
like three or four things that
continuously happened so I will have in
the underbar I have a link to check out
that post which it will be constantly
updating for all the new sort of news
anyway guys what do you think I'm
personally I think this is really
believable it looks like the real iPhone
to me yeah I like the design looks good
of course you know a front-facing camera
sounds perfect I mean everybody's been
waiting for that for a long time but
definitely be sure to leave me a comment
saying what you think anyway guys thanks
