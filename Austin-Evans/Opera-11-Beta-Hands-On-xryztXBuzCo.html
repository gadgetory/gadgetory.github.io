hands-on of offer 11 so oper 11 is just
been released as far as the beta it's
not actually fully out but as far as the
beta goes it's really quite solid and
they've got a lot of really nice
features in this so I think I can give
you guys a hands on um so as you can see
here the interface everything looks
mostly the same about the main thing
you'll see at first glance is up here
now you can go ahead and click on this
now basically just tell you a little bit
about you know the security of the
webpage you know if it's encrypted if
you know if there's any reported
problems you can even click details and
see you know if you want to report the
site kind of a small thing but it's a
little bit of a nice and proven the main
thing however is that opera now supports
extensions I know this is always been
one of my biggest problems with opera it
used to use some sort of add-ons but
they were kind of well they they weren't
the greatest however now it supports
extensions practically they're almost
identical to the way chrome does and
they work very well so here's the opera
extensions gallery I woke you know do
keep in mind I'm fairly sure that this
is not what's finally going to look like
and work I mean this is just obviously
in the beta but so it's pretty simple
you can go ahead and scroll through here
they have a large variety you know you
even have got YouTube downloaders
ad-blockers
all kinds of different things so I'm
going to just click on this one give you
guys a little taste of what it all looks
like and once it loads here we can go
ahead and get a little information here
about the Downloads the size one of
those last updated up and go ahead and
click on this for screenshots so we can
go ahead and take a look at that and if
we like we can go ahead and install it
actually I've already installed one
right here now of course just like in
chrome actually works almost exactly
like in chrome where some will just be
in the background and others why should
we go ahead and get their own buttons so
for example here is the virustotal
one of my favorite extensions I love for
all browsers as you can see you click on
and it pops up really quite simply and
easily I'm so there you go that is the
extensions they work pretty well there
aren't too many of them right now but
for one I've heard it seems like it's
going to be pretty easy to port a lot of
the Chrome extensions over here so
definitely if you already use Chrome
right now I would expect to see a lot of
those extensions over in Opera sim
so another thing kind of minor but there
is now a your dialogue I suppose and
where you can go ahead and keep flash
keep different add-ons from
automatically running so this is really
great especially if you're on a Mac you
don't want you know flash eating up all
your CPU all you have to do is by
enabling this you can go ahead like for
example here's a YouTube video and
obviously it doesn't automatically do it
on front now I can go ahead and download
and activate the plug-in but otherwise
they would not automatically load which
is definitely a nice feature now that
one of the cooler things I like is tad
browsing now obviously tab browsing
that's everywhere
however in Opera you can actually stack
tabs so you can see here this tab looks
a little bit different if I go ahead and
click this you can see that have quite a
few different tabs all in the same tab I
guess make much sense but basically you
can go ahead and stack and rearrange
tabs as much as you like um so let's say
I'm you know I'm scrolling through this
website of course this is actually well
it's not a big secret that I've got this
website but I of course will do a full
launch which it's done later but so like
let's say I'm going through here reading
a bunch of pages and you know I can just
go ahead and sort all of these pages in
so I can go ahead and hover over them
and you scroll through already they can
go ahead with them minimized and hover
over them and let's say I like okay I
want to find this one click on I mean
immediately over here I can go ahead and
select whatever I want and continue on
with my browsing so the guys that's it
for my first look at opera 11 it's a
very very fast browser I hope you sleep
you ever seen any of my speed tests it's
practically just the same as chloramine
which is a little bit slower but it's
got a lot of really nice features and
I'm really pleased with this offer 11 so
of course it is free and you can
download it for Windows Mac and lengths
so no matter what you've got you should
be covered so of course definitely go
ahead and recommend you guys give it a
try as you can tell it's a very
competent browser and I really do like
opera a lot so yeah anyway guys thanks
