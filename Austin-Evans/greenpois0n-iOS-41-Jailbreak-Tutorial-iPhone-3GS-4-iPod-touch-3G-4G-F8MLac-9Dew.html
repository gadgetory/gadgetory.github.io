jailbreak tutorial show me head
jailbreak your iPhone your iPod Touch or
your iPad using green poison so I'm sure
a lot of you guys know the whole story
I'm not gonna get into that but what I
will do is show you guys how to use
green poison now this does currently
support all the same devices that lime
rain does so if you already successfully
jailbroken using lime rain no worries
you don't need to bother with doing this
however if you had problems with lime
rain before whatever reason you want to
use green poison I'm not here to show
you the tutorial that are very similar
so just to run through it real quickly
here the device is that green poison
supports is the iPhone 3GS the iPhone 4
the iPod Touch 3rd generation so if you
have an 8 gigabyte iPod Touch 3rd
generation does not support that
currently the iPod Touch 4th generation
all models doesn't matter what kind and
lastly the iPad now at the moment at the
moment this is all it supports however
in the soon it should go ahead and also
support the iPod Touch 2nd generation so
if you do have an 8 gigabyte iPod Touch
3rd generation it will support it soon
just not quite yet and also should
support the 2nd generation Apple TV so
if that's not good news there I'm so
anyway before we begin standard warning
when plug your iPod or whatever into
iTunes and let it sink to go ahead and
get you know all your data you should
not lose any data in the jailbreak
that's always good to be safe ok somehow
go ahead and take a look here go ahead
and go to green poison calm I will of
course have a link down in the
description and go ahead and show you
guys now currently there's no Mac you
know it says back there Mac is currently
not there so they're still working on
that however you can go ahead and click
it for windows ok so before we do
anything once you have green poisoned
downloaded your one can you just shut
off your device and it's pretty simple
go ahead just hold the power button for
just a minute and then until the slides
on long I mean slide to power off rather
as soon as it happens it's off then
we'll get to go so now at this point
come over to Peter and open up green
poison and it will automatically shut
off iTunes so there we go so it's pretty
simple all you basically all it is
there's a button that says prepare for G
/ E
so what basically we're going to be
going and got into DFU mode and if
you've never done this before I will go
ahead and show you as well as the
program counts you down
basically you hold the power button for
a few seconds then you hold the power
and home then you release the power
button DFU mode simple as that all right
sounds go ahead and show you guys so
course with your device off and of
course connected via USB let's go ahead
and put into DFU mode come on I didn't
click it it says get ready three two one
hold the sleep button for two seconds
now hold the sleep and home-button for
eight seconds or 10 seconds or whatever
and then once we pull held for 10
seconds we're gonna go ahead and release
the sleep button and continue holding
the home button so usually it says 15
seconds but it does not really usually
take that long maybe eight seconds or so
but go ahead and just continue holding
it until the dialog goes away there we
go go ahead and release it and now iPod
or iPhone looks pretty much blank
however now a little button has appeared
it says geo Rick so let's plug it so it
will go ahead it says jailbreaking so
just watch your device and we'll go
ahead and start exploiting and this will
take a minute but you're pretty much
done at this point and you can see your
loading bars will start going and there
we go you get a white screen but
basically guys this is you that's what
spring you were good to go there's not a
whole lot to worry about basically you
just need to just sit back it'll take a
minute
there'll be lines of code be all kinds
of different stuff it'll reboot but in a
minute it will be jailbroken so hang on
guys I'll cut and I'll be right back as
soon as it's done okay so they didn't
take just a minute and now as you guys
can see here if we flip over to the back
page we do see loader so basically this
is similar to line right all we need to
do is open it up and all we need to do
is go ahead and hit Cydia hit install
Cydia I'll go ahead and download it and
it will install it so again guys
very very simple jailbreak we're pretty
much done so this is great for if you
had problems with lime rain or anything
like that you should be good to go so
there we go we're already done I mean
well it does ask you want to remove
loader from your device tool it to you
I'm go ahead and leave it just in case I
ever need it but yeah that's pretty much
it so guys as you guys can actually I
think it's better to respring here in a
second yep there we go so it will
respring really quickly here
but yes so guys that's pretty much it
for the jailbreak if you have any
questions or comments or anything like
that feel free to leave it in the
comment section below I think I've
covered everything but you have really
simple jailbreak and big props to the
whole chronic dev team and everybody who
worked on the jailbreak
okay there we go so anyway guys thanks
