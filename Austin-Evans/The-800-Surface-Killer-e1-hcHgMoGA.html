Put the Eve V side-by-side
with the Microsoft Surface Pro
and you'll see that they
look pretty similar.
A quick glance at the Eve site
makes the comparison obvious.
But take a closer look
and you'll see that this is
a really interesting device.
The second you open the
box you'll see the names
of a thousand people who
contributed to the design
of the Eve V.
The idea was that this was
a crowd designed device.
Eve originally reached
out to me over a year ago
asking if I wanted to take a look at the V
and in the meantime
a lot of the specs have
legitimately changed
based on community feedback.
This is a really cool idea.
Of course, there are downsides to buying
from a small startup,
but you can't fault them
for trying a new approach.
However when you consider just
how good the Surface Pro is
the V has to do some really cool stuff
to justify it's existence.
And it kind of does.
While at first glance it
looks incredibly similar
to the Surface.
Take a closer look and there
are some thoughtful details.
Instead of a single USB-A and
the bizarre Mini DisplayPort
on the Pro, you're getting
two full-size USB ports
in addition to a pair of USB-C ports,
one of which is full Thunderbolt 3
and both can be used for charging.
Now there is no facial
recognition with Windows Hello
but you do have a slightly
hidden fingerprint sensor
and a very similarly adjustable kickstand.
Again, at first glance
the detachable keyboard
looks nearly identical to the Surface
but it has a surprisingly mechanical feel
with a lot of key travel.
It's not what you would
typically expect to find
on a laptop or a two-in-one.
And while it took me a few
minutes to get used to,
it kinda makes the Surface
feel a little bit spongy
in comparison.
You've also got the slightly
unnecessary RGB backlight
but it does double as
a Bluetooth keyboard.
Detach it from the V
and hold control and F12
to sync it wirelessly.
I don't know how often I
would end up using this
but it is a nice feature.
I will say the trackpad isn't amazing.
It's totally fine
and combined with the
touchscreen navigation is okay,
but I do prefer the clicky-ness
of the Surface Pro touch pad.
Probably the best feature of the keyboard
is that it's actually included in the box.
This is almost a necessity
on a two-in-one like this
and on the Surface it
will cost you another $130
to get the keyboard.
Big props to Eve for, you know,
including that basic necessity in the box.
It goes beyond that too.
They also include a pen.
Another $100 addition on the Surface.
To be fair, it's based
on slightly older tech
than the latest Surface pen
but the slight difference
in latency really isn't
a big problem for me.
And again, it's included in the box.
One minor issue I've noticed
is that while both tablets
have a microSD card slot, the
Eve has a little notch on it
which makes it really difficult
to actually remove the SD card,
which is just kind of dumb.
The rest of the hardware feels decent.
It's a bit heavier and
entire thing is more rounded,
which feels a bit cheaper
than the incredibly tight tolerances
of the magnesium Surface.
But importantly both
have fan-less designs.
Well mostly.
The Eve uses lower
wattage Core Y processors,
so on paper this is a
trade-off between performance
and battery life.
On one hand you are going
to be losing a little bit
of performance, especially
in heavier tasks,
such as video editing and gaming.
But on the flip side at least in theory
you're going to be getting
better battery life.
However when you stack
it up to the Surface Pro
not only does it offer a
higher wattage Core i5 model,
which is still going to be fan-less,
but it also has better battery life
at 13 and a half hours compared
to 10 hours on the Eve V.
The model I have here is almost top spec
with a seventh generation Core
i7 processor, 16 gigs of RAM,
and a 512 gigabyte SSD,
which comes in at $1,600.
However if you want to
pick up the base model
with the Core m3, eight gigs
of RAM and 128 gigs of storage,
that starts at $800.
Put the speced out V
alongside the $1,300 Core i5 Surface Pro,
and you'll see that they're
fairly comparable in Geekbench
and that holds up well
in real world usage.
The Eve is snappy and for
normal stuff it's totally fine.
Just don't expect to go and do anything
all that taxing on it.
You do have that Thunderbolt 3 port
which allows you to take
advantage of an external GPU
but for most people
that's going to be a little bit too much.
Screen-wise the Eve has a 12.3 inch panel
with a resolution of 2880x1920.
It's a good screen.
You're getting an individually
calibrated display
straight from the factory,
that while on paper is slightly
sharper than the Surface,
but in reality both are top notch.
I will say the rounded edges of the V
does make the bezels
look a little bit bigger
but there really isn't
much to complain about
when it comes to the screen.
However the speakers, while decent,
fall quite a bit short
of the front firing ones on the Surface.
This is what the webcam looks
and sounds like on the Eve V.
So as you can see it's a little bit grainy
but for stuff like Skype
and Google Hangouts
it should be okay.
On the flip side the Surface
looks significantly better.
Not only is it going to be 1080p,
but as you can see it is
no longer the soupy mess
of the Eve.
The story of Eve is great.
I mean who doesn't want
to root for the underdog?
And to be clear, the V is a good computer.
Not only does it generally match
or even exceed the
Surface in a lot of areas,
but it's around the same price or cheaper
and it includes not only the
keyboard and also the pen,
which Microsoft is going to
charge you over $200 for.
The problem is that they're
building these to order
so availability is a lot more complicated
than you might hope for.
However if you're willing to
take a chance on a new company
the Eve V is absolutely worth a look.
So what do you guys think?
Is this a true Surface Pro killer?
