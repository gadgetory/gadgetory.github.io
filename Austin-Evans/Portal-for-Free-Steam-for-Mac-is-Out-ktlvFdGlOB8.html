today I'm here with a bit of a different
video from my usual I'm going to be
typing in just a little bit about steam
for the Mac as well as a very very cool
thing to be able to download portal for
free for a limited time so yeah go ahead
and cover that anyway let's get this one
started
this covering everything
okay guys so as you may or may not know
steam for the Mac has just been released
today now if you don't know what steam
is basically it is a really cool
solution to be able to play games all
kinds of computer games on your computer
just by downloading them
it's run by valve who has made a lot of
games such as like half-life that you
probably know about and it's a really
cool thing well it's been on PC forever
but now they finally brought it over to
Mac so go ahead and show you guys a
little bit about it so here is one
really cool key thing sorry one really
key thing that you need to look for
though is it see that you were on the
Mac is that you need to look for right
here you see it shows the Apple plus
windows ok now games for that are on
Steam aren't I mean so many of them have
been made for Windows that not all of
them by any stretch of the imagination
or for your Mac so definitely be wary if
it says you know if it doesn't if you
don't see the Apple or whatever don't
buy it because it's not going to work
for you just a little tip but guys one
really key thing that I want to mention
about Steam for the Mac is that let's
say I'm gonna buy this guns of Icarus
for example ok well I'm on Windows right
now I buy it from $9.99 ok so I play it
on Windows now let's say I go over to my
Mac turn that on
open up steam well I can go ahead and
download this because it is branded with
Steam place so I can actually if I buy
it on one platform I'll have it on both
and this goes for games you already own
as well ok guys so that's just a really
brief overview of portal for the Mac I'm
not gonna go into I don't I don't have a
Mac right here just letting you guys
know that you can go ahead and do that
but what this is for is for everybody
well unless you use Linux but if you
have a Mac or PC and yet steam then I
highly recommend that you download
portal portal is a fantastic game really
hard to explain guys have you never
heard of it before
it's it's it's a really unique game
where you know you shoot portals through
walls and then you have two portals and
you shoot one and you shoot the other
and that made no sense whatever but guys
just trust me it's a really awesome
awesome game and it is free now now
actually I don't have it on for the
computer I've i always just play it on
my
box but now that's free for your PC or
Mac and I highly recommend you can
download this guys this is a really
really fun game especially if this is
your gettin portal for your Mac so this
is a great game to start out with but
also if you have PC go ahead grab it
even if you don't have steam it's
totally free to go ahead and download
steam and you can go ahead and be
playing portal in just a few minutes so
guys definitely I'm really really
recommend it's a fantastic game one of
my all-time favorite games no doubt
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
