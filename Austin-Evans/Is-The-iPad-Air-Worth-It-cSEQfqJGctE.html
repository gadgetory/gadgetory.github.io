here is a video going over is the iPad
error worth it
so today I've got my good friend Lamarr
Wilson hey hey you don't know none ya
had him in a bunch of my videos and I've
been on your channel a bunch but
basically we've got the iPad Mini here
or iPad yet Wow
that's okay it feels a lot like the iPad
Mini and that's actually the first thing
that I kind of noticed is you've been
using the iPad Mini for a while I have I
have as my primary tablet and it's a
very lightweight easy to use and sexy
like me can you yeah when I first tried
at the store yesterday I was just amazed
at how light it was like it's you think
they shave all just a little bit is not
a big deal but I was one handing this
for the most part I was you know like
searching Flipboard and reading a book
and kind of doing everything with one
hand anyway yeah it's definitely lighter
so the old iPad always just seemed a
little bit too big and too heavy for me
and you had the iPad 2 right I did this
is so much lighter yeah I had that I had
the iPad 2 the 3 the 4 I didn't keep any
of them I just it just felt like it was
too big and too heavy and even though
I'm still not totally sold on this like
a nine point seven inch screen this does
a lot to make it a lot smaller a lot
more easy to use a lot more portable
some of the big new advantages of the
new iPad air is that does have the Apple
a7 processor which is also in the iPhone
5s so I was running some speed tests of
course I'll go more in depth in the full
review but this thing is very very fast
in fact it scored about half as much is
the new MacBook Pro Retina so tablet
especially for a phone that's really
really fast but how does it compare to
your normal iPad Mini definitely saw a
speed increase you know the iPad Mini
has a
a5 and select a couple it's good load
yeah now the difference is they're not
even worth talking about it it is
definitely much much faster alright so
another thing is that this has a Retina
screen which I've had many does not have
and yes it is a nice screen also not had
a little disagreement in the store about
how nice reading is I think it is nice
but it doesn't make everything else
unreadable and that's that's my that's
my thing about right it's okay it's not
unreadable but the way I like to look at
it is it's like after you watch a
high-def TV going back to like an old
like Sierra's oh no no not like that it
sounded like that no yeah not what picks
up now yeah it is okay well this so I
argue in your video but one thing I'm
naughty
huge fan of with the iPad air as the
price so it still starts at $500 which
is fine for tablet that one gets you 16
gigs of storage which I recently picked
up the Asus Transformer book t100 that's
a Windows 8 tablet with 64 gigs of
storage and keyboard dock for $400 so a
68 iPad for $100 more doesn't make all
that much sense to me this is Windows
though
well that's does that add takeaway value
it literally takes away all right so yes
so iOS is $300 more damage shut up so
the iPad Mini retina that's coming out
later this month is actually gonna be a
hundred hours less than this yeah and
it's gonna just be a smaller version all
the innards are exactly the same the
screen is going exactly the same yes you
might have more pixel density because
it's mom yeah well yeah yeah he's the
same 2048 by 1536 in green just on a
smaller display although to be totally
honest I think it's written enough that
it probably won't make a big difference
but it's a nice thing to have and so for
me I actually really do prefer the size
of the iPad Mini just because even
though the iPad air does give you some
added features like it's probably a
better battery life since it's about the
same specs there's just more room for
battery you do have that bigger screen
and it's specially going to be better
for productivity so if you're gonna
maybe like slap a keyboard case or
something on here it's going to be way
bigger than the tiny little iPad Mini
but on the other hand for me I have a
laptop that I really use for
productivity and whatnot so when I want
to grab a tablet I want something that
small that's lightweight it's fast it's
got a good screen to be good for
watching video reading books that kind
of things so it shouldn't really compete
with the laptop exactly yes while this
won't run to be better yeah you so
overall even though the iPad air is a
great tablet much all it's done is
really convinced me that I really want
an iPad Mini retina I mean what do you
think are you gonna be upgrading oh yeah
I'm definitely be upgrading uh just yeah
just playing with this one the eye pin
here again really convinced me that I
can wait a few more weeks for the small
digression but this is a really light
nice step you're new to tablets and you
want something bigger definitely check
this out in my opinion it's when I
played with that story was I was really
surprised and it is the huge improvement
over the last I pad like I know we've
said that before but I really can't
stress that enough that it is so much
lighter it's so much you know thinner it
feels better than hand it's got the same
kind of nice little edges and it comes
in space grey which you guys don't worry
as I do so what do you guys think about
the new iPad air is it something that
you're gonna be picking up or you maybe
going to go with the iPad Mini retina
definitely sure to let us know what you
think in the comments below anyway big
thanks to my friend Lamar you guys
should definitely go check his channel
out Lamarr Wilson what exactly do you
over there
comedy vlogger I talk about all kinds of
things of course tech is always gonna be
the center you know I have a like
section as I just comes out Monday
you're going to be in it yeah and we're
gonna talk about things that I like and
Austin and I might be at the beach yeah
all I'll say that no no spoilers so
definitely go check out his channel see
the whole video on Monday and anyway
guys I will well and I will get your
next I was like no I won't be your next
still got all the space still got all
the features that's how it works
oh that's totally your battery not
actually it's a smaller battery but it's
about the same battery life so smaller
buddy like you some of the things I
really like about the air is that it
really does just feel like you said like
a big iPad Mini nice modelling by the
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
