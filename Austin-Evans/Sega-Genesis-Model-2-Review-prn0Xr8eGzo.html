of the Sega Genesis model 2 now there
are of course 3 different versions of
the Sega Genesis there was the original
the model 2 which I have here and
there's also a model 3
however today guys I'm go ahead and show
you the Sega Genesis model 2 as in my
opinion was one of the better Sega
Genesis just because of the looks
because I really do like the looks of
this I'm sorry I didn't just give you
guys a quick tour starting from the
front you will see two controller ports
and I actually are fully compatible with
all Sega Genesis so you know if you have
the original model it works just fine
when plug in two controllers in addition
you have a power button as well as a
reset and when you turn on the power you
see these three lights light up on the
top of the you go ahead and insert your
Sega Genesis cartridges so in this case
that just got Sonic the Hedgehog spread
and drop it right in there and they work
fine and the cartridges are even grooved
on the back so that you go ahead and
pull them out so it works really nicely
ok so I'm moving around to the back
there is not a whole lot here so as you
can see here there are only two ports
there's one for the a/v out and then one
for the power adapter now this actually
is not that great as original Genesis
actually had quite a few other ports
including even a headphone not a big
deal though however as most of the time
you really didn't use any other ports I
mean all you need to do is plug it into
your TV
now obviously the much smaller size of
the model 2 is are definitely a nice
touch here you can see the Sega Genesis
model 2 compared to its main competitor
in the day the second generation Super
Nintendo as you can see both are pretty
similar in size the super Nintendos a
little bit taller and the Genesis is
just a little bit wider but all I mean
both of these are really compact
consoles and to be honest but neither of
them look too bad even today one thing
that Sega really focused on was a really
really nice variety of peripherals to
extend the Genesis lifespan so of course
the Super Nintendo really didn't really
focus on that and really no other
console has put so much effort into
really extending the life as the Genesis
did so there are two main ones through
is the Sega 32x which as the name
implies it actually gave it 32-bit
support so it play different games just
doom and a lot more you know advanced
another probably arguably a little bit
more important I guess was the Sega CD
and this actually is
entirely functional with both the Sega
Genesis 1 &amp;amp; 2 so if you pull off this
little thing here and this is just a
protector right here I'm you actually go
ahead and use this that sits on a base
station actually don't have one right
here but the Genesis actually sits on a
base station and you can actually go
ahead and play CD audio CDs but the main
thing was to actually go ahead and play
sake of CD games on the Sega CD gains
are actually pretty interesting they
want to uh they generally had somewhat
better graphics but the main thing was
they just had more room so actually it
could have you know full cd-quality
audio and a lot more advanced features
so between these two add-ons though it
really did give the Genesis a lot of
life you know instead of buying a new
console you just go ahead and buy one of
these add-ons and you also you get
better graphics and play a lot more
games so it definitely is a pretty cool
feature the Sega Genesis was really a
fantastic console and indeed this model
too is one of my favorites now of course
the original model if you can get one
that's probably the one to go with just
because it what did have quite a few
other features such as you know a volume
and some more connectors and stuff like
that however if you just want something
small just to play the Sega Genesis
games you don't want to have to pay that
quite a bit more expensive price as the
model 3 I definitely recommend the Sega
Genesis model 2 it was really solid
console build quality is fantastic and
it still supports the full all the
accessories the 32x as well as the CD so
guys if you're interested go ahead and
just check them out like I said they're
really cheap and of course you know I
mean there's still great games like you
know Sonic the Hedgehog moral combat
among many many others anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
