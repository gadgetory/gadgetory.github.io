went out and found a surprisingly good
700 game PC that was pre-built from a
big box store so that got me thinking
what happens when you want to spend $400
I build a lot of custom gaming pcs and
the math is really simple you're almost
always getting better price to
performance when you build it yourself
versus buying a pre-built however things
have been changing lately in this 3 and
$30.00 novo is a great example of that
one of the nice things about a pre-built
system is that you at least do get some
accessories so this looks like a
keyboard and while I'm sure it's not
going to be particularly high quality
it's better than nothing and especially
if you don't have any accessories right
now something that this will get you off
the ground now we have the computer
itself so something is a little bit
interesting about the skies that is
considerably smaller than most desktops
because of that as you'll see little bit
later it does limit some of our upgrade
options so it might not look like much
but this guy has some potential
so it's powered by a core i3 7100 paired
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and a one
terabyte hard drive and that might not
sound too impressive yet but with one
major upgrade I think it can actually
handle some pretty decent gaming this is
the Nvidia GT 1030 typically lower-end
graphics cards just don't make a lot of
sense
but the 1030 is surprisingly good and
with a $70 price tag it puts the entire
price of this bill that $400 which I
think actually might just be able to
challenge Ken's 700 ollar system well at
least when you consider price to
performance so open this guy up and one
of the main issues is that it always
supports a low profile graphics card
which just so happens to fit perfectly
with our GT 1030 so I think the only
thing we have to do here is just move
the Wi-Fi antenna out of the way but
besides that it printed should be good
to go and with that we had the graphics
card installed so as I'm looking inside
here there actually is some upgrade
ability so on top of the graphics card
you can't easily put another four gigs
of ram in here and while it does have a
one terabyte hard drive to start with on
the bottom there actually is a slot for
an in to SSD so if you want to spend
another say 30 40 dollars on RAM and
maybe another $80 on SSD for less than
$500 you're getting a pretty decent
system so if we would have actually got
the correct GT 1030 which is about a
half an inch smaller it would fit no
problem however with this one
not so much so normally I would try to
cut out a little bit of the metal just
so we'll be able to clear but the
problem is because the system is so
small the hard drive is literally right
here up against the lip so if I did that
basically I would have to pull out the
hard drive this one's like literally a
half an inch too big so um so can we
just do the rest of the video with the
computer case open like can we just can
this just be the rest of the video
because it's not gonna close anymore
than that a few windows updates later
and the system is alive so well yes it
might not look ideal right now we're
actually do have some decent specs
inside that core i3 is clocked at are
pretty impressive 3.9 gigahertz while
the GT 1030 might not be the most
powerful graphics card around it should
definitely be able to handle some pretty
decent gaming so our first game is going
to be csgo
now should be no surprise that the
system is easily able to handle it even
on high settings at 1080p we're gonna
you err between 110 140 frames per
second now sure it might not be the most
competitive thing in the world where
some systems can write 3 or 400 frames
but I would say this qualifies as
playable you know if I could actually
find someone I could just plant the bomb
that's also an option next we have
rocket League now this is another game
that isn't particularly demanding but it
actually looks pretty good running here
on the 400m so at 1080p on high settings
we're doing anywhere between 50 to 60
frames per second next we have Middle
Earth shadow of Mordor as I almost kick
so this is a slightly older game however
even on low settings I think it looks
pretty decent at 1080p and we're getting
a pretty solid 55 to 60 frames per
second so if we would have you know
gotten the correct sized graphics card
for our case I think this actually be
looking pretty good and what's kind of
impressive is what kind of price to
performance you're actually getting out
of this guy if you're going to build the
system today it would cost you around
450 dollars that's not including stuff
like the optical drive or Wi-Fi card now
mind you if I was going to build the
system for $400 I would probably make a
couple of adjustments like drop the core
i3 for a Pentium and maybe consider a
slightly faster graphics card but
considering there were 400 ollars in it
didn't have to build anything besides
not being able to close the case it's
not bad if you guys want to see how Kim
was able to get an even better deal on a
pre-built system definitely be sure to
go check this video out here but what do
you guys
think about our Franken monster for $400
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
