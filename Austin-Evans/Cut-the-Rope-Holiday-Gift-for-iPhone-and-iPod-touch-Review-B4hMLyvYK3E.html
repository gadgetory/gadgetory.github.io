of cut the rope holiday gift for the
iPhone and iPod Touch so this is sort of
a free holiday themed version of the
very very popular Cut the Rope
application that was a lot of fun
however this one as I said is free and
it should give you a very good taste of
what cut the Rope is all about I'm
spoiling you further ado let's go in
just jump right on into this one so go
ahead and hit me play and when you jump
into one of these now cut the rope I
enjoy a lot it's actually been recently
updated with several cool things such as
Retina display support all that kind of
good stuff let's just wait to show you
guys what the gameplay is about so
basically the objective of the game is
go ahead and get this candy into this
little guy named Tom noms and mouth now
it's pretty simple you go ahead and just
do that but you also have an additional
objective of getting as many stars as
possible and on the process so if you go
ahead and get all three stars and get it
into his mouth you can go ahead and
advance although you don't those are
just optional stair-step other things
you need to go ahead and cut the rope
and we will go ahead and cut that rope
and then pop the bubble and there it
goes there are a lot of innovative
things in cut the rope which is probably
one of the reasons why it's such a
popular app so let's go ahead and I
should there I think we got all three
right there so that was a really simple
simple one but there's all kinds of
different things and cut the rope you
can go ahead and you know bubbles there
are different ropes that you know are
different lengths some you know will
actually stretch there's all kinds of
cool stuff now in this one this these
are like warps so basically the candy
goes in here and will come out here some
go ahead and cut this here and there we
go that was pretty simple so you see
here whoops through there and came out
there I'm going to do one more here
let's go ahead and cut this I think I
played this one before so I kinda
remember yeah Oh missed it barely let's
try again um so we go ahead and just cut
it and I think it's at that line we need
to do this there we go so we gotta get
all three stars but there you go guys
that is Cut the Rope holiday gift a
definitely really fun app I've been
playing it a lot just because it's you
know harsh it is free almost like an
expansion pack the for the full version
if you do own that so guys definitely
recommend go ahead and pick it up very
fun little game for your iPhone and iPod
touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
