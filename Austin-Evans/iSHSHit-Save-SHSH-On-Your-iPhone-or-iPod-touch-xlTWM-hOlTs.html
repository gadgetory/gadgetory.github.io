tutorial showing you how to backup your
SHSH blobs on your device as of course
SHSH blobs were really key if you
jailbreak as they like to go ahead and
downgrade to previous firmware which is
telling a very very useful thing well of
course there are have been ways to do
this before you go ahead and use
tinyumbrella I've done several tutorials
on that as well as City it does go ahead
and automatically do it however it kind
of takes a little while sometimes and so
it's always nice to have a blow back up
so that's one go ahead and show you
today which is called i sh sh it you'll
need to open up cydia in search i sh sh
it all one word you should go ahead and
find it it is available for free in the
bigboss repo so once you've found it go
ahead click install and let it do its
thing so once you went ahead and
downloaded and installed i sh sh it is
very very simple so once you open up the
app this is what you'll see it's going
to be very simple to tell you about your
unique chip ID what device you have and
what firmware all that is totally fine
all you do is come up here to and hit
this blue button that says save I know
this will take just a moment it will
download and save your SHSH blobs so
there you go as you can see here it just
says as a backup complain successfully
so I can click OK and then we can go
ahead and also go in to manage and if we
like we can go ahead and actually send
these to ourselves so by clicking send
all oh go ahead and actually open up
your email so you can go ahead and email
this to yourself and have a local copy
of your sh sh blob for your computer so
you can do whatever you want i'm sort of
the guys that's it for my review and a
quick little overview of i sh sh a very
handy little app if a lot of you guys
have questions about SHSH blobs you want
to have to deal with tinyumbrella this
is an even simpler method to be sure
that you do have it saved both consider
it as well as on your computer anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
