life is the Samsung unpacked event for
the launch of the galaxy s4 so we just
watched the keynote they showed off a
lot of the cool features so let's take a
look the phone looks very similar to the
Galaxy s3 it is a bit taller and thinner
but it's got the same basic shape with a
slightly larger 5-inch display speaking
of that screen it is a full 1080p
resolution and coupled with the fact
that it's an AMOLED screen it looks
fantastic viewing angles are great
brightness is great this is seriously
one of the best screen phones i-best
phone screens I have ever seen inside
the galaxy s4 you'll find either an
Exynos 5 octa 8-core processor or a
Snapdragon s4 pro quad core processor
depending on where you live
most likely the s4 Pro will be launching
in the United States and both of these
phones are paired with 2 gigabytes of
RAM as well as a big 2600 milliamp hour
battery which should give it nearly Note
2 sized battery life which will be
awesome the phone is running Android 4.2
jelly bean which is the latest version
of Android so far and is running the
TouchWiz skin now this is mostly the
same as which will find on the galaxy s3
in the note 2 so if you didn't like it
there you're probably not gonna like it
here however from my brief hands-on time
I definitely did see quite a few
improvements it seemed a little bit
smoother a lot of the transitions and
everything it looked a lot more polished
than any previous version of it that
I've ever seen the camera has been
upgraded to 13 megapixels which is quite
a bit better than the 8 megapixel
cameras that you'll find on the galaxy
s3 as well as the note 2 at least on
paper and it does have several new modes
my favorite is dual camera mode so what
it allows you to do is take pictures and
video with both cameras at one time so
for example for taking video on the back
facing camera if you wanted to go ahead
and bring in the front facing camera and
overlay that on the video which actually
is a really cool feature and I'm
surprised that no one has actually ever
thought of this before there are also
lots of additional features so one of
them is air view now what this is is it
allows you to actually pull up some
menus for example like a context menu
without actually touching the screen all
you need to do is hover your finger
above it you know automatically open
pretty gimmicky I don't think we'll
probably using it that much but it is
cool that you can actually interact with
the screen without actually touching it
another cool feature is that the galaxy
s4 is outfitted with an IR blaster which
will allow to function just like a TV
remote so you all you need to do is go
ahead and program all your TVs and
set-top boxes and anything else that you
want into the phone and just point it
out at no work just like a normal TV
remote which is actually pretty cool the
Samsung Galaxy has
four will begin shipping late April this
year and they didn't announce surprise
however it will almost definitely be
around the same price as the Galaxy s3
was when it launched
anyway I'm curious to know what do you
guys think about the brand new Galaxy s4
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below if you
guys are interested more feel free to
check out my last video where I went
over what to expect with the Xbox
infinity if you enjoyed definitely be
sure to leave this video a thumbs up and
if you're interested in more videos like
this be sure to subscribe anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
