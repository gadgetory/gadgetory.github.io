here with a review of the new AMD Radeon
r9 290 so this gives you a ridiculous
amount of performance for $400 so let's
take a look the r9 290 reference design
is entirely unchanged from its bigger
brother which means that while it looks
nice it really can't compete with more
open coolers you still have dual BIOS
onboard but instead of having quiet an
uber modes the 290 runs the fan at 47%
basically splitting the difference it's
a loud card however you can adjust the
fan speed down if you're willing to give
up a bit of performance physically it's
identical to the 290x with dual DVI HDMI
and DisplayPort and 8 plus 6 pin PCI II
power connectors it's also based on the
same Hawaii GPU that's been slightly cut
down with 2560 stream processors
compared to 2,816 max clock speeds of
947 megahertz versus one gigahertz in
the same four gigabytes of gddr5 vram
that's very nice to have on a $400 card
especially for gaming and high
resolutions like 4k AMD is really
pushing the card right out of the box so
don't expect to get much more by
overclocking by default power tune will
run the car right up to 95 degrees
Celsius before throttling which they
insist is safe but you can lower the max
temperature if you'd like you also get
all the new features from the 290x
including crossfire without a bridge you
get mantle as well as true audio support
however the real kicker with this card
is the ridiculous performance
you
AMV definitely isn't pulling any punches
with the r9 290 for $400 you get a card
that outperforms the GTX 780 and
sometimes even the r9 290x however it
does that at the expense of being a very
loud and a very hot card at the price
there's no beating this card as long as
you're willing to deal with the higher
temperatures and noise level so what do
you guys think would you pick up an AR
92 94 your next build definitely be sure
to let me know in the comments below
anyway thanks so much for watching if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date with the latest
and greatest anyway I will catch you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
