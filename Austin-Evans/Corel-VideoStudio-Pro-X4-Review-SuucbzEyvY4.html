VideoStudio Pro X 4 you will find quite
a few solid features in VideoStudio Pro
X 4 including support for picture and
picture editing a wide variety of
customizable effects and titles as well
as a library of transitions and
royalty-free music for your projects
editing and video studio is
straightforward on the upper right you
have your library which is where all
your photos video and audio is held
you can now organize the clips depending
on what type of media you want to view
or just drag them down to the timeline
here you will find all of your titles
transitions and effects as well if you
have ever used a previous version of
video studio you'll be right at home
with this version everything is fairly
and intuitively laid out with the
timeline that supports multiple video
audio and title tracks on the bottom of
the screen and the preview window at the
top left the UI has also been
streamlined from the previous version
and offers a fairly small learning curve
before you were up and running
performance is a major factor in all
video editing programs and you'll have
no complaints with VideoStudio Pro X or
the program is optimized for a wide
variety of hardware including the 2nd
generation Intel Core processors AMD
multi-core processors and GPUs and
Nvidia CUDA technology you'll find
support for a wide variety of formats
including
h.264/avc HD and many many more export
options are equally robust although one
layer quibble is that while it's easy
enough to choose a preset the editor
oftentimes won't allow you to manually
change options such as bitrate there are
quite a few nice effects including the
program so here are just a few
VideoStudio Pro x4 also has the coral
guide which is a storefront for
downloading additional titles templates
and more most of what you'll find is
free and there are some nice effects
here so this is definitely the first
place you should check out once you
download the program the install process
is a bit clunky but overall this is
definitely a very nice feature there are
many more features that I haven't gotten
into including support for 3d video
blu-ray disc burning uploading to
YouTube and multiple monitors support
the program retails for $99.99 and a
copy was provided to me for free for
reviewing purposes there's a
full-featured 30-day trial available on
Quarles website so I recommend trying it
out before deciding whether or not it's
right for you I personally have used
choral video studio since the days of
x-2 and while it may be lacking a few
high-end features from Sony Vegas or
Final Cut Pro for many people the
simpler UI and much cheaper price will
make quarrel VideoStudio Pro X for a
better choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
