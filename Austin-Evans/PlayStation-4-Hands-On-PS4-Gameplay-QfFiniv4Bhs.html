here with the hands on of the new
PlayStation 4 live from e3 first things
first we finally have the actual console
design and I've got to say it's looking
good to me it looks like a ps2 mixed
with an Xbox one but it works with a
very angular design covered in a glossy
black plastic not only that but it also
seems significantly smaller than the
Xbox one which is a surprise considering
the similar hardware inside there's also
an all-new controller for the first time
ever with a Playstation and after
spending a bit of time with it I've got
to say it's an improvement it's larger
than the outgoing ps3 controller
bringing it a lot closer to the Xbox 360
in size most of the buttons and triggers
are in the same place and have a nice
tight feel with the addition of a large
touchpad in the center there's also a
light on the top which works with the
PlayStation 4 eye camera similar to how
the PS Move works today all of that said
well it's definitely an upgrade I still
found myself preferring the shape and
feel of the Xbox 360 controller with
eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory along
with a much faster GPU than on the Xbox
one the ps4 is no slouch as far as
graphics go the main game I spent time
with was blacklight retribution which is
an upcoming free-to-play shooter it's
one of many next-gen games that aims at
running at 60 frames per second and
while the graphics are definitely
nothing on Crysis 3 on a PC it is a big
step up from the current gen consoles
there are also very impressive
third-party titles including Need for
Speed rivals which shows off the power
of the ps4 nicely along with one of my
favorite games from e3 battlefield 4
they demoed 64 player multiplayer up on
stage and I've got to say it looks
really awesome not only are the maps
huge but even buildings like skyscrapers
can be destroyed Oh a Mirror's Edge -
yes please I'm really impressed with
what I've seen from the PlayStation 4
and the fact that it's $100 cheaper than
the Xbox one with support for used games
and no always-online restriction makes
it a big win in my book what do you guys
