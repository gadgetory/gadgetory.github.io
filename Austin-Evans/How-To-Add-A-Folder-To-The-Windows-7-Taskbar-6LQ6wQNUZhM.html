today I'm here with the videos that
should actually help you guys out I'm
going to be showing you guys how to go
ahead in Windows 7 to add a folder to
taskbar now obviously in Windows 7 the
taskbar is pretty similar to the dock in
Mac OS 10 but the problem is it's not
quite as customizable you have pretty
much when you pick the icons you can run
out of space really quickly you can run
out of space in addition you can go
ahead and you know need to put folders
and that sort of thing which doesn't
quite work so I'm gonna go ahead and get
into that and explain it all to you and
show you guys a pretty cool way to get
around it anyway let's get this one
started
okay
so one to seven like I said it's a
little bit different standardly you just
have this the icons which is the way I
like to have it but the brothers a
couple problems one if you have more
programs that you want to put down here
then there's space then it gets really
ugly on this right side there'll be a
like a little scroll bar and you scroll
it up it looks bad and it's pretty much
a bad idea I think likewise is you want
to put a folder in here you have
obviously your Windows Explorer you can
you wouldn't have that there and it'll
launch your libraries but the problem is
if you want to put an individual folder
kind of like we're back with the old
quick launch you can't do that you can't
well you can but you have to right-click
it and then come up to the pinned bit
and you know that I mean it works but
you know that it doesn't look good and
it's kind of you know not not cool so
what I want to show be showing you guys
is actually a combo of how you can put
your applications how to have more
applications than you want and have a
quick link over here as well as how to
go ahead and get your folders etc over
here
it all works the same way so anyway
let's go ahead and start this doesn't
matter really this first bit you can do
it wherever you like basically you just
need to make a folder I should make a
blank folder put it somewhere I just
have it my documents and then go ahead
now as you can see here I have this is
for browsers so what I decided to do
because I have a lot of browsers I want
to have a folder to put them all in so
that I can have all these links without
taking up a ton of space okay
so basically what I did was I just went
and through the programs and just
dragged links over to this folder now
this will work yeah pretty much however
you want you can drag links over like
the way I'm doing or you can just use
this bit to use this folder so it
doesn't matter you'll see what I mean in
a minute but basically either at this
point you want to go ahead and drag
links over to a file or you can just
pick a file that you want easy access to
on the side either way it doesn't matter
okay so once we have it
just back out and come to it now you
need to right-click it come down and hit
create shortcut okay so now scroll down
just a little bit have this browser
shortcut so I'm going to drag it out to
my desktop to make a little easier to
work with okay so if we want we can go
ahead and leave it like this but as you
can see here that might not quite look
right so let me just quickly show you
guys how to change the icon so just go
ahead and hit properties come in here
and then click change icon okay now you
should already have this installed but
if not I'll go ahead and put this link
to the district in the description
basically it's a file filled with icons
so basically you can pick whatever icon
you want so you know you can go through
here and basically whatever picture a
little icon that you want to have on the
bottom so you know what let's just for
the purposes of this video let's just
pick this little check mark works for me
now I will say one thing you can it
doesn't quite work one percent of the
time it's odd you hit apply and if you
look over here all I did was clear out
the folder what I figured out to do is
just do again just when to just click it
hit properties and then go ahead and hit
change icon just click it one more time
hit OK and I hit apply again now you see
that the icon changed I'm not really
sure what the deal is I guess that's
just a glitch in Windows 7 not really
sure but just do it twice and that that
pretty much fixes it ok so now we have
our icon it looks pretty good and
obviously if you open it up we have our
folder slash folder filled with icons
but you can be whatever folder you like
though so we have that it works good and
I will know you might want to go ahead
and you know edit like the size the
icons and stuff you know to make it fill
out the screen better you know you can
just customize that a little bit but
once you get the basics you know
everything else is simple from here okay
so once you have your the shortcut on
your desktop now it's time to go ahead
and put it down here now obviously if
you try to dry it just drag it down here
like this see it just tries to come over
here we don't want that that I mean that
just kinda looks dumb so we gotta use a
little bit of a different method so why
don't you do is
right click down here and hit lock the
toolbar so it's going to be unlocked if
I can click it right okay there we go so
now come to the top hit toolbar and then
come over and click links okay so now we
see we have a little bit of a links
toolbar looks pretty ugly right now but
that's okay okay sorry I have this but
I'm gonna go ahead and delete it
and show you guys what it looks like
again anyway okay so we can go ahead and
just drag this out just a little bit so
we have playing around now this is
really simple just go ahead and grab
your browsers or whatever full four it
is anyway grab the shortcut and drag it
into the links okay so now we have it
down there technically it works but
let's clean it up a little bit so let's
go ahead and right-click it okay now you
see show text and show title we don't
want to use these so go ahead and click
show text that won't be there anymore
and show title that won't be there
anymore so now we have it now there's
two different ways you can do it from
here you're pretty much done but it does
mostly comes down to preference
obviously you can dry it back but
there's it's not quite a hundred percent
working you can have it as a small icon
like this so let me just go ahead drag
it over here which is actually the way I
like it so you can have a little icon
right there that's the way you want go
that's fine
there's also large icons which you would
think would be the right way but it
doesn't quite work let me show you so
you hit large icon at first that looks
great but if you look over here like all
these programs I'm not so sure you guys
can see it but we're just bumped up
maybe like 10 pixels or whatever the
whole taskbar looks a little odd maybe
you like it you see look at the clock
it's a little taller um you know if you
look here like here's the camstudio if
you look on the bottom you can see a
little strip of blank and that's kind of
a little downside for some reason the
links when you add a large icon link
kind of bumps it up so you know that
kind of comes down to personal
preference whether you guys mind that or
not personally I do kind of mind it so I
like to do is I just have it small icons
and I just lock up the taskbar and I'm
done so guys that's pretty simple now
you have a folder and obviously you can
add more than one you have a folder
which can be full of applications like
this or can be just any folder
like maybe you guys know it's something
that you'd like to get to real fast but
you don't really want to have to use
Windows Explorer because you know that's
that's handy to you know just open up
your libraries so hey guys that's how to
add folders to your taskbar in Windows 7
hopefully it helps you out took me a
little bit to figure it out but it's
pretty handy anyway guys thanks for
