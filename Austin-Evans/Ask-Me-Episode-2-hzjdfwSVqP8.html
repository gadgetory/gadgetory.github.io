so if you can get familiar with what
asked me is all about it is a series
where you ask me questions pretty simple
right so of course I had a lot of really
great response a lot of good questions
and whatnot from the first episode so go
ahead and move on and continue this
series going to be doing every couple
which is so with the second one the
responding asks do i play any games in
the FPS genre uh yeah I do typically
been a pretty big fan first-person
shooters right now kind of playing
through Claude for a little bit and
battlefield bad company two but you know
throughout the years I've definitely
played lots and lots of games halo call
duty battlefield mean you name it I
pretty much played it off post
productions asks favorite pokemon that's
a tough one um I would probably have to
say umbreon because I was just loved I
loved the whole EV line cliff thought it
was really cool especially when I got my
first one way back when but yeah I price
up to embree on these newer ones not
really none of the new designs really
got me interested so yeah I probably go
with that Zita simply asks have I ever
used linux and what was my experience oh
yes actually I had used linux now I've
never used it I when does pretty much
always been my main i mean i've used mac
and i've used linux of course but i
actually did use linux for a solid week
once I just decided I was actually going
to try to a video believe this is about
a year or so ago I decided I was gonna
touch windows for an entire week I was
gonna go see how much I could do on
ubuntu i believe it was whatever was the
newest version a couple years ago um
actually I tried that and i only got
about 45 days in just because i was
having a lot of trouble doing video
editing and whatnot but I yeah I
definitely have used links quite a bit
in the past typically I've got dual
booting on one of my computers or you
know guy I've got somewhere I like it I
mean there's a lot really to like about
linux um my biggest problem with it
though is just the applications that
weren't in your life i typically you
know i like to use steam and games and
stuff i like to look for various things
such as video editing software and stuff
that you IDI daily basis and it's kind
of little hard to find that kind of
stuff on linux but of course if i ever
some of this stuff ever got moved over
there i would definitely take a closer
look Titans 91 asks what do you do when
people ask you stupid or insulting
questions well this is the internet you
know it's def
gonna happen especially once you get you
know more popularity more people
following you I definitely have trolls
and people who maybe that still means
stupid questions and insulting our kind
of a bit different I mean stupid
questions well I mean net everyone is
super technically inclined or this and
that so a lot of the time I mean if it's
questions kind of got an obvious answer
I don't really mind answering that you
know but if it's something insulting
whatever i'll usually just ignore it I
mean usually those people are just you
know just trolling or just doing
something so there's really no point in
responding or anything just just let it
be I had 19 x howell MI oh I'm actually
18 years old I'll be turning 19 about a
month or so riptide 312 asks would you
start to review console video games like
LA noir portal 2 I need your experience
on what I should spend my cash on all I
should it's a fantastic question because
it just so happens that about 44 days
ago I decided to revamp my d3 channel if
you guys have been watching me for a
while you'll know that a while back I
create a secondary channel I had an idea
for doing like really short tech videos
but I kind of realized that I do those
on my main channel so it kind of
conflicted but of course I've now
revamped it now I'm doing gaming content
on it if you guys would like to check it
out i'll have a link in the description
what I'm doing now is like a walkthrough
so I'm doing a walk walk through a far
cry two but I definitely plan on
expanding it out into reviews news plans
to be a full video game channel so I
don't have any reviews just up yet but I
definitely do have plans to start doing
reviews of all kinds of games ng DJ
music asks have you gotten attention to
3ds or are you waiting for more good
games to come out to get yours yeah you
nailed it on the second one I am waiting
for good games for it when I first came
out or rather was first announced I was
really excited for it I thought it
looked awesome but then as that kind of
time went on and we saw like the launch
lineup I literally did not see one game
that I was even remotely interested on
the launch lineup so I know I don't have
one what I am waiting for some good
games like ocarina of time starfox then
asked a lot of cool stuff at e3 and
that's probably what's going to get me
to finally go ahead and break down by
one but yeah I actually do not have one
yet the crank ain't dead asks any sense
of replacing p67 with z68 ah no not
really I do have a z68 motherboard
my computer and while you know tends
towards your spine or whatever there's
not a whole lot new I mean the
solid-state driving solid state drive
caching is ok but personally I just
refer to Justin by solid-state drive and
just you know manually do it myself get
a little bit better performance that way
and also like you know having
overclocked graphics are nice but to be
honest I think for the vast majority
you're going to want to dedicate GPU so
does easiest d8 if you're going to buy a
brand new and it pretty much makes sense
because it's about the same price and
you get a couple of extra features but
if you already have a p67 board I
wouldn't even consider it you've got
something that's just fine ZZ electronic
asks what youtuber inspired me to start
doing these videos and what youtubers do
i watch now well as far as who got me
started or who inspired me to get
started I was used to watch a lot of
like iphone and like app review kind of
people so you know extra reviewer
iPhones and iPods i touch ipods iron man
3 33333 a lot of old guys some of them
are still installed and still making
videos but i mean i started watching a
lot of those guys back then i was like
hey that doesn't seem like it's too bad
forget the fact that i have no camera
terrible my terrible computer just an
ipod i can do those videos but i
definitely glad I did it but yeah those
are kind of guys who got me inspired and
I was like seeing how they were making
videos and they were getting views and
stuff in my ki think I could do that I'm
as far as people I watched right now I
watch a lot of YouTube as you as i'm
sure you guys do as well um as far as
like on the general kind of stuff i
really love like Freddie Wong's videos
I'm i also do enjoy watching all kinds
of stuff now put me on the spot like
digitalrev TV I love them Linus tech
tips man better I could probably go on
all day long they'll watch some
starcraft commentators like
HuskyStarcraft ensure a lot of you guys
follow him HD Dana I mean I I probably
even subscribe to like 90 100 people and
I pretty much watch all the videos so
yeah I watch a ton of YouTube and pretty
much all kinds of different genres and a
lot going to get stuff anyway guys
that's it for episode 2 of ask me so if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
more comments down below I ask me
whatever you like of course I can't
answer all the questions I had about a
hundred comments last week but I'll do
my best to go ahead answer
many of your questions in the can next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
