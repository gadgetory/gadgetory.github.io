today I'm here with my very first phone
review of the LG VX 5500 for Verizon
Wireless I've used this phone for about
two weeks or so tested the calls the
camera and all kinds of different stuff
about it so go ahead and give you guys a
forward view tell you what I think about
it anyway
let's get this one started okay so first
thing I got to mention is the size this
is a obviously a flip phone as you see
it it's pretty small but I want to show
you guys how small it is here's my iPod
Touch and you can see I mean it is
I mean tiny it's a little bit thicker
but what really got me was it's about
the size of an an iPod Nano
and if you look I mean it's very small
and as such it's great for sliding in
your pocket everything it does not
really weigh anything I mean really it's
it's really solid so that's the first
thing I really like about this phone I
mean the fact that you can just tossing
pocket really forget about it but
there's also a lot of other cool things
so the first thing obviously you'll
notice is that camera focus is that we
have at two screens you have a screen
primary screen right there so obviously
you know for as normal
we also have a one inch screen right
here so it'll tell you incoming calls
all kinds of stuff at bat and when you
have it open it will tell you the time
and it's definitely a nice little touch
especially for something that's this
thin let me go ahead and run you guys
through all what's on it so obviously we
have the one inch screen right here is
where the speakerphone is and the
speakerphone does sound pretty decent at
this phone
here you have a tiny little 0.3
megapixel camera it only does shoot
stills it does not shoot video and
they're not that great
the pictures but it's you know it's just
something kind of
have I guess now looking on the right
side it's totally free and clear except
to a dedicated camera button so we open
it up hit the button right here and now
as you can see we have the camera so
let's go ahead and take a picture of
this and then there we go and then you
can then you have choices to save send
or erase the let's go ahead and erase
that and then you can go in here my
pictures and then just show you guys a
demo real quick it does not take good
pictures I mean they're they're pretty
small and they're kind of junk but you
know it's better than nothing on the
front you'll see nothing it's just
smooth now on this side you will see
there's a few things you see here's
something to hook up like a headset or
something yeah it's not you can't hook
up a normal microphone I mean you do
hook up a normal microphone this will
not fit a normal thing such as like
speaker your headphones or anything like
that so you have to have a special the
special kind for that the flats are not
that great but now you have volume up
and down so I'll just call volume if we
go ahead and turn it up turn it down you
know pretty pretty standard stuff right
here we have voice commands voice
commands are actually pretty cool so
let's go ahead and show you guys a time
so we hit that so with this you can say
all kinds different commands you can say
send message to go to check item you see
all kinds different stuff like that and
lastly on this side underneath this flap
which I hate this flap I gotta admit
it's not it's kind of hard because you
actually have to pick it up there we go
but you will see we have micro USB and
this is used for both charging using the
the charger that comes with it and also
you can do limited syncing with your
computer but I will note it's only got
like 44 megabytes of storage and
you can't expand it so you're probably
not really going to need that but it's
not a big deal on the bat it's nothing
actually if you guys can see it's got a
different plate like that all plastic
but it's pretty solid and underneath
this actually it's a 1000 million hour
battery and I got to say battery life
the two main things I like about this or
battery life and I like the size battery
life on this and they rate it to be 14
hours I mean 14 14 days of standby time
and I can absolutely I can absolutely
see that in the time I've used this with
I spent a week without charging this
using keeping it on almost all the time
and making some light to moderate call
usage and the battery is only got down
to about half so I got to say the
battery life is just just excellent you
know and maybe go ahead and doing all
kinds of stuff and it really doesn't
matter so those two are major things if
you're not looking for you know a big
smartphone that's definitely a really
good way to go okay so let's take a look
at the inside of the phone as you see
here you have the screen and it is very
very fingerprint I mean you see their
fingerprints are all over the place
you have the speaker and they come down
here you have a standard for just a
normal phone you have your buttons you
have a sort of you have a d-pad not a
d-pad but Africa that's called
you have your four buttons navigation
buttons there we go okay you have your
speakerphone turned on and off your
clear which also doubles as a back
button the send and end which obviously
end the doubles as a power key and then
you have your standard buttons and they
everything does light up and I got to
say the feel of it I don't know if you
can see right there the feel that is
very nice it really feels like an
expensive phone you know it's obviously
you don't have any kind of keyboard on
it so you're not really going to be
doing a lot of texting on it but I've
messed around some and it really feels
good so it's really solid and that goes
for the whole
the build quality is really solid if I
take it like this you guys might be able
to see you can kind of twist it a little
bit and right there it can kind of do it
but honestly I wouldn't worry about it
it's solid I mean as long as you're not
really try to try that hard I wouldn't
worry about it and of course I've
dropped the phone
you know I've dropped the phone a few
times and it's been just fine so there's
a few there's two different features
there's web browsing there's well you
can do web browsing it's a feature phone
I mean you guys saw how small the screen
is it's not great and I wouldn't really
recommend using this maybe as an
emergency but then you gotta get data
plans and all kind of stuff like that so
really I would steer clear the web
browser it also does have assisted GPS
and also you can get it with the Verizon
Navigator service I have not tried this
so I really can't say anything about it
other than the phone does have it so
some up I like the phone a lot um you
know a lot of people like you know on
Verizon for example you have some really
good competition like in the Droid and
also the Nexus One will be coming here
soon
but this is not going to be you know a
smart phone this is just a standard
boring in the best and supported phone I
mean it's not exciting um it's it's it's
there's nothing that you know you show
your friends going to go WOW but guess
what it's a solid foam it's built well
great battery life it's pretty decent
you you have your camera phone and all
kinds of good stuff like that if you're
interested in buying this phone it will
run you free or a penny they say but
basically free if you get it from
Verizon Wireless on a contract and you
also can get this prepaid so if you
don't like to do with contracts whatever
you can get this pick this up prepaid
and you know do the minutes like that
gentle it's $50 although I did see at
the time of this that a few places had
it for cheaper than that so if you're
interested in that you might want to
look around before you you pay the $50
in any case if you're looking for just a
standard feature phone
it's hard to go wrong with this Verizon
Wireless coverage I really like that
I've just recently taken a trip and had
great coverage the whole way I really
like Verizon so all in all pretty solid
foam no real downsides to it other than
it's not a smart phone and nobody needs
us not everybody needs a smart phone so
anyway guys definitely recommend it if
you're interested in something like this
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
