video going over ccleaner for Mac now
ccleaner has been one of my favorite
programs on Windows for quite a while
and it just come out of beta on OS 10 so
download it of course I have a link in
the description of this video you
downloaded at piriform comm and that's
how you say it anyway
Billy just give you guys a little
example of what CCleaner is all about so
as you may have guessed from the name
ccleaner is all about clearing up the
junk on your computer now of course
there's a lot of stuff on Windows and
people you know give Windows a bad rap
for that however you can definitely get
some junk on your you know your Mac
which can definitely slow it down
and of course just eat up disk space and
all kinds of stuff so this is a great
way to keep it nice and clean so it
split up into a couple of categories
I'll try to go through them as briefly
as I can so over here you can go ahead
and clear out web browsers so just as
far as like things that come
automatically installed in OS 10 so
let's say for example we want to have
Safari totally clean just like a brand
new install so we can delete cookies
history cache all that kind of stuff you
know I don't actually think I'm going to
do that but if you wanted to you know
always it is kind of nice to have
something that's you know kind of like a
brand new fresh browser over here you
can take care of system things so for
example it can automatically delete our
trash recent documents application
server so I'm gonna go ahead and remove
the servers and leave probably
everything else alone
there's also system applications so we
can clean out the junk now do keep in
mind it's not like wiping everything so
what it's doing is its wiping out like
system file I mean that system I'll
temporary files generally it's not going
to maybe affect anything major of course
if you delete cookies and all that kind
of stuff it can do but in general just
going to do kind of behind the scenes
step just kind of speed everything up on
top of that you also do have access for
third-party applications so for Chrome
I'm not going to delete anything kind of
like to have all my my things still
saved but as far as applications go we
can go ahead and just let it clean up
all this stuff there's probably not
going to be that much but we can take a
look so once you go through everything
what you can do is you can quit just
clean or we can analyze so I'm going to
do is analyze and here we go so this is
the analysis I wouldn't go ahead and
remove about 7.5 gigs or so worth of
stuff
pretty much all that's in my trash but
we can see here there is some software
update there's like 15 Meg's there
iTunes had some stuff QuickTime had for
some reason 98 megabytes so there's all
kinds of stuff once we figured out we go
okay that we we don't want any the steps
just hit clean and woosh it'll be gone
and we just say 7.5 gigs on our hard
drive which is pretty cool
especially if you have a small SSD like
I do now there also some other tools
here so for example you can uninstall
things very simply so let's say I no
longer wanted a VLC or whatever I could
just uninstall it straight from here
nothing spectacular but it is nice to
have all this in one area you can also
repair permissions so if there's
something wrong you can easily just say
okay I'm going to repair it or verify or
whatever and you can also erase free
space on your drive which I don't
recommend if you have a solid-state
drive but if you want to go ahead and
make sure that no one like for example
if you're selling your Mac whatever this
is a good way to go and lastly there's a
kind of cool little feature that allows
you to delete cookies individually so
let's say of course you know cookies are
the little bits of information that your
web browser will download from pretty
much any site as you guys can see here a
lot of this stuff is not anything I want
I don't want one 12.2 oh seven dotnet
like that a lot of this is from
advertisers or whatnot so you know if I
wanted to leet all these but still can't
see save a couple so for example you
know I want to stay signed into YouTube
and Google so I can go ahead and move a
couple over here and then I going to go
through all these on camera that we
probably take quite a while but you can
go through and keep all the cookies that
you want delete the rest and you're
going to be good to go anyway guys it's
going to be about it for my little video
on ccleaner for Macs I highly recommend
it it's a great program like I said I
love it on Windows and now that's over
on OS 10 doesn't going to be using it
quite a bit anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave
it a thumbs up and if you're interested
