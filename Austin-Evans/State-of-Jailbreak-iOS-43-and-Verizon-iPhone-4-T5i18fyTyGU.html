another state of jailbreak video and
today I'm going to be talking all about
iOS 4.3 so in addition to talking about
the jailbreak I'm also gonna go ahead
and talk about just the firmware itself
in case you don't already know so go
ahead just to begin with iOS 4.3 is
going to be available most likely early
next month probably coinciding with the
Verizon iPhone release it's going to
bring a couple of new features for the
different devices so the main thing is
that it's going to allow airplay to work
with apps so that way it should be you
know it opens up a lot of possibilities
for different apps on your iPod or
iPhone go ahead and simply just go ahead
and touch send the video over across
using airplay which is typically been
pretty much restricted until now so
that's pretty cool on the iPad it's also
going to be a really cool feature that
allows you to go ahead and just swipe up
to pull up the multitasking bar as well
as to swipe left and right to go ahead
and switch apps which is definitely very
very cool feature now on to some of the
bad bad news which is the fact that
looks like iOS 4.3 will not support the
iPhone 3G and the iPod Touch 2nd
generation so actually this is kind of
surprising you know we've typically had
support for them you know judging from
last year where we had all the way up to
iOS 4 it looks like Apple's not gonna
bother bringing it any farther it looks
like if you have one of those devices
it's gonna be the end of the line you're
never gonna get any more updates so
that's kind of a disappointment
now that was getting away from that go
ahead and talking about the jailbreak
itself now of course is you guys most
likely know there are a couple of
untethered jailbreak that are currently
in development so there's one red snow
which is going to be which requires
access to the iOS 4.2 beta 3 sh-sh blobs
and the firmware you can currently use
that for on 4.2.1 right now no word
whether or not that's going to work on
4.3 but I think that the odds are pretty
good
and of course 4.3 also should work with
the same line rain exploit that we've
used for quite a while um however with
the Verizon iPhone acai and get a little
complicated so basically what the
question is is whether or not apple has
patched the lime rain exploit now a lot
of people tend to think they have and in
that case it's possible that will fall
back to shatter or something else so
there's a lot of things going on and
really not clear what jailbreak we will
be using here in a month or two but do
know that there are a lot of exploits
available there are a lot of different
methods in doing this so one way or the
other we should have ourselves a
jailbreak for the Verizon iPhone as well
as just devices on 4.3 in general pretty
soon so guys that's it just want to give
you guys a quick update just talking a
little bit about 4.3 the Verizon iPhone
what we're gonna do about jailbreaking
all that kind of stuff so yeah anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
