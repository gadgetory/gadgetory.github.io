the demo of gameplay on the PlayStation
Vita the first game will be taking a
look at is uncharted golden abyss as the
main launch towel Sony is promoting the
game has some very nice graphics it's
not as good as Uncharted on the ps3 but
for a handheld console showed up a few
low resolution textures it looks good
and runs smoothly what really sets
Uncharted apart are the controls in
addition to the normal fiscal controls
which works similarly to the ps3
controller it also uses all the other
methods the Vita has there's the touch
screen which you can use for QuickTime
events such as clearing a path or
tracing the line for Drake to follow the
rear touch panel can also be used for
zooming in the scope of your rifle which
actually works really well
and finally when aiming you can tilt the
video to get your shot lined up nicely
well uncharted isn't a hands-down
amazing game it definitely looks good
and uses the Vita controls well the next
game is little deviants this game is
mostly known for using the rear touch
panel to be able to push the ground up
to roll your character around well it's
a very cool tech demo it doesn't really
work as well as I'd hoped
it's hard to know exactly where your
finger is on the back side of the Vita
so the controls are a bit shaky on the
upside the game is vibrant and it also
runs very smoothly something I can say
about every videogame I've tried so far
the last game in my favorite launch tale
so far is Super Stardust Delta this is a
download-only game in the PlayStation
Store for $10 and it's a ton of fun
it's a twin stick spaceship shooter on a
3d world like in Super Mario Galaxy
where you have to avoid being hit by the
many obstacles and enemies while blowing
up as much as you can
combined with the Vita's fantastic oled
screen and the super smooth gameplay it
all adds up to an experience that really
highlights what the Vita is capable of
