and give you the full comparison between
the main phones on verizon the droid
lineup of course it's the HTC droid
incredible the motorola droid eggs and
the upcoming motorola droid 2 so guys
I'm gonna go ahead and compare them give
you get some more information hopefully
help you make a decision on which one
you might want okay so let's go ahead
and start out by taking a look at the
HTC droid incredible I'm so guys this
one's been out for just a little while
but still really really solid boom okay
so some of the specs art it has a 3.7
inch AMOLED display an 8 megapixel cam 8
gigabytes of internal memory Android it
runs android 2.1 with since it does have
a 1 gigahertz snapdragon processor so
guys this is a really solid phone
probably one of the best phones around
right now you know it doesn't it's not
doesn't have one of these huge screens
like the HTC evo 4g over on sprint you
know let's have a front facing camera
like the iphone 4 but guys really it is
a really solid phone I mean it's a
fairly compact compared to some of the
other larger phones it does of course
have android 2.1 like i said with sense
on the snapdragon processor is a very
very solid processor it's a really good
phone unfortunately though guys there
looks like it's starting to you know
fall back some there are some really
really good phones coming up ok guys so
the next time i'm going to be taking a
look at this a motorola droid eggs I'm
so guys this is a really big phone in
more than one ways so I'm go ahead give
you guys a reminder of it so guys it
does have a 4.3 inch display it has an 8
megapixel camera with 720p
high-definition video recording three
microphones one for a mountain oyster
cancellation one on the front one in the
back for video recording it has an 8
gigabyte internal memory as well as a 16
gigabyte micro-sd card android 2.1 with
a custom motorola interface not water
it's something else they don't really
have a name for it on it that guys and
this have a 1 gigahertz OEM AP processor
so guys this process was really fast on
it means it's probably a good step up
from the Snapdragon processors that
we're used to seeing on a lot of android
phones I'm so guys the motorola droid x
looks really really solid you know i
like the fact that it's you know it's a
big phone but
isn't just near a standard you know just
another HTC phone we keep seeing you
know every day it seems mean somewhat
unique with the motorola interface it
also does have of course the different
processor which should be even faster ok
guys so the next one we would be taking
a look at is the successors the original
droid the motorola droid 2 i'm so guys
before we again this one has not been
officially confirmed we've heard this
from a verizon representative we've
heard it from you know a lot of
different sources but before we began
just want to let you guys know take it
with a grain of salt everything looks
pretty solid but you know you never know
I'm saying it guys the motorola droid 2
looks like it will have a 3.7 inch
screen just like the original droid a 5
megapixel camera android 2.2 froyo most
likely and a gigabyte SD card as well as
8 gigabytes of internal memory and
lastly the same 1 gigahertz chip from
the droid x I'm so guys this bone is
looking pretty solid probably one of the
major things they did because obviously
the screen a lot of it looks the same is
they redesigned the keyboard and that's
a great thing in my opinion the original
droid keyboard wasn't terrible but this
new one looks quite a bit better it now
has a full keyboard from edge to edge so
all the keys a little bit bigger they
look like they have a better feedback to
them and all in all it just looks like a
really solid upgrade ok guys so
hopefully now you have a pretty good
idea of what all the major droid phones
on verizon are about I'm so guys
personally you know a lot of people i'm
sure you guys are asking the same thing
which one should you get well i think
that there's a case for all any of them
you know if you have you know if you
don't like really large phones you want
to know keep something that's a little
bit smaller but still have plenty of
power and obviously but an android that
HTC droid incredible is a really solid
choice um that said if you want to go
ahead and move up you really want a full
slide out keyboard which looks to be
pretty solid maybe you're coming off of
a blackberry or something like that and
the motorola droid 2 is probably the one
you're going to want to go for
personally in my opinion though guys i
would pick a droid x yes it is really
pretty large you know so maybe if you
have smaller hands or you don't really
want to be carrying a lot of stuff i
guess but the guys i think between the
really nice screen the very fast
processor and the fact that it just
seems to be a really solid phone
actually
us have of course the motorola interface
which is jus pros a few things it's not
quite as in-depth as on your HTC sense
but still it's really solid so guys if
I'm behind a phone right today or rather
once it comes out if I'm going boy by
while I'm go go ahead and get the droid
x so what do you think doesn't let me
know in the comments are used to make it
the droid incredible are you looking for
the Droid X or are you just going to
wait for the droid two then they let me
know I'm pretty interested to know what
you guys are interested in any way
