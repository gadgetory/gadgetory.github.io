is a gaming PC for $2,500
now this is about as expensive and as
high-end as it gets while still being in
the realm of sanity so of course you can
spend way more on a computer but kind of
beyond this point you kind of hit the
point of diminishing returns so you want
spend another $500 oh it might be 5%
faster I spend another thousand dollars
I might be 10 percent faster so you're
not really gonna be getting those kind
of huge performance gains as you do
going from something like the thousand
dollar bill to this for CPU we're going
to be using an Intel Core i7 3770k
processor now this is a killer CPU it is
a four core design but it does have
hyper threading which means that windows
will see it as an eight core CPU now the
base clock speed is only three point
four Giga or rather three point five
gigahertz
but this is very very overclockable
thanks to that case series branding so
with the Senate that we have in this
build you should easily able to get well
over four gigahertz probably closer to
four point five strictly for gaming this
isn't that much better than the core i5
however it does have some other
advantages for example if you ever would
like to do some video editing virtual
machines 3d rendering that kind of thing
then the extra performance of the quiet
seven will definitely come in handy all
for about three hundred twenty dollars
for a CPU cooler we're going to be using
a corsair h 100 eye now this is what i
use in my own build and i've been very
impressed with it so far pretty much my
only slight complaint is that the fans
can get a little loud but thanks to the
built-in corsair link software you can
go ahead and adjust the fan speed and
the curves straight from the OS so just
open up the corsair link software and
you're going to be good to go there now
as far as the h100 igoe's itself is an
all-in-one liquid cooler so that means
that everything you need is totally
built in you're not to worry about
filling it or doing anything else pretty
much just mount it onto your cpu put the
radiator into the top of the case and
you're good to go speaking of that
radiator it is a dual 240 millimeter
radiator with a pair of 120 millimeter
fans aka all the geek talk aside this is
going to deliver a lot of really great
cooling performance for only buy one
hundred and ten dollars for the graphics
cards we're going to be using a pair of
msi geforce gtx 680 s now these are some
of the best GPUs on the market period so
when you put two of them together in SLI
expect some really really awesome
performance now these aren't just any
old gtx 680 s these are both the msi
overclocked edition with our twin
frozen's of cooling and on top of that
they both do have 4 gigabytes of RAM
built in this is important as a normal
gtx 680 only has 2 gigabytes of memory
now when you're only playing on a single
monitor this really does
come into play however when you're
playing some really insane resolutions
with multiple monitors that for goodbye
it's a dedicated memory makes a big
difference and allowing you to play all
the best games and all the greatest
settings now this is going to be very
pricey so both of the GPUs together can
run you over $1,000 for a motherboard
we're going to be using an assay
Bertuzzi 77 now this is bar none one of
the best motherboards that money can buy
so for starters it has a very very
unique look with their sous Thermal
Armor so you take a look at it it
basically has a lot of well Thermal
Armor all over the motherboard now this
helps protect it as far as heat and all
that kind of stuff it also really looks
nice inside your case it also has all
the features you would expect so of
course you can overclock your cry 7 with
this board it supports up to 32
gigabytes of memory you have full
support for USB 3 SATA 3 as well as PCI
3 and more importantly than all of that
it has a very very good build quality
and a 5 year warranty so this board is
built to last all for about $240 for
memory we're going to be using 16
gigabytes of Samsung ddr3 RAM now I'm a
huge fan of this stuff I use it in all
kinds of my bills and that's because it
works so for starters it's fairly cheap
which hey even on an expensive bill
that's always good to save a little bit
of money and on top of that it delivers
some absolutely stellar performance so
by default it ships with a clock speed
at 1600 megahertz which is fine you can
leave it that and you have no problem
but it is very easy to overclock the
stuff to 1866 megahertz or even higher
so all this for about $90 for 16 bytes
is gonna be a great deal for an SSD
we're going to be using a 128 gigabyte
Samsung 840 pro series drive now this is
in my opinion the best 2.5 inch SSD out
there I is one of my own build and I've
used Samsung SSDs for a while and never
had any problems with them so then not
only did deliver some absolutely stellar
performance but they also give you good
reliability which is you know good combo
so of course with the 840 pro you also
do have a couple of other options so
again with this built I chose to go with
a 128 gigabyte version as we have a
normal hard drive for other you know
files and all that kind of stuff
but if you want more storage you can
also bump this up to either 256
kilobytes or 512 gigabytes and all the
links will be in the description of this
video however if you want go ahead and
stick with you 1 and 28 gigabyte version
of this SSD it's gonna run you about
$150 for a hard drive we're going to be
using a 2 terabyte Western Digital
caviar black now I'm a huge fan of SSDs
they do have one problem and that is
they get very expensive when you try to
get
and higher capacities so this story of
trying to find a 2 terabyte SSD for us
instead we're going to be pairing a hard
drive with a normal SSD to get the best
of both worlds so with the SSD you put
all your major things for example
windows you major programs your gains
that kind of stuff
and for the rest of everything else you
go ahead and put it on the hard drive so
you still have access to it but it
doesn't have to be you know taking up
all that space on your SSD so 2
terabytes of storage is gonna give you
plenty of room and on top of that the
caviar black is one of the fastest hard
drives out there all for about $180 for
a power supply we're going to be using a
corsair ax 850 now when you're doing a
major build like this with sli graphics
cards overclocked CPU hard drives SSDs
all the kind of bells and whistles
inside the rig you definitely do not
want to skimp on the power supply so of
course you need the standard kind of
stuff like enough wattage obviously to
power at all but you also want to make
sure that you get quality and that's
what the corsair x-series provides so of
course you get plenty of power to handle
your graphics cards and all that kind of
flat stuff but it also is a modular
power supply so helps kind of keep your
cable management nice and neat it's all
for about $140 for a case we're going to
be using the corsair obsidian 650d now a
case is very important obviously as this
is what your build looks like so if you
get a green and purple case well your
builds gonna be green and purples so
there's a lot of things to keep in mind
with a case not only of course with
performance and the good size and all
that kind of stuff but also the
aesthetics now I'm a big fan of the 650d
is I think it looks very very nice clean
it does have a window so you can see all
your cool components inside it also does
have a pair of 200 millimeter fans with
an integrated fan controller so you're
going to get some really nice airflow
through this case over by $150 for an
optical drive we're going to be using an
LG blu-ray burner now an optical drive
is something that I consider optional on
most of my builds however with something
this high-end I think it does make sense
to go ahead and include a blu-ray drive
so you can watch your movies DVDs CDs
all that kind of fun stuff now of course
if you're not interested in this feel
free to jettison it it's Jennison yeah
that's that's the word jettison jettison
the DVD Drive just on the blu-ray drive
I'm gonna stick with that because it
sounds cool anyway if you're not
interested in having this you can by
foul means jettison it and go ahead and
just use a DVD driver in fact not even
use an optical drive that's what I'm
doing in my rig right now but if you do
think that you're ever gonna need to
watch blu-rays or install DVDs or
whatever this is a good option for about
$75 for an operating system you have the
choice between Windows 7
Windows 8 so I didn't make this decision
for you guys so I left this out of the
bill and I will put links to both of
these in the description so whichever
one you want to go with you can so there
are pros and cons with both Windows 7 is
tried tested true it's a very excellent
operating system I used it for many
years
however Windows 8 is the newer version
of that so it brings some questionable
improvements so the new interface is a
little huh well it doesn't work too well
on a desktop but the good thing is you
can pretty much entirely ignore it so I
use Windows 8 on my own system and
basically I just ignore the Metro UI and
use it kind of like a faster or more
responsive Windows 7 also one thing to
keep in mind is that what Microsoft is
starting to face Windows 7 out so by the
time you watch this video it actually
may not be available for sale so well in
that case your kind of mind is made up
regardless though if you do want to pick
up a copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 it
will run you about $100 so there you
guys have it an awesome twenty five
hundred dollar gaming PC of course
prices are constantly fluctuating so
I'll put links to all the best prices in
the description of this video if you
guys are interested in more I have lots
more computer builds that everything
from under $400 all the way up to this
so no matter what your budget is
hopefully I do have a build that you
might be interested in so again go ahead
check that out if you guys are
interested and if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel anyway
guys I will catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
