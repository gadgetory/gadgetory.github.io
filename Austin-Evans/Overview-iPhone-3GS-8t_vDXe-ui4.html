wrapped up and overall I think he was a
great show everything from snow leopard
QuickTime to Safari was covered but I'm
going to focus on the next iPhone iPhone
3GS let's get this one started
the iphone 3gs is almost entirely an
update to the iPhone 3G the focus is on
speed and it's the s in the name
everything from launching messages to
loading apps to viewing attachments is
at least two times faster although it
must be said not everything will be
faster which is slightly confusing as
they pretty much touted that everything
would be faster and then said that not
everything would be faster so that ones
just have to wait to see what how it
goes there's also a brand new 3
megapixel autofocus camera which also
includes video some video that was shot
by an iphone 3gs was shown and it was
certainly very impressive
they also mentioned that you can edit as
well oh this really wasn't shown the
video can be sent through email mms as
well as you through youtube one of the
best features is voice control if you
hold down the home button a new
interface will pop up it's very
straightforward and it's definitely a
big step up from the 3G using voice
control you can do everything from
making calls with your voice to
controlling iTunes and more in example
you can ask the phone what's playing now
and it will speak the title and artist
back to you the feature really wasn't
demo but it already looks very promising
assuming this is at least fairly
accurate this should be a must-have as
many people thought there's also a new
built-in digital compass there's also a
new compass app that Google comes with
the phone as well you can tap to go
right into maps and if you tap it a
second time it will orient the map to
where you're facing along with the
compass comes support from Nike Plus
which as you will probably already know
has been around for the Nano and I touch
for quite a while now all 3G asses will
have hardware encryption which should be
something that will help the iPhone with
businesses in addition there's also some
very very improved battery life in the
3GS with up to 5 hours of 3G talktime
and nine hours of Wi-Fi internet it
usually add an improvement of least two
hours over the 3G the 3GS will come in
two memory configurations 16 gigabytes
and 13 and 32 gigabytes which will sell
for $199 and $299
respectively the same two colors white
and black walls to be sold in addition
the normal iPhone 3G a gigabyte will
continue to be sold until they are out
as $99 as of today all iPhone 3GS will
be $99 assuming that there are eight
gigs they didn't say anything about any
price reductions on any remaining 16 or
32 gigabyte models so we'll just have to
wait and see what's going on with that
the iPhone 3GS will be available June
19th two days after the 3.0 software
update will be released for everyone
personally I think the WWDC went very
well and I like the new iPhone well it
is basically the 3G with some upgraded
internals a few extra software features
and an extra camera it still sound solid
be sure to stay tuned for lots more
videos on the Worldwide Developers
Conference

the laced F reviews iPhone and iPod
