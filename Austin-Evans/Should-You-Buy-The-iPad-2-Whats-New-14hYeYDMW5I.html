What's New</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2011-03-12</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/14hYeYDMW5I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">hey guys it's Dan here with an overview
of what all is new in the iPad 2 so you
know there's a lot of people out there
I'm sure Paul you might be one of them
who are considering buying the iPad 2 is
your first iPad or you have the original
iPad you're like well is this worth it
or not
so I'm going to go ahead and go through
some of the new features and help you
make your own minds up about that so the
first thing you'll notice is that now
comes in two colors so when I had the
white model right here what you can
still get in the exact same black as
before it'll look very similar from the
front whatever if you want to spice it
up a little bit you can pick it up in
white now in renders and pictures and
that sort of thing but what if it looks
pretty bad however in person I'm really
a fan of it I think it looks very nice
especially when you flip it over it goes
really nicely with the aluminum back
finish on the floor so this one is still
going to be up to you know your
preference whether you know you want to
go ahead and get something that's I'd
say why it's probably a bit better with
fingerprints I mean you really can't see
them compared to the black but again
that's just gonna be entirely up to you
know what you like but if you're
interested in getting white I would have
no problems with it
everything looks put together right and
it looks pretty nice in person so in
addition to that there also is a new 3G
model so in addition to the same 16 32
and 64 gigabyte capacities and Wi-Fi and
3G you can now pick 3G for AT&amp;amp;T or
various GSM s you know networks around
the world or you can pick it up for CDMA
which is primarily used in the United
States for Verizon Wireless so you do
have the options there if you're
interested in getting 3G for your tablet
now moving on there are also a couple of
new major new features and cameras so of
course you have a front-facing VGA
camera now that's pretty much going to
be the exact same camera from the iPhone
4 and the iPod Touch 4th generation you
can expect ok quality obviously it's not
going to be amazing but for FaceTime and
that sort of thing is going to be great
speaking of FaceTime of course the iPad
2 does come with FaceTime FaceTime if
you're not aware already it was a just
an app for the iPhone iPod Mac and the
iPad twos it allows you to just video
chat I'm so that works really quite
nicely it's very smooth very seamless
experience although do keep in mind that
you will need to stay on Wi-Fi to use
FaceTime so we flipped the iPad over on
the back here
a couple of new features here so most
notably you'll find another camera this
is going to be a 720p rear-facing camera
and it's actually again this is going to
be pretty much the exact same camera
from the iPod Touch 4th generation aka
pretty decent for video as long as
you're in really good light I mean
that's about the best thing I can say
this camera gets really really
dramatically worse when it gets you know
and standard lighting you know it's just
not very good at all however like I said
guys you're not going to be wanting to
use an iPad as a camera I know this
thing is way too big and heavy to hold
out you know use as a camera just kind
of it's a little silly so for FaceTime
that sort of thing that's going to work
fine
I now are on the back of go ahead and
show you guys here and there also is a
new speaker so as you can see right
there there is a speaker on the bottom
ah that is actually working really well
a surprise the audio quality from the
iPad 2 is really really quite
exceptional of course now it's not gonna
go blow anyone away but as far as the
tablet goes this is plenty of Sam
absolutely great for movies music
playing games and all that sort of thing
something really really impressive with
the iPad 2 is the thinness this is
extremely thin in fact if I pull in an
iPod Touch 4th generation you'll see
that it's even thinner than that
although do keep in mind that with a
case off it's going to be that are going
to be about the same the iPod might be a
tiny bit thinner but the iPad 2 is just
absolutely crazy thin it's thinner than
an iPhone 4 and much thinner than the
original iPad I know what this is going
to do of course you know you think well
tablets you know you know who cares
about the thinness however that's a
really big deal for the iPad you know of
course when you're holding it like this
it's nice and lightweight and it feels
very very good in the hand is you know
it's just nice smooth finish so you can
just hold it in there you know do what
every type so well it kind of seems like
a little bit of a you know a small thing
that's actually one of my favorite
things about the iPad 2 feels right in
the hand and it really works well and
then moving on from that there are only
a couple of major other things as far as
the UI goes exact same as on the iPad 1
so you know iOS is still here you can
still go through your apps of course you
do have rotation so you can do it
however you like however there are a
couple of
improvements inside the iPad so the
first one is is that there is now a
dual-core one gigahertz Apple a5
processor what this means in
non-technical terms this thing is fast
so you can go ahead and review websites
really quickly apply really nice apps in
fact some games on the iPad 2 are really
going to look great there are some
really key improvements that Apple has
made things as far as in the graphics
department so games are going to look
great you've got also additional RAM and
a gyroscope which will make those motion
control games a little bit better and of
course even in this thinner package you
still have the same really really
impressive 10-hour battery life in fact
I've had this since yesterday had not
even plugged it in once it came with
like 90% charge and playing around with
it for you know several hours now it's
still at 65% so you know battery life is
not going to be an issue as far as I can
tell on the iPad 2 anyway guys that's
about it for the you know the new
different things as far as the iPad 2
compared to the iPad 1 now well as its
worth the upgrade it's kind of hard to
say if you already have an iPad 1 your
iPad is not suddenly a you know an
obsolete piece of junk it's still a
great tablet and iPad 2 just refines it
just add some nice new features that are
nice to have if you can afford to no to
sell your iPad or upgrade however if you
can't don't really worry too much this
is nice but it's not a 100% you know you
turn is just absolutely stunning all
that kind of stuff it's a really nice
piece of tech but just not a absolute
absolute must-have gadget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
