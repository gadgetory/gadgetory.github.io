I'm here with my sixth application
review which going to focus on some free
apps of that I've got three of them here
I've gone i'm going to review the
hysteria project light pretty cool
creepy very unique game i'm gonna review
tap punk which is a really fun game I've
really been coming back to a lot lately
i'm gonna i'm going to review seat ibiza
cupra race which is a pretty cool free
racing game you guys probably want check
out so let's get this one started
okay the first app that'll be reviewing
today is called hysteria project light
now obviously this is the lite version
of the full one I'll go over i'll tell
you a little bit more about the full and
later but while those i'll stick with
the lite version right now um basically
you know I know there's name for this
and I'm totally don't but I don't know
what the name of them are but basically
this is it's less of a gang it doesn't
actually use graphics basically it's a
series of video cutscenes and basically
what it is is it's a really creepy
really really well done and basically
what you are and it's like I said it's
video it's real it was probably some guy
I guess he had a camera on like a helmet
camera or whatever but basically this is
all real got some really cool effects
basically you're somebody who was I
guess taken or whatever and you're
waking up in this like shed this guy
ties you up and then he leaves and
there's these really creepy mark on the
door and basically you figure out how
you want to escape and you know is your
face totally in your hands it's really
cool it's it's nice it's all the
cutscenes it's basically like the video
you're basically watching because like I
said I mean it's totally real it's not
like computer or anything anything I'm
sorry anything basically it is is you
wake up the lite version is very short
also it's mean you will you will get
through it very very quickly but the
thing is you basically your wake up and
then you have it's not like you're
watching you get prompt there are prompt
on the screen which sometimes you will
tap the screen to do something while in
the middle of a cutscene or the cutscene
will stop and it'll give you some
options saying like do you want to run
or do you want to stay and look for
something to defend yourself or whatever
it's now I will say it's well it's very
creepy and you will you know I mean you
won't cry scare you but it will mean
less you're really scared easily but
it's very interesting it's very cool um
I won't go too much into it lite
versions very simple if you I would
probably recommend it's a very unique
one I definitely recommend
at the lite version if you think you
might like it ah personally the full
version is a dollar it's on sale right
now um if you want uh you can go ahead
and upgrade personally I'm not going to
but that doesn't take away from the fact
that hit this does look like a pretty
cool app and yeah so you guys might just
wanna go check it out but my second
application review is going to be called
tap punk this is a free one it's really
simple yet it's something I keep coming
back to I'm having a lot of fun with it
basically it's almost like a very slim
down version I don't know if you guys it
was a little while back there's a an app
that came out called beat maker which is
basically you could take different parts
of songs that you can download or get
however and I take small parts of the
sound of the song then it would turn
them into buttons and every time you hit
the button it would play that that
little part of the song and you can make
your own music out of it this is like a
really slimmed down version of that
basically it includes two songs from
Daft Punk to pretty big ones harder
better faster stronger and technologic
the these two songs i'm really glad
these are the two they put on there
because it makes a lot of fun if you i'm
sure most people for these songs but
they're very easy to they're very easy
to play and you can really be creative
with it now um this is a really cool um
this is something it's not for everybody
I mean this is something I really
personally enjoyed just possess a lot of
fun and make your own songs and have fun
with it and everything um the thing is
it's kind of it's kind of really bear I
mean there's only the two songs now
originally it was just harder better
faster stronger it was on there when
when it first came out and then they
added technologic in and an update and
from I can tell they definitely are set
up to update with more songs because
there's a where you pick the songs
there's like 30 empty slots and and this
is not a lite version or at least
there's no paid version that will be
coming out as far as i know this is
really simple um
there's not a whole lot there's not a
whole lot to it I like it a lot
basically I mean it's just totally up to
you and of course if you want to get it
and delete it that's fine because it's
free so he let me just give you guys a
little preview of what what kinda you
can do with okay so the last type that
i'll be reviewing today is called seat
ibiza cupra race I know that's a
mouthful um basically this is uh I'm
sure you guys have seen a lot of the car
manufacturers they will get their own
iphone apps and usually for free go
ahead and put them out there it's
basically like free advertising and of
course all of us like it because we free
games this one is probably among the
best I know a lot of you guys tried the
very first Audi challenge that came out
totally forget about this this is
actually a real 3d full game it's not
it's kind of like the volkswagen polo
challenge really um except it's it's I
think it's a little bit better um the
graphics on this are really really nice
I mean they're true there's only one car
and I mean obviously there's not a ton
too I mean it's mainly just doing on the
one car when you're driving along
everything but still everything looks
nice and there's a lot of stuff to do I
mean I I really like it um basically it
starts you out with a really really cool
anime cutscene and before I say anything
else ignore the cutscene I mean it
sounds weird but the graphics are
totally that's not iphone graphics it's
it's just like it's just computer um I
would love those where iphone graphics
but basically what it is is that you go
in and you have it's pretty simple
basically you go in there and it's just
the one car obviously this is let me
just give you the background
see is a Spanish car manufacturer and
one thing that I kind of thought was a
little odd was seats aren't sold in the
United States and yet this app is
available on our App Store so I mean I'm
not complaining obviously that's that's
great but and I just thought something I
just mentioned basically it is is you
start with one car you don't know
unlockables or anything like that it's
it's pretty simple basically you can
pick color you can pick racing stripes
you can do some different things
basically what you do is you basically
just race it's got some nice controls
the tilt control is i would say about
dead on it's not it's not too sensitive
it's not too sensitive where you're like
all over the road and everything which
is the problem in a lot of them but it's
also it's also not you know just totally
wooden and you yank the iphone all the
way around to try to get turn that's not
the case at all this is probably I mean
it's just about dead on the steering you
got like practically all of them you
have gas and brake on your left and
right down down bottom totally works
fine um you know I actually I tried a
lot of racing games and I would have to
say this is probably some of the best
controls because I've I really like I'm
really partial to like the PlayStation
Xbox I like having like the like having
a real controller or better yet even
like a racing steering wheel but for the
iphone and ipod touch this is pretty
good the graphics are really something
that you will notice I mean I mean
they're really good you've got you raced
around this really nice looking track
like against its suppose it's near beach
or whatever it's really nice looking
everything is nicely rendered you really
like I mean when you're looking at I
mean it's really really cool looking I
won't go too far into it it is a fairly
simple application but uh I like it it's
a free racing game which that in my book
I pretty much just if I see a free
racing if I get it um at least I would
say if you if you like racing games i
would say at the very least try it if
you like it obviously you can keep it
and like i say with all three
applications if you don't like it delete
it and you all
you did would you just wasted 20 seconds
your life I mean it's not that big a
deal that's just about it I don't want
to get too in depth on it I'd say go
ahead pick it up if you like racing
games if not that's totally fine
personally I like it I play it every
once while it's it's pretty cool and
again the between the controls and
graphics it's a lot of fun when you do
play it be sure to check out seizure
