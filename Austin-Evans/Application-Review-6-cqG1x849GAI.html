I'm here with my sixth application
review which gonna focus on some free
apps of yet I've got three of them here
I've got I'm gonna review the hysteria
project light she's pretty cool creepy
very unique game I'm gonna review tap
punk which is a really fun game I've
really been coming back to a lot lately
I'm gonna I'm gonna review Seat Ibiza
Cupra race which is a pretty cool free
racing game you guys probably watch it
out so let's get this one started
okay first act I'll be reviewing today
is called hysteria project light now
obviously this is the light version of
the full one I'll go over I'll tell you
a little bit more about the full one
later but what I'll do is I'll stick
with the light version right now um
basically you know I know there's a name
for this and I'm totally don't I don't
know what the name of them are but
basically this is it's less of a game it
doesn't actually use graphics basically
it's a series of video cutscenes and
basically what it is is it's a really
creepy really really well done and
basically what you are and it's like I
said it's video it's real it was
probably some guy I guess he had a
camera on like a helmet camera or
whatever but basically this is all real
got some really cool effects basically
you're somebody who was I guess taken or
whatever and you're waking up in this
like shed this guy ties you up and then
he leaves and there's this really creepy
mark on the door and basically you
figure out how you want to escape and
you know is your face totally in your
hands it's really cool it's it's nice
it's all the cutscenes it's basically
like the video you're basically watching
because like I said I mean it's totally
real it's not like computer or anything
anything I'm sorry anything basically it
is is you wake up the light version is
very short also it's mean you you will
you will get through it very very
quickly but the thing is you basically
you're wake up and then you have it's
not like you're watching you get prompts
there are prompts on the screen which
sometimes you will tap the screen to do
something while in the middle of a
cutscene or the cutscene will stop and
it'll give you some option to saying
like do you want to run or do you want
to stay and look for something to defend
yourself or whatever it's now I will say
it's well it's very creepy and you will
you know I mean you won't price here you
but it will I mean unless you're really
scared easily
but it's very interesting it's very cool
I won't go too much into it the light
versions very simple if you I would
probably recommend it's a very unique
one I definitely recommend
at the light version if you think you
might like it
ah personally the the full version is a
dollar it's on sale right now if you
want you can go ahead and upgrade
personally I'm not going to but that
doesn't take away from the fact that
this does look like a pretty cool app
and uh yeah so you guys might just wanna
go check it out but my second
application review is going to be called
tap Punk this is a free one it's a
really simple yet it's something I keep
come back to I'm having a lot of fun
with it basically it's almost like a
very slimmed down version I don't know
if you guys it was a little while back
there's a an app out that came out
called beat maker which is basically you
could take different parts of songs that
you can download or get however and I
take small parts of the sound of the
song then it would turn them into
buttons and every time you hit the
button it would playback that little
part of the song and you can make your
own music out of it this is like a
really slimmed down version of that
basically it includes two songs from
Daft Punk two pretty big ones harder
better faster stronger and technologic
the these two songs
I'm really glad these are the two they
put on there because it makes a lot of
fun a few I'm sure most people for these
songs but they're very easy to they're
very easy to play and you can really be
creative with it now um this is a really
cool this is something it's not for
everybody I mean this is something I
really personally enjoyed just possess a
lot of fun and make your own songs and
have fun with it and everything the
thing is it's kind of its kind of really
bear I mean there's only the two songs
now originally it was just harder better
faster stronger it was on there when it
first came out and then they added
technologic in and an update and for my
I can tell they definitely are set up to
update with more songs because there's a
where you pick the songs there's like 30
empty slots and and this is not a lite
version or at least there's no paid
version that will be coming out as far
as I know this is really simple um
there's not a whole lot there's not a
whole lot to it I like it a lot
basically I mean it's just totally up to
you you know of course if you want to
get it and delete it that's fine because
it's free so here let me give you guys a
little preview of what what kinda you
can do with okay so the last type that
I'll be reviewing today is called Seat
Ibiza Cupra race I know that's a
mouthful basically this is I'm sure you
guys have seen a lot of the car
manufacturers they will get their own
iPhone apps and usually for free go
ahead and put them out there
it's basically like free advertising and
of course all of us like it because we
get free games this one is probably
among the best I know a lot of you guys
tried the very first Audi challenge that
came out totally forget about this this
is actually a real 3d full game it's not
it's kind of like the Volkswagen Polo
challenge really um except it's it's I
think it's a little bit better um
the graphics on this are really really
nice I mean they're true there's only
one car and I mean obviously there's not
a ton - I mean it's mainly just doing on
the one car when you're driving along
everything but still everything looks
nice and there's a lot of stuff to do I
mean I I really like it basically it
starts you out with a really really cool
animated cutscene and before I say
anything else ignore the cutscene I mean
it sounds weird but the graphics are
totally that's not I phone graphics it's
it's just like it's just computer yeah I
would love it those were iPhone graphics
but basically what it is is that you go
in and you have it's it's pretty simple
basically you go in there and it's just
the one car obviously this is let me
just give you the background see is a
space
a car manufacturer and one thing that I
kind of thought was a little odd was
seats aren't sold in the United States
and yet this app is available on our App
Store so I mean I'm not complaining
obviously that's that's great but and I
just thought something I just mentioned
basically it is is you start with one
car you don't there's no unlockables or
anything like that it's it's pretty
simple basically you can pick color you
can pick racing stripes you can do some
different things basically what you do
is you basically just race it's got some
nice controls the tilt control is I
would say about dead-on it's not it's
not too sensitive it's not too sensitive
where you're like all over the road and
everything which is the problem in a lot
of them but it's also it's also not you
know just totally wooden and you like
yank the iphone all the way around to
try to get it to turn that's not the
case at all this is probably I mean it's
just about dead-on steering then you got
like practically all of them you have
gas and brake on your left and right
down down bottom totally works fine um
you know actually I tried a lot of
racing games and I would have to say
this is probably some of the best
controls because I've I really like I'm
really partial to like the PlayStation
the Xbox I like having like the like
having a real controller or better yet
even like a racing steering wheel but
for the iPhone and iPod Touch this is
pretty good the graphics are really
something that you will notice I mean I
mean they're really good you've got you
race around this really nice-looking
track like I guess it's suppose it's
near a beach or whatever um it's really
nice looking everything is nicely
rendered you really like I mean when
you're looking at I mean it's really
really cool-looking I won't go too far
into it it is a fairly simple
application but uh I like it it's a free
racing game which in my book guide
pretty much just if I see a free racing
I get it at least I would say if you or
if you like racing games I would say it
the very least try it if you like it
obviously you can keep it and like I
said with all three applications if you
don't like it delete it and you all you
did would you just wasted 20 seconds
your life
I mean it's not that big a deal that's
just about it I don't want to get too
in-depth on it I'd say go ahead pick it
up if you like racing games if not
that's totally fine personally I like it
I play it every once a while it's it's
pretty cool and again the the between
the controls and graphics it's a lot of
fun when you do play it be sure to check
