of coral VideoStudio Pro x3 now I get a
question asked all the time and that is
what video editor do I use well go ahead
and be staying I'll go ahead and give a
full video on and what I use which of
course is video studio I've used this
for about 6 months now and before that I
use its processor so I think I'm pretty
I'm pretty well versed in how to use it
so what I give you guys my full review
so VideoStudio Pro is not a high range
Video Editor you know if you're looking
for something like Sony Vegas if you
need all that power then this is not
gonna cut it
however it works great for me I don't
have really complicated editing and so
it works really nicely for me and it
probably will work for you I would say
for the majority of you unless like I
said you need some really advanced
features so I'm glad to show you how it
works really simply I'm gonna reply to
settings and of course this is a fairly
in-depth ed or I don't want to go
through everything but I will show you
the basics I mean you can see here we do
have a window basically you know we can
preview so I'm gonna form go ahead and
select this I can go ahead and preview
you know the video you know you can do
all that kind of stuff and there are
things where you can go ahead and mark
in marked out you can cut you can also
go ahead and view it in a larger screen
if you like but basically this is the
way where you know you added it and you
go ahead and select between project and
clip now over here is where you find all
your files so I can go ahead and select
through all my video files and you can
see here I have a fair few files in here
so let's go ahead and just add one
really quickly here so let's jump into
my desktop and pick out a video I've
need to go ahead and edit so let's go
ahead and just mock edit it I don't want
to take a little bit too long if I did
this all but so let's go I'll just grab
it and drag it down here I'm out here's
where we've set all of our stuff so you
know here's where we put the video we
can also go ahead and add other things
so let's go ahead and do a
picture-in-picture
let's let's go and grab another videos
to this gameboy advanced review and do
keep in mind this is not really actually
editing video I'm just showing you how
it works so there we go let's say we
want a picture in picture so I can go
ahead and move this
the spring however like or I can go
ahead and just anchor it it may be the
the bottom right so let's say you know
for whatever reason this is how we want
to do it so there we go we've got this
going here but we can actually add quite
a few in fact we open up the track
manager you'll see here we can have up
to six overlays you can go ahead and add
images or video in all sorts of
different ways just very handy meals the
title tracks as well as music tracks but
I can just show you that right now
so it's blend select the title track
let's say let's just drag this down here
so let's say we want to say let's say
this is going to be Nintendo so we're
just doing something here so we go ahead
and have Nintendo and I want it up in
right here of course can change the how
long it's going to last all you know the
bold I want it to be you know a line on
the left and go through all my fonts you
know you can do all the standard stuff
and did you can also go ahead and go
into border so I can make it you know
plus I want to add a shadow and then I
be able to see that too well or I can
make it glow there's all kinds of
different things you can do as far as
the text and the deep you can go farther
and actually add animations so if I want
it to drop I can go ahead and make it
fly in so if I want to fly in and
there's all kinds of things you can do
like that but we're gonna go ahead and
just leave that alone so now we've got
our text we've got our videos and now
let's put an add some audio I also can
go ahead and go down here to the Audio
tab and then it does come with several
presets indeed it actually does come
with some preset video so you know for
transitions and stuff it also does have
a fair a few different audio that's
totally royalty-free and ready for you
to use so let's just pick something
random and drop it down here on the
Audio tab so there we go now let's go
ahead and jump over to the project and
of course this is a total mess but as
you can see here we do have a lot of the
different things that video studio can
handle so we can go ahead and play
through this look white and click on it
then you see here the videos are going
to start playing it works pretty well as
far as the CPU and everything it
actually is really does run very nicely
on multi-core processors so you have you
know like a core i5 especially core i3 I
do all my editing on a core i3 so it
does work very
you have multiple cores so there we go
that's the basics now there are a few
other things um we can go ahead and go
over to transitions and there are a very
very nice variety of transitions here I
don't know exactly how many but you do
there are more than enough so let's go
ahead and grab this and just add
transition just to show you guys how it
works
so let's just cut that and let's pick Oh
what do we want to use let's use across
them so when you just drop it on here
and of course that's the way you do most
things if you had an effect or a
transition you just pick it up and drop
it wherever you want
let's go ahead and play this and see how
this looks so there we go not too bad
and of course we can go ahead and you
know change that up and do whatever we
like so that's the transitions now last
thing I'll show you is effect as you can
see here again a lot of effects are
available Coral coral VideoStudio you
know some of them like you know you want
a vignette I don't know Shay I'm fine
not saying that right I'm you know throw
stone you can have it you know with like
when the facts you can zoom motion which
is actually a pretty cool effect you
even do old film so a lot of the stuff
is really cool available in here so like
active camera for example let's go and
use this one so now if we're go ahead
and play it as you see here you know it
looks you know like an earthquake or
something
indeed we can go ahead by pulling up the
options let's go ahead and go here and
pull up the options we can go ahead and
actually customize this so you know if
we want it to you know to less crop
let's blur etc etc we didn't go ahead
and pick presets and indeed this works
for pretty much all of these they all
have different options so it's very very
customizable last day I'm going to show
you just how to render it you know you
have the different things you can go
ahead and just there's a straight upload
to YouTube video which is what I usually
do on mobile vision one slight drawback
especially for me is that when you go
ahead and render it as you know render
once you're done with the video and
you're ready to render it it you know
this is what I usually use just the
standard mp4 HD however it only works up
to ten minutes and so if I have a video
that's longer than ten minutes there's
really no great way to do it so the way
I have to do it is if I have
say a ten and a half minute video when I
put up on YouTube I'll have to go ahead
and render it as HD v 720p and then I
need to go ahead and re render it to get
the file size down that's pretty much my
only major negative part of this file
but with this program rather however
that's a pretty minor thing I doubt many
of you will just have to do 720p and
upload to YouTube that is more than 10
and 10 minutes long so kind of a minor
thing there of course that's why you can
do it you can go ahead and choose all
kinds of different formats so if you
want to put it for a blu-ray for DVD all
kinds of different things you can go
ahead and set that up and it will render
I had noticed the render times are very
fast it does tap on to your GPU so
especially if you have a nice GPU in
your computer it will render very very
fast mode most of the time the videos
like for example the 7 that video
rendering and high definition probably
won't take the 10 minutes on my core i3
processor asuma that's it for my review
of choral VideoStudio Pro x3 really
really great video editing program and
the best part is that it is very cheap
so currently on Amazon I just looked it
up it's going to be running about $35
which is much much cheaper than what you
might find in a similar video editing
suite with you know similar features so
beyond between the fact that it works
really quite well you know you don't
have to worry about a lot of you know
lag or glitchyness I mean where it runs
very nicely and the fact that it's
really quite cheap and works great I
highly highly recommend this if you're
you know if you need video editing for
whatever you need
especially for YouTube it does work
quite well so yeah guys that's it you
know I've had a lot of questions about
what video editor I use so I didn't want
to go ahead and do a full review on it
and show you guys all about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
