overview of three of the top tablets for
2010 so starting out there of course is
going to be the apple ipad which has
been a tremendous success for Apple you
know they've sold millions and millions
and millions of them and people really
tend to like the iPad it's been probably
the first really commercially successful
tablet and quite some time on Ben
addition there are two other tablets
that very well could challenge it so
starting out there's a gown samsung
galaxy tab which is looking to be the
premier android tablet once it's
released later on in addition there's
also the toshiba folio 100 which looks
to go ahead and bypass a lot of the
standard sort of specs paw of a tablet
and it'll go for outright speed go ahead
and be able to do high definition video
playback all the kind of stuff that you
would expect to do on such a multimedia
platform I want any of you guys an
overview of each of the three and can't
tell you my thoughts my opinions on them
all to begin with let's take a look at
the samsung galaxy tab so the galaxy tab
there's a lot of things with the samsung
galaxy has smartphone Maya which
definitely is not a bad thing so this
means that they will of course run
Android is actually going to be the
latest 2.2 and it'll also carry over
several of the main hardware features
including the arm cortex a8 processor
which is called 2 1 gigahertz this is
very similar to the ipad which of course
is heavily based off of the iphone so
that definitely is good news for the
galaxy tab in addition the galaxy tab
also uses a 7-inch screen which is
considerably smaller than the 9 inch
screen in the ipad now for some people
the 9 inch screen actually might be an
advantage but for me I think the seven
inches is about the sweet spot for a
tablet you know it actually it's not
really all that large because even
though an iPad is very very thin it
almost takes about the same room as a
laptop or a netbook it does take up a
considerable amount of room whereas the
galaxy tab coming in at only seven
inches should be a decent bit smaller
should be a lot easier to carry you know
it won't be such a big deal you know
they have to go ahead and carry it
around although of course both these
tablets are very small very fat very
light but when you're talking about a
tablet every ounce and every little bit
of weight and height and all that kind
of stuff definitely does matter so the
specs including it has a 7-inch super
TFT display with a resolution of
for x 600 in addition it also does have
16 gigabytes of storage built in and you
can go ahead and plug in up to a 32
gigabyte microSD card to go and expand
that out now some of the interesting
things about the galaxy that the ipad
lights it actually does have a 1.3
megapixel front facing camera for video
chat which is a definitely a big deal as
of course the ipad really does lack all
of that i really like the galaxy tab I
think it's got a lot of potential and
especially miss because it does run
Android it's going to be one of the
first real Android tablets we've seen so
of course the galaxy tab will be
available with 3g just like the ipad go
over a difference between the galaxy tab
is it likely will be subsidized
basically what this means is that you
can go ahead and go to quite a few
different carriers go ahead and buy a 3g
plan and actually it will cut the price
considerably down on the galaxy tab
square it in the united states the ipad
starts with about 500 we've heard that
the galaxy tab will plug coming in at
more closer to two to three hundred
dollars with a carrier subsidy that
stuff like good news if you're looking
to get into a tablet and you do want 3g
definitely go ahead and be able to get
the best of both worlds now let's go
ahead and take a look at the toshiba
folio 100 so the folio 100 does have
some similarities to the samsung galaxy
tab namely the fact that they both to
run android 2.2 however it does differ
from its competitors in one big area
which is screen size so the folio 100
has a 10.1 inch display which is much
larger than this competitors now like I
was saying with the Samsung Galaxy Tab a
7-inch display is personally for me I
think it's really good however for
depending on how to use it a 10 min just
what also could come freely in handy so
basically some of the uses of a 10-inch
display would be no such watch a lot of
movies a lot of extra web browsing
especially if it's not really going to
be very very portable if you're not
going to be taking it with you
everywhere so the specs include it has
that 10.1 inch display with a resolution
of 1024 x 600 it has 16 gigabytes of
storage built in and it runs the nvidia
tegra 2 chipset so what this means that
it should be very very fast for web
browsing and pretty much anything you do
so that's definitely a really good thing
some of the other features include us
have I again a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera
it also has an HDMI out port and of
course it does have support for an SD
card which is definitely really nice is
instead of having oh maybe I micro SD
you can actually go ahead and put all
your camera memory cards and everything
like that which should definitely be a
next feature the folio 100 definitely
looks like a very competent android
tablet it has a lot going forward with a
Porsche android 2.2 it's going to go
ahead and have that big 10.1 inch
display it does have some really kind of
interesting things such as an hdmi port
as well as support for full-size SD
cards now let's go ahead and take a look
the Apple iPad now this is a tablet most
of you are probably familiar with and
what is your aren't I just go ahead just
give you an overview of it anyway so the
iPad it runs the iOS 3.2 currently which
is very similar to what you would find
on maybe your iPhone your ipod touch
although of course much much larger so
some of those features of the ipad
included it does have quite a few
different varieties you can get it with
16 gigabytes 32 gigabytes or 64
gigabytes of storage as well as you can
get with just Wi-Fi or you can also get
it with Wi-Fi with 3g some of the specs
included that's have a 9.7 inch
led-backlit display with a resolution of
1024 x 768 like I said it does come in
16 32 and 64 gigabyte capacities and
does run the Apple a 4 1 gigahertz
processor now the iPad does run iOS I
mean Justin over the next couple months
it will be upgraded to 4.0 or arrived at
4.2 which should bring a lot of new
features including multitasking etc etc
the ipad is unguided lee the king of the
segment right now there's really nothing
available that can really challenge it
so if you're looking to buy a tablet
today the iPads probably what you want
to go for however once the other two
android tablets do come out later in the
year then definitely the ipad definitely
will have some competition but of course
i'm still not so sure if anything can
immediately unseat the ipad of course it
does have that really nice form factor
everyone already knows it it has access
to the enormous Apple App Store and it's
just such a great experience everything
is super super fast very very responsive
so the ipad is definitely a really hard
package should be hey guys i'm really
curious to know what are you thinking
what tablets are you really looking
forward to buying or looking at or
whatever definitely leave your thoughts
and comments in the comment section
below anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
