here with my next computer build video
so it's been a couple months since I did
my last one in the meantime I've got a
ladder quest to do a really high end
awesome gaming PC so it's what I'm going
to be doing today with a PC that comes
in at the $1,500 price point start our
build off with we'll be using an Intel
Core i5 2500 KC bu now I know you guys
are afraid all on your keyboards right
now saying Core i5 why not use the core
i7 the main difference between the i-5
and the i7 is that the i7 has
hyper-threading which allows Windows to
see it as a cores as opposed to 4 and
while that's great if you do a lot of
heavily threaded tasks such as video
editing and that kind of stuff for games
most of the time they struggle to use up
for course so that 8 virtual quarters
really is going to give you a lot of
performance benefit beyond that it's
very similar to the i7 you're still
going to be able to overclock it into
the stratosphere in most cases well over
4 gigahertz and it's still gonna be an
absolutely rock-solid CPU for now like
gaming for just day they used to have
absolutely tons and tons of power for
about 230 bucks this is a great way to
start or build next we're going to be
using a cooler master hyper 212 + CPU
cooler now the i5 is going to have a
cooler just like this and while this is
fine it's gonna be singing a base clock
speeds all day if you want to do some
major overclocking the hyper 212 plus is
a great way to go
this makes way more heat it allows you
to get some really high overclock
without catching your CPU on fire so
this one's gonna run about 25 bucks or
so and in my opinion it's gonna be well
worth it next step will be using the
gigabyte gaz 68 ud3 motherboard this is
the same one that I've been using in my
computer for almost a year now
and I gotta say it's a great motherboard
now that doesn't look awesome it's got a
black PCB which I love those things
beats the blue and all the kind of
ridiculous colors that really don't
belong in a gaming case but on top of
that it's got all the major features
that you need
since it's a z68 board that means you
can be able to overclock your cpu as
high as you want and on top of that it's
got all the major features that you want
so it's got SATA 3 it's got USB 3 and
it's built really well so it's got a
nice thick boards not like gonna be
really be flexing when you get big GPUs
in there so overall it's a great board
for about 155 bucks
now comes the fun part for GPU we're
going to be using the Sapphire Radeon HD
7950 now as many of you guys know this
is a brand new card from AMD and it is
one of the most powerful single GPU cars
that you can buy the 7950 is a great
card and on top of that you can actually
overclock it so in some cases you can
actually get up to the same level of the
7970
with three gigabytes of gddr5 memory
this thing is absolutely going to
demolish any game you throw at it
including pedal field 3 on ultra that's
pretty much gonna be your reaction no it
does expensive it's gonna run you about
$480 so it's by far the most expensive
thing into this entire build however if
you want the absolute best performance
you can get without having to go with
crossfire or a dual GPU card this is
gonna be the way to go for memory we're
going to be going with 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM now this
stuff's clocked at 1600 megahertz and
probably the first admit 16 gigabytes of
RAM is overkill in a gaming machine you
never know when that extra might come in
handy this is the same Ram I have in my
computer however the difference is this
has a low-profile heatsink so while mine
looks great it's got a very tall
heatsink and it makes it impossible to
add a second fan to my hyper 212 Plus
for better CPU cooling so it's better
idea if my opinion to go with this low
profile stop it should perform just the
same and for about a hundred bucks or so
it's gonna be a great way to go since
this is a high-end gaming machine you
gotta use an SSD in this case we're
going to be using 128 gigabyte Samsung
830 Drive now this is one of my
favorites for a couple of reasons for
one it's reliable sure you can spend a
lot more and get an Intel Drive which
may be slightly more reliable however
it's gonna be very close and beat a lot
of the other SSDs on the market and on
the flip side you're going to get great
performance again maybe not quite as
good as some of the same force drives on
the market but it's going to be very
close with over 500 megabytes per second
read speeds so you put that together you
get a really good reliability you get
really good price and of course you get
that great performance this is gonna be
a great way to go great huh that was bad
but anyway it does come with a copy of
Batman Arkham City as well as Norton
ghosts so get a little couple freebies
in there for hand 80 bucks it's a great
way to go enjoy a gigabytes really isn't
going to be enough though so willing to
add a two terabyte Western Digital
caviar grain drive this is a very simple
Drive I have a pair of them in my
computer they work really well they may
not leave me the fastest thing in the
world but of course the things that you
really got to get at your OS your major
programs that kind of stuff will go on
the SSD and for the main hard drive you
can put you know music movies pictures
maybe a couple steam games that kind of
stuff that you're not gonna need the
super fast access to it's gonna be great
got plain storage it's gonna be a good
Drive about 130 bucks for power we have
the corsair TX 750 watt modular power
supply nowadays you have some choices
here
so the one I've chosen which is the 750
watt supply with modular capability is
great however if you don't really care
about having a modular supply you just
want to have all the normal cables and
try to wrap them around the case you
can't save a few bucks
in fact the non modular supply is what I
use in my array right now over on top of
that you can also go down low bit so
Senate fifty watts there's a bit
overkill for this machine you should be
able to get by with 650 so if you want
to go ahead and bump the the wise down a
little bit you should be okay however
having seven I have fifty Watts having
that a little bit of extra envelope for
power and whatnot is good for upgrades
as well as if you ever decide to rebuild
your computer overall though that's
gonna run you about 115 bucks and of
course less if you decide to gain on
modular supply or go down to a 650 watt
supply moving on to the case in this
case we're going to be using a hand tech
302 so the 302 is a fantastic case which
allows you to have lots of room for all
your kinds of hard drives graphics cards
that kind of thing but also gives you
some really nice air flows to keep
everything nice and cool now if the
original antique 300 was a really really
well-loved case it had lots of room and
all that kind of stuff and the 302 is
the newer version with USB 3 and some
new improvements as far as air flow all
that kind of good stuff however this is
definitely your choice so a case is the
thing that you're going to be looking at
you know of course all your parts are in
there but as far as the aesthetics go
the case is by far the most important
step so if you want a different case
with perhaps a window LEDs that kind of
stuff absolutely feel free to go for it
go for if you're looking something a
little more understand they're still
gonna get the job done in all other
categories the antique 302 is great for
about 70 bucks lastly we have an Isuzu
DVD burner now this was optional I know
a lot of you guys really don't use
optical drives anymore however it
definitely can come in handy especially
if you're installing Windows or programs
and all that kind of stuff if you want
you can skip this one or you can upgrade
to a blu-ray drive depending on how you
use it but overall if you're looking for
something really basic for 20 bucks this
is a great addition to your build so
what's the damage
well as of filming this video the entire
price of the build is going to come to
one thousand four hundred and ninety six
dollars and ninety cents so we're
definitely keep in mind that prices are
constantly fluctuating so by the time
you watch this video it may have gone up
down all that kind of stuff so make sure
that you know exactly what it is
I've links to all the parts in the
description of this video anyway guys if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
this video a thumbs up really helps me
out
