here with ask me so this is my series
where I answer all kinds of questions
straight from you guys so let's get
started
yo what are your thoughts about the new
iPhones I'm mostly impressed with what
we've seen so I Oh s7 looks like a major
improvement over iOS 6
it was definitely starting to get a
little old there the 5c I'm liking the
colors a lot that's one of the main
reasons why I like the Lumia 1020 is you
can get it in all kinds of cool colors
like yellow and stuff it is a little bit
expensive and the specs are basically
very similar to the iPhone 5 but it is
nice that we're getting at least a
little bit of a cheaper iPhone you know
apples kind of working with us a little
bit now the 5s is looking like a
standard iPhone update so it's very
similar to the 5 but it's got some cool
new features like a better camera and
Apple a7 processor blah blah blah but I
think the big thing with that is going
to be the fingerprint scanner and
whether it's actually going to be a
useful thing or a little bit more of a
gimmick do you see yourself making phone
build videos if the phone block concept
were to become a thing it would be cool
but I really don't see this whole phone
block thing taking off now the idea is
that you take a lot of different parts
and you kind of build your own phone
kind of like Legos almost and while that
would be awesome if it were possible and
it is sort of possible but it's very
very unlikely that first of all you
could have all of these companies
working together and all making parts
that are in these little block size
things that you could get a decent
enough interface where you could just
say okay I'm gonna throw a CPU on here
and a camera and a battery and it would
all work together kind of a little bit
unlikely but if you guys want a little
bit more on this my friend marques who
did a great overview talking all about
foam blocks you guys go check that out
cool idea probably not gonna happen what
is your opinion on stock coolers if you
aren't interested in overclocking unless
I'm doing a build that specifically
meant to be overclocked I pretty much
always stick with the stock cooler it's
gonna get the job done it's gonna be
fairly quiet and it's also free which is
nice as obviously if you buy an
aftermarket cooler you have to take some
of your budget away from maybe some
extra RAM or a little bit better
graphics card or whatever so unless I'm
overclocking I stick with the stock
cooler how does it feel to live in my
shadow of me being a hot guy nice try
but I am NOT gonna touch that one
wait do you use a case on your phones if
so what cases do you usually go for if
not why don't you use a case aren't you
worried about dropping it I'm not really
a big fan of cases I mean sure it's
definitely gonna be helpful if you drop
your phone but for the most part phones
are pretty durable I'm sure you might
scratch it up a little bit but I would
much prefer to have a couple little
scratches on my phone as opposed to
having a nice awesome looking design
that feels and looks great and you put a
giant ugly rubber case on it it's like
well what's the point have you ever
owned a MacBook and if so did you like
it definitely I've been using an 11 inch
MacBook Air for the last couple years so
I actually prefer Mac books to Windows
laptops there's some cool stuff in OS 10
that's kind of nice to use when I'm
getting away from windows and the
MacBook Hardware itself is great
especially these new Haswell ears with
awesome battery life so yeah I like the
MacBook Air in fact I've already
reviewed this one if you guys haven't
checked that out yet
but it's a really great laptop
especially for me because it's super
thin and lightweight and portable so I'm
out and you know doing an event or
traveling or whatever it's really easy
to make an entire video on the air as
opposed to having to keep that giant
computer behind you with me at all times
what is one device that you are glad you
did not get definitely the Lytro so this
was a really cool looking camera that
came out a year two ago he was in this
very weird shape and instead of taking
pictures normally it actually allowed
you to do some cool things like being
able to shift focus after the fact and
all that kind of stuff
now it would've been cool when I was
actually really interested in it but a
couple friends kind of talked me out of
it as it was well just not very good it
was also 500 bucks so definitely pretty
glad that I didn't get that probably
used it five times did a video on it and
never touched it again can you remember
the first ever video game you bought
definitely so my first game that I ever
bought with my own money was pokemon red
so I was about six or so and all my
friends were starting to play pokemon it
had just come out and it just
immediately was just this huge thing in
my school so I knew I had to get a
gameboy and I had to get pokemon red so
I saved up my money which as a
six-year-old was really really hard to
do but I did it and my grandma ended up
chipping in just a little bit of extra
money so I could end up purchasing the
game as well as the Gameboy so I went
down to the store got a lime-green
gameboy color as well as pokemon red and
is about the
this moment of my six-year-old life
anyway that's going to be about it if
you have any questions for next time on
ask me feel free to drop them over on
Twitter Facebook or Google+ and of
course all those links will be in the
description of this video anyway guys
thanks for watching yo I found this
thing called a cute girl is that a
Pokemon type yes you should absolutely
start by using charm maybe a little
sweet kitty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
