here with an unboxing of the HTC One on
AT&amp;amp;T
with an all-aluminum design and some
very impressive features let's take a
look starting with the box there's not
much to see until you pop the top to get
at the fun stuff first off we have the
HTC One and silver but first let's see
what else comes in the box
lift up the phone tray and inside you'll
find a pair of decent-looking in ear
headphones and some extra ear tips the
micro USB cable for charging and syncing
and the USB wall adapter to plug your
phone in there's also a sim eject tool
Quick Start Guide with a bit of info on
the one and finally some safety info
along with HTC stickers now let's get to
the HTC One itself you'll see it's made
almost entirely out of aluminum along
with the glass display up top are the
light and proximity sensors headset and
one of the stereo speakers along with
the wide-angle front-facing camera and
on bottom you'll see those somewhat odd
button layout with only a back and home
button as well as the second front
facing speaker up top you'll find the
lock button which actually doubles as a
TV remote along with the headphone jack
and along the right side are the volume
controls with the SIM card hidden in the
top left corner
lastly around back is the four megapixel
camera with LED flash and a second
microphone coming back around to the
front let's take a closer look
the 4.7 inch 1080p screen is incredibly
sharp and vibrant almost immediately out
of the box I can safely say this is one
of the best displays on a phone period
the dual front-facing speakers are also
incredibly impressive pumping out some
very nice sound that's better than most
tablets I've used much less phones while
that's only got four megapixels the
camera is also something special but
I'll have to go more in depth on this
one in the full review so what do you
