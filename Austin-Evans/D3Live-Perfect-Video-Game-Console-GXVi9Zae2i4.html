episode of d3 live today we're going to
be doing something a little bit
differently what is the perfect video
game console now for this week I have a
little bit of fun instead just me
talking about what I think and
everything I'm gonna take questions from
everyone in the chat on blogtv from
Twitter as well as with you guys on
YouTube want to leave them in the
comments section below now the whole
premise behind this idea is really
simple what is the perfect video game
console in your opinion so it doesn't
have to be entirely realistic I mean if
you want to have a Nintendo DSi played
Xbox 360 game totally cool just what do
you think would be the perfect game
console so you know there's a lot of
things that are important so for example
graphics obviously gonna be pretty
important backwards compatibility with
older games different having different
franchises like Halo on the Wii or
whatever but just have a little bit of
fun with this and just kinda pretend
that you get an audience with you know
the CEO of Sony or Microsoft or intend
order and just tell them what you want
so I'd start with what I think and what
kind of like I'm an idea that I had that
I think would be pretty cool so of
course all the game video game consoles
in this generation use DVDs or in the
case of the PlayStation 3 that uses a
blu-ray that's great this server you
know fine beats the old cartridges in
most cases however ever since I've
really started getting into PC gaming
and mouse has been past couple years but
the more I'm more I play the more I
realize I really like download-only now
there's a lot of problems with
download-only not everyone has a lot of
internet restrictions as far as you know
the bandwidth caps and speed and
everything like that but for those of
you who do have a really good internet
connection would you be interested in a
console so let's say it's the
PlayStation 4 so let's say that there's
have a normal version of it you you know
you buy the games just like the discs
and yeah it's no problem and you get to
play the games just like a normal
PlayStation however what if there was a
different version of it that was smaller
and cheaper that they had always only
download only personally I think even
though I love actually owning the disc
signers thing I think I actually might
go for that because like I said I like
just downloading the games I don't like
to have to you know fumble through the
discs and I think I just like had it on
there especially bad a decent sized hard
drive that I wouldn't have to worry so
it's kind of my question you guys that's
kind of what my dream console would be
if they had well make that dream console
but I think that would be a really good
idea but enough about what I think let's
go and take a look at what everyone else
has to say
so what guys would be your favorite
video game console and
go ahead and take a question from
Twitter here perfect console we'll have
steam on it there's already this thing
called a PC that has steam on but yeah
absolutely I mean if steam could be on
an actual console I think that would be
great
let's just take a question from the chat
I'm gonna see as you guys see we're
doing a little differently to this week
but I just take a lot of your guys's
thoughts and opinions and whatnot they
already have that with the online
especially a pretty good point all night
is a really cool system if you guys are
not familiar with what it is basically
it is a streaming service so instead of
having to download the games or you know
buy the discs whatever it just strains
it so the game runs on a server and
basically what you see on your TV is
like video and and when you do the
controller that sends it back so pretty
much there's nothing to download there's
nothing to install all you see as long
as you have a good internet connection
is just the game personally I think in
that connections aren't quite good
enough for online I know there's oh I
would say a lot of live but there is
some lag involved in that that's that's
a little bit of a turn-off for me but
yeah absolutely on live has a lot of
capabilities and I think it could really
do well in the future a touch screen
controller a little better it has been
certain thing called the Wii U it's
coming there's gonna have a touch screen
controller um I'm interested to see it
to be honest I'm not upset sold that at
touchscreen is gonna be fantastic
but I definitely can say especially with
the motion sensors everything that could
be a really good really good deal social
integration I'm not a big fan of social
integration to my games I mean don't
live wrong I don't really mind if like I
can pull Facebook friends or people from
Twitter over into my games together
friendless I mean that's not a big deal
I don't I don't mind that too much but
um I don't want farmville on a an Xbox
or anything I think there's a certain
line and in my opinion of course it's
definitely different for you guys in my
opinion I think social integration could
should just be helped just helpful for
just getting friends to find online
should kind of ease that he's that I
don't want you know every time I get a
trophy to be put on my facebook wall or
go tweet when I you know beat the game
or something
and that was sold on that ps3 plus wii u
plus xbox360 would equal a pretty crazy
console um again since this is all for
fun I'll see what would that be I mean I
guess for that you obviously have all
the consoles I've been all the games on
one and there actually has been a lot of
talk throughout you know the years that
you know what if they just quit making
individual consoles and have to spend
$300 here and $300 here and $300 here
and just mold it into one console that
you buy that plays all the games um I
can let that idea I mean like the PC for
example you know unlike an Xbox or
Playstation it's not like you can just
go well the PlayStation plays pretty
close but it's not like you can take a
Super Nintendo game and just plug it in
but with the PC all the time you can
play a game that listen you know maybe
from 1998 or 1988 and you can play it
pretty much full / not perfect unless a
perfect but really good backwards
compatibility with PC games and if they
were able to do something that with the
console Sony and Microsoft a Nintendo
just got together to go you know what
let's just make one console that'd be
pretty cool although I don't think
that's ever gonna happen just saying
that but I think it would be a pretty
cool idea an alliance of Apple with
Playstation so we can play iOS simple
games but also hardcore ps3 games that's
such a great idea I think I mean a lot
of it especially when you look at the
3ds which isn't been doing quite as well
as a lot of people thought they would I
think a lot of that is due to the fact
there are a lot of cheap decent games on
the iPhone as well as on Android and
smartphones in general um so they could
combine something lots of fun games like
Angry Birds and fruit ninja and all the
kind of fun games you can just throw in
your pocket as well as some really more
hardcore in-depth games like Uncharted
and Gran Turismo and fallout and you
know all the really cool game franchises
on the you know the main site if they
could go ahead and pull those together
think it'll be really cool um the
perfect console should be able to be
unlocked hacked legally awesome could
not agree more
now I that one thing I've always felt is
consoles if you buy something you should
be able to do ever you want with it now
I don't condone piracy I think you
should if you there's a good game
absolutely go by that I mean that's that
goes without saying I absolutely believe
that but there are other things you can
do like ps3 like you can write it it's a
 fool computer if you
- I mean there are a lot of cool things
that you could do like the Wii for
example it plays DVDs but they don't let
you do that I think that seems really
really silly to me see I absolutely
agreed if they could make a console and
just say hey you know if you want to
unlock if you want to tinker you want to
do cool stuff on it absolutely feel free
because to be honest when they lock it
down that's not a big deal it just gets
unlocked meant take a few months or a
few years but if they allow you to do it
and you know they put stuff in place
maybe to prevent piracy that's totally
cool I don't think that'd be awesome
but anyway guys that's gonna be it for
this episode of d3 live now of course
we've taken all the questions for
everyone who's watching the show live
next i want to hear what you guys have
to say so what is your perfect video
game console again the answers can be as
crazy as you want doesn't actually have
to be realistic but what kind of video
game console would make you buy it 110%
so definitely be sure to leave those
thoughts or your ideas in the comment
section below and I will catch you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
