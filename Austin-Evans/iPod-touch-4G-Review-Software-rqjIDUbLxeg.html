at the unique software on the iPod Touch
4th generation so I'm not really gonna
go over I Oh s in general more than
likely you are familiar with the
operating system so I'm just gonna go
ahead and go with the kind of unique
things to the iPod Touch that are new
I'm so first let's go ahead and start
with FaceTime
so FaceTime is pretty simple I do have a
demo of it up but basically FaceTime you
can go ahead and you pick through your
favorites you know the recent you can go
ahead and go through your contacts go
through their it's pretty simple but
again not gonna really get into FaceTime
all that much it's pretty simple you
know you just go ahead and click a
button you just want to call somebody
and hang up so it's not a big deal um so
now go ahead and go over and take a look
in game I mean rather than happenes
everybody go ahead take a look at camera
app the camera app works pretty well you
can see here you can go ahead and flip
the camera so there we go so that it now
it's on the rear-facing camera and I'm
gonna go ahead flip over to the
front-facing camera works pretty well
you know it just takes one second down
here you can go ahead and take it on
video or you flip it over here take
stills so actually now I've got the
front-facing camera on so pull one and
go ahead take a picture I'm go ahead and
flip over here take little videos so
let's just go ahead and so it's
recording so blah blah blah just short
little clip to record hit it again to
stop recording now we won't go ahead and
jump over to the camera roll and so that
was the video we just did so we can go
ahead and watch the video we can do some
different things we can for example
email the video or send it to YouTube we
can go ahead and back forward we can
play well then go ahead and scrub and in
the iPod Touch 4th generation you there
is the iMovie application which is $4.99
on the App Store there also as you can
go ahead and do some basic editing so
hey we just want to trim this so that
I'm swing going trim this lets say we
want to start right here and you want to
end right here obviously let's go ahead
and turn up just a little more so
obviously you know it's not that great
but for you know general kind of stuff
maybe you know you know you just started
with your friends and you want on your
pause and cut out the first few seconds
it does we're just fine so that's the
camera application who does work pretty
well um that's pretty much it as far as
the unique software game Center which is
you know it's pretty it's pretty
forward of course I had done another
video on NASA and like I'm go ahead and
get into it on here but in general it's
very very quick very very speedy
and the applications are pretty cool on
the iPod Touch 4th generation
