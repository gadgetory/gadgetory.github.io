motorola CEO just announced that they
are going to have a 2gig it hurts phone
that will be out before the end of the
year two gigahertz guys that is that
kind of blows my mind I'm just going to
be a little bit of perspective for
example you know the iphone 3gs has a
600 megahertz as megahertz that be point
6 gigahertz you look at maybe I the
nexus one that's only one gigahertz the
current motorola droid again 600
megahertz guys you can even compare this
to you know you bump up for example most
netbooks or 1.6 guys even my laptop
computer my dual core laptop computers
only 2.1 yards now of course gigahertz
on the entire deal I mean there's more
to it than that but it's certainly a
pretty big factor so assuming this phone
doesn't have 30 to 45 minutes of battery
life it should be an absolute just
monster um so they talked a little bit
about it and they basically say that
this is going to be the most
technologically advanced phone that is
possible right now and guys I gotta
believe it so they said it will have
android now of course they said that
this will be out before the end of the
year so we don't know if it'll be enjoy
2.2 maybe 2.3 or some other later
released depends on when it comes out
got some things going to be a monster
also like iphone 4 is going to have a
gyroscope so it's going to be definitely
a really nice feature for you know being
able to really have them really precise
motion controls just like on iphones can
bring a whole new dimension I'm really
I'm really glad that phones are starting
to bring this forward another thing is
it's going to have the nvidia tegra chip
guys if you don't know if this is this
is probably it's kind of it's really
coming around it's going to be it's a
very very powerful graphics chipset
where it allows you to have really
really powerful graphics guys i mean i
wouldn't be surprised with you know two
gigahertz CPU and the nvidia tegra chip
it will probably be able to you know
render much better than me probably
graphics close to like a playstation 2
maybe even beyond that it's going to be
really really powerful now with the
tegra chip they said it will support
full 10.1 flash which is pretty
obviously will do
lot slower rooms he'll do it with full
hardware acceleration too so guys hope I
mean it might be able to you might be
able to watch full flash videos and you
mean this this phone so you know just so
powerful little bit be able to do it
without having to strain let me surprise
me with specs like this you probably
watching three videos three flash videos
at a time running 10 apps I mean it's
just going to be ridiculous I'm guys so
they didn't need to actually say which
phone was going to called any more
details but talk about whether they give
details they give details guys there's a
lot of speculation about whether or not
this is going to be the motorola droid 2
of course the droid came out last late
last year but isn't getting about time
for a refresh you know a lot of other
phones have you know bump past it so
guys if this is going to be the motorola
droid 2 this is going to just be
phenomenal you know it might it might or
may not it also might just be a
different kind of foam well you know a
droid 2 is coming but it might be you
know maybe brand is something else it
might not have the hardware keyboard
integrate that guys though this is going
to be an excellent phone the many thing
I have a problem with is probably the
battery life is not going to be that
great but if they can get the battery
life to be decent without you know it
happen to be four inches thick or
whatever this is going to be a just an
excellent phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
