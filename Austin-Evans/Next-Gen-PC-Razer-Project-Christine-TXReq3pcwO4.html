at CES 2014 at the brazier groove with
what I think is always the coolest thing
of the show project Christine
so as you guys know I've been building
pcs for a while and while they're great
and we've seen a few advancements
especially with smaller pcs but for the
most part a PC is a giant tower that's
really not changed too much in quite a
while however this has maybe not is a
totally perfect concept it's very very
cool so the way it works is very simple
all you do is buy these add-on cards and
they will just slide in so the central
tower behind me is the full motherboard
so it's actually going vertical and
everything else just plugs into it with
a card so let's say you want to add a
graphics card throw it in
change your CPU take out the old one put
in a new one you need an SSD you want
hard drives
you want some better sound card all
these kind of things are totally
customizable so what we did was we
integrated liquid cooling into this
modular design so that's kind of really
cool because we use a central Bay where
the cooling liquid is stored and then
all the different cartridges have dual
self closing valves on them so as soon
as you connect them the liquid cooling
would actually run through the cartridge
itself and then as soon as you
disconnect the self sealing valve should
just not spill any cooling liquid at all
obviously the moly pcs for awhile you
know that's not really anything crazy
new what is new is the fact that it's
absolutely simple could not be easier
you just pull it out put it in so they
say that you can actually take any car
to put in any other slot you'd have like
a CPU and graphics card drivers bar and
you can swap them around so we'll see
how the interconnect is I'm not entirely
sure how a CPU and graphics card can be
plugged into the same spot and
everything is going to work fine but
I'll give them the bad out our goal is
to introduce this now and then gauge
response from our fans and from people
who hear about it and if that's if
there's enough positive demand for a
thing like this we would go into an
actual development for a final product
which we might see maybe one year or
maybe in two years down the road
obviously from here to a final product
is going to be a long wait a lot of
engineering hurdles to be overcome but I
think that's always been what Razer is
all about and we kind of want to see or
want to prove that there's still
innovation even in the space as
traditional as the desktop PC
unfortunately it's just a prototype at
the moment so maybe here in a year or
two we'll actually be able to have a
final version that actually works I'm
really excited to take a look and see
what project Christi is going to be all
about when we have a final version
anyway before we get out of here I've
got to give a big shout out to
Squarespace for powering my CES 2014
