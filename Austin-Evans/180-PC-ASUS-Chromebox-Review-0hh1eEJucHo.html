you want to be entered to win a new Asus
Taichi two and one
just tweet what inspires you about PAX
East with the hashtag Intel inspired by
April 18th hey guys this is Austin and
today here's the review of the new asus
chromebox is this little $180 computer
worth it the first thing you'll notice
is just how small the chrome box is
measuring in at just under five inches
or twelve centimeters wide it's
downright tiny for a complete desktop
and there's even an included vase amount
if you want to hide the chrome box
behind your monitor it's nothing too
fancy material-wise just some somewhat
thin plastic for considering the price
I'm totally fine with a safe little
black box you've also got plenty of
ports with a pair of USB 3.0 up front
and an SD card reader along the side in
addition to a couple more USB ports
around back
you also have both HDMI and DisplayPort
to connect your monitor flip it over and
you'll find a small event for air flow
which thankfully isn't a major issue as
the chromebox stays very quiet even when
working hard the stock configuration
comes with a single two byte laptop Dem
however upgrading it with another two
gigabytes is a great idea that should
only cost you twenty dollars or so
inside you'll find pretty modest specs
with a dual core Intel Haswell based
Celeron processor that two gigabytes of
RAM and a 16 gigabyte SSD since you're
basically just running a web browser
this is actually a good amount of
performance as I never felt like I was
waiting around for the chrome box to
catch up the 2d the bytes of memory is
probably the biggest weak point and even
that's not too bad I was able to
consistently keep around 10 tabs open
and still have things being nice and
responsive one welcome addition is the
built-in dual band Wi-Fi which was
consistently able to keep a strong
signal on my network which is definitely
important for a computer that's almost
entirely reliant on the Internet there
are a few offline apps such as Google
Drive and games like Angry Birds but for
the most part you need to be connected
all the time speaking of games while the
chromebox tablet isn't meant to be a
gaming PC you do have a few options
Bastion is able to run inside the
browser decently
although frame rate is definitely a
little choppy where Angry Birds will run
perfectly fine inside Chrome as someone
who hasn't used chrome OS since the
cr-48
it has come a long way
so if you guys aren't familiar Chrome OS
is essentially an alternative to Windows
there really is pretty much entirely
built around the Chrome browser there's
a traditional desktop and taskbar and
even a quick way to arrange your open
windows which is very similar to Windows
7 what you won't be able to do is
install your normal programs like Word
or Photoshop which depending on your
needs could either be no problem or a
complete deal-breaker considering just
how much time most of us spend in the
browser it actually works pretty well
and one upside to this is that since you
never install typical programs viruses
and malware are essentially not an issue
if you're already using Chrome all your
preferences and bookmarks will pop up
and you'll have an entirely set up new
computer in just a few minutes once
you're up and running it's basically
like using Chrome on any other computer
watching YouTube even an HD is no
problem in sites like twitch and Hulu
work right out of the box as well as
streaming music services such as Spotify
and Pandora you'll find flash and html5
support which covers the vast majority
of content on the web however you are
missing Java and Silverlight it's also
possible to install Linux if Chrome OS
isn't your thing and you want an awesome
little media PC for one or $80
I think Asus nailed it with the chrome
box a lot of people live in the browser
and if you do Chrome OS just make sense
so what do you guys think is the chrome
box worth it let me know in the comments
below anyway thank you guys so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
