here with what to expect with the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 3
now the note 2 is still one of my
favorite phones as it combines a huge
screen with awesome battery life so
let's see how their no three stacks up
to start with let's take a look at that
huge screen so the note 2 had a 5.5 inch
display whereas the note 3 is expected
to bump that up to a 5.8 inch 1080p
panel now even though the screen size
will get bigger that doesn't necessarily
mean that the phone will get any bigger
as if you look at the galaxy s3 versus
the galaxy s4 they're both pretty much
the same size however the galaxy s4 is
able to fit just a little bit of a
bigger screen in there by getting me or
some of the bezel around the edges
thanks to that it should keep the
removable back panel allowing you to
still get access to your micro SD card
slot as well as the battery and speaking
of that battery it should be awesome so
like I said earlier the note 2 has still
one of the best battery lives of any
phone that I've ever tested and even if
the note 3 is just a tiny improvement on
that it means it's still gonna be
probably among the best of the best as
far as the build quality goes that one's
still a question so some people think
that the note 3 will be made out of
metal similar to what we find on the HTC
One however I'm not quite sure as
Samsung has been continuously making
phones out of plastic and that's
definitely not a bad thing there are
pros and cons to using both aluminum or
plastic on your phone but Samsung has
been doing plastic for so long that
would be kind of surprised they decided
to move away from that although if we do
get an all aluminum fender note 3 I am
NOT gonna be complaining as far as specs
go this should be an absolute beast so
the note 3 is going to be rocking a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
quad-core processor as well as three
gigabytes of RAM
now I actually just want you to stop
just think about that for a second
this phone is going to be about as
powerful as some laptops and to top it
all off it's going to be running the
latest version of Android whether that's
Android 4.2 or who knows 4.3 might
actually be out by the time the note 3
is ready to be launched now we actually
know quite a bit about the camera as it
should be the exact same 13 megapixel
shooter from the Galaxy s4 so if you
guys have seen my review of the galaxy
s4 you'll know that's a very very good
camera with 13 by 8 pixels there's tons
of resolution it's a very crisp and
clear looking camera with good color
contrast pretty much the only slight
negative is that the low-light
performance it
quite as good as I'd like beyond that
it's an absolutely stellar camera and it
should be making its way over to the
galaxy note 3 so how about when you can
get your hands on this thing so I would
expect the note 3 to be announced in
early September and probably go on sale
a couple weeks later so it's actually
really very close so what do you guys
think about the Galaxy Note 3 personally
I'm excited I mean I still think the
note 2 is a pretty good phone but if you
update the screen get better specs and
update the build quality a little bit I
think it's gonna be absolutely awesome
but definitely sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below if
you're interested in more feel free to
check out my review of the Galaxy s4
which should give you a good idea of
what the note 3 is gonna be all about
and of course if you enjoyed this video

up and subscribe for more videos like
this including the full review of the
note 3 once it comes out anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
