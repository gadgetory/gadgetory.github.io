building the ultimate ps4 video where we
may have gone just a little bit over the
top over this time well I mean clearly
we kept things completely rational and
in no way overkill whatsoever we start
out once we have something simple this
is the Seagate game drive SSD now this
will work on both the Xbox one Jets as
well as the original Xbox one and the
idea is pretty simple this is a USB
based SSD unlike the ps4 which you can
easily swap out the stock drive for an
SSD with the Xbox the internal drive is
pretty much what you get the real
advantage with an SSD like this is going
to be in performance so you still have
the standard hard drives inside your
Xbox one but not only are games going to
load faster from this guy but it's also
going to give you an additional 512
gigabytes of storage so one thing to
know is that you don't actually have to
use a game drive for the Xbox it
supports any USB 3.0 tribe's at least
256 gigabytes but for 200 bucks the game
drive is not a bad deal what if that's
not enough that's where a sub comes in
so this is only going to work on the
original Xbox one but then it does it
give you an additional two USB ports but
also will let you install a full extra
hard drive so inside what we're getting
here is something that actually should
match pretty well with the Xbox one and
selling this guy should be as simple as
just lining it up with the USB port on
the side and so right as a box it
doesn't really add a lot of bulk to the
Xbox you're getting those an additional
USB ports over here but the real star of
the show is what you can actually put
inside this guy pop up in the back here
and you'll see our spot for a two and a
half inch hard drive now in theory you
could also put an SSD in here however
since we already have an SSD because
we've got to go in Max's storage on this
guy so make sure we're getting the most
out of the Xbox you have an additional
two terabyte hard drive we just need to
attach this bracket and the drive should
just slide into place alright so as
simple as that
at least in theory we added an
additional two terabytes of hard drive
space to our Xbox that's clearly not
enough so that's where the modular data
bank comes in with this guy we can add
an additional four terabytes of capacity
to our Xbox so inside the box this is
also fairly straightforward but it's
going to require maybe just a little bit
more work because unlike dropping a
small hard drive on the side
this guy codes right on
hahahaha alright who's already looking
goofy
unlike the media hub this guy is
actually going to live on top of the
Xbox and that's because it supports full
desktop three and a half inch hard drive
wait wait hold on the coffee house the
cecht is it like magnetic wow that's not
magnetic so don't put your xbox upside
down with the data Bank on but it is
being held in by something whether it's
like adhesives or magnet or something
always do is just take off this top
teeth so we can get at the three and a
half inch drive same and selling this
should be pretty straightforward all we
do is line up with our drive bay fly it
all the way back so it's fully seated
and that should give us an additional 4
terabytes in capacity with our Xbox one
I am already really proud of how
ridiculous looks and we're not even done
yet because next we have a intercooler
now if you remember from the ps4 video
we found that these really don't add a
whole lot of value it marginally might
cool your ps4 down just a touch so over
the Xbox one does have a very different
cooling solution essentially right below
this grate here is a very large fan so
in theory giving that more airflow could
help or it could just be a complete
waste of money
supposedly this will give us a 30% drop
in temperature which I find kind of hard
to believe but at least it does have a
couple of temperature sensors that will
tell us not only what the air
temperature is outside the Xbox but also
inside so once the Xbox is cooled off
after done gaming for example in theory
the fan should shut off automatically so
on the bottom we've got a fairly
substantial looking fan but beyond that
it pretty much should just drop right
into place over the Xbox so the power of
the cooler is as simple as just using
the included micro USB cable to take up
one of our USB ports on the back which
is kind of taking up all of our USB
ports but thankfully we have a bunch
more up front now so to take the
ridiculous one step farther we have the
nichael charge base so what this is
going to let us do is charge two Xbox
one controllers on top of this
monstrosity the only difference between
this and normal controller is this comes
with a separate backplate so one things
pop it on you'll see is the context of
the batteries on the back which means
that once we drop it onto the dock it
should automatically charge
there we go that's a proper Xbox one set
up right here what am i doing
put the ultimate xbox one over the top
we have the xim4
this little adapter is going to allow
you to use a mouse and keyboard on a
console specifically the Xbox one and
here we have the xim itself which kind
of looks like a glorified USB hub so
front we have a couple of USB ports as
well as one more on the back and micro
USB so with this in theory we will be
upper running with our Xbox one with a
mouse and keyboard or we could have just
got a PC so after about an hour of
fiddling with this to try to get it all
to work we now have a mouse and keyboard
support for Xbox one this is not the
most elegant solution what you have to
do is you have to run an original Xbox
one controller into this guy a mouse and
keyboard into it and then it goes out
via USB and it also just disconnected
why does it really just break so once we
get everything up and running it works
pretty well
so the way the xim4 works is that you
actually pair it with your phone and you
can sync over different profiles right
now playing the original titanfall but
there are profiles for most games for
ps3 ps4 Xbox 360 Xbox one and something
I appreciate about this is there's
really not a lot of latency now sure you
can notice maybe a touch of you're
really paying attention but as far as
I'm concerned it feels like I'm just
playing on a PC well it's just worth all
the extra complexity and hassle I'm not
so sold I think that it's a useful thing
if you're trying to build the ultimate
Xbox one it totally works but it's a lot
of extra hassle and honestly if you're
just doing this by a PC so take away
from the ultimate Xbox setup first of
all this is obviously overkill you
shouldn't do this to your Xbox it's dumb
but there are some interesting bits and
pieces in here so to start with the
enttec x1 cooler it's sort of
interesting it works well but it's not
useful the Xbox one is so over built
with cooling that this is really not
going to make a significant difference
as far as getting a charge station for
the Xbox it's not really that useful I
mean it is nice to be able to drop an
Xbox controller on but there are other
options that are not mounted on top of
the controller that make it look super
ridiculous the hard drive situation is a
little bit more complicated
always supports a maximum of two
additional drives on top of what's
inside so right now we have the four
terabyte drive connected and we could
get the SSD or we can get the two
terabyte drive all in together it's only
going to see two of the three at any
given time now unless you really need
all seven terabytes at once it's not
only a big issue and honestly I do
really appreciate how easy it is to
expand your storage with the Xbox
whether you want lots of space with a
normal hard drive or a really fast as a
speed so what do you guys think about
this totally not overkill Xbox one set
up let me know in the comments below but
if you guys want links to any of this
stuff they will be in the description
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
