here with the review of the Oppo find 5
now I'm paper this thing looks awesome
but how does it actually stack up the
first thing you'll notice about the find
5 is that it's a brick of a phone and I
mean that in a good way not only is it
fairly big but it's also quite a bit
heavier than something like the galaxy
s4 and solid is the perfect word to
describe the build quality even though
it's made out of plastic find five feels
like it can take some serious abuse
which is definitely something I like to
see fire it up to find a 5 inch full HD
1080p screen it's on par with the best
phones out right now with incredible
amounts of detail and very accurate
color and contrast fire up a game and
the large size definitely works well and
with that resolution there's no chance
of being able to see individual pixels
with the naked eye as an IPS display it
works reasonably well outdoors although
it isn't quite as bright as some other
phones up top you'll see a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera along with the
notification LED and speaker grille and
below the screen are the capacitive menu
home and back keys I accidentally hit
them quite often as they're closer to
the screen than I'd like
however it's something you get used to
another oddity is the placement of the
slate button on the left side of the
phone it was something I got used to
eventually but being over on the right
side or up top would have been better in
my opinion the back is coated in a
sharp-looking matte black finish with
the speaker grille on bottom and camera
up top audio quality was reasonable if a
little light on dynamic range which is
about what you should expect from most
phones these days the 13 megapixel
camera and dual LED flash is surrounded
by brush metal which adds a bit of style
to the otherwise plain back the images
overall are good not quite as nice as
what you'll find on the galaxy s4 but
you do have a lot of megapixels to work
with along with surprisingly decent
low-light performance where things get a
bit disappointing is when you take a
look at the software Oppo is loaded to
find v with a heavily skinned version of
Android 4.1 and it's a bit of a mess
the unlock screen looks nice for example
but would often not fully unlock unless
I was very deliberate if you set the
alarm or have a calendar notification by
default it plays a long and loud nature
sound that can be a real pain to
actually get shut off
app icons are automatically given as
shadow and background which just looks
bizarre next to some of the stock icons
which
pass on this treatment nothing in
particular amounts to a deal-breaker and
Oppo has been constantly upgrading the
phone but it didn't take me long before
I was ready to flash a custom ROM
hardware wise there's really not much to
complain about defined 5 sports a
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
running at 1.5 gigahertz along with 2
gigabytes of RAM and either 16 or 32
gigabytes of storage with no microSD
card slot while it's not quite up to the
cutting edge like on the galaxy s4 HTC
One it's still one of the fastest and
most responsive phones out today about
the only thing I can fault it for in
this department is the lack of LTE it
supports both 18 T and t-mobile here in
the US with HSPA+ which is plenty fast
for the most part but it would have been
definitely nice to see it rounded out
with LTE with the 2500 milliamp hour
battery I was impressed by the battery
life all but the most heavy smartphone
users should have no problem getting
through a day with defined 5 the find v
can be summed up two ways on the
hardware side it's got a beefy build
good specs good screen good battery life
with the only real exception being that
does not have LTE on the software side
however it is a bit of a mess now for
the most part it is usable and of course
it is Android 4.1 however this phone
really is in need of a good custom rom
with an unlock price of $500 it's a
tough sell compared to the Nexus 4 which
is not only cheaper but it's also a
better phone for most people however
keep in mind that Oppo twas a very new
company and the fact they've actually
been able to make a phone that's this
good and this competitive right out of
the gate is really impressive so if you
guys are interested in a phone with a
kick-ass build and don't mind flashing a
ROM the Oppo find 5 is definitely worth
a look
what do you think about the find 5 did
they miss the mark or did Oppo nail it
