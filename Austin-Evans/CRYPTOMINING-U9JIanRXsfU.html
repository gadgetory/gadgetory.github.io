me money right now
well that might sound like some scummy
pop up ad in reality it's all thanks to
crypto mining you've probably heard of
crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and
litecoin these are digital currencies
that are worth real-world money for
example a single Bitcoin goes for about
2400 dollars right now this has become a
really big industry not only has Bitcoin
been recognized as legal currency and
places like Japan but you can spin
Bitcoin a lot of online retailers such
as Microsoft playing games on Steam you
can even purchase things with PayPal
using Bitcoin it is a big deal for
example if you fire up a mining program
on your computer it will immediately
start crunching the numbers on different
transactions that come it's way as a
reward for doing all that hard work
you'll gain tiny tiny amounts of
cryptocurrency typically this doesn't
really equal much however it's things
like Bitcoin become more more valuable
it can actually add up there are two
different ways of getting your hands on
crypto currencies such as Bitcoin the
first is really straightforward you can
buy and sell them just like anything
else so the market will go up and down
and it does that a lot but the theory is
you buy them for cheap to sell for more
and you make a profit just like the
stock market the other is by mining so
every transaction is public so what that
means is that some computer has to do
the work of deciding that hey someone
has money it need to go the other person
make sure that's a legit transaction in
the early days you could use an ordinary
gaming PC to mine Bitcoin but it's
gotten more popular and more importantly
there's more competition for mining it
is pretty crazy to use a standard game
PC to mine Bitcoin today there has been
other cryptocurrencies that have sprung
up over the years
so back in 2013 I had a few different
litecoin mining rigs set up and
generally speaking if you have a PC with
a solid GPU you can make that work
however the issue is as things get more
and more popular people design work
called Asics which are literally custom
design chips that are purely made to
destroy a PC at mining today though
crypto mining has seen a major
resurgence and a lot of that is thanks
to a new option called aetherium now
this is something that actually does
make sense to mine on a standard gaming
PC so we've been using the CyberPower PC
that we did a video on recently which
actually is now down to $650 which is
kind of funny because thanks to crypto
mining even the graphics card itself
sometimes we'll go for $650 generally
speaking higher-end Andy cards like the
rx 580 that's inside is going to be your
for crypto mining and video options also
do work pretty well too if you have a
lower end card that's maybe a little bit
older it's going to draw a lot of power
you want to try mining on the CPU it's
generally not going to be worth it
Crypton mining really is all about the
GPU the actual setup for mining is
surprisingly straightforward a lot
better than it used to be so you just
need three things a PC to do your mining
a Bitcoin wallet and a mining program
there are lots of options for creating a
wallet but I use coinbase not only is it
fairly simple as they do pretty much all
the work for you but not only can you
buy Bitcoin but more importantly you can
sell them or just spend them for the
mining program a really easy option is
to use nice hash so this one's a normal
Windows app and all you do is let it do
its initial setup give it your Bitcoin
wallet address and it handled everything
else from there nice hash does take 3%
of everything that you mine then
returned it's a completely automatic
setup so if you're not super familiar
with this stuff it works pretty well and
it's even smart enough to automatically
pick between different algorithms based
on what's going to be most profitable
the cool thing is since this is just a
normal Windows program you can mine
whenever you want so say you want to
actually play some games on your gaming
PC just about mining for a few minutes
once you're done turn it back on
so I'm about to throw some numbers at
you guys but please take all of these
with a giant grain of salt let's can go
way up and wait I'm pretty much at any
point so right now with this set up over
the last few days it's average making
about two dollars and ten cents a day so
of course you do have to keep the
electricity bill in mind so with this
system and the electricity rates here
it's fully about 25 cents worth of power
a day that might not sound like much but
when you add it up that's about 57
dollars a month or about six hundred and
ninety dollars a year which is actually
enough to pay for the entire system but
and there's a giant but this changes all
the time
seriously so just today as we've been
filming this video prices have changed a
lot so earlier this morning we're making
about a dollar ninety day however right
now we're doing about two thousand
thirty one cents in mining it really
does change on an almost hourly basis
all this is just an example with this
single graphics card inside the system
so you have a really beefy system let's
say a pair of 1080 eyes you could be
making a lot more money on the other
hand if you have an older grabbe's card
it might not even make sense to my in
the first place
so there is a cool calculator I have
that linked in the description we can
plug in what your hardware is it will
tell you roughly about how much you
would make per day what doesn't really
make sense
is going on buying a bunch of hardware
just to start mining so this is actually
made graphic cards not only out of stock
in a lot of places almost more important
than that really really expensive what I
think makes a little bit more sense is
if you already have a gaming PC and you
just want to give this a try it is kind
of fun I'm thinking need to keep in mind
though is that this is going to be
essentially running your GPU at 100%
24/7 it's not necessarily going to
immediately break or anything but we'll
definitely shorten the life span of your
card
this definitely isn't for everyone but
as a nerd there is something kind of fun
about this so what do you guys think
about mining cryptocurrency let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
