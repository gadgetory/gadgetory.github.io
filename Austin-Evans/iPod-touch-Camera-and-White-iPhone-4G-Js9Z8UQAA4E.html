everything and that's what I would say
if I had a you know prototype you know
iPod Touch with a camera of course you
know that app would probably sue me for
and stuff like that which okay I'm just
joking but somebody did should get an
iPod touch with their camera as well as
show somebody has a white iPhone 4G yeah
not black white so go ahead go through
all that guys by the way Apple please
Nestle me this is actually not a you
know it doesn't have camera honest oh
hey guys so there's two big things this
morning the first of which I'm going to
go ahead and cover is the iPod touch
with a camera
to be honest I'm a little skeptical
after that we got burn on the last one
with not having a camera I'm I'm not
going to be totally convinced until I
actually see Steve Jobs go here's my
clock with the camera but until then I'm
kind of feeling I'm hoping the one they
showed looked like it was just a normal
I pod it didn't have any kind of
redesign basically the only differences
were that it had a camera and as well as
a micro microphone this is what it
looked like so I don't you can say well
look out for it if this is not just an
old prototype just from Lobster that's
just somebody pulled up they may very
well actually could be coming out and
they'd be here in a month or so they
might make it and then it might be like
a three and a half G and then like a 4G
iPod Touch might come out in September
we don't know but we'll just have to
find out soon now the next big story we
have is going to be the iPhone 4G now of
course we've seen things like dozens of
prototypes people just been leaking like
crazy but what really cool things is
that something I hadn't thought of but
it looks like there's going to be a
white version now of course this makes
sense there's been a white iPhone
there's that white iPhone 3G white
iPhone 3GS so make sense there being
white iPhone 4G
HD programming learn the name
there's some pictures circulating around
of the iPod iPhone and white and it
looks pretty good I gotta admit that's
not a full it's not like a normal
prototype like we've seen before it's
just more of like the bits and pieces of
it but it does look to be pretty legit
so yeah guys that's it for today's daily
Apple products stuff yeah guys
definitely a comic though I'm really
interested to know what are you guys
more excited about are you more excited
about maybe getting I can a white iPhone
4G or you just want an iPod Touch with a
camera personally I've got to say I'm a
big fan of the iPod Touch and I really
hope it gets the camera
I mean we've waited for it and we
thought we had it and we didn't have it
and then you know all kinds of stuff so
I really hope that they actually have an
iPod Touch of the camera actually I hope
it really copes it I really hope it
comes out soon I mean I don't know I'm a
little skeptical this one looks pretty
much just like the prototypes we've seen
before but who knows I mean what I hope
happen is that actually just go ahead
and bring it out like I said like a
three and a half G whatever run for a
few months then before the full iPod
redesign but hey who knows anyway guys
just be sure to let me know what you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
