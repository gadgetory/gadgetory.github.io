checking out some weird tech we have a
peel box listed on the channel and
sometimes companies send us some weird
tech so Ken please what is our first
item has a fourth row infinite on the
smartest screen keyboard in the world I
mean with a Bing button you know it's
got to be smart so there are 15
programmable keys and each key is 72 by
72 pixels so there is a product that
I've seen that's kind of similar to this
which would be the elgato stream deck
the idea here is that once you plug it
in you can have each of these buttons to
be customizable and at least in the al
Gaudi's case it's usually used for
streaming so after a few minutes of
setup we have a few things that are
programmed in so for example I can open
up a Word document copy paste hey guys
this is Austin and then press the other
button to actually launch the channel
now this is super simple and at 150
dollars this is not going to be for
everyone but it's actually kind of
decent USB motion sensor it places the
computer into sleep mode if no motion is
detected for a period of time you could
just set the screensaver i legit 'le
cannot think of a single reason well you
would use this over just setting your
computer to go to sleep oh boy the
Russian Federation oh let's give you
exciting see the fun of doing something
like this is that usually Ken picks out
things that I know he gets on purpose to
be terrible but with this I have
legitimately no idea what's inside this
weird box from Russia
greetings Austin we're a small company
from Moscow Russia and we sent you one
of our wonderful Nixie tube clocks if
you guys have never seen it Nixie tube
before it's essentially like a retro way
of looking at like the time or like
numbers or something and you know is
that anyone still made these whoa that
looks so cool
that is so cool it's not really a
traditional piece of tech but man is not
what I expected to see today I was
expecting lots of terrible tech and not
this really elegant and cool-looking
retro clock - to what auto water what's
step into the future with touchless
faucets
wait so is the idea that this is just
going to be a automatic faucet where you
don't have to touch it yep that's
exactly what it is hey guys
Zhou Stein and welcome to Austen's
kitchen corner where I reviewed the
latest and hot new bathroom gadgets Oh
so you can actually already can tell
that uh either there's no water that the
faucet is turning on and off when I put
my hand underneath it
the leagoo s8 oh I get it
s8 like a certain other Samsung Galaxy
s8 that's really heavy why is it so
heavy so at first glance the phone even
though it is similar to the Galaxy s8
actually isn't too bad so it jumps out
to me is that it feels not only a little
bit thicker but a lot heavier which
actually kind of don't hate although the
back is an absolute dust and fingerprint
and magnets I can say one thing they did
well though there's a fingerprint sensor
at a reasonable spot on the back of the
phone
unlike you know the real Galaxy s8 oh
I've got the blur mode alright let's try
the blur mode oh wow um blur mode not
good not good
how much is the thing I wonder how I'm
actually curious how much does it cost
the leagoo s8 oh it's only like $100
that actually makes it a lot better I
expected it to be a lot more expensive
it does have a 1.5 gigahertz octa-core
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of storage as well as a 3000
milliamp hour battery I will say though
for around $100 this is actually really
nice hardware yeah
the software is a little weird and the
cameras aren't exactly great but for 100
bucks
climate case insulating smart phone case
prevents your smartphone from
overheating
freezing fits all brands and models of
smartphones man they're making some bold
statements here what is this what what
what's this sign here it's so heavy oh
there's nothing inside here it's like
gel so the idea here is that if you're
going to go out in a cold area you
microwave this case and if you want to
go out in a super hot area you put it in
the refrigerator let Mellie do you have
this metal carabiner which obviously
should go in the microwave what happens
when some person doesn't read the
instructions puts they're told phone
inside this and microwaves the whole
thing soft glass you are unique
is this a screen protector what's thanks
for the iPhone 10 oh it is a screen
protector a volunteer to try the soft
glass screen protector Ken Ken this is
the front so we do that later so I guess
we peel off the back first yeah I'll sit
back on it flip it over okay you just
take this off oh dude Wow
I think we may we might have put a good
screen protector the first time ever hey
Austin I'm a 360 camera from instep it's
kind of weird that the camera apparently
wrote a note
someone could you said hey we have this
really cool camera it does these things
not I am the camera this is what I do
insta 361 a 360 vr camera they promise
you can do 4k video and 24 megapixel
photos in full 360 inside the insta 361
we get the camera so the D here is that
not only is this going to be usable as a
standalone camera but if you plug it
into an iPhone which obviously will not
look quite as good on YouTube what the
idea here is that I can get a full 360
view of pretty much everything around me
and I mean it actually looks kind of
cool I played around with a few 360
cameras like this and while a lot of
them look kind of ok especially the ones
that plug into the iPhone
I didn't have high expectations when I
saw a 360 camera show up but I gotta say
this is a lot cooler than I thought I
might actually have to take a closer
look at it later
so that's it for this first episode of
weird tech from my p.o box doesn't be
sure to let me know if you want to see
any more of this stuff in a future video
and I will catch you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
