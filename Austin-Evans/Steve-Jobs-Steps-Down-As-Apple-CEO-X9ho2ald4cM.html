news
effective immediately Steve Jobs is
going to be stepping down as a CEO of
Apple now I don't need to really remind
you guys of how important of a figure
Steve Jobs was of course when he took
back over Apple about 12 or 13 years ago
or so Apple was about dead I mean it was
really really doing badly and now look
at it apples the most successful and
probably the richest company on the face
of the earth right now an absolutely
huge turn of events with the iPod was
really starting Mac the iPhone with iPad
all these hugely successful products and
of course all that came under Steve Jobs
as rain however unfortunately that day
is over so it just can't the news just
broke he is going to be remaining with
the company as you would expect he wants
to be the chairman of the board which I
don't see any reason why they would not
let him do that but the new CEO of Apple
will be Tim Cook if you guys are not
familiar with who that is basically Tim
Cook has actually been filling in for
Steve Jobs
he's been on two medical leaves so far
in the past couple years and he's filled
in from the whole time than doing the
CEO stuff so no major changes should
happen and of course all the reading out
all the current product plans for Apple
all the iPhones and stuff for the
foreseeable future are definitely going
to remain the same now of course what
the major thing that this means is that
for Steve Jobs is getting old and of
course he has been dealing with cancer
for quite a while so I don't think
anyone's gonna be too upset to see him
finally retire after so long but of
course this is still going to be good
news it's not like he's gonna just be
disappearing or anything like that he
does like I said remain want to want to
remain with the company and I'm
absolutely positive that he will still
have a pretty big voice as far as all
the new products and all the future
plans of Apple so anyway guys I just
wanted to give you this quick video make
sure that you guys all knew and very
very curious to know what do you guys
think about this I know a lot of people
don't like Apple and this and that I
don't think anyone can deny the huge
impact that Steve Jobs and Apple of
course have had on the entire technology
industry in the past 10 15 years or so
so very curious to know what you guys
have to say definitely be sure to leave
all the comments you like in the comment
section below and I will catch you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
