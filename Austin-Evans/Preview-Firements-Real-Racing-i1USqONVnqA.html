the first real racing simulator for the
iPhone and iPod Touch model games such
as fast lane street racing in the Fast
and the Furious game do a very good job
of utilizing the potential of the AI
devices Real Racing appears to take the
racing genre to the next level real
racing brings some extremely sharp
graphics to the iPhone putting shame
almost any other racing game available
along with the impressive graphics come
what appeared to be some of the most
realistic physics we've seen yet
bring it solidly on par with fantastic
graphics of the original Gran Turismo
for PlayStation one of the highlights of
the game something that has been only
seen in a handful of other games in wz4
comes to mind is the addition of an
in-car view this is something that is
not even common from any brand new
console games I Forza Motorsport for
Xbox 360 which gives you a great drivers
view while graphics and physics both
really make this game shine it's online
features that really make this game a
standout in real racing you have very
many cool options a major upside is the
addition of full online multiplayer you
can quickly go to race anyone globally
with a multitude of different ways to
play and then a very cool feature is
that you can create a video of a race
and upload it to YouTube with the press
of a button and share it with your
friends offering 12 tracks and 36 cars
would launch rural racing looks to be
the next big game for the iPhone and
iPod Touch I think I already won the
International mobile gaming award for
excellence and kind of and connectivity
recently the GDC 2009 definitely looks
like something to look forward to one
that places said although I would expect
it to be probably $9.99 when it launches
definitely look for this game sometime
in early May the meantime fireman has a
trailer to what your appetite be sure to
check out zircon for the latest on Real
Racing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
