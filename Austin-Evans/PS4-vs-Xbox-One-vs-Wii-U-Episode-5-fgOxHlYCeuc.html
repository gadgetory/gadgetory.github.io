about time to add a new challenger how
does the Wii U stack up with the ps4 and
Xbox one Nintendo took a totally
different approach than Sony and
Microsoft this generation not only is it
almost comically smaller than the Xbox
but you might notice the controller is
just a little different
the Wii U uses the gamepad which is a
hybrid controller and tablet it's a
clever piece of tech that gives you a
lot of extra features on top of being
able to stream gameplay from the console
it works well there's next to no latency
and it frees you up to play a lot of
games on the gamepad without needing to
use a TV it's also where you can use a
meebo they're not really needed for most
games but they look cool and can unlock
new characters or levels the controls
are fine but it's a massive controller
it can be a bit uncomfortable to use for
longer periods and you'll need to charge
it far more often than the others one of
the bigger problems with the gamepad is
the price it's included with the Wii U
but because it's necessary that means
the Wii U cost basically as much as the
ps4 and Xbox one on paper it just can't
measure up the Wii U has a far less
powerful CPU graphics and only a quarter
as much RAM as the others making it
closer to a last gen console in the spec
Department it also only comes with 32
gigabytes of storage meaning you'll
probably have to take advantage of an
external hard drive one area where it
does have a big advantage is with power
usage the lower end specs help it to
need far less power especially while
gaming and that's really where it shines
titles like smash look far better than
you would expect based on the specs and
games like xenoblade do an impressive
job of pushing the hardware to the limit
with totally respectable graphics
Nintendo's art style like in splatoon
also goes a long way toward evening the
gap the first party games are absolutely
the strongest part of the Wii U Nintendo
has assembled a huge library of killer
games like Mario Kart you'll also find a
few third-party titles such as watchdogs
which are solid but few and far between
especially when you compare to what the
games look like on the ps4 the Wii U
really can't hold up there are some
games that are shared but things like
Minecraft came out years later and is
bizarrely $10 more than the others other
triple-a titles just aren't here if you
get away you you've got to be serious
about Nintendo games there is a solid
selection of virtual console titles
though with everything from NES to wheat
the games could be on the slightly
expensive side but the emulation is
solid and it's nice to be able to not
only play games on the TV but also on
the gamepad you also essentially have a
full we built-in
hook up a Wii mote and you can get in
the old school we menu and player discs
with a clean hdmi output the xbox is
just starting to add backwards
compatibility and the ps4 uses the less
than stellar PS now so if you have a big
we game library the Wii U has you
covered on the other hand the interface
is usable but feels a full step behind
the others it's a bit less serious but
things like multitasking and just moving
around is noticeably slower than the
others put it beside the ps4 and things
are much more grown up with a more
mature online store with a far better
selection the same goes for the new Xbox
one interface it's a lot better for
multitasking and it also does much
better with media you'll find the basic
apps on the Wii U like Netflix YouTube
and Hulu but not things like twitch and
Spotify which is a bit of a shame it
doesn't support DVDs or blu-rays either
if you're serious about media the Wii U
just isn't your console games are the
biggest strengths but also the biggest
weakness of the Wii U on one hand you've
got killer titles like Mario maker and
smash but on the other you have next to
no third-party support for big games
the Wii U makes way more sense as a
second console alongside a PlayStation
Xbox or even PC but with its replacement
looming on the horizon now might not be
the greatest time to invest in the Wii U
with five videos down the console
comparison is nearly out of clothes but
stay tuned there's one last episode to
determine the winner
