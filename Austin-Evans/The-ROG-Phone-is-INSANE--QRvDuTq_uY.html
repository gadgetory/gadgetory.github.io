ROG phone so in a Sue's invited us out
to their event here at Computex I had a
few big questions so after seeing the
razor phone last year there's some
interesting stuff there's some stuff
that it does well but at the end of the
day it has a great display it has an
interesting build but it's not a great
phone now I don't want to be too hard on
the razor phone as there are some things
that does well but at the end of the day
I don't care how gaming focused of a
device you're making it has to be a good
phone and the ROG phone at least on
paper and sort of based on first
impressions looks like it is that good
balance so what is the ROG phone what
you're getting here is on the surface a
very unique looking device and when I
say that I mean it not only do you have
an LED that is going to be full RGB on
the back but you've got a vent
you've got vapor chamber cooling and
you've got what looks to be one of the
best-looking displays I've ever seen on
a smartphone the LG phone is rocking a
six-inch 2160 by 1080p AMOLED display
now that might not sound impressive but
what you're getting here is two things
first of all it's a solid panel
it's got good viewing angles really
impressive brightness it's going to
support HDR but almost more importantly
than that it's going to be running at a
full 90 Hertz no yes
on paper the razor phone has it beat but
now you're getting a much much nicer
looking OLED panel but as far as I'm
concerned bringing it in 90 frames per
second versus 120 frames per second it's
very hard to tell on any display
especially when it comes to a phone so
what you're getting here is actually a
decent I'm gonna stop pressing stings
accidentally no if you take a look at
the back of the phone you'll definitely
see it's got some gamer style but I
actually don't think it's that bad it's
going to be fairly subtle especially
when you considering that this is going
to be glass sort of blends in a little
bit and while you do have a glowing LED
logo it's going to be completely
customizable and importantly you can
also turn it off if you don't want to
you know if you're seeing in a meeting
looking like this the rest of the specs
are literally as high-end as you can
imagine this guy is rocking the
snapdragon 845 but not just any
snapdragon 845 it's actually a custom
version which is running it just under
three gigahertz they don't have the
exact SKUs just yet but you should
expect a gigs of ram and up to
supposedly 512 gigabytes of storage
camera wise you're getting a set up that
is very similar to the zenfone 5 and 5z
a wide-angle 8 megapixel camera as well
as a 12 megapixel standard shooter now
the main difference here is that these
are going to be supported by Google's AR
core which should be helpful for some AR
games in the future but expect decent
performance maybe not anything
spectacular but definitely better than
the razor phone might be tuning to the
razor phone all this is being backed up
by a four thousand milliamp hour battery
a pretty decent size especially
considering that you have to have so
much power to run phone like this now
there's some other things that are
definitely appreciated first of all we
do have USB C as well as a headphone
jack and two more USB ports which I'll
talk about in a second but you're also
going to be getting some really
impressive sounding front firing
speakers those are incredibly loud
speakers something cool that shared with
the pixel two is that you can actually
squeeze on the edges of the phone to be
able to enable gaming mode so on the
pixel that'll turn on Google assistant
but here you can see it turns whole red
and looks cool and this will turn off
things like notifications when you're in
the game enable a higher level of
performance and just look really cool if
you take a look at the top of the phone
what you're going to find are there two
little sort of ridged edges here now
this actually can be mapped inside the
software to be an actual button so as
opposed to needing to carry around a
controller for some games you might just
be able to use these as triggers because
it's all going to be pressure-sensitive
it's actually kind of cool and one of my
favorite parts even though it's not
really all that important is if I
actually open up the camera here you can
see it if I just press on top it takes a
shot which is cool right it feels like a
real camera you don't have to think
about it like I think I naturally sort
of press down on this part of the phone
when taking a shot but it actually works
as a shutter button here what really
pushes the ROG phone into crazy talent
are going to be the accessories so in
addition to your standard USB C port and
a headphone jack that you're going to
find on the bottom of the phone the side
of the phone also has two more USB ports
the first accessory is the arrow active
cooler now this moves your USB C port as
well as your headphone jack to the side
of the phone so when you're playing in
landscape it doesn't sort of get in your
way when you're trying to hold it on
either end but on top of that it has RGB
because of course it does it's a phone
in 2018 that has the ROG brand on it and
on top of that it's also going to
function as an actual cooler for your
phone and importantly this is included
in the box unlike some
other slightly more exciting accessories
but I would say one thing because the
fan is going to be cooling the entire
back of the foam because of the vapor
chamber which runs most of the way here
you're actually getting a little bit of
cool air on your fingers when you're
holding it like this which is nice play
any kind of smartphone game for an
extended period of time you know that it
can get very hot very quickly there's
also the mobile desktop dock so this is
actually a pretty hardcore accessory
which when you dock your phone inside of
it will give you a wide range of ports
including Ethernet HDMI DisplayPort a
ton of USB ports and importantly it's
also going to allow you to use a mouse
and keyboard in the game now this paired
with some clever software will allow you
to use a mouse and keyboard on literally
any Android game out there the way it
works is is that it will remap various
different parts of your display to go
along with your keyboard or Mouse so for
example if you hit the e key on your
keyboard it can press a specific part of
the display that might you know reload
or pick something up now to be fair the
very early ROG phones that I got to try
was not super smooth as far as this went
so we'll kind of have to wait and see
but I feel like it's a very simple piece
of tech that I'm sure they'll be able to
sort out by the time the phone comes out
the real issue is going to be I think
this is kind of cheating because most
people are playing on their actual
phones and someone else could just drop
their phone on the dock and play with a
full mouse and keyboard so we'll see
about that but super clever and I think
actually could be implemented pretty
well something just as crazy is the twin
View dock now this sort of turns your og
phone into something that kind of looks
like a Nintendo DS so essentially when
you drop your phone in it's going to
give you a secondary display which you
can use for a lot of different purposes
for example if you want to say stream
from your phone you could have the
actual chat and the twitch window up on
one screen and your actual game on the
other but there's a lot of really cool
advantages that you could have with this
especially considering that it does have
not only a full sized SD card slot and
USB see out but it even does have a full
six thousand milliamp hour battery there
is a lot to like with the ROG phone now
the idea of having a phone that's
dedicated to gaming it first was very
skeptical to me right
so yes it's going to be a nice function
to be able to have something that can do
well at gaming but I mean at the end of
the day it's a phone and it has to be
able to function well as a phone so
based on what I've seen with the ROG
phone it does perform well but
importantly it still doesn't really give
up a lot of functionality or features
right you can still fit it in your
pocket it's not going to be giant it's
not going to be bulky as
nice display good performance all the
things that you would expect now the
main issue and I think the main thing
that really sort of worries me with the
ROG phone is going to be price this is
not going to be cheap especially
considering that it does come with the
actual fan attachment inside the box so
of course it's too early to know about
the actual specific pricing or any kind
of availability although it should be
out later this year but the thing that
really worries me is that this is going
to be $1,000 plus foam no I get it if
it's going to be in the $800 to $1,000
range I think it's actually going to be
justified right I mean you compare it to
something like a Galaxy Note 8 or
something it's not going to be far off
but if it's going to be thousand eleven
$1,200
that's going to be a lot of money for
essentially a Tsar oh geez first phone
some very curious what do you guys think
about the ROG phone let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
