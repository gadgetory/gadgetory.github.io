Austin and today I'm here for something
a little different look at my friend
Alex here and we're going to be building
a computer so I'm gonna be blindfolded
and together we're gonna see if we can
build this computer okay
like if you're a book computer you know
how much can she hear oh no oh yeah I
can
you look cool though yeah yeah it's a
lot that's such a lie so start with
getting the big brown box it should say
Coursera yup okay okay hey hands off
mmm that's a good sound all right let me
strategically not break anything I want
to put your finger here and just like
give it a feel and write down down down
yeah no oh right there so this is a back
of the case yeah okay so this is where
the power supply should go okay yeah did
I just get it that's not going anywhere
yeah okay cool so that is actually a
step one the case is actually kind of
definitely I don't like that feels right
does that like a bunch of like computer
stuff that yeah
finish directions but I'm guessing
weight of them we don't need directions
pretty much everything in the computer
hooks up to this somehow there we go
that sounded like some mad genes right
there we're looking at the back of the
case yeah okay I know oh it's on the
side wait what do you think it's inside
its is she gonna be really tough because
you're gonna like make sure it pops let
me just make sure it's like fully like
popped in there that was easy
oh wow you have to dig it yeah so
there's two notches there's two notches
yeah like Oh like a little curvature
okay yeah you see this - yes so she
should go straight in no pressure it's
you're just rest there even so I can't
help with this one this is gonna be all
you I think I did it perfect good job
thank you thank you hire me thank
you see four little holes yeah okay so
line it up and just kind of gently set
it down to make sure it's lined up okay
I believe it fun isn't it
yeah so we're actually almost ready to
put this in the case okay there's only
one step left here and that's finding
the memory so basically what I would do
is like just lined up in the slot come
on above and then use your thumb there
kind of like present please Oh who's
that maybe nervous no oh I know what I
just put my finger and without an that
Pleasant those ports basically set them
down so like those ports are sticking
out but you'll see inside the case
there's like one Myles dancing yep yeah
keep going
so inside the case there's one metal
standoff in the middle it's kind of like
taller uh-huh you see that one yeah
that's like the center point right so
like if you rest the motherboard on it
then I'll kind of like Center everything
is it not fitting or it's not good it's
hard to get it lined up right so the
motherboard does it look like it's lined
up back here you see all the ports yes
uh okay I think it's good we in yeah now
comes the next bit which is the graphics
card okay okay bye-bye
okay cool all right so open it up and
there should be a graphics card inside
slide in hot place and we're good I'm
not doing this right okay so it goes in
like this let's show the viewers at home
sure the boys at home uh oh yes I'm
weird
oh oh that was so satisfying high-five
okay so after a little bit of
fast-forward I think we're about set up
hopefully yeah boy what's your
confidence level right now um you know I
had a good day I think that's a good
sign I had a good taste the ice cubes
it was a good day and everybody's happy
so alright blindfold off time that's
right
oh good yeah yeah good make me feel
better
gute amazing if you best build a nursing
in my life this is this is perfect
perfection
you ready yeah pick up smooth fingers
crush rings three two one oh you played
it
oh now now let's try it again
okay good boy life oh this is actual
real high five time wow I really we need
to like Doug do something now what's a
different day like we did it
well I I feel like we should do another
video oh yeah
you know I had a pretty good idea okay
go for it uh so I do a dating series on
my channel
okay uh first off would you go on a date
with me no no you know the computer Iowa
absolutely doesn't go look I think that
was your date test for me okay right now
I have mine for you I like to feel
comfortable with people okay so I
thought the best way we could feel
comfortable with one another is if we
watched a virtual reality porn thank you
so much

course and see you guys over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
