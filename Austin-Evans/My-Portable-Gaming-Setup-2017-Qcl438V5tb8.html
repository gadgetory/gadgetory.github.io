portable gaming setup so it might not
look like much from the outside but
inside this bag is everything I need to
game on the go
first of all I've got to give a big
shout out to ASA for sponsoring this
video the star of my portable setup is
their predator Helios 300 laptop for
just over a thousand dollars what you're
getting here is a pretty well built
laptop so yes for some people the gamer
aesthetic might be a little bit strong
but for me I feel like it's fairly
subtle and you do have that kind of nice
brushed aluminum look what really makes
this guy special are the specs so inside
it's rocking a core i7 7700 HQ processor
GTX 1060 graphics as well as 16 gigs of
DDR 4 memory as well as a 256 gigabyte
SSD take a look at the benchmarks and
you'll see that that core i7 is about as
good as it gets as far as gaming laptops
go right now and with the gtx 1060
inside is a big step up with a 1050 Ti
and especially the 1050 it's also pretty
upgradable so underneath a pair of doors
on the bottom of the laptop both of
which only need a single screw to get
into not only can you upgrade this guy
to 32 gigabytes of memory but there's
also an entirely empty two and a half
inch drive bay for adding a hard drive
or another SSD it's also rocking a 15.6
inch 1080p IPS panel so a lot of laptops
weirdly even gaming laptops will skimp
on the screen Department but this is a
solid IPS panel it's got good viewing
angles solid color and 1080p is a good
sweet spot for that gtx 1060 inside it's
also running a basically clean build of
Windows 10 which is nice so if you want
to get into the gaming side of things
there is the Xbox app which gives you
game DVR as well as you can connect with
people on Xbox one and one of the only
things that's actually pre-loaded is a
sirs predator since software which is
fairly basic but allows you to take a
look at things like temperature as well
as control fan profiles with the Helios
we're able to play most games on high if
not ultra settings at 1080p so Forza
horizon 3 is a good example of this
now I typically play it on the Xbox one
where it runs it you know decent 30
frames per second on high settings but
here not only can we crank it up to
ultra but more importantly we have an
unlocked framerate where we're getting
anywhere between 60 to 80 frames per
second a gink I don't get to play
anywhere near enough but really enjoy is
Starcraft 2 now with something that's
been out for a few years it shouldn't be
any big surprise but we're easily able
to play on full Ultra settings at 1080p
nation we have player unknowns
battlegrounds so pub G is again
it's actually seen a fair bit of
optimization lately and it runs pretty
well here
so it's 1080p with a mix of medium high
and a couple of Ultra settings where
she's able to get a pretty consistent 50
to 60 frames per second oh god oh god I
was a bad idea running naked down the
street totally recommended never gonna
never gonna go wrong now to go along
with the laptop I actually do use a
samsung t5 which I keep in this little
carrying case so this is where I keep my
Steam library so because I go between
different computers both here at the
office as well as my personal laptop so
it's nice to be able to keep all of my
games in one place so I don't have to
download them again all over the place
keep them updated and because this is
natively USB see it will go right into
the Predators USB C port give me an
extra 500 gigs of storage for games so
when it comes to actually gaming I don't
use anything all that crazy I use a
pretty standard mouse pad as well as the
Ben qfk one mouse don't let looks fool
you even though this is a very basic
plain looking Mouse it actually performs
really well so I'm not really a big fan
of sort of more flashing mice with a ton
of buttons and RGB something that this
is really all I need for a gaming setup
and it definitely doesn't hurt that's
only like 60 bucks
well the prior keyboard paired with the
Ben q mouse is what I need for about 90%
of my games I actually do like to play
some racing games like Forza which is
where the Xbox one controller comes in
so this is one of their custom design
lab controllers they actually did a
video on a few months ago but as far as
the actual functionality it's the exact
same as any of the new Xbox one
controllers that feature bluetooth so
some of the older ones you either had to
plug in via USB or use one of the
wireless dongles and for this guy all I
need to do is pair it with the laptop
and I'm up and running for headphones
I'm still rocking these status CB ones
so this is actually my second pair
actually sort of wore through the first
but I really do love these so not only
do they sound really nice especially
considering the $80 price tag but
they're super comfortable for long
gaming sessions and on top of that they
do fold up so you can easily fit them in
a bag it might not be exciting but I
also keep a four port tap on me so I'm
only does this turn one outlet into four
but you also get three USB ports
especially when you're traveling and you
need to say plug a couple laptops or
tablets or phones in this thing can be a
lifesaver
everything goes inside a to me cheap-ass
bag now don't get me wrong this is
definitely on the pricey side but now
does it carry all of my accessories as
well as sometimes some video gear but
most importantly the Helios 300 it might
not be overkill but I'm pretty happy
with how the setup turned out
as always links to all this stuff will
be in the description of this video and
let me know what you guys think about my
setup in the comments below anyway thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
