review of the original Game Boy released
by Nintendo in 1989 I think it's safe to
say this is one of the most important
video game console releases ever let's
see what it's all about the first thing
you'll notice is that the original Game
Boy was big it's still pocketable but by
today's standards it's a break while you
definitely won't forget it's in your
pocket there are some advantages to its
size it fits well on the hand and
everything has a very solid feel that
you don't find often in newer systems
like the 3d s most Game Boys came in
great over in 1995 Nintendo released the
play at lab models which brought new
close to the line including blind in my
favorite transparent while the Gameboy
wasn't the first portable console to use
cartridges it was the first to bring
into the mainstream compared to its
bigger brothers cartridge downright tiny
was storage between 32 kilobytes and a
whopping 1 megabyte unsurprisingly
face-melting graphics weren't part of
the equation
the game will rocks a four point one
nine megahertz 8-bit CPU and eight
kilobytes of RAM
despite entire games taking a far less
space than a single low quality mp3 they
won't have bad looking at all with over
800 games made during the 10-year
lifespan of the Gameboy you had
everything from racing games to RPGs one
part where the nostalgia michigan gives
up a bit is with the screen the og
gameboy sports a 2.6 inch screen with a
resolution of 160 by 144 the size and
resolution are just fine the problem is
is that it's green really really green
you can adjust the contrast with the
dial on the left side of the system but
even then you're limited to four shades
of green like most game boys it's not
backlit so you'll need to play near
source of life but for most games it
works alright something that made the
Game Boy a bit unique was the addition
of a link cable port this allowed you to
connect to Game Boys together to compete
or trade something that Pokemon took
full advantage of one of the reasons the
Game Boy is so large is because it needs
four double A batteries this might seem
like overkill today but this along with
the modest technical specs gave the
system anywhere between 10 and 14 hours
of battery life whereas competitors like
the game gear and links required six
double-a batteries and only managed four
or five hours in fact the game gear and
links are great examples of the game
boys massive success how many of you
have honestly heard of either of these
consoles before with games like Tetris
and Pokemon Nintendo had a runaway
success from nearly 15 years
sunny finally entered the PSP into the
ring to compete and even today the 3ds
is still the most popular dedicated
console of this generation he may not
have had the best screen or been the
slimmest console but there's a little
about the gameboy helps shape gaming as
we know it today now if you'll excuse me
I'm going to go back to being 6 years
old again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
