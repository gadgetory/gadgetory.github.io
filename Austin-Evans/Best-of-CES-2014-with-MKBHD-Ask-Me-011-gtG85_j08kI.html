here at CES 2014 with a new ask me
answering all kinds of questions from
you guys over this time I have my good
buddy m√°rquez's so you're gonna do this
what is your favorite thing you both saw
at CES for me it was definitely the
oculus rift crystal code
I guess prototype so I've been a fan of
our tails for a little while and thanks
you guys haven't seen that video you can
go check that out but I'm a huge fan of
oculus and that really blew my mind
those leashes first time you try oculus
right first time I ever tried oculus
rift and I was actually a big fan of it
yeah but I'm gonna say I wasn't my
favorite thing okay everything was all
the pixels and I kind of all look a
little bit on my channel where I was
talking about what to expect mm-hmm
there was a lot of 4k TVs a lot of well
not 4k cameras there was a couple 4k
cameras whew there was plenty of TVs on
display so I'm gonna say the pixels how
many computer build failures have you
had me everything bills has been perfect
I don't which talking about well I can I
can actually say that I don't cuz I okay
I built two pcs okay both of them are
still currently operational okay I've
had problems sure I've had like things
but I'm never like killed a PC like like
maybe I've done something and it didn't
work and I I was eventually able to fix
it so like how many have failed none but
how many of them have had to require
maintenance a few no no not all of them
okay like three maybe and I fixed him
also
don't worry about it they're props how
many red and black gadgets does marques
own does this kind of gadget this shirt
no it doesn't matter
everything okay okay the couple a couple
examples okay
the tripod is the tripod I own is
actually red black and red Oh head on it
is red and black ok Hanon camera on here
well people it's not it's best cinema
logo favorite one time logos made the
revering on the lenses okay I don't know
like yeah just didn't have the headphone
mic yeah the red black 8 th and 50s it
headphones are in black ah the tablet
that I use my iPad Mini it's black and
has
headphones okay I don't have the red
cover on my Nexus 10 but black nexus 10
red cover a lot of red black contrast
going on in my gadget world right now so
it's one product that you saw at CES to
get yourself normally I would say oculus
because that's the thing I'm most
excited about I think if I got like
three anything anything it wouldn't be a
$300 oculus it would probably one of
those like $50,000 4k tvs that are
curved and AMOLED the whole deal what
about you good call I have a video on my
channel of all the cars of CES yeah so
there's a couple Ferraris in there a
couple Lamborghinis and oh I did a video
just on the Tesla Model S and I'm a
particularly big fan of so I could take
anything home technically it was there
something it was technically there and I
say the Tesla Model S was there yeah
take that your G our 4k device is really
necessary I mean for phones and such
okay so 4k I like I'm a fan of pixels
first of all I love a high pixel SD
display but I keep seeing the question
you know when I see a 4k tablet
hmm can my eyes see the difference
between a 1080p tablet and a 4k tablet
and the answer might be no but when you
wanted to know when you're asking if
it's worth it if you have to pay or to
get it right now right now the answer is
usually no yeah yeah I'm on but I think
the fact that it's no now doesn't mean
anything about the future I think it's
going to become worth it and more and
more you'll see much better panels in
the future and I think I would never
have a problem with having a how arcade
tablet or even a 4k phone if it ends up
having a great experience what's a good
budget DSLR to start out with if I want
to produce video similar to you and
mkbhd that's a good question I started
off with the Canon t2i now when someone
says budget there's always gasma what
does that mean what do you mean by
budget oh wait you know I've someone
invested in the Canon lineup and I'm
someone who shoots canons stuff getting
in a huge ecosystem like that the Canon
t5i you know great lightweight
user-friendly DSLR I take it will take
great video actually oh I'd better and
better it's kind of hard to pick a bad
camera right now
yeah from that lineup and I know you
shoot an icon the icig icon probably not
too much longer
I'll actually go with the t3i mostly
because the chief will obviously t5 is a
couple years newer but the t3i still
shoots awesome video it does leave out
lose out on the autofocus as well as the
touchscreen it does have that flip out
screen which is nice for when you're
doing YouTube videos you need to film
yourself but it's also really cheap I
mean I've seen these things for four or
five hundred bucks all that yeah where
is the t5 eyes a little bit more so it
depends on your definition of budget I
think both of those are actually awesome
choices to get yourself started and take
some really nice high quality video sure
whose CES 2014 bag is heavier alright so
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say my bag says
this is me hey this is my bag okay for
the record what is the bag called Maya
is the cata
three in one - two - okay and this here
is the ten bo rody - we both did at
what's in our bag videos so if you want
to verify if I want to go through the
Amazon links and figure out what the
contents of each bag weighs you'll
probably find that my bag had heavier
equipment in it which is probably the
worst honestly because we have a see yes
it's not supposed to go in heavy yeah
you know want to carry around I think
you win this round because your bag was
lighter I win
yeah okay all right Haley if you guys
want to see more of our videos from CES
