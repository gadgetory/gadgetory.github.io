about the cleanest gaming laptop you'll
ever find this video is sponsored by
Lenovo and this is the l√©gion Y 7000 so
if you guys are not familiar Legion is
Lenovo's gaming brand and they're doing
some really interesting stuff first of
all take a look at this laptop you know
what you won't find RGB or roll really
anything that sort of screams gamers
this is a very understated design and I
like it combine that clean white
lighting with the all matte black look
and this is a seriously different gaming
laptop and is also helped by the fact
this is a nice soft touch material as
well performance is definitely a strong
suit with you why 7000 inside you'll
find the core i7 87 58 this is the
latest generation 8th gen processor
which importantly has now a 6 cores but
also a boost clock of up to 4 point 1
gigahertz no sure games are becoming
more more multi-threaded to take
advantage of that 6 core processor where
I really notice the biggest difference
isn't multitasking even when I have a
ton of programs and tabs up maybe I'm
doing something that you installing a
game in the background or trying to
stream it does hold up that i7 is backed
up by a full NVIDIA GTX 1060 with 6 gigs
of RAM so this is a really good
combination for a gaming laptop like
this especially when it comes to playing
at 1080p the 1060 has absolutely no
problems this 1080p panel is pretty
solid it's a full fifteen point six
inches and importantly it does have a
pretty decent brightness of around 300
nits from that IPS display I will say
there are a lot of configurations with
this laptop so my model has 16 gigs of
ram which is backed up by a 128 gig SSD
and a one terabyte hard drive but you
can option this down to eight gigs of
ram if you want you can also go for pure
SSD storage and one of the cool upgrades
is I'd full 144 Hertz panel personally I
would opt for that 144 Hertz display
this actually has enough power to play a
lot of games now a max at 1080p but well
above 60 frames per second we're not
dead yet that's always a great sign
so fortnight is absolutely no problem
for the system we're easily able to play
at 1080p with fully max settings and
we're getting somewhere in the 70 to 80
frames per second range that 144 hertz
panel would absolutely be paying off
right now so you guys see I didn't die
there
seriously play something else wait wait
why not there's one I seen one fortnight
no what do you wanna play oh oh yeah I
just died so I guess we have to flip
black ops now fine
normal fortnight look at the settings
here yo shout-out to one who made this
one Treyarch this is actually really
really nice got global illumination
quality subscript surface scattering wow
let's actually have proper PC port oh
that's a lot of dudes oh wow are you
serious
everyone's dropping right here it was
bad this is really bad listen those
speakers actually sounds really good so
this does have Harman Kardon audio it
has a pair of front firing speakers
which sound pretty good to me
performance seems to be pretty solid so
we are running with pretty much full
maxed out settings at 1080p and right
now I'm getting about 80 frames the
lowest have really seen though is around
the 60 mark where it where is that
coming from
well actually shoot him Wow now this is
not the thinnest gaming laptop around
but it is fairly portable it's only a
little bit over an inch thick and it
weighs about 5 pounds realistically this
is a nice sweet spot between a super
thin and very expensive gaming laptop as
well as something that's much thicker
it's got good thermals but it's also
something that you can actually know say
in your backpack or I don't know can
what do you do with gaming laptops where
do you put them
here's the test
I can easily hold the laptop in one hand
no problem that my friends is the gaming
laptop portability test one of the
interesting design decisions is to
slightly raise the screen in the hinge
to give more room for the thermals
underneath so basically all the hot air
is being exhausted out the back it still
doesn't leave room for most of your
ports the selection is pretty solid so
there is the USBC port which sadly
doesn't support thunderbolt 3 but still
appreciated we do have mini DisplayPort
USB a as well as HDMI and Gigabit
Ethernet and on the left on the right
side of the laptop we have another pair
of USB ports giving you a grand total of
3 that's especially appreciated because
even though it's nice to have a lot of
the ports around back sometimes you know
you want to plug in a flash drive to the
side of the laptop the keyboard is
classic lenovo which is to say it's
about as good as it gets for a laptop
not only do the keys have that nice very
familiar shape but importantly the feel
is pretty much on point and I like for
typing but especially for gaming the
lenovo legion y 7000 is a seriously dope
gaming laptop in only does it have
plenty performance for 1080p gaming and
streaming but importantly not only does
it look nice but it won't break the bank
definitely worth a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
