seriously starting off at number 5 we
have touch ID okay so this one probably
sounds really obvious but hear me out
everyone has what is basically a
completely unique password on each
finger so it only makes sense to use
them right fingerprint scanners have
been around for a while now in laptops
and even an Android phone a couple years
ago the Motorola Atrix 4G what makes all
of this cool again is surprise surprise
Apple so the iPhone 5s has touch ID
which is a fingerprint scanner built
into the home button this is a
surprisingly awesome feature that allows
you to simply tap your thumb against the
button and bam your iPhone is unlocked
now a lot of people have been a little
hesitant that touch ID has been hacked
or that the NSA is collecting their
fingerprints while no security is
foolproof
to actually hack touch ID is actually
pretty hard you'll need a super high res
pictures of some ins fingerprint then
you need to clean it up in Photoshop
print it out on a transparent sheet and
then pour latex to get a passable
imprint way easier than guessing
someone's passcode right on top of that
your fingerprint data is stored securely
on the phone in a way that makes it
basically impossible for anyone to ever
get it's basically a win-win for keeping
your phone secure and still simple to
use all with the power of your thumb at
number four we have Google Fiber okay
I'm just going to throw this one out
there I'm incredibly jealous of
everybody who has Google Fiber it's just
basically the greatest thing ever
average internet speeds in the United
States are 7.4 megabits per second where
fibre comes in at a full 1000 megabits
per second it's 135 times faster I mean
I just really don't know what else I can
say about that except that I want but
what can you exactly do with such fast
internet well you could load every
single one of my nearly 1,000 videos in
Full HD and it would take you nine
minutes and 14 seconds or you could
download one of the best looking PC
games out Crysis 3 engine
a minute and seven seconds want to catch
up on Game of Thrones
you can download the entire third season
at blu-ray quality in 53 seconds I could
keep going but I think you get the idea
Google Fiber is stupid fast
unfortunately not everyone can get fiber
right now it's available in Kansas City
at the moment and they're expanding to
Provo Utah in Austin Texas so while you
and I probably won't have fiber anytime
soon superfast Internet is coming and I
can't wait at number three we have the
oculus rift earlier this year III I got
to try oculus rift this goofy looking
headset right here now basically it's a
screen with a couple of bits of optics
as well as a motion sensor inside and it
is one of the coolest pieces of tech
that I've seen a long time it's a full
3d virtual reality headset and it is the
most immersive way I have ever played a
video game thanks to the head tracking
you can look around in game and actually
see what's going on which is incredibly
awesome the display built into the
oculus is only 1280 by 800 which when
it's right in front of your face is
fairly low resolution however the final
consumer version will be 1080p one of
the coolest things about the rift is how
easily you forget you're wearing it
because you see a different image with
each eye the 3d is totally natural
unlike 3d movies for example and even if
you wear glasses you can just walk
whatever lens you like in and you're
good to go I've been playing with the
rift for a little while now and once the
final version is ready it's going to be
practically a must-have for gaming at
number two we have 3d printing okay so
this is definitely the weirdest sounding
thing on my list I mean come on even
normal 2d printer still suck a 3d
printer will typically use plastic to
print layer after layer of material down
until a full model is complete the cool
thing is that you can buy your own 3d
printer for as little as five hundred
dollars and begin printing your own real
objects while plastic is most common
higher-end printers can also print using
metal for example the Audi RS Q from the
movie I Robot was 3d printed albeit on a
much larger scale so why would you want
a 3d printer well right now it's fairly
limited as far as the size of the
objects that you can print unless of
course you've got yourself a pile of
money
to get a really big expensive 3d printer
however things are improving very
quickly earlier this year the company
defense distributed was able to print
all the parts needed to put together a
3d printed gun while that's probably
illegal
3d printing definitely isn't and as
printers get more and more advanced and
cheaper I can see all kinds of awesome
uses for them soon coming in at number
one is Google glass as far as new tech
goes it's hard to be glass this brings a
lot of what's great about your
smartphone and it puts it on your face
right now Google has released the
Explorer edition of glass which while a
little basic still lets you pull up
useful data like directions with Google
Maps the way it works is that it has a
small translucent crystal display that's
up above your eye so that when you're
not using glass you can totally forget
it's there however when you need to look
something up for example BAM it lights
up and you're good to go
it's also got a built-in camera which is
a surprisingly awesome feature to snap a
picture or video totally hands-free just
like smartphones and tablets have blown
up over the last few years
wearables like glass are definitely the
next big thing Samsung has just released
the Galaxy gear SmartWatch
and the pebble has been out for a little
while however for me nothing quite
matches up to the power of having all
this technology built inside your
glasses I can honestly see a future
version of glass replacing the smart
phone giving Google glass the number one
spot in my top 5 coolest new tech so now
it's your turn what is some of the cool
new tech things that you guys are most
looking forward to definitely be sure to
let me know what you think in the
comments below
anyway I want to thank the sponsor for
this video ting tang is mobile that
makes sense there are no contracts to
sign and you won't be stuck with an
outdated phone for two years
unlike most plans with ting you only pay
for what you use for example if you use
less data this month than last month
your bill will actually go down which is
awesome to see how much you could save
if you switch ting has a savings
calculator for me switching to ting
would save me on average fifty four
dollars a month and that includes things
like tethering which sometimes costs
extra if you want to check ting out and
support the channel go to Austin ting
comm and you'll save $25 on buying a
ting device or get a $25 credit if you
bring your own phone that's Austin
tange calm so go check it out thank you
so much for watching if you enjoyed
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel so you catch lots more videos
like this and you're always kept
up-to-date with the latest and greatest
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
