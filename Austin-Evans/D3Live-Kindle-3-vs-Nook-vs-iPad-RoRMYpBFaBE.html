deep free live so this week we will be
talking ear eaters more specifically the
amazon kindle third generation the
barnes and noble milk as well as the
apple ipad so of course amazon just
released their new kindle go ahead and
start with it now obviously the kindle
is really the one that started out
readers and it is consistently stayed
one of the best if not the best around
with the new it it is a bit thinner it
is also quite a bit cheaper at only a
hundred and thirty nine dollars that's
pretty impressive as you know just a
couple years ago when the kennel came
out it was over four hundred dollars so
that's pretty cool so basically right
now it's going to go ahead and get a
kindle you can pre-order them and they
will be released in a few weeks here you
basically for 139 dollars you will get
the standard kindle which it has a six
inch e-ink display it will be one
hundred thirty nine dollars and you will
get Wi-Fi now if you want to go ahead
and bump it up you can go ahead and get
it with AT&amp;amp;T 3g that's not a bad option
and of course the 3g is free so you can
go ahead and download books from
anywhere personally though I mean unless
you're really you know out and about
traveling everything I think I'd
probably recommend you're sticking with
139 dollar version you know it's quite a
bit cheaper and be honest yeah like I
said guys I mean when you getting into
you know one hundred forty dollars that
is almost just like you just walk by and
go hedge by that it's not it's not a big
deal it's not something you know you
really have to you know get worried
about it whatever like maybe the ipad is
so that I think the kindle is going to
remain a really solid choice and for the
price it's going to be really solid now
of course let's go ahead and move on to
the barnes and noble milk so there are
also two versions of this one is one
hundred fifty dollars with Wi-Fi and
then one is two hundred dollars with
Wi-Fi as well as 3g again i'm not a huge
fan of 3g and e-readers i do like the
idea of you know of course it's free so
you know you're not going to have to pay
a lot for to use the 3g service but then
again i don't know i mean Wi-Fi should
be good enough to load pretty much
anything I mean unless you like to you
know I just can't see you know really
using an e-reader out in the middle of
nowhere to download books I mean it's
not a big deal so you know if you're
buying one or two books a month
hopefully you're going to be in Wi-Fi in
your house
something so I don't think that's a
really big deal worth spending the extra
money that said though guys the milk is
definitely you know a pretty decent step
up from the kindle as far as features
but whether I'm not saying it's better
example exactly but it does have a 3.5
inch color touch screen on the bottom so
i use the note and they are pretty cool
on the problem is though is that he does
run android and usually i literally like
android it's a fantastic platform but
for an e-reader it's just not that great
so the main problem with android running
on the note is that it's pretty slow so
of course an e-ink display if you've
never seen one before they look really
really selling but the main problem is
that you know the refresh time takes a
while so you know you click on a next
page you know to flip a page amount of
book for example and it does take a
couple seconds to go ahead and flip and
that's kind of a problem but of course
it's an aim display you know you kind of
learn to expect that what you don't
expect though is on the LCD screen it
doesn't really is not really any better
it takes a while to scroll or anything
like that so what I like the milk and I
do think it's really cool that when I'm
having with screen as well as you know
you go ahead and look at one screen and
look at the other kind of gives you you
know a really kind of cool thing I don't
think the Nook is really that great i
think that for the price it's probably
not too bad but I'd if you're really
sticking for just a standard ereader I
probably stick with the kindle now that
looks quite and tickles with the wild
card which according to apple ipad so
the ipad is much more expensive than
these starting at five hundred dollars
going all the way up to 830 with the 64
gigabytes with Wi-Fi and 3G amount of go
ahead and just stick with the Wi-Fi
model that's just kind of what I think
you know it's the closest match and if
you gave nor the price difference that
ipad is a really really big step up from
just a standard e-meter so of course the
ipad does come well you rather you can
go ahead and download for free in the
App Store with the iBooks application
now I'm open to the force going to be on
the standard color touchscreen and that
has advantages as well as its
disadvantages so with a full color
screen you can obviously you know look
at pictures it's going to look really
nice and you're not going to have any
issues with frame rates or anything like
that
you just flip the pages kind of just go
just as smooth as you can imagine the
problem is however is in battery life
where is the nook and the kindle you
know you're rated for how many days or
weeks the last night in charge the ipad
is only going to be about a few hours so
even in 10 hours that's pretty good you
know considering a laptop but it gets an
e-meter that's a pretty big knock as far
as you know the kindle you can just
leave on you charge it anyway every week
every two weeks or something like that
that said though guys the ipad does a
lot more than just book reading so of
course you can get on the internet with
Safari you can go ahead and check your
email really you can do so much with the
iPad that being an e-meter is only just
one of the very very many things that
does but of course you would expect that
considering that it is much much more
expensive so really guys it's kind of
hard to say what you should get or what
you should personally if you're just
wanting a standard e-meter you know you
don't really worry about what all the
extra stuff that the ipad does if you
have like an iPhone or some other smart
phones you can do that i'll probably go
ahead and go with the kindle it really
saw it on the neck of the latest version
of it is slimmed it down is trimmed off
a lot of the price and it works even
better now that said if you have a
little bit more money and you're looking
for a device that will do more than just
read books the ipad is probably going to
be the way to go you can go ahead and of
course read books but you can do so much
more that really does warrant the much
more expensive price tag okay so in the
second segment of d3 live i'll be taking
live questions from everyone i'm
currently on the log TV we've got a lot
of people in here some go ahead take
some questions okay where do you get the
Amazon Kindle from that's a good
question so until up until recently the
only place you can get the kindle was
well from amazon however they've
recently go ahead and branched out so if
you go to mini target stores you can go
ahead and buy the kindle there that said
though probably the best bet is to go
ahead and get it from amazon um a lot of
times we'll have deals or special
special incentives for you to get them
there sometimes they'll give you you
know like a free case or something but
go ahead it's not that bad of an idea to
go ahead and take a look at target just
because you next we'll go ahead and get
a hands-on of actual can
because as great as you know a lot of
devices are if you actually can't you
know shows feel them and test them out
for you by obviously might be a bit of
an issue what do you think you really
consider an iPad ebook reader um I don't
I considered that ipad to read ebooks
along with dozens of other things it
does um like I said I don't consider it
to be a strict ebook reader and I doubt
many people buy it just to be to be an
e-book reader however it is something
that does do and it is something that
does do really well so I know it's kind
of its kind of lino one of that gray
area but I do definitely expect that you
know you can do a books on it and it
does work pretty well so so I've had
really a meter and entertainment device
um say printer same answer the ipad does
so much it's really hard you really just
can't say it does one thing or whatever
I mean yeah of course you could say it's
just for web browsing but guess what it
does a million other things you'd say
it's just for apps but it's got a lot of
other things than that so it's really
hard to say the ipad does one thing and
look I'd like the idea the ipad fills a
lot of different niches at one time I
mean you know you could almost use is
like a netbook you can use it as an
ereader you can use it as you know like
a portable DVD player obviously doesn't
play dvds but you can watch movies on it
you know you can use it a giant ipod
there's a lot of really cool things you
can do with the ipad would you
personally read on screen rather than a
book I that's a good question um I'm you
know I'm a pretty big reader I like I
have a whole bunch of books everything
um I've never really had a whole lot of
experience I've never actually owned an
e-reader I've never really you know
spent the time I mean I've read a couple
of books on my ipod touch just for the
fun of it but to be honest I love the
feel of a book I love actually be able
to hold it put your bookmarks everything
I do like the idea of feed readers I do
like the fact that you know you can have
hundreds of books and you know a really
tiny device I mean there's no way you
can actually do that in real life you
know if you had the real paperback books
but that said though I think that
there's you know there's you can you can
do either it's just kind of based on
personal preference personally I mean if
it's not a big deal I'm just in my house
whatever I'd love to go ahead and just
buy the book and just reread it around
but then again if I'm going on a trip or
four
I don't have a lot of room for a lot of
books you know buy a kindle or ipad or
no core whatever it is that's just fine
you think an ipod touch the good device
for reading books with ibooks it's a
good question um i have like i said i've
actually read a couple of books using
the classics application you know just a
few months ago before iOS four came out
i'm using the classics application on
the ipod touch um actually it's not that
bad of course ipod touch has a pretty
small strain and this goes the same for
iphone it has a pretty small screen
however it is usable um personally if
you do really want to read a book I read
for example 20,000 leagues into the sea
it was a very long book and with the
small pages than I thought I believe it
had over a thousand pages the iBooks is
a really good application and as well as
classics and many others and if you know
it is just something you want to do I
didn't really have any troubles with it
you know especially in a dark room you
just turn the brightness down and it
works pretty well um but if you're
really going to be reading a lot of
bolts I don't really recommend an ipod
or iphone I mean it's more for
occasional rating than you actually
reading you know huge boats all the day
all day everything um which key reader
is considered the most durable and which
one is there a one with an unusually
high return rate I don't know about the
return rate as far as durability I would
probably tend to think the ad kindle no
I don't have any you know this is just
based on for what I think the milk is
probably pretty good as well but I just
think with two screens that's just more
stuff to break and the ipad wallets you
know it's a great-looking piece and I'm
sure if you put it in that case whether
it would be pretty well protected we've
all seen a lot of drop tests where it
doesn't take much you know ipod and ipad
to drop off your 30-foot tableland and
you know the screen my brain so I would
just kind of just based on my personal
opinion I would tend to think the kindle
but as long as you're being careful as
long as you're not you know dropping it
or you know as long as you pin the case
whether I think pretty much any ereader
or whether should be okay um I heard it
was a barnes noble look um yeah again
it's kind of hard to say because i
honestly don't know for sure about me
I've never I haven't really researched
it but just based off if you know what
I've seen and what I
had hands-on and stuff the kindle does
seem to be pretty solid is there a beta
for Safari 6 no there's not safari five
actually just came out about a month ago
or so so it probably will be at least
another year so until spar six probably
when the next version of OS 10 comes out
netbooks are books or ebooks whichever
one you get price wasn't an issue price
wasn't an issue I would probably well I
probably get them all but now if I just
have to pick one I'd probably pick the
ipad now the ipad is quite a bit bigger
than the kindle the milk but like i said
like i said before there are so many
things my ipad can do it's a really
solid thing and i really think that you
know a lot of people would be happy with
an ipad i mean like i said the battery
life isn't anywhere near as good and
some people don't like reading the
backlit screen some i some people just
like you to read a normal kindle screen
but i think the ipad if you money was an
option video somebody's gonna give you
one for free i think probably go with
the ipad the iphone design is there
going to be an iphone reason later this
year probably not generally the iphones
just redesigned once a year and while
the iphone 4 we've heard a lot of the
reception issues I don't think apple's
going to you know ribs and I'm antenna
or anything like that I think that
they're going to give away free cases
like they are doing right now and that's
pretty much going to be it hallo guys
