250,000 subscribers so as the thanks to
you guys I decided that I would do a
very heavily requested video so let's
jump right on into it this is my gaming
setup first of all we've got my gaming
pc this is where I do my gaming along
with all of my video editing it's built
in a fractal design define r4 which is
one of my favorite cases right now and
inside I've got a core i7 4770k pulled
by a corsair h100 I I was having some
issues with crashing thanks to a dying
stick of RAM so right now the CPU is at
4 gigahertz with 8 gigabytes of Samsung
memory but I usually use 16 gigs of RAM
and bringing the core i7 up to 4 point 5
gigahertz I've also got a GTX 780 for
the graphics card which is an absolute
beast of a card for both gaming as well
as editing I'm not really a fan of
crossfire SLI so the 780 works great for
me for the power supply I'm using a sea
Sonic 650 watt gold supply which is not
only modular but completely silent most
of the time since I work with a ton of
video I keep Windows 8 in my programs on
a 256 gigabyte Samsung 840 pro SSD and
everything else on a few caviar greens
which I like restoring data as they run
cool and quiet it's a constant work in
progress but it gets the job done for
the monitor I'm using something a little
different a 29 inch AOC ultra wide
display it's sporting a resolution of
2560 by 1080 which makes it nice for
watching widescreen movies and playing
games like with graphics cards I prefer
to have everything on a single monitor
and the aoc works nicely giving me
basically two 1280 by 1080 monitors in
one up top is my webcam which is a
Logitech c920 this is what I use for
live shows along with video chatting and
it's a solid webcam with Full 1080p
recording and autofocus something else I
get asked about a lot on my speakers
these are Harman Kardon sound steaks and
they are awesome
it's a 2.1 system with a nice big
subwoofer and they deliver a nice punchy
sound which is great for music and
gaming they also look really cool and
they are
- huge making it easy to fit the entire
set on my desk for editing or when I
need to keep it down I've got a pair of
audio technica ath m50 headphones these
are absolutely some of the best cans
I've ever used and liked them so much
that this is my second pair to power
them I use the Pheo e 10 USB amp the N
50 s work unpowered but use them with
even a moderate amp like the e 10 and
they come alive with a really nice sound
as far as how I actually game I have a
steelseries 6gv2 mechanical keyboard and
a Logitech performance MX mouse the 6gv2
is a simple no frills keyboard with
cherry black switches which I personally
like and it's built to take some serious
abuse my performance MX is probably not
too far from needing to be replaced but
it's still a great very ergonomic Mouse
with extra buttons for productivity and
it works wirelessly a recent addition to
my gaming setup is the Nvidia shield I
recently reviewed it if you want to
check that out
but it's an awesome portable for playing
emulators Android games and even PC
games thanks to the GTX 780 I've gotten
my computer so that's my set up I don't
want to see what you guys are rocking so

gaming setup and tweet it to me over an
