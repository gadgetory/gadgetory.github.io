I'm going to be continuing along my
series of the different showing you guys
some different features that are new and
3.0 what I'll be showing you guys today
is going to be some improvements to the
mail application some improvements to
the to the iTunes we're showing you guys
how you can download some different
things such as movies and videos etc I'm
also going to really briefly show you
guys the voice memos anyway let's get
this one started
alright guys so let's get this one
started
hey first I'm going to show you guys is
the mail application now if you guys
have seen the may have obviously you
guys I use the mail a lot um rather hit
that basically what the mail you know
the mail is everybody knows all about it
but there's a little bit of an
enhancement and you know this looks like
the normal but when you scroll a little
bit up look there there's a search inbox
and this is kind of tied in to spotlight
search although it's got a pretty big
down set and let me show you what that
is when you go to search your inbox and
of course it says be slow now when you
go to search your inbox it do you see
the top four things the from to subject
all that's all it searches unfortunately
it does not actually search the contents
of your email for whatever reason I have
no idea but like let's say I search oh I
don't know and wow it's being really
slow oh yeah I'm sure I can scroll
through here but you know that's not
showing me that's just show me what the
title is now I mean even if I hit all
it's not gonna make a difference because
all its gonna do is read the from - and
the subject so that's a little bit of a
downside but still it's it's an
improvement and it does help when you're
searching through and also here let me
show you something that's a little
cooler
I actually don't do it cuz it will like
this thing like crazy but let's say I
want to search I don't know let's just
search that the random just typed bunch
of things in okay now you see right
there
okay says continue search on server if I
hit that like I said I won't because my
computer will lag and iPod lag but if I
hit that it will go ahead and go on to
my mail go on to the mail server which
is I'm using Gmail so go on Gmail and
search for whatever I type in there
that's kind of a small thing and again
it's only gonna search through the
subjects and from and to which it's not
perfect but I mean it's helpful and let
me show you guys real quick if you
watched my previous video you will know
that this kind of way it is but if you
search over to go over to the spotlight
search you can get all that the same way
so like let's say soar
Shh you and I hid seat well nice night
wow it's fail it decided not to Wow it's
not searching my mail that is just great
that's right okay come on it's got your
interesting where okay never mind
well it usually works fail okay well
let's go ahead it usually when you go
into spotlight search I'm not sure if
it's just lagging right now cuz I'm
courting or what but usually when you go
into spotlight search you can go ahead
and search through mail that's the way I
usually do it it's not real point in
doing it email but for now I can't
actually show you a demo of this go
ahead and show you voice memos no I'm
just gonna tell you little bit about it
while that background looks terrible
and you tell you a little bit about it
basically what what voice Quarter is is
basically just a voice recorder
now obviously you could buy these from
the App Store and I believe there are a
couple free ones and but basically in
3.0 it would come with it period now I
have not tested this out yet um it comes
with the iPhone 3GS obviously the iPhone
3G the original iPhone in the iPod Touch
second iteration now if you have an
original iPod Touch first generation it
will not come on your 3.0 and the reason
simple the iPod Touch second generation
as well as all the iPhone models it had
an audio in basically the headphones
could double as you could plug in
whatever it is microphone whatever and
it will go ahead and let you record so
you know I haven't tried it I actually
do not have a microphone for it yet but
I just wanted to mean that's just one of
the cooler features or just want to let
you guys see it anyway okay so the last
thing I'm gonna cover today I'm sorry
this is kind of a short video and I know
everybody knows this stuff but had
started it now I wanted to go ahead and
finish out showing you guys some 3.0
stuff
so I'll go ahead and finish it up with
iTunes now there's actually some pretty
substantial improvements to iTunes when
it loads anyway improvements the main
thing really is that you can now
download videos
and a lot of people were like why can't
you download videos
I mean what's you know what's the deal I
mean obviously you could download music
before and then not too long ago they
added you could download podcasts but
you could not download videos so now you
can see that down bottom second tab
click the videos and now you can
download all kinds videos you can
download music videos you getting down
to TV shows and you can also download
movies now um the thing is yeah I will
note that this is for it really doesn't
work over a cell network just like with
iTunes with music it's ten megabytes is
the max that you could download like
let's say if you're on a 3G or whatever
and you can want to try to download
anything from iTunes music videos
podcasts whatever ten megabytes is your
max any more than that I'll just say go
get Wi-Fi so you'll need Wi-Fi but you
can see you have the full you basically
any kind of move you whatever and the
thing is like let's say grant training
let's take a look at that now when you
go into buy one obviously you can take a
look and you can also watch preview I
won't even try that cuz like I said this
thing will glitch like crazy okay anyway
so as I was saying when you download a
movie from iTunes it will go ahead and
download that standard definition
regardless of whether you buy HD or not
and basically the way it works is that
when you hook up your iPod to iTunes it
will tell it basically that you bought
it and they will go ahead and download
the high def if you got it do something
real quick and like I said there's a
preview button right there you can also
rent it just you know just the same
basically the full-featured iTunes video
on your iPod anyway let me just go real
quick the price is the same obviously
it's not like your I've had I've heard
some problems with people trying to
download
downloads bigger like like gig geek and
a half and stuff on your iPod and stuff
over Wi-Fi it can be a little slow
sometimes I don't really I have not
really downloaded anything that big all
downloads just one single episode before
but I had having problem it downloaded
just as fast as you know just about as
fast as on my computer I really didn't
tell a difference yeah so you can go
through
you can go through the TV shows and open
up music videos I mean there's really
nothing that's special it's just kind of
you know something nice and uh one thing
I will see is you see up top the free
you can go ahead and obviously download
the free stuff as well um it's still
kind of hard to find just like in iTunes
there's no gigantic button flashing it
says hey this is the pre stuff I mean
it's just I don't know what they I mean
that would be really cool if they add it
in a more tab but a while I'm speaking
the more tab oh just note a couple of
things real quick iTunes you you can now
do that I'm just going to show you a
quick you can now download iTunes U
videos and everything through your iPod
which is very cool I know a lot of
people like that and also you can do
downloads and just shows that I don't
have any money and then the really cool
thing is a redeemed now before it used
to be is you had a any kind of redeem
such as like a iTunes card or promo
codes you had to get on iTunes and do
all that from now but right now I can
get right on the redeem and get a second
to load but go right on to redeem and
just punch in whatever code whether it
be for a promo code for or you know a
gift card or whatever and apparently
it's not gonna load here but it will
just yet right here and basically use
punching the code and then you know if
you've got the code so this is a really
nice thing why if you don't really have
to go ahead and grab your computer and
all open up iTunes you can do even more
from just right from your device anyway
that's just about it guys I sorry I
Drive drug this little out and also you
guys probably knew all this pretty late
on this I just wanted to cover a little
bit more of the 3.0 I know a lot of
people holding out on it and it's just
something I just go wanted to get you
guys out I know I've been
obviously I'm jailbroken here and I'm
running 3.0 I'm happy with it guys I'm
glad I thought I went ahead and upgraded
you know I've heard some people having
some problems with some of the
jailbroken apps don't work right
everything but in general I'm
impressed with it so you know I mean
yeah I don't actually don't know what
I'm saying anyway guys you know if you
need any help there just toss out here
