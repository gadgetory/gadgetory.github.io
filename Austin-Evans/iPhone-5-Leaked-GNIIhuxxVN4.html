10t unveiled what very well could be the
iPhone 5 as you can see in these shots
here there are several key things about
this iPhone that separates it from the
iPhone 4 so the first of which is
obviously going to be the white color
now there have been white iPhone 4s
before so that's not a big deal however
there are a couple of key things that
make us think that this compare will be
the iPhone five rather than the iPhone 4
so the first thing is the camera if you
take a look at the camera on the back it
is somewhat different from the iPhone 4
same goes for the button layout slight
differences although nothing really all
that big another thing that kind of tips
this off as being an iPhone 5 in fact
that as you can see in the same screen
it actually has 64 gigabytes of storage
moving on to the OS you can see that
there are a couple of key differences
it's the first which is the way
multitasking works so a lot of people
myself included haven't really been all
that thrilled with the Apple
multitasking that comes shipped with iOS
4 however this version looks really
quite nice as you can see here it draws
a lot of inspiration from expose on the
Mac all I need to back up pull up all
the apps you like open them and close
them no problem the other thing is that
the addition of a new folders UI I know
this folders UI looks pretty interesting
I'm not entirely sure that I'm a huge
fan of it I think it's kind of one of
those things we've got to try it or
really make up your mind but it
definitely is very different from iOS 4
and it's not half bad at all
it also looks like there's much deeper
Facebook integration as you can see in
these settings there is a option for
Facebook which is definitely not there
in the previous versions of the OS and
does really work nicely with all the
rumors saying that there will be deeper
Facebook integration in the next version
of iOS now I do want to caution take all
of this with a grain of salt
now this certainly is a legit prototype
you can see a lot of the Apple
various apps that they use for
development so this is definitely a
prototype of some sort however it very
well might be an iPhone 4 prototype
because there are just a couple of small
differences nothing major and we don't
see any larger screen or several other
of the rumors that we've heard so
definitely do take that with a grain of
salt although the site that does have 64
gigabytes of storage is a good sign
same goes for the build now as you can
see in these settings it really briefly
showed it looks like it's going to be
iOS 4 however it might just
for testing purposes but for all we know
the iPhone 5 might launch with some
version of iowa's or anyway I'm very
curious to know what you had to say
about this do you think that this is the
iPhone 5 do you think this may be an
iPhone 4 prototype what do you think
about the changes in the OS all that
kind of stuff be sure to let me know in
