at the dell streak 7 here's the nvidia
booth CES so i've been able to play with
improvements I've got some some opinions
on it looks pretty cool so first of all
show is it's actually quite then so as
we see there I don't have the exact
specs it's pretty can also does happen
of course accelerometer we can go ahead
and rotate the entire thing just a
second and now this does of course run
on the nvidia tegra two chip which is uh
seems to be a theme on a lot of the
phones and tablets here at CBS it's
definitely really quite smooth and
snapping so see what i can do here with
one hand a little difficult but runs
pretty nice and smooth it was able to go
ahead and take a look at some gameplay
which you guys might see in this video
or might another one but one thing i do
want to mention screen is I believe only
800 x 480 resolution so it's not quite
the best however it definitely is really
quite speedy mom she hasn't seen here
you go ahead and pull up a little bit
you take to them look at the tell you I
hear some show you guys you should go
ahead and scroll through pick whatever
you like you know it's a pretty solid
tablet so you guys this is my hands on
the field actually I ought to show you
the back there go you see there's the
camera I think you guys to lose my hands
