today I'm here with the first look on a
really actually surprisingly great
application called Photoshop comm mobile
now everybody knows Photoshop probably
one of if not the absolute best photo
editors for your computer well now
there's a version of it for the iPhone
and iPod Touch and I gotta say I've
messed with it for a little while and it
is really really solid and best of all
it's pretty yeah I there's no reason not
to get this even if you just want mess
with it so I'm gonna go ahead and give
you guys a demo of some of the features
so let's go ahead and first you gotta
open up find the picture um I've already
got one see I put it in here you go
that's just a screenshot from the gal
con labs so now you come into the main
interface you got along the bottom you
have like just to exit and you have undo
and redo and you have save and I will
show you that in a minute let's go ahead
and go through some of things first you
can crop crop rotate flip go ahead and
show you guys crop crops real nice
really smooth that's one thing that
really like if everything is smooth its
I mean there's no you would mean you
think that you know so let's go ahead
and look at that so now you see we've
got cropped and then go ahead and undo
it
next we have rotate works really well I
mean seriously I mean just flick it mean
the iPod I mean that's I just can't
believe how just great it runs just I
mean you know just just flip it it it
doesn't I mean you would think because
these aren't I mean obviously it's not
full Photoshop but it still runs well
let's go ahead and flip it oops quick
flip it so now when you flip it you just
get totally messed up and do every want
go I can get that as we go into the
color so let's go to exposure now
there's not a whole lot of on-screen
controls but it's real simple basically
put your finger there and then you slide
it left and right
so you see here it's kind of good and
that's why did you say that there's also
saturation which I'm not sure how well
the camera picks this up but when you go
ahead and saturate full color which
looks crazy bright and dragged all the
way down and
kill all the color off I'd like that
myself but let's go ahead and go to tint
and then go ahead and just really you
know just go through you see the top bar
here you can go through all the
different colors which looks really
quite nice let's go ahead and open up
black-and-white which obviously you know
black and white but that's what undo
that now let's go ahead and sketch
sketch is really nice features because
this might not be the best one because
obviously you know it's a game but it
still gives you pretty pretty nice deal
before I can get at that though um
soft focus which is kind of kind of like
soften to the image I suppose which
works pretty well you can see here it
again my camera is not great so but it
definitely does really you know make the
image really nice and soft looking and
last week go over here and do pre ones
so let's say new art do the pop so you
see how it did apply a bunch different
filters to it and it for from this one
is like the border you see here there's
a blur which actually it was really nice
yes we scroll through here and she baked
like rainbow let's take a look at this
one you can see here there's a little
bit of waiting time smile that's crazy
let's Quentin that's what I'm use this
one but you see there's a little bit of
waiting time but in general it's really
nice and smooth um and like I said this
is such a solid thing let's go ahead and
actually let's go ahead and I'll show
you guys have a save and upload now you
can just save and exit and it will just
be saved in your pictures or you can
save an upload um this is tied to your
photos show a shot calm account
um it's free it takes ten seconds to set
up and you don't have to use it it's
free regardless of why you want to it
but if you do want to use it you go
ahead and have the option to save and
upload I've already got mine all set up
so you can go ahead there's the picture
you can add description you can select
your album all that stuff for this boy
just go ahead and upload it so it takes
just a moment
and you actually see there's a pane just
for uploading so obviously you can make
really big ones so once it's done it's
going over to the online give it just a
moment to load
open up the library and then
mmm loads and then here it is on my
account
so we each go ahead and close that out
and there it goes so guys that's a
basically a kind of a tour of Photoshop
comm mobile um seriously guys honestly
easily the best photo editing I've used
I mean it's really solid and what really
surprises me is the fact that it's free
which that's that's awesome
and not only that obviously you can its
sync to photoshop comm so you can share
these pictures really easily but also
that it runs really smoothly there's no
hang-ups it doesn't glitch even when
you're doing all kinds of filters and
stuff I mean it takes maybe two or three
seconds sona guys that we just might
look on Photoshop con Mobile on a highly
recommended application it's free I said
guys go ahead check it out and you
definitely will not be disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
