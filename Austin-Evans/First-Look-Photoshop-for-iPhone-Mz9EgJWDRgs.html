today I'm here with the first look on a
really actually surprisingly great
application called Photoshop com mobile
now everybody knows Photoshop probably
one of not the absolute best photo
editors for your computer well now
there's a version of it for the iphone
and ipod touch and I got to say a mess
with it for a little while and it is
really really solid and best of all it's
free yeah I there's no reason not to get
this even if you just want mess with it
so I'm gonna go ahead and give you as a
demo of some of the features so let's go
ahead and first you gotta open up find a
picture I've already got one so you
better put it in here you go that's just
a screenshot from gal con labs so now
you come into the main interface you got
along the bottom you have like just to
exit you have undo and redo and you have
saved and I will show you that in a
minute let's go ahead and go through
some of the things first you can crop
crop rotating flip go ahead and show you
guys crop crop feel nice really smooth
that's one thing not really like this
everything is smooth it's I mean there's
no you would mean you think that you
know so let's go ahead and look at that
so now you see we've got cropped and
then go ahead and undo it next we have
rotate works really well I mean
seriously I mean just flick it i mean
the ipod mean that's why just can't
believe how just great it runs just to
mean you know just just flip it it
doesn't i mean you would think because
these aren't I mean obviously it's not
full Photoshop but it still runs well
let's go ahead and flip it oops quite
flip it so now when you flip it and just
get totally messed up do every want oh I
can get by that as we go into the color
so let's go to exposure now there's not
a whole lot of on-screen controls but
it's real simple basically put your
finger there and then you slide it left
and right so you see here it's kind of
good and that's why did you say that
there's also saturation which I'm not
sure how well the camera picks this up
but then go ahead and saturate full
color which looks crazy bright and drag
it all the way down and
kill all the color off I like that
myself but let's go ahead and go to tent
and go ahead and just really you know
just go through you see the top bar put
my thing here you can go through all the
different colors which looks really
quite nice let's go ahead and black and
white which obviously you know black and
white but that's what undo that now
let's go ahead and sketch sketch is
really nice features because this might
not be the best one because obviously
it's a gain but it still gives you a
pretty pretty nice deal go ahead and get
a tat though um soft focus which just
kind of kind of like softens the image I
suppose which works pretty well you can
see here it again my camera is not great
so but it definitely does really you
know make the image really nice and soft
looking and last week go over here and
dupree ones so let's say new art do the
pop so you see how it did apply to bunch
of different filters to it and it for
from this one is like the border you see
here there's a blur which actually looks
really nice oops let me scroll through
here and you take like rainbow let's
take a look at this one you can see here
there's a little bit of waiting time so
that's crazy let's go ahead and that's
what I can use this one you see there's
a little bit of wedding times but in
general it's really nice and smooth um
and like I said this is such a solid
thing let's go ahead and actually let's
go ahead and show you guys have a save
and upload now you can just save and
exit and it will just be saved in your
pictures or you can save an upload this
is tied to your photoshop calm account
it's free it takes 10 seconds to set up
if you don't have to use it it's free
regardless of what you want to it but if
you do want to use it you go ahead and
have that option to save and upload I've
already got mine all set up so you can
go ahead there's the picture you can add
description you can select your album
all that stuff for this we're just going
to go ahead and upload it so it takes
just a moment you actually see there's a
pain just for uploading so obviously you
can make really big ones so once it's
done go ahead over to the online give it
just a moment to load open up the
library and then
their loads and then here it is on my
account so we just go ahead and close
that out and there it goes um so guys
that's a basically a kind of a tour of
Photoshop com mobile um seriously guys
honestly easily the best photo editing
I've used I mean it's really solid and
what really surprises me is the fact
that it's free which I that's that's
awesome and not only obviously you can
sync to photoshop com so you can share
these pictures really easily but also
that it runs really smoothly there's no
hang-ups it doesn't glitch even when
you're doing all kinds of filters and
stuff I mean it takes maybe two or three
seconds so in other guys that we just
might look on Photoshop com mobile on a
highly recommend application it's free I
said guys go ahead check it out and you
definitely will not be disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
