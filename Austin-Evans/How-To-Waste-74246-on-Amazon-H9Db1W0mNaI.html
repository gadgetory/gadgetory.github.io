did you surprise us with mystery tech is
it already hidden someone what Oh what
is this
Austin what could this mean
Austin Evan this is right thing I I know
exactly what this oh oh I even got a
letter from Susan also can I give a
shout-out to Clarke who in selected the
package with great care
Thank You Clark okay I tell stories
brief little story about why this is on
mystery tech so I hit a million
subscribers four years ago something
like that it's been quite a while but I
never got the option to claim my play
button and so I didn't want to be that
weird person's like hey give me my shiny
trophy so I never asked for it I never
got one but Ken has been determined he's
been single handedly on board with
getting a gold play button and now we
have it I'm glad you're here to share in
this moment I'm pretty sad for you you
can't leave me a million subscribers
that's so big actually you know what yes
that's bigger than Las Vegas that later
than Venice it's bigger than a big
Hoover Oh
this mystery text a little different
because my buddy Jake Rovers here hi
I wasn't ready for this I'm Jake Roper
you might remember me from such things
as vsauce3 your dreams and also your
future stepfather good to see you all
right thanks Ken for finally making me
get the play button hey thanks Ken
thanks hey thanks Ken thanks Ken all
right that's so cool you just have a
projector set up like showing it
constantly going that's what we did for
the Intel thing Oh what are we supposed
to get him to these two blanket together
do you want me under the blanket Ken
I'll get over the blanket what's going
on I'm very confused okay anyone I feel
like we're in Harry Potter Audio is so
much better yeah it's the invisibility
cloak okay and why is this so awkward no
longer got to be under your neck we
please leave yet it's really women
anything
he's such an elaborate episode of
mystery tech I'm gonna get out of here
there's gonna be lipstick all over my
car I'm so weird
don't look at the ground look at my eyes
okay get out ready okay here we go
why well what's it look like
so back in 2012 I did a video with
Samsung on the Galaxy camera okay I have
a way to large white shirt which is
where this comes in
I always blend in with the background
it's an amazing video did you really
need to get in the tire like mannequin
for this also why is he so tall like I
feel I feel so short now what are you
doing to him we could remove a flag for
review you know it's kind of funny that
he has more movement than you usually do
J oh that's nice
I'm glad that you kept the tag on it so
you can return this later whoa Wow okay
we got a little wardrobe
definitely demonetized come on I said
you go to the gym
yeah but he's falling apart like don't
worry I got you ready okay oh where does
it go in I'm just thinking it man just
take it
I need to find the whole bin fine it's
fine isn't it of mine it needs to be a
hole it's okay just write her
okay hold okay where's this hole oh
sorry
wrong
where is he does anyone know where this
goes
let me just grab it there you go there
you go stop Imam Oh perfect that's much
better
okay let me just are you doing okay
that's okay oh there we go huh at least
it figures accurate you know exactly
what I look like
don't worry about it it's fine yeah
that's about accurate okay a minute SD
card inserted yes let's take a let's
take a nice pick all right let's do it
let's do it
wow that's cool shutter sound oh yeah
it's slightly upside down but besides
that you can flip it and post Josh so
what made the Galaxy camera kind of
special was it it is a basically full
point shoot that happens to run Android
position we kind of cool play me like a
modern-day version of this ya know how's
it look though well it's great this is I
don't see the point
really I'm gonna take this I'm sorry
it's very warm the pizzas super
insulating there we go
good imagine an rx100 that ran Android
right they was slightly bigger that had
like more of the phone functionality
built in that could be kind of cool
riddle me this Austin go for it why
would one need a camera that has like a
phone operating system but not the phone
part of it what's this who wears the
night oh oh great oh I'm gonna open it
towards you okay I will step back here
oh it's already open Ken why do you take
everything from me you're the worst
stepson I've ever had looks like some
sort of bicycle thing oh look at that so
it's really you're sitting down you can
pedal on your bicycle the power box so
the idea is this is just like a standing
bicycle but it uses a chair wait what oh
this is very to arrow with littering on
wait huh wait does it charge your phone
generator mood
yes okay okay okay let's do this let's
do this then open the base so unclip and
remove the leg pen so what's the leg pen
also I should let you take off these
glasses put my real ones on this is very
difficult to see so the idea is wise
you're pedaling you can power something
off of the full outlet even though I
guess it depends it says 20 watts for
ten minutes max or 14 watts continuous
so I guess it will overheat if you try
to pedal yes we're gonna have to find
out let's see an explosion well so why
don't they say you have to lubricate
everything with dishwashing soap they
say that multiple times like multiple
things need to be dish washed so this
doesn't wanna just lubricated if you
lubricate it and will go in much more
seamlessly let's see why the bath the
lubrication okay will you get the feet
on though cuz otherwise it's gonna like
it's fine okay we got this all right are
we ready okay okay we need to get this
foot okay it's a little bit in there so
oh okay
there's a solo operation oh yeah don't
work
thank you dish soap okay 76% wait come
on
use those thighs all right are we
charging we're charging how long I got
to do this until I get to 800 okay so
fine my shoes are too big my shoes are
too big there's a snake in my boot who
thinks this is a good idea like are we
living in some Mad Max apocalypse where
all you have is the power of the power
boxed chargers gadgets Jake what if I
was really in the Mad Max world do you
have any ideas on how I can survive yeah
I do there's a video on vsauce3 what max
apocalypse there's explosions there's
war voice there's car flips is there
power marks there's no power box now cuz
just a really dumb idea okay we should
want to watch cheeks video link down the
description smash that like button hit
that notification bell and tell your mom
that you love her cuz she always tells
me about how you know it really hurts
her
I've never gotten sweaty for a mystery
tech before it's cuz you haven't had me
on the show
oh wow that hurts something right here
oh alright this looks play what see and
there's a dual emitter super do a okay
that's I believe that's a spell Oh what
is this mini arcade for Gameboy hold on
a second so I've seen a lot of weird
game accessories I've seen a lot of
Gameboy accessories I've never heard of
this it didn't get a little magnifier
for this high-performance joystick super
stereo sound that sounds like an apple
branding home I'm sewing right now oh do
you need a knife no no no oh wow
okay that's a lot bigger than the Game
Boy I was expecting yeah well if you
want to play Game Boy on levels higher
than you've ever seen you need this I
don't rip the box this thing looks like
retro and probably very expensive how
much was this what that's a lot of money
a hundred and eighty US dollars can
Djimon so for reference the gameboy is
already a very large portable by today's
standards but this this is uh Wow
okay so headphones and it's kind of like
and then that text in there yeah alright
so we put our giant C batteries in Oh
don't answer
oh wow this is I'm on the edge of my
seat so I might not be good at Tetris
this is this is crazy though this is a
little generally one of the most
ridiculous accessories I've ever seen I
didn't know they were meeting like this
I mean look how big it is it's like two
of Jake's heads the resemblance is
uncanny it does look a lot like me dad
thank you what we got Ken oh I think I
know I know exactly what this is cuz I
own one Nicolas Cage yeah that's Nicolas
Cage whatever close enough there you go
it's the gift that keeps on giving the
pillow inside of it I'm so happy so you
know sometimes I like to think that
mystery text we go a little over the
rails we get a little crazy with it but
um this takes it to a whole new level I
blame you Jake I blame you
I wouldn't I I do you know what I would
blame mmm when I was 16 my parents got
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
