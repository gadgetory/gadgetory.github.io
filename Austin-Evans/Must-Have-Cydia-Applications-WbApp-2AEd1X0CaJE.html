today I'm here with another in my series
of must had City application videos with
the rusical application called YB app
now I've had too short for winterboard
app and I'll show you guys a little bit
that in just a second when the board is
a lily I mean just an awesome awesome
application and I mean it's probably one
of the main reasons why most people
jailbreak I know it was a pretty big fat
your memories not want to um you know it
gives you so many useful tweaks it gives
you so many useful things all kinds of
stuff I mean I mean even like like like
cool things like well winterboard I
don't even know what I'm saying here
it's just everybody looks linen board
but there are kind of some flaws and I
just can't show you guys real quick but
without touching anything because you're
touching thing every springs but you can
see here that there's not a whole lot
you can do you basically check something
or uncheck something that's mention a
lot of people don't kind of realize some
things mess up those because you need to
you know move the themes and you're the
highest one works so you know that's not
an ideal kind of but with the addition
of YB app is actually a pretty good it
turns pretty good basically what this
allows you to do is kind of preview on
all use all the stuff in cydia I mean
City outlines in winterboard so that you
can test it now it's not perfect but
it's better than nothing so let's go
ahead and black chrome okay so we'll
click on it it gives us a little preview
so this is basically what the black
chrome background everything looks like
and if we want to flip it and we get
some different things we get like turn
on/off black navigation bars no on top
labels etc etc and force my camera so
it's not to focus but so you know and
you can go through here now some of them
do not work so let's go
let's go to be 17 you can see that works
pretty well but now i open up Flass
Clark you can see because it's nice
because I mean it actually will show you
everything you know it will show you
that icons on it won't be perfect now
it's it but it's pretty handy so you can
also go look at the themes by tight and
you also look at them by date that you
installed them but you know just like
you scroll through them um let's go
ahead and show you guys okay so let's go
ahead and open up blue aura which is my
fame that I haven't update in a while
but so you can see here you see the doc
and see the background but let's go
ahead and now you can see this this is
the new version I've never gotten had to
releasing but so you can go through here
take what if you want so say here I
don't want undocked labels um I do want
dot labels so let's go ahead and install
it I just had okay to respring and give
it just a minute just like your spring
anything else and then just saying you
will see that it's fully respring just
like your wonderful wybie app you know
it's not a necessity most most of my
favorites to the applications aren't but
it's convenient and while those previews
aren't perfect they definitely do go
aways and kind of like showing you
what's about what you're about to see um
it's kind of I mean once you get used to
winterboard you're not gay it's not
going to be surprising that much but
it's definitely a pretty cool thing so
anyway you can see here now that it's a
respring now obviously this does not
look much like blue aura because i do
have boss paper running which in case
you were wondering that's what I've got
in the background but it doesn't look
like that but if i should off bus paper
it would look just like the normal thing
yeah guys that's just about it this is
why be apt that's pretty good app um you
know I like it um you know if you don't
want to get it winterboard spine as is
but it's kind of nice to see a little
bit of customization without having nail
flip through and move them up and down
and check them and all that kind of
stuff you can just go okay I want this
and this and be done anyway guys
just about it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
