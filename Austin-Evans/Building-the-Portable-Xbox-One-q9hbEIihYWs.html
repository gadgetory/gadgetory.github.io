the portable Xbox One S setup.
So ... (sighs)
Hang on a second.
This is not right.
Now this is a little bit more like it.
This is the Xbox One S.
Now you might be asking,
&amp;quot;Why are we using the
One S as opposed to the newer
and more powerful One X?&amp;quot;
First of all, it's going to
be easier to power the One S.
Because it's going to be
a fully portable setup
running on battery, this
guy's gonna last a lot longer.
But the second reason is the screen.
While the One S will
technically output 4K,
pretty much all the games
are going to be running at
1080p or below, which
is where this comes in.
This is the G-Story
display for the Xbox One S.
The idea here is that this
is actually going to mount
onto our Xbox, sort of like a laptop.
And because it's going to be full 1080p,
it actually shouldn't look too bad.
Take a look at the box,
and not only will you see
this monitor, but you'll
also see the PS4 Pro option,
which is very similar
to what we did when we
built the ultimate PS4 Pro.
There's some key upgrades
with this one, though.
Not only does it support
HDR, which we'll see
how good that actually
is, but impressively,
also is going to support AMD's FreeSync.
This is not available on the Xbox One yet.
However, an upcoming patch
will allow FreeSync monitors
to work with the One S
as well as the One X.
Once that's available,
that actually might make a
pretty big difference to actual gameplay.
As you can see, we're
getting an 11.6&amp;quot; display
with a 1080p resolution.
What's kind of cool with this
is, not only does it have
dual HDMI ports, but it's also going to
have the speakers built-in.
Pop open the box, and
the first thing we're
going to see are the accessories.
And here, we have our
actual display itself.
You can see it matches the
Xbox One S pretty well.
I think it's a touch
brighter, but this is also an
Xbox that might be a
little bit dirty right now.
That's actually gonna be pretty close.
The next question is, &amp;quot;How
do I actually mount it?&amp;quot;
Doesn't seem like there's an
obvious way to mount this.
Two clips on the sides later,
we have what looks to be
an Xbox One S laptop.
You can open up the
screen, close it, and it
doesn't look crazy, although
I will say that there's
nothing holding the screen down like this,
so you might wanna be a
little bit careful with
putting this in a bag.
However, that's actually
a fair bit of the way of
getting our Xbox One portable.
However, that is not anywhere near ready.
It's okay.
It's not a real video
until I've drawn blood
or hurt my funny bone.
Next up, we have the iPRIGENT
solar portable battery generator thing.
The idea here is that
this is a pretty powerful
battery bank that you can charge
either via solar or ...
What's gonna be a lot more practical is to
just plug it into the wall.
But importantly for us, it's
going to have a full outlet
so we can power not only our monitor,
but also our Xbox One S.
Or at least, that's what I
hope we'll be able to do.
We haven't tried it yet.
Whether you're climbing in the Himalaya,
living in your village while
you travel in the world,
or camping on the beach,
we will keep you powered.
I feel so safe and powered thanks to
this generator, I guess.
All right.
So it's metal.
It feels like a car battery.
But importantly for us, in
addition to our USB ports,
which actually might come
in handy for the monitor,
but importantly, we do
have that full outlet.
So if we plug it in, in
theory, this should be
capable of delivering enough power to
run everything we need.
You know what?
This actually doesn't look
all that ridiculous right now.
However ...
Actually, no, there's not a however.
We're not gonna go crazy with this one.
We're actually going to make something
that is remotely practical.
For the rest of this setup,
we're going fairly basic.
This is going to be an Xbox
One Design Lab controller,
although obviously, you can use any
Xbox One controller you want.
It's important to have at
least a slightly newer one
with the headphone jack
because we have a headset.
This is the Astro A10.
It's, of course, not going
to be super necessary to
have a headset, but
because this is going to be
a portable setup and we
might not always wanna
actually rely on the speakers
here, it's going to be
nice to have this guy we can
plug into the controller.
So to make this fully
portable, we have the
Peak Design Everyday bag.
This is actually Ken's
Everyday bag, right?
- [Ken] Yeah.
- Oh wait, I just said every day.
(mocking) It's every day ...
No, I almost did it.
I almost did it, but I didn't do it.
You're welcome.
What's nice about this is that it's
going to be fully modular.
In addition to the awesome
little clasps you have
to open up to the top
section, if you want,
you can just unzip the side
and everything in here can be pulled out.
Right now, it's set up as a camera bag,
but if I just rip out these sections,
we should be able to fit the Xbox.
So inside this bag, we
have everything we need
for our portable Xbox setup.
Except the headphones,
which didn't quite fit,
but close enough.
If you're crazy enough like
me and you actually wanna
play your Xbox in the
park, hopefully this is
actually going to work.
Although whether it actually does or not,
that's a little bit of a different story.
The real question I have here
is whether this battery is
actually going to be able
to power not only the Xbox,
but you also have to keep in mind that
we have to power the display.
I can't imagine that
that screen's going to
take up all that much power.
Probably only 10 watts or so.
But we do need a multi-tap
to be able to get
this single outlet on
the actual battery bank
into the two outlets we need for both
the Xbox as well as the display.
Luckily though, it should
just pop in like this,
and (laughs) it's good to go.
The first thing I wanna
do is make sure that
our battery can power the display,
which shouldn't be a problem,
but none of this might work.
We'll see.
If I hit the power button
twice, it should turn on.
Then I hit the power
button here, and okay.
So at least we have the monitor up.
Now let's plug the Xbox in, and (laughs)
I really hope this works.
Otherwise, we're gonna have to redo
this entire part of the video.
All right, plug the Xbox in.
And because we broke our home button,
I'm gonna hit the disc eject button.
But if you give it a
second, it will turn on.
Sweet.
I still need to plug in
the HDMI, but I think
we actually might be okay here.
Okay, so we have our fully
portable Xbox One setup.
This is actually much less ridiculous than
the last one we did.
So the next step is to
get actually online.
Normally, that would be a problem.
If you're playing
something that's offline,
it's no big deal.
However, thanks to the magic of tethering,
we actually should be able to play online.
All right, the console is
connected to the network.
Now the next thing is ...
Actually, I'm curious about the display.
It does show that we support HDR video,
however, it doesn't
support HDR10 for gaming.
So I guess in theory, we could maybe
watch a video or something.
However, the display itself is
actually surprisingly decent.
It is really bright out here, and yet,
while it's a little bit reflective,
I can totally see the screen no problem.
So it's time to put
all of this to the test
with a game of Fortnite on my Xbox
in the middle of a park, even though
the phone version exists.
Oh hey, we're up and running.
Dude, this totally works.
(laughs)
I can't really tell if there's latency.
Obviously we're playing
on LTE, but it feels fine.
Hi, little guy.
You wanna play some Fortnite?
Come here.
Come here, play some Fortnite.
Yeah, want some Fortnite?
I don't have anything for you, sorry.
Don't bite me, please.
The squirrel approves of Fortnite.
I have no idea where I am.
(laughs) Dude, he's totally
just chilling here. (laughs)
Really just does not care.
I'm actually not totally sure how long
this is going to last on battery.
I could tell, but this actually covers up
the battery indicator, so we'll see.
Usually when you're
outside with pretty much
any kind of screen, but
especially something that's
going to be gaming related,
you're usually gonna
have to deal with a lot of glare.
But I'm surprised at how
matte this display is,
as well as just how decent
it is to play outside,
especially the brightness helps.
It's really not that hard to see at all.
I feel like the headset just pushes me
over the edge right now.
I can't really notice any serious latency.
I'm sure it's there.
I haven't really seen a ton
of other people just yet.
But as far as I'm concerned,
I'm playing on Xbox anywhere else.
The idea that I'm fully
untethered running on LTE
doesn't really seem to be an issue,
which is kinda cool, actually.
So if you'd like to build
your own portable Xbox One,
we'll have links to everything
we used to build this
in the description of this video.
And you also might wanna go
check out the original video
where we built a portable PS4.
Anyway guys, thank you
so much for watching
and I will catch you in the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
