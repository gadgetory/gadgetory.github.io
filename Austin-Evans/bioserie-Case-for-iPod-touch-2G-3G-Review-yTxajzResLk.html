the bio Siri case for the ipod touch 2nd
and 3rd generation so obviously if you
call my gel you know that I don't really
like to do case reviews that often um
however last saw this case actually was
really impressed I'm you know it's
actually got some real unique features
that you know it's kind of rare to see
in cases these days is they're pretty
much all the same you know it's just you
may be a little bit better design here
and there but this will actually does
have one major claim to fame so I'm
going to give you guys my full review
okay so taking a look at the case you
the thing you'll immediately notice is
how thin and light it is now well
obviously this is a perfect protection
it does do a very very nice job of
trimming the bulk off of your device I'm
so if you guys can see here it is a very
very thin case and it is really just a
mean insanely light I believe it's only
about 10 grams and I can absolutely
believe it i mean this does not wait
anything now I've definitely found that
to be true you know when i'm carrying it
with my ipod touch you know I really
don't either really I couldn't notice
the difference with the case on compared
to with advocates I'm actually why we're
here as you can see here losing logo
here says made of plants which is
actually true that's one of the big
draws of the bio series case is that
they are made of plants so actually it's
instead of you know like a normal
plastic or a normal rubber case on this
actually made of a different kind of
material it's actually the same kind of
material as you find in itunes card I
believe it's called NGO and don't quote
me on how to say that but um it's the
same kind of plastic obviously it's a
it's a different texture here but it's
very very cool it's actually going to be
a really eco-friendly case and yeah
that's definitely a very nice draw and
of course in my testing really hasn't
made any difference as far as you know
the durability or anything like that so
it's pretty much a win-win now taking
your device in at this case is very
simple I'm all you need to do is go
ahead and if you guys can see here
there's these two little ridges on the
side it'll just pull them apart and you
advice will kind of pop up a little bit
and then I like I do is just slide it
backward and you can get out of the case
and it's just a simple just do it
reverse line it up with the top and just
kind of apply just a little bit of
pressure and it's pretty nice and secure
inside the case so as far as the case
goes as you can see here there's a lot
of crime
home exposed and obviously this is not
going to be the best case for you if
you're looking for the maximum
protection and however it's actually not
too bad as you can see the chrome is
exposed so you know there is going to be
some exposure however one of the really
nice things is that most of these kind
of cases don't have any sort of lay on
the table design so you know if you do
this you know it's going to be laying on
the screen however that is not the case
with the bio series case so as you guys
can see here these little ridges that go
ahead and help you get you know get a
grip also do serve as a lay on the table
design so as you can see here there's
here also up top so you can go ahead and
feel free to let your device face down
without any worries at all the bio
series cases are available in a lot of
different colors and for several
different devices so obviously it is
available for the ipod touch 2nd and 3rd
generation they don't have it for the
fourth generation just yet but i
wouldn't be surprised if they're working
on that in the near future they also do
have it set up for the iphone 3g and the
3gs they have one for the iphone 4 they
have one for the ipod nano 5th
generation and they are about to be
releasing a 1 by Oh Cirie case for the
ipad so that's pretty good they do have
a nice variety so most of you guys would
have one of those devices it also does
come in four colors tons in this lime
green which I really like and it also
does come in white red and black so
overall I was very impressed with the
bio series case now obviously it's not
going to be for everyone so if you
prefer you know a lot of protection for
your device if that's your main focus if
you don't really care so much about the
light weight or anything like that in
the looks you just want really really
good protection this is probably not the
way you're going to want to go however
if you like something that's a lot
thinner it's a lot lighter and I really
was surprised at how well really nice it
was to actually have something that was
a bad light you know it was almost like
not having any case at all but of course
it does give a good amount of protection
you know obviously wouldn't want to drop
this thing but I'm sure it would do a
lot better with the case on them without
a case if you're interested you can go
ahead and purchase one of these at the
bios 3 website and for about thirty-five
dollars and you do get a discount if you
buy more than one so the price it's a
little bit more than I would like but
considering that it is eco-friendly and
fact it's still a pretty good case
overall
I don't have any hesitation to recommend
it if you do like what you see here they
