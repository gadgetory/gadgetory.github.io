videos on great iphone websites we start
with a very promising new website by a
well-known youtuber iphones and ipods
let's take a look at his site iphone
designs com and see what all it offers
I phone designs com brings together a
lot of really great attributes in the
site the front page like most WordPress
sites brings together all the recent
posts which largely focus on the latest
news the site largely focuses on
jailbreaking and does a good job
tutorials on how to jailbreak using
different methods such as black rain or
covered in good detail and the entire
site is done very professionally the
posts are laid out well with minimal
advertising in the way and with some
handy features such as Twitter
functionality which allows you to let
your followers know that you're reading
a post
standard WordPress comments are also
enabled which is always a nice feature
iPhone designs also has a very handy
page that allows you to download any
firmware for any device free directly
from the apple site again this is mostly
oriented to the jailbreaking crowd but
is handy to have such a simple page to
download whatever firmware you need
there is a page that lists a good number
of cydia repositories not all of which
are easily found along with these are
quite a few repost that host practice
city apps next there is a downloads page
which while a bit bare at the moment is
quite handy there are two categories
windows and mac applications right now
all there is are links to download
winscp and black rain in the windows
category but I imagine more is on the
way there are a few more downloads in
the mac category pwnage tool demo God
and saira duck but still the pickings
are bit sparse and it will be nice to
see once it gets filled out next is a
pleasant surprise on an iPhone site a
robust wallpaper section it resides in a
separate sub domain and makes use of a
separate theme and layout in it you can
download a good variety of wallpapers
however the section seems like it needs
a bit of work while on the desktop it
works well the obvious main purpose is
for downloading iphone and ipod touch
wallpapers and there it doesn't work so
well when viewed on an iDevice the nice
looks of the wallpaper section are lost
to the small screen and viewing and
downloading wallpapers can be a bit of a
chore especially considering that the
main site has a fully functional mobile
version that said however it only takes
a few moments to scroll through the
wallpapers and download one out on the
main site the mobile version kicks in
and everything looks and what is
considerably better you can easily read
all the latest posts on the main page or
go into whatever post you like and read
it in a nice format made for your iphone
or ipod touch
while it might not be perfect I phone
designs com does a solid job of bringing
a good mix of news jailbreaking
tutorials helpful downloads and a
promising looking background site
especially considering that the site was
just started I see no reason why it
can't continue to get better and better
and become one of the go-to iPhone
websites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
