from CES 2012 with a hands-on of the O
bunch of TV so if you liked when take it
away sure what you're looking at here is
Ubuntu TV in the event you project over
the past couple of years we've done a
lot to build a user experience through
usability design and testing to create
an experience that's portable across
multiple device form factors what you
see here is a bunch of TV and this
provides a simple precise way to search
through your video content from whatever
source you might have video in whether
that be from home media servers online
services broadcast television etc you
could play these there might be options
from sources to rent them or purchase
the videos and download those they also
play from your bunty one personal cloud
where you can stream live music or or
video from your cloud a very simple
interface to to browse around and move
navigate through the through the video
play and then simple controls in terms
of changing language and subtitle
settings we've made it very simple to
add other applications for example a
guide application which would provide
you information in your local region of
the programming that's available and
this might be this might be coming from
your cable box or broadcast television
you can scroll through here and choose
to play it or to record it for viewing
at a later date and then over on the
left we have other examples of
application icons like YouTube which
would provide of course access to
youtube content and this could be any
any number of content sources whether
they be online or applications we work
with to provide from your DVR and other
devices in the home so this is running
on x86 right now but you do have plans
to get integrated into TVs correct yes
so we're working right now to integrate
this with and bring it to market through
TV manufacturers
and it runs ubuntu this is running on a
bunch of course and it runs a bunch of
runs cross architecture on both arm and
intel x86 platforms so if you could just
sum it up really quickly what separates
this from other smart TV solutions on
the market well it provides an
integrated experience across all of your
device form factors running a bun to all
so it's it's got tight integration with
your bunch of personal cloud and very
relevant to use a person to provide the
information and end the videos that you
want to see and make it easy to search
and use those to Oscar video viewing
experience so when can we expect to see
this you can expect to see this later in
2012 awesome thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
