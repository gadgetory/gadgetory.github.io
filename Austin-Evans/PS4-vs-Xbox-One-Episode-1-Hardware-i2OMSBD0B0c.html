been fighting for console supremacy in
nearly two years into the latest console
cycle how did the Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 stack up to kick things
off let's take a look at the console
hardware and here you'll see a big
difference the ps4 has a smaller
footprint while also being thinner which
is no small feat take a look at the
iFixit teardown and you'll see that the
PlayStation is built more like a laptop
compared to the distinctly desktop like
Xbox one considering the red ring of
death overheating issues to plug the 360
it's not a surprise that Microsoft
played it a bit safe this generation but
there's no getting around that the Xbox
looks more like a VCR than a game
console thankfully you can customize
both with a skin from deep brand which I
have on my consoles it's easy to get the
exact look you want like two-tone carbon
fiber or my personal favorite the 1981
edition ps4 look past the well looks and
the consoles are surprisingly similar up
front you'll find a slot loading blu-ray
drive and power buttons on each and
while they're perfectly usable I do
prefer the bigger touch sensitive
buttons on the Xbox compared to the
smaller less accurate buttons on the
PlayStation you'll find a pair of USB
3.0 ports on the front of the ps4 where
the Xbox has one usb on the side along
with two more around back you'll also
find the power connector HDMI out
optical audio HDMI n dedicated Kinect
port IR blaster and Ethernet jack
compare this to the ps4 and we've got
the same HDMI optical audio ethernet and
proprietary PlayStation camera port but
the Xbox is the clear winner for this
one the extra USB 3.0 is nice the IR
blaster can be helpful for home theater
setups and the HDMI IN allows the Xbox
to control a cable or satellite box it
also comes with dual band Wi-Fi compared
to the single stream 2.4 gigahertz
solution on the ps4 if you live in an
area with a lot of Wi-Fi networks like I
do the Xbox one does a much better job
of pulling in a consistent signal or the
ps4 has so many wireless issues I had to
run an Ethernet cable for it it's not
all good news for the Xbox though while
both come with 500 gigabytes of capacity
the ps4 officially supports swapping
drives you can add a larger hard drive
or go the SSD route to cut down on
loading times what
awesome but at least the Xbox one allows
installing games on a USB Drive which
the ps4 doesn't even though the Xbox is
bigger it also needs a large external
power supply where the PlayStation is
able to make an internal power supply
work making it quite a bit easier to fit
into tighter setups something else to
consider is that these consoles can put
off some serious heat take a look at the
Xbox one and it tops out around 41
degrees Celsius under a full gaming load
which isn't too bad this is mostly
thanks to the top half of the console
venting the hot air move over to the ps4
and you'll see similar temps on top
however most the exhaust happens in the
rear and here we're reaching nearly 60
degrees this isn't dangerous but you'll
want to make sure the ps4 has access to
plenty of cool air put it in a crowded
entertainment console and you could have
issues dealing with all of that heat can
result in a noisy console so next I ran
Grand Theft Auto 5 on both the Xbox and
PlayStation for 10 minutes and measured
how loud they got
while the Xbox one is barely audible the
ps4 gets considerably louder during
gaming this isn't much of an issue but
the Xbox scores a clear win here next I
measured power consumption for each
console at idle while watching YouTube
and playing GTA 5 here the Xbox makes
the clean sweep consuming 30 less watts
at idle and is still significant 16
fewer watts under gaming some of this
gap has to do with the more power-hungry
gddr5 memory inside the ps4 but
Microsoft has done a good job of
optimizing for less demanding use which
is likely to make up most of the
consoles lifespan sony has built a
better looking console and more compact
package with some serious power under
the hood but Microsoft made a lot of
good choices to make a quieter cooler
console with more hardware features
giving it the edge in this one that's
not the whole story though want to know
how the controller stack up how about
the performance stay tuned this console
war is just getting started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
