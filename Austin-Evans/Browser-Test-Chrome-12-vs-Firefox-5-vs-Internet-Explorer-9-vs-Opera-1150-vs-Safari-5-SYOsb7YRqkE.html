of browser tests today taking a look at
chrome 12 Firefox 5 Internet Explorer 9
offer 11.50 in Safari 5 before we begin
let me explain a bit about my testing
procedure all browsers are fully updated
to the latest non-beta release and all
were tested using a fresh install with
no additional options enabled such as
hardware acceleration each test was run
multiple times on the same Windows 7
computer the first test the v8 benchmark
a JavaScript test made by Google this is
a good indicator of overall JavaScript
performance for websites such as Gmail
here you'll see that chrome dominates
the competition with opera and Firefox
following out behind next we have the
Peacekeeper benchmark which is a great
overall test of browser performance and
one of the most influential tests of all
here opera pulls out a narrow lead over
chrome with the rest of the browser's
considerably farther back getting away
from pure speed and into memory testing
each browser was loaded with multiple
tabs open here you'll see Firefox takes
his typical lead with opera and Internet
Explorer a bit behind with html5
becoming a growing part of the online
ecosystem the html5 test measures how
well each browser supports the latest
web standards chrome takes a solid lead
here however all browsers with the
exception of Internet Explorer do a
great job lastly we have the html5
fishbowl this test focuses on how well
each browser taps into the GPU of your
computer meaning native hardware
acceleration is a big factor internet
explorer aces the test with the perfect
60 frames per second and Firefox does a
respectable job while the others fall
flat unlike previous tests there is no
overwhelming winner at this time each
browser with the exception of Safari had
at least one area where it did a great
job however if I had to pick just one it
would be chrome opera impressed me
thoroughly with its performance and
excellent interface Internet Explorer
remains one of the best-looking browsers
I've ever seen in Firefox 5 remains a
great go-to choice however all things
considered today chrome remains the
winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
