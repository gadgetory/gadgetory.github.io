have more than a few cartridges lying
around
now while these are great I prefer them
over CDs and DVDs for a lot of reasons
mostly their durability
however one thing they can definitely go
wrong is that they can get dirty and
worn over time now while obviously these
all have an expiration date you know
they're not gonna last forever you'd be
surprised how many of them that you know
those might have to start having errors
or quit reading actually all they need
is just a simple cleaning any cartridge
is going to have a series of contacts
along the bottom now this pretty much is
the same no matter what console you're
talking about perhaps it Sega Genesis
like here maybe an old Atari a Nintendo
64 there's all kinds but pretty much
across the board you'll find a series of
contacts inside the cartridge the case
now these contacts can get dirty and
worn over time and especially if you're
noticing like your games are getting
slow or you're getting errors that sort
of thing
I'm definitely worth a shot to clean
them out so you know there's a lot of
reasons why they can get dirty typically
you know cartridges are ten fifteen
twenty maybe even over so you can really
simply just coin these out with just a
couple of things so what you're going to
need to do is get yourself a q-tip and
I'm sure everyone has a couple of these
lying around all you need to do is dab
it a little bit of isopropyl alcohol
also you might be able to find it as
rubbing alcohol so what you need to do
is take the q-tip and lightly dab it in
the rubbing alcohol now I say lightly
dab it I mean you know just take maybe
like a capful or something and just
lightly get a little bit of it on there
you don't want to be dripping or
anything like that
so all you do is really simply make sure
you get some light in here is take it
and then just kind of make circular
motions around the context of the
cartridge now don't worry this is not
going to harm it in any way in fact this
is what a lot of the videogame
manufacturers they used to sell
cartridge cleaning kits which pretty
much did this exact same thing
now most cartridges will have contacts
on the front and back so I'll recommend
do them both as you guys can see here
just one pass got all of this dirt off
the cartridge I'm soon as you guys can
see here you can definitely imagine how
this could cause problems with loading
on all kind of stuff typically I like to
run through a couple of times so don't
use that same tip you want to go ahead
and grab the other tip dabble it a
little bit in alcohol and then go and
swipe it a couple more times once you've
completed cleaning out the car
texe of the cartridge what you need to
do is let it set out for a little while
make sure it's fully dry before you
answer it into the console this
typically should not take that long with
the longer you can wait you know make
sure it's kind of shouldn't drive the
better you will be now the cool thing
about this is that it works with
anything with a cartridge including even
Game Boy games so you just use the same
thing although of course the Game Boy
games only have one row of contacts
there's nothing below it but all you do
is just take your q-tip and just run it
along inside the contacts to make sure
that everything is nice and clean there
you guys go you can see there's quite a
bit of dirt and whatnot on that so we
got all that cleaned out and now well
next time we decided to play a little
bit of Mario Kart we should be good to
go
hey guys that's just a quick little tip
showing you if you ever have any
problems with your cartridges how to
clean them up really nice and easy like
I said don't worry about that that
should not cause any harm like that's
the way that they're supposed to be
cleaned just be sure that you don't go
overboard on the alcohol just get a
little bit of rubbing alcohol I don't
use anything else just be sure it's a
little bit of isopropyl or rubbing
alcohol put it on a q-tip and run it
probably twice that's what I like to do
then let them sit out and dry for a
little while
and then you should be good to go and go
back to enjoying your retro games anyway
