here with Tec I like so this is a series
where I go over all kinds of cool and
awesome new tech so it could be gadgets
it could be accessories it could be
gaming PC stuff pretty much anything
that's cool and I like as far as tech
goes I might just do a video on so let's
jump right on in to start with we have
the MMO 7 Gaming Mouse from Mad Catz as
you probably guess from the name this is
a mouse into playing mmo's like world of
warcraft but of course are worse for
pretty much any other game - it's
finished in a glossy red and black which
I definitely like but it does come in
other colors as well you'll find lots of
programmable buttons as well as a pair
of mouse wheels on the body and overall
everything feels nice and tight flip the
mouse over and you'll find a small tool
that you can pull out that lets you
adjust the mouse including the thumb
rest which is a nice touch unscrew the
rubber piece on bottom and you can also
change the feel of the mouse by adding
or removing the small metal weights it's
got a very nice tracking 6400 dpi sensor
as well as a dedicated button that you
can use to change the sensitivity on the
fly this is basically the transformer of
gaming mice there's almost nothing you
can't customize exactly how you want
which is two big thumbs up for me next
is something a little different the blue
lounge mica stand is you've got a lot of
Apple products this fits in perfectly
with the minimalist build that's made
out of actual aluminum it's mostly made
as an iPad stand so you can use it
easily on your desk for example and with
two rubber ends to hold it up it stays
nice and secure even cooler is that you
can fit bigger things like a MacBook
with no sweat especially if you want to
use a monitor and keyboard and make the
laptop get out of the way even though
I'm not really sure why you would want
to you can even fit your smartphone on
the mica if you like overall if you want
a cool-looking stand for your tablet or
laptop this is definitely something to
take a look at now for something a
little louder we have the Eton rugged
ruckus wireless speaker it looks pretty
standard at first glance but there's
actually some cool features in here
first of all it's a Bluetooth speaker
and works fine with most phones and
tablets after a quick pair but if you
take a look at the top it's also got a
solar panel to help recharge the
internal battery it's even slightly
waterproof if you're taking it outside
the audio quality is pretty good it can
pump quite a bit of volume and it's got
a decent amount of bass for a Bluetooth
speaker it can distort a bit with the
latter volumes but
the most part is pretty awesome for
stuff like parties it also has a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack if you don't
want to use bluetooth and it can charge
via microUSB if you're inside one cool
trick is that if you flip the included
charge cable around the Rekha's can use
the solar panel to charge a smartphone
or tablet instead if you're looking for
a pretty sweet wireless speaker check
the records out so that's about it
hopefully you enjoyed and of course if
you want to know any more about anything
that I've talked about in the video I
will have links in the description of
this video I have a question for you

sure to leave your suggestions in the

the Samsung Galaxy s4 if you enjoyed
