with my buddy Dom we're answering your
questions live from VidCon good timing I
like that
what upcoming phone are you guys most
excited for this year obviously a lot of
us are expecting the note 5 that's right
now the obvious choice I think but I
think there's a lot of hype going around
with the 1+2 yeah yeah we're gonna find
out about it next week actually the
keynote or the presentation is next week
and that's gonna be pretty fun too and
of course there's the iPhone success I
think the six was huge I think there's
so much hype around that yeah but I
think the success is also going to be an
interesting upgrade I'm hoping we get
like more RAM and better battery phones
they're coming at you hey Austin are you
ready for Windows 10 we gotta say it's
actually really cool there's a lot of
stuff in there that I like it just seems
to be a little bit nicer set up I think
one of the big things I like on OS 10
you know would like have like multiple
desktops that's a big feature that I
really appreciate a lot of the Metro
stuff a lot of the Start menus and stuff
it's a lot more simple it's much more
made for a desktop versus before it was
kind of a mishmash really wasn't great
on being anything so yeah I'm excited
about Windows 10 in fact I should be
doing a video on Windows 10 before too
much longer who's your favorite
Australian um I'm the best it's me hey
okay fair enough you just and you just
asked the question I asked the question
and then she answered she even comes she
asked the question she answered herself
how did she get in here
Apple music were Spotify and why so I've
been using Spotify for two maybe three
years now and you're an Apple user there
right yeah I came from beats music
actually and I had to migrate to help
with music obviously so what do you like
about Apple music I've tried it I I like
some things like I like beats one but
each one is not something that's really
I consider really fully part of Apple
music since you don't have to actually
pay for it what do you like about Apple
music it really cuts together some some
playlists and some mixes that really do
suit my taste in music so it's pretty
solid in that department I'm playing
around the Apple music but I like
Spotify because it's art on everything
and it seems to be a little bit better
set up right now
iTunes Apple music will be available in
hand that's a big deal I don't want to
be locked into using just an iPhone or
just an Android phone or Windows Phone
or
hacker Chromebook or whatever I like
stuff that works across the board and
it's good at least it's gonna be working
on Android that's yeah that's a good
first step but Spotify still gonna keep
it for me I'm about to decorate how many
rolls of wallpaper will I mean well you
know it's gonna depend on the size of
room that you have so let's say a 10
foot by 10 foot room that's not right
yes sounds I mean normal we're not we're
not ballers over here I mean we have to
be responsible with our budget how many
doors one door one door I really know
that closet yeah buzzer men okay I'm
gonna say two coverage per roll ooh
what does that even mean I don't know
this is difficult fifty square foot okay
actually just hit clear five rolls do
you guys think we'll be seeing a bigger
iPad anytime soon you know for a while
that I didn't think so but it really
does make sense in like the business and
education area yeah it's just having
that larger real estate and and maybe
like split screen apps that's the big
nine I've never looked felt like I can
do real work on an iPad it just feels
limited or feel slow or clunky I'd be
curious to see what a bigger screen
being able to love you know for example
split screen maybe have like some kind
of like Microsoft service like cover or
something that could go a long way in
fact she left would you give up all your
computers and phones for three months if
you got a million dollars in return
yeah or even everyone think about that
ah for three months take him yeah Wow I
think it would be a little harder for a
year I think for a lot of people that
are probably are right but for us who
literally our jobs are YouTube like
that's like saying just take off a year
from your job sure we would have a
million dollars we're talking about
smart phones right know what I'm I'm
smart phones computers everything I
would consider this to be you couldn't
get on YouTube you couldn't you couldn't
do anything related to your job I mean
obviously a million dollars is a lot of
money yeah I could do a lot of other
things but think about this think about
that would do serious damage to your
channel right like how many people are
gonna be left after a year of zero
videos leave dropped off the face of the
earth I think that actually could do
some pretty good damage I three months
definitely yeah one year I maybe two
million how he's doing the VidCon Don
telling about some of the VidCon things
that we've done
we've done the VidCon the VidCon and
then we did some more VidCon more VidCon
