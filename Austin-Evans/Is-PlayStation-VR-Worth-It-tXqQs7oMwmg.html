here with one very important question
his PlayStation VR worth it so you guys
may have caught a video I did a few
months ago where it compared a developer
kit version of psvr against the oculus
rift and HTC vive and I was pretty
impressed in so have some high
expectations here okay so this was like
the fun stuff so we'll weigh one second
on that
and we've got what looks like the
accessories okay first of all we have
PlayStation VR worlds so we get the
London heist scavengers Odyssey ocean
descent VR luge and danger ball on top
of that we also get the PS VR demo disc
so this has a bunch of demos for things
like EU driveclub
rigs a lot of games you're probably
going to want to try anyway next we have
a controller which has actually been
around for a while this is the
PlayStation Move so these were
originally made for the PlayStation 3
and they were essentially Sony's answer
to the Wii Remote from Nintendo now they
were not massively popular a few games
took advantage of them however it looks
like there's going to be a much better
use for them with psvr we also get these
PlayStation camera now it's important to
know that there are actually two
different ps3 our bundles so this is the
full launch bundle which has all the
accessories in addition to PlayStation
VR however some of these things you're
just going to need so for example you
need a PlayStation camera to make psvr
work you don't necessarily have to have
move however a lot of games will require
it so probably something you're going to
want to pick up one way or another so
speaking of the camera this is a
slightly redesigned version now as far
as I know there's no real major
difference between this and the original
camera it's not like if you already have
all those you need to go out and pick
this one up
essentially what this is going to do is
track your actual VR headset so
essentially as you kind of move around
the space the camera will be able to
tell exactly where you are
oh that is cool the little things you
know the little things like oh wait this
is a box this is your Quick Start Guide
you know what Sony I would never
normally read something like this but
you went to the extra trouble let's see
what's inside your Quick Start Guide
oh yeah it's a quick start guide
different okay so another instruction
manual and this is the actual breakout
box so what looks actually like sort of
a mini ps4 so this is the processor unit
so everything is still going on on the
ps4 itself however this is going to give
you a couple extra features so it kind
of enhances the audio for full 360 VR
effect and it also gives you an HDMI out
to your TV so for example if you're
playing a VR game and your friend wants
to watch you can still see what's going
on on the TV through this box and we
have a headset so psvr doesn't actually
have built-in headphones like oculus so
you can plug in pretty much anything
this is a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so if you'd like you can
use these low profile options or bring
your own cans alright it's time for the
fun stuff
so what Oh No site not fun stuff more
cables the future I thought the feature
is Wireless this is not Wireless we have
wow that's light the psvr headset itself
wow that is super late and even though
it looks big and bulky it's really
lightweight this actually seems like
something that I could be wearing for
quite a while without getting
uncomfortable whoa look I'm in the
future the videos really dark so with
this kind of rubber on the sides it
really kind of helps to block light out
and even though I wear glasses I feel
like this is totally comfortable yeah
the real world I didn't sign up for this
I don't go back to psvr
haha oh you know what this is the V
arguing on play your the exhilaration of
an illegal street race an illegal luge
all right let's do this here's something
interesting I didn't need to adjust the
screen at all for my glasses I literally
put it on and immediately was nice and
sharp there's a little button on the
bottom where you can pull it in and out
to kind of adjust it but super simple
setup alright immediately not digging
the motion here ah this is like motion
sickness 101 X and sore more of the
static sort of things the screen
resolution is not bad here everything is
very blurry it's cool I can get the idea
but it's uh yeah it's noticeably less
sharp than something
like the Viper oculus let's do the
London heist that sounds like fun
one thing let's say about using the Move
controllers it's pretty obvious that
they really weren't designed for VR
because while you have your X and square
and all your normal PlayStation buttons
without being able to look at them it's
a little unclear as far as which one
you're actually pressing the actual
presence is not bad it seems like it's
able to track in 3d space reasonably
well it's not anywhere near as accurate
as something like the v controller but
this seems fine like this is easy ok
shake hands oh of course I would Sony
wait that's actually a Sony can i light
the money on fire I lit the money on
fire ah open this up this oh ok oh wow
I should probably got my gun hahaha this
is cool so I am noticing a few limits to
the tracking so they try to lean too far
out of the PlayStation camera can't see
me or like I actually hit like that well
you know the actual couch I'm sitting on
oh I got him
alright next let's try driveclub PR so
this is one place where I can see the
ps4 is a little less powerful Allah is
powerful in a gaming computer so for
example when I look at the BMW I can see
a lot of aliasing with the sharp edges
cuz I see a lot of detail in here I've
gotta say this uh looks like I'm sitting
in an actual car you know I've been
playing for about 45 minutes or so right
now and PS we are still staying very
very comfortable so my face is sweaty
everything feels nice and smooth oh I'm
on the wrong side the reddish Oh Berto
what hahaha that's cool let's do it
alright
this is solid I gotta say I am NOT
displaying right now so Eve Valkyrie is
an interesting game because it's also
available on the oculus so it's a really
easy comparison to make I mean there are
definitely some differences I think the
lower resolution screen on the PSP R is
a bit noticeable arm graphics wise it's
hard I mean a good experience is sort of
seamless you really don't think about it
you really get immersed in the game and
I think the PSP R is absolutely up to
the point where it can totally do that
framerate is dead solid like out of all
the games I've tried today I have not
seen one drop frame nothing torn nothing
it's been a very very smooth experience
Valkyrie is not the my first choice of a
game - hahaha
try it in virtual reality but it really
kind of gives you an idea of the scale
and the scope of what you can do here
get it get it
while PlayStation VR is less expensive
than something like vive or oculus it's
also still $500 and that's still not
even including the price of a ps4 now
something like the ps4 pro might make a
bigger difference to quality however the
main thing you need to keep in mind is
that VR is still very new there's a lot
of potential here however it's still
very much an early adopter thing if you
really want to try VR this is a great
way to go however it's not a must-have
so I only had time to play a few games
today however if you want a full rundown
of the best of the best games for
PlayStation VR definitely check out my
buddy Kevin Kenton who did a full
rundown of all the latest and I'm
curious what do you guys think about
PlayStation VR let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
