Black Friday time and this video is
sponsored by the WD blue SSDs we're
about to have some fun so if you're
looking to get your hands on some tech
this is pretty much the best time of
year to do it so there are a ton of
deals on game consoles phones laptops
TVs you name it and while most of these
are going to be only on Black Friday
itself some of them are actually going
to be live right now and of course all
the links to what I'm going to be
talking about will be in the description
while the Xbox one X might be the shiny
new toy of 2017 there are some really
good deals on the standard Xbox 1s so
you can pick this guy up from Amazon for
$200 for the 500 gigabyte console and
then includes a free copy of battlefield
one and if your about that coals life
you can pick up u1s for one-hundred and
ninety dollars with $45 a bonus Kohl's
cash you know if you want to buy your
mom's and around $200 the Xbox one test
makes a lot of sense for most people so
it plays all the same games as the Xbox
one X however it just does it in 1080p
but you can still do 4k streaming with
video and Ultra HD blu-ray zon this guy
for like less than $200 you don't have
an Xbox one yet now is the time to pick
one up but if you are on the PlayStation
side of the fence you can get some
pretty good deals on the ps4 slim this
is also going to be on Amazon for $200
Tovah it's going to be the one terabyte
version now if you want to visit our
good buddies over at Kohl's they have
that same 200 all a deal for the ps4 but
with a whopping $60 of Kohl's cash so
you can that's a gift for your mom now
if you do want to get on that 4k life
there are some deals for the ps4 pro so
this guy is going to be available for
$50 off at Gamestop so 300 bucks this is
not a bad deal over the best deals on
consoles this year are definitely on the
standard Xbox and ps4 if you do have a
ps4 you may want to consider updating it
with a brand new WD blue SSD who are the
wonderful sponsors of this Black Friday
video the WD blue SSDs start at $90 for
a 250 gig Drive on Amazon and even if
you want to jump up to the 500 gig
version it's only going to cost you 150
upgrading is really easy you can pick
this up and either a standard two and a
half inch form factor or the smaller m2
if you have a newer computer
you really want to go crazy you can put
a WD blue inside your ps4 so swapping
out the old hard drive for superfast SSD
will make a big difference to stuff like
game load times they're rated for up to
400 terabytes of rights as well as 1.75
million hours of time between failure on
the one terabyte model that's a lot of
specs well as these have always been
fast for a long time they were either
too expensive or just didn't come in a
big enough capacity to really make sense
however when you consider that you're
getting a 500 gigabyte drive for about a
hundred and fifty dollars it makes a lot
more sense so if you want to check this
guy out
like what everything I'm talking about
in this video the link will be in the
description continuing on with game
console deals this one is actually kind
of crazy so Game Stop is offering the
original white Xbox 360 for free and
yeah I mean that it's actually free it's
normally $60 however you get a $60
mail-in rebate so if you don't mind
spending a little bit of time going for
the rebate you can pretty much get an
Xbox 360 for free continuing with the
game stop trains they have a Zelda 2 DS
for $80 now while the price isn't all
that special what is is the actual
hardware itself this is a super limited
edition green color and it comes with
Ocarina of Time 3d pre-installed and
when I say super limited I mean it
they're probably going to have a few of
these per store however it should also
be available at places like Target and
Walmart if you want to pick up this
green one Black Friday is the day to
find it they will be gone really quick
oh hi I didn't see you there I was just
enjoying a wonderful virtual world with
the brand-new PlayStation VR that came
out last year that I already did a video
on what's cool about this guy is that
you can pick up the headset you can get
the camera that you need to actually
have it work and a copy of Gran Turismo
sport for $300 on Amazon so if you want
to join the super cool virtual world
with me links in the description moving
on to laptops Best Buy has a really good
deal on the Lenovo IdeaPad 120 s at $100
so I did a video on this guy about a
year ago this is the slightly older one
10 s model but $150 I was really
impressed considering is you can get
this guy for $100 though it's hard to
argue with a cheap laptop like this if
you're looking for something a little
bit more high-end Dell has their new XPS
13 available on the Dell store for a
thousand
so we also just did a video on this guy
and I liked it a lot
no do you have that 8th gen core i7
processor but you have a great build and
honestly at 30 andr dollars it's not a
bad deal but at a thousand if you're
looking for a higher-end laptop it is
definitely worth a look and if you're in
the market for a new smartphone best
spot has some good deals on the Galaxy
s8 as well as the note 8 so the Galaxy
s8 is going to run you 636 dollars with
activation but if you want these
standard Galaxy s8 it's only going to
cost you four hundred and twenty dollars
on Black Friday it wouldn't be a good
Black Friday deal without a good old
Stampede which is where Best Buy comes
in with the 50-inch sharp 4k TV they
have for one hundred and eighty dollars
this might be the best Black Friday deal
I've seen this year over and true good
old stomping trampling fighting fashion
you want to get this guy unlike pretty
much everything else here it is only
available in-store so on amazon.com you
can pick up the standard Kendall for $50
you can also get these Fire HD 10 for
$100 and if you want to go over to Best
Buy they have the HD 7 available for $30
so if you've ever wanted a 3000 tablet
that isn't terrible in your life that's
the one to pick up I've actually been
really surprised with how much I like
the Google home mini having Google
assistant in your house for 50 dollars
is not bad however on Black Friday on
walmart.com this guy is going to be
available for $29 but if you use Google
Express Checkout you're going to get a
$25 one more gift card meaning that for
$4 these guys are going to go fast so
links to check out all this stuff will
be in the description and let me know
what is the best Black Friday deal that
you guys have seen this year let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
