of the Nintendo 64 the Nintendo 64 was a
really big console back in the day as it
was Nintendo's first real major step up
from the Super Nintendo
now forth back in these days you know
everyone was still on their super
Nintendos or even your sega genesis so
to make the leap into full 3d gaming was
definitely really pretty impressive and
Nintendo definitely did it right with
the Nintendo 64 however it was not by
any means the first out to market of
course there were quite a few of his
competitors to beat it such as the 3do
the PlayStation 1 Sega Saturn among
several others however Nintendo while it
was a bit later definitely came to end
really packed a punch with the Nintendo
64 so let's go ahead just take a look at
what all I had to offer so let's go
ahead and take a tour around the console
so up front we do have 4 controller
boards and the Nintendo 64 was actually
somewhat unique in the fact that it was
one of the first consoles to actually
support for player gaming actually
wasn't the first but really after the
Nintendo 64 did it
you know everyone started doing it
indeed these days it pretty much all of
the main consoles do support at least
four players well you can't really see
it there is a light here that indicates
when is on you have a so a nice sort of
Nintendo 64 on the top so flipping
around to the side you don't really see
a whole lot and around the back there is
even less so actually I don't have it
right here but there is this is where
the power supply goes and it's a sort of
an internal external power supply
basically this entire thing is filled up
once you plug this power supply in so
not a big deal technically it's an
external but since it's all inside the
console you really don't have to worry
about you know I'm tripping over or
anything like that and over here you do
have the audio and video out and there's
not a whole lot on this side either and
if we go ahead and flip it up top here
of course it's gonna be a little hard to
see since this is of course translucent
orange my pin the other coolest colors
ever so you do have the on/off switch to
go and turn on and off obviously you
have a reset button and right under here
you do have a spot for the expansion
pack now the expansion pack from the
Nintendo 64 basically gave it more RAM
now it didn't come
it was it didn't come with all Nintendo
64's but if you did but go ahead and buy
it you would be able to play some games
some games looked better and some gays
games actually required it so it was
definitely kind of interesting there
let's lug this on here up here we do
have the cartridge slot and that was
something else where the Nintendo 64
kind of differed from its competitors
and the fact that it actually went ahead
and used cartridges rather than the
discs like CDs for example of pretty
much everything else now this was both a
help and a hinderence to the Nintendo 64
on one hand it did helped with load
times cartridges look really quite quite
a bit faster than their CD based
counterparts however cartridges are very
very expensive compared to a CD which
costs next to nothing to produce now
overall though the Nintendo 64 was a
definitely a very good looking console
it was very very you know compact
compared to you know a lot of the
consul's of today and one of my favorite
parts of the Nintendo 64 is this this
just the color
now it did come in quite a few different
colors including black and quite a few
others sort of standard ones however it
also did come in some more of us
somewhat kind of crazy colors which is
like the one I had here we just
translucent orange now just imagine if
they sold an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3
or a Wii in translucent orange today do
you ask how many people would buy it now
let's go ahead and take a look at the
Nintendo 64 controller uh some guys this
was a UH this was unique controller I've
got to say that it was unique controller
so as you can see here it's a very very
large controller indeed they actually
had this kind of a like a spaceship
looking design with you know three
handles instead of two I mean it worked
pretty decently so you do have a d-pad
all your standard directional buttons a
and B start I mean you do have a kind of
a unique sort of joystick or control
stick or whatever you wanna call it did
work pretty well however Nintendo 64
definitely was not one of my favorite
controllers while I did have quite a few
buttons even has LNR and if we're going
to flip it over here you even had a I
guess a little button here for shooting
like if you're flying
playing shoot back there all right but
there are quite a few different layouts
for the Nintendo 64 controller well I
wasn't a big fan of it as most of them
well you really couldn't grab everything
on you couldn't use all buttons on the
screen at once that's what I mean by
that is you're holding it like this you
do these but you really can't I mean
it's kind of a stretch to reach your
thumb all the way over there I have
about average sized hands especially if
you had even smaller hinge definitely
would be able to reach it
and on the other hand if you want to go
ahead and you know hold it like this and
do like that you know hit that button on
the back move this then yeah then you
kind of gotten to the thing where your
hands are a little too close together
and you're having to tilt the controller
so it was definitely a unique controller
and it even did have my I'm just flip us
over here
I'm even it had some expansion so as you
can see here there's a little slot right
here where you go ahead and plug in some
different things another quite a few
different ways that you can do this for
example there's a rumble pack as well as
a couple others have what I have here is
an expansion pack so let's go ahead a
transfer pack on so the way this work
just snap right on you go ahead and
slide in several gameboy games and yeah
I should go ahead and have the gameboy
games play on a Nintendo 64 you could
transfer stuff so it's definitely a kind
of a unique feature however overall not
the biggest fan of the Nintendo 64
controller it was just just a little bit
too far out there and try and they just
try a few too many things for my liking
and not all that really paid off okay so
that's it for my review of the Nintendo
64 personally I really never was too
into the Nintendo 64 one is brand-new
I've pretty much spent all my time and
all my money buying games the original
PlayStation 1 however that should say
nothing against the Nintendo 64 it was
and remains to be a really fantastic
console indeed if you take a look it's
two of the best games of all time in my
opinion Goldeneye double-oh-seven
and Ocarina of Time both were Nintendo
64 exclusives so that should definitely
give you kind of an idea of you know
what power and what what a great console
the Nintendo 64 was so many of you guys
if you're interested in buying a
Nintendo 64 I definitely recommend it
they are very very plentiful these days
indeed just the same way that the
original PlayStation and quite a few
other older consoles are these costs
next to nothing these days and they're
really fantastic consoles now if you're
not really in the market to go ahead and
buy yourself a Nintendo 64 or for
whatever reason you're not really not
interested you should know that you
can't actually play Nintendo 64 games on
the Wii
now obviously good luck trying to have
you slot slot an int o 60 port cartridge
into it but you guys should go ahead and
download it in the Virtual Console
section so a lot of the fantastic you
know some of the best games of all time
for the Nintendo 64 are available so you
can't go ahead and play them on the Wii
today so either way you do it I
definitely recommend Nintendo 64 is a
great console and had a lot of just
fantastic groundbreaking games so you
know you guys I hope you enjoyed the
review thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
