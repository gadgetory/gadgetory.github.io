thank you you can't take my line that's
my line
hey guys this is Austin I just do you
may remembered a few other videos we've
done together and back by popular demand
is my dad today you watch a lot of video
on your phone yeah sure dude surely I
can seriously a video so you watch a lot
of video on your phone so you watch a
lot of video on your phone right sorry
what do you think right now I am using
the original Google pixel right yeah
wish to be there dad has great taste and
smart phones but this one's uh it's it's
and still pretty good shape huh the only
thing is it's still a not huge display
know you'll have a laptop or a tablet or
anything like that right now so that is
where this comes in this is the Dell
Inspiron 5000 so we've been doing a lot
of stuff with Intel who are awesome
enough to sponsor this video by the way
and one of the things I really thought
would be cool and they really like the
idea is it hook you up with a little bit
of a travel set up that you can Alli
take around and watch video on actually
a little bit of work done so there's a
lot that you can do with the computer so
the main thing obviously is probably
going to be video but you can't do some
gaming on it it doesn't have like a
dedicate graphics card that's super
hardcore QDC
but actually one of the things I think
you might appreciate is does unlike a
lot of laptops today have a full DVD
drive now I haven't used an optical
drive in a computer in a long time but I
think this actually is a good example of
why you would actually find it really
useful because you can put in CDs and
DVDs basically everything with just this
one laptop so I can get rid of this no
you can't get rid of your phone do you
want to carry this around in your pocket
or thing I don't think so what you'll
find that there is the 8th gen core i7
it's going to give you more about
performance for anything you want to do
especially when it comes to say
transcoding like video or whatever you
know transcoding video is sorry that's
very local yeah you ever transcoded a
video dead no on purpose when you have a
hard drive you've got a lot of capacity
right so you can load this up with tons
of video and everything like that but
the thing is hard drives just aren't
that fast so octane memory is in
addition to the hard drive
it will speed things up like you know
when you turn on the computer and get
like windows going or like you want to
open up your web browser or whatever the
cases like that
I'll team memory just speeds everything
which is good it's definitely a good
thing because if you're running on a
normal hard drive it just takes a while
right you don't wait three minutes for
your computer to turn on who's got three
minutes give it a try you new laptop I
feel like I'm just like selling you on
why it's cool all right the key function
the key function is excellent in the can
for no I don't think so most laptops
don't have my chemical keys but it still
feels pretty good right like if you're
actually properly used like a normal
like laptop keyboard I know you used to
like ease like typewriters how forty
years ago but yeah anything there's only
two kids there were two boys in the
typing class yeah and we all had to use
manual keys they only had two manual
typewriters all the girls got a letter
are you complaining that like your
typewriter was too old for it everybody
said well can't you agree that this is
much nicer oh yeah so lots of itself
it's great this is definitely the main
part of your setup but we wanted to get
you hooked up with just a little bit
more so first of all Ken found this it's
cool right yeah so the idea here is that
this will be able to carry now the other
accessories we have for you but also the
laptop so the next thing we've got for
you is the Logitech MX anywhere 2 I'll
let you do the unboxing of this one
instructions we don't really those I
mean that's actually pretty much on
point no you know where he gets them now
haha there's also a carrying case for
your mouse so this is Ken's favorite
pair of headphones these sony 1000 x
mark threes so do much ever actually
listen to headphones oh yeah do you know
when we're moms around
wow wow wow ok
[Laughter]
okay but once I get charged how long is
this good for it's actually good for
actually it says on the box think it's
like 20 hours or something
we're 30 hours it's good for 30 hours we
would be much more helpful you didn't
throw the Box across the room but yeah
30 hours be nice to be in the district
before all right so really I feel good
what'd you say yo you came you know I
listen to your music
pretty solid watch listen to mine this
guy's name is logic okay murder him
oh that's a good start right normally I
don't like rap uh-huh that's don't like
rap so that's pretty much everything you
need for your main setup but one other
thing we want to throw in is something
I've been using a lot lately is this
it's the Anker PowerPort fusion what it
does if I pop it out here it looks just
like a normal power adapter right you've
got two USB ports but the cool thing is
this is also a battery bank right
definitely this yeah it's really really
good I love and then you got a little
carrying case for this cheerful song
it's the king pouch we're gonna call
this a soft why is that a sock it's nice
like a song what kind of speaking that
movie once so I've done a lot of talking
in this video right do you want to take
over do you want walk through your new
setup not really okay okay thank you
they spent a lot of money home all this
really nice tan leather right huh why
did they use nylon straps $400 I think
this should be leather can they ripped
you off baby no you in here we go here's
to the new Dale and it opens up seeing
how to use the see angle it's Kate I
need two of these I need two of these
okay we're both going somewhere huh
washing back to the future huh I got my
own you need a pair look at this dad
lookin out for me right now yeah Ken
Lane should give me another pair of
headphones
yeah yeah
and damn dad thank you for coming on the
video thanks for being on the channel
don't wait too long if you guys want to
check out dad sorry you can't cuz he
doesn't internet very well but he's got
a laptop so yeah maybe like a channel on
this thing yeah wait you could make a
youtube channel on this laptop right no
really you're like a webcam you can edit
video there's a lot of comments saying I
oughta start my own YouTube competition
whoa wait what what sure
we need a competition what are you
trying to steal my job right now no no
no no hey guys this puppy Evans not
stealing your stuff no way you stole
mine that's my thing as I say that I'll
pay more better hours to this video took
a dramatic turn very quickly hopefully
you enjoyed the dad set up I guess he's
got a channel soon I guess everyone's
leaving me so you should probably just
go check that out
one job Seeley big thanks to Intel for
sponsoring this video
in making this whole madness happen with
the awesome dell inspiron 5000 now if
you'll excuse us I guess I'm gonna start
working for dad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
