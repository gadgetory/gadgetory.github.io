from CES 2012 i'm here with canon and
chucks we like it and give us a demo
here oh thank you very much we're here
at Consumer Electronics Show 2012
demonstrating the new flagship power
shot g1x this is our top-of-the-line
compact digital camera and it is a very
very unique camera in our lineup because
it's the first power shot that has a 1.5
inch image sensor this is about six
times larger than the sensor that's in
the predecessor model the g12 and with
that extra size we're getting a lot
nicer image quality in terms of low
noise and also high sensitivity so we've
gone up from a high-end iso 3200 of the
g12 up to 12,800 here on the g 1x that
extends the range of shooting conditions
where you can get great images it also
basically gives us lr style image
quality we also have in this camera a
digit 5 processor which is our latest
and greatest image processor and that
helps to clean up the image quality for
both the JPEGs and the movies makes the
camera run a lot faster as well as you
see it has a fold-out 3-inch finder that
has the same degree of resolution on the
LCD as our 5d mark two which is our good
professional quality SLR so you're not
sacrificing anything at all in terms of
overall quality on the design of the
camera you also have a four times
optical zoom here 28 to 100 12
millimeter equivalent f28 to 5.3 now
that is a great great combination lens
for this camera because with that large
image sensor size we're able to keep the
overall size of the camera nice and
small but we have a good powerful lens
so it's a 14 megapixel CMOS the actual
measurement of the chip is 14 x 18 point
seven millimeter i mentioned up to iso
12800 it also has full manual control
full automatic raw files HDR and i want
to talk a little bit about the movie
mode on this game because it's also kind
of special of course we've got full HD
1080p but in addition to that this
camera unlike the eos models that we're
currently offering has optical zooming
power optical zooming and autofocus
continuously while you shoot so it's
really a very powerful camera for video
as well as still photography
it's going to be available in February
at a retail price of 799</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
