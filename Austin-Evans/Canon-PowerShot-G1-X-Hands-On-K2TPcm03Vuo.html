from CES 2012
I'm here with Cannon and chucks we like
it and give us a demo here oh thank you
very much yeah we're here at Consumer
Electronics Show 2012 demonstrating the
new flagship Power Shot g1x this is our
top-of-the-line compact digital camera
and it is a very very unique camera in
our lineup because it's the first power
shot that has a 1.5 inch image sensor
this is about six times larger than the
sensor that's in the predecessor model
the G 12 and with that extra size we're
getting a lot nicer image quality in
terms of low noise and also high
sensitivity so we've gone up from a
high-end ISO 3200 on the G 12 up to
12,000 800 here on the G 1 X and that
extends the range of shooting conditions
where you can get great images it also
basically gives us lr style image
quality we also have in this camera a
digit 5 processor which is our latest
and greatest image processor and that
helps to clean up the image quality for
both the JPEGs and the movies makes the
camera run a lot faster as well
as you see it has a fold out 3-inch
finder that has the same degree of
resolution on the LCD as our 5d mark ii
which is our good professional quality
SLR so you're not sacrificing anything
at all in terms of overall quality on
the design of the camera you also have a
4 x optical zoom here 28 - 112
millimeter equivalent f28 - 5.3 now that
is a great great combination lens for
this camera because with that large
image sensor size we're able to keep the
overall size of the camera nice and
small but we have a good powerful lens
so it's a 14 megapixel CMOS the actual
measurement into the chip is fourteen by
eighteen point seven millimeter I
mentioned up to ISO 12800 it also has
full manual control full automatic RAW
files HDR and I want to talk a little
bit about the movie mode on this camera
because it's also kind of special of
course we've got full HD 1080p but in
addition to that this camera unlike the
EOS models that we're currently offering
has optical zooming power optical
zooming and autofocus continuously while
you shoot so it's really a very powerful
camera for video as well as still
photography
it's gonna be available in February at a
retail price of $7.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
