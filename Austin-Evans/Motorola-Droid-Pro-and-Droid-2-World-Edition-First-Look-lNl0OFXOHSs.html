some possible new motorola droid phones
for verizon so thanks to boy jeans
reporters open to really big leagues
looks like we're getting a really solid
picture of what the new droid phones
we're going to be seeing this year are
so the first one we'll be taking a look
at is a motorola droid two world edition
so this name suggests it is simply a
cdma + gsm version of the standard droid
2 now what this means is that you
actually be able to of course use it on
the standard cdma network of verizon but
you also be able to be able to take it
all around the world and sure what
pretty much just fine as it will support
the GSM standard which is very very very
common around the world and this is
where cdma is definitely not so this is
great you will be able to just pop
another sim card in so you know if
you're in the UK you can just pop in at
UK sim card etc etc instead of having to
go ahead and you know buy another phone
or try to find some other work around so
it's definitely nice feature in addition
it also will be coming in two colors
black and white so kind of interesting
however this is not going to be a phone
it's going to be extremely popular
really the only reason you would
probably want to get this is if you
frequently or maybe a business traveler
or you maybe have family and other
countries and you know you're frequently
going there but that said though it
definitely is going to be a nice feature
to be able to not be just stuck to
verizon network next one we're going to
take a look at is the motorola droid pro
and the droid pro is actually going to
be a really powerful phone is it's not
i'm going to have a four-inch screen but
at one point three gigahertz CPU now
this is a really nice step up from most
other phones today such as the iphone
for the droid eggs etc and it also is
going to have full gsm roaming
capabilities just like the droid two
world edition so this looks like it will
be even better if you're a business
customer you can go ahead and have one
of the fastest funds available and we'll
have a nice 4 inch screen this look like
it's going to have a keyboard so it's
going to be pretty similar to the droid
x as far as that goes but will also have
that faster cpu and be able to roam on
pretty much anywhere in the world so if
you're looking for that phone like that
you definitely will probably want to go
ahead and wait till November when
should be announced and released so
that's it personally I don't know I
think the droid two world edition is
going to be kind of nice especially for
business customers who may be coming off
of a world version of a blackberry that
might board for you but my pig is
definitely going to be the droid pro I
like it's going to have a 4-inch screen
I think that's about the sweet spot for
you know touchscreen smartphones in
these days and the one point three
gigahertz CPU is doesn't want to be very
very fast couple that together with
actually be able to roam abroad actually
use the GSM as well as the CDMA networks
it's going to be a really nice thing so
guys definite let me know in the
comments what do you think about these
phones I know a lot of my viewers are
from different countries other than the
United States so are you interested in
maybe importing one of these phones
knowing that it should work on you your
standard GSM networks Tiffany let me
know in the comments I'm curious to know
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
