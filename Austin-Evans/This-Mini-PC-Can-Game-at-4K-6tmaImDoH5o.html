hey guys this is Austin
this tiny computer is packing some
serious power so this is the zotac
Magnus en 1070 so if you guys remember a
couple months ago I did a video on the
Alienware alpha r2
now that was a great little console
killer PC however it was really aimed at
1080p this is focused on VR and
especially 4k gaming so Wenzhou type
offered to send us out I couldn't say no
so first of all we get wow that's
actually a lot of paperwork oh well I
almost threw this away I'm like oh a
disc who cares however inside there's
also a flash drive so this has all of
our drivers which are still probably out
of date but it's very least we can
actually use it those drivers actually
might come in handy too since this is a
bare-bones system so what that means is
it's somewhere in between building
something yourself and having a
completely pre-built system so it comes
with most of what you need in the box
however you still get the option of
putting in your own SSD your own memory
and your own operating system moving on
we have the power adapter now it'll be
nice to not have to deal with an
external power brick because the system
is so small I can understand besides not
that big so here is the PC itself for
something so powerful this is pretty
small so for comparison this is what it
looks like next to a ps4 as you can see
even though it's packing a lot more
power it's still a really small computer
in really that's one of the big
advantages of getting a system like this
sure you can build something yourself
it's going to be more powerful for the
same money however is not going to be
easy to build anything anywhere near as
powerful in such a tiny package all unit
that's actual metal Wow
so on top of you got some plastic as
well as on the bottom however we have a
fair few ports so up front we have an SD
card reader USB 3.1 port as well as a
3.1 enabled USB C might be a mouthful
however this guy is rockin some ports
and around back you have four more USB
as well as a pair of HDMI a pair of
DisplayPort and a pair of ethernet jacks
and since this is a bare-bones system
it's also going to be easy to get into
so ZOTAC includes a pair of thumb screws
on the back
then if we push the back off oh yeah
super easy so inside is where we're
going to install all of our parts so not
only do we have to DD our four sodium's
slots for memory but you also can use
either an m2 as SD slot or you can also
use the two and a half inch drive bay
which can work with either a hard drive
or SSD now what you can't is easily
upgrade or any of the core internals
such as the CPU or GPU as you can
imagine with something like this they
didn't exactly just cram normal gtx 1070
inside however there's a big warranty
void sticker right here so i want to
think twice about that so for this
system I'm installing a samsung 950 pro
now if this was going to be my main
system I would probably also take
advantage of the two and a half inch
drive so something like a really fast
nvme SSD paired with maybe like a 2
terabyte hard drive would really kind of
be the best of both worlds for RIM we
have 16 gigabytes of Crucial ddr4 memory
now one thing you need to keep in mind
is that these are so dense so unlike
normal desktop Ram this is going to be a
lot smaller which considering this is a
small gaming PC that make sense so as
far as getting this operational that's
pretty much all you have to do the last
step is to install your operating system
I'm going to be using Windows 10 and
we're good to go inside the zotac we've
got a core i5 6400 t the gtx 1070 and
with specs like this while the cpu is a
little bit on the weaker side it still
is quad core which means that now i
should be able to play some 4k games but
it's also v already so the first game
we're going to be trying is Middle Earth
shadow of Mordor now this might be a
couple years old however especially a 4k
this thing is no joke yeah so intense so
intense so we're playing shadow Mordor
on 4k on high settings now for something
that's this small nice for something
this small it's not bad we actually
could crank the settings up just a
little bit however we're getting a
pretty solid frame right here without
even needing to deal with uh-hah that's
so good next we have the witcher 3 now
this is a game that absolutely holds up
graphics wise I would be surprised if we
can actually run this maxed out at 4k so
here with medium settings at 4k things
are pretty playable it's still not
perfect so we're getting upper 30s in
the framerate however this is not an
easy game to run at all next we have
battlefield 1 and this actually isn't a
game that I've been able to test you
some curious how it performs I just came
looks so good so for now we're playing
on 4k medium and immediately it's looks
so nice there's really something to be
said like I know that some people talk
about 4k is not worth it and depending
on like what you're really doing it
might not be but if you actually had
like a proper TV it makes a big
difference well not in your gameplay it
makes a difference to you know how
pretty the game looks Kyle actually kind
of terrible so yes the zotac is
expensive I love a link in the
description if you guys want to check it
out however considering just how much
power you're getting in such a small
package it's actually not that bad so
what do you guys think about the system
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
