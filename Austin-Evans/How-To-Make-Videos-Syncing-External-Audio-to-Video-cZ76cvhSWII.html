my series of videos showing you how to
improve your video quality so today
we're going to be taking a look at how
to properly sync your video and audio
together and this is something that was
very very requested last time so let me
go ahead and give you guys a quick
tutorial so first of all obviously
you're going to need the video so this
is probably gonna be from your camera or
camcorder preferably that will have some
audio it helps you sync but it's not
that's not a huge deal and then you
should also go ahead and pick up your
audio from perhaps an external
microphone for example USB or zoom h1 or
whatever so once you have both of these
just go ahead and drop them into your
timeline on whatever video editor you
like and then there's a couple of ways
to do this
now there's the automatic approach which
if you have an editors such as Final Cut
Pro 10 it'll allow you to automatically
do it so it'll get it all perfectly
synced out without any having to worry
about anything
same goes for there are plugins for
various editors not for everything but
there are plugins that you can go ahead
and pick up if you can will do the same
thing will do it automatically for you
however if you don't have a video editor
or you want to buy a plug-in or anything
like that there is a very simple manual
way of doing it so all you need to do
and this needs to be done while you're
actually filming it's just claps so I'm
gonna go ahead and open up the the sound
mixer it's called in quarrel you might
see his waveform or audio or something
like that but basically just be sure
that you can actually see the audio in
waveform so I like to do is just clap so
you guys can see there a clap and that
it's a really nice loud noise it allows
me to go ahead and sync everything
really nicely it's just going to be
audio and whatnot it can get a little
bit difficult but if you have a nice
really loud clap and preferably if you
can have it on camera it's very simple
so once you had this and you have a on
both to see your everyone here as well
as one here so just go ahead and trim
this down doesn't have to be super
precise at the beginning just get
roughly about right and actually wanna
do that hang a second let's just cut the
top clip and delete all the beginning of
it and then come down to our audio and
do the exact same thing and then put
them together and if we look here
everything looks about synced up we can
go ahead and play through it and we
should hear the clap just it shouldn't
have any echo or anything like that
should just be able to hear the clap and
it's about that simple guys so only
other thing is if you can take your
video editor and
Wenlock your audio and video together
mute the the camera clip because odds
are you're not gonna want both audio
source just want to have your good
microphone with whatever it may be and
there you guys go so at this point
you're all good to go just be sure to be
careful when you're editing if you don't
like you can't lock them together you
don't you know they don't get out of
sync
you know half the video is you know if
the audio is way off or anything like
that but as long as you can lock it
together and be careful with your
editing you should have no problem and
here we should have much better audio
quality without having to spend a ton of
time so hey guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely be sure to subscribe to
the channel if you have any more tips
that you'd like me to cover as far as
making videos definitely be sure to
