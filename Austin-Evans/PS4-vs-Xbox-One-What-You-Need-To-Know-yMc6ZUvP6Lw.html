here's what you need to know about the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
so both consoles will be out here in the
next few months so let's take a look to
see exactly which one is going to be
best for you to start with we have the
PlayStation 4 which will be coming in at
$400 and will be released on November
15th in the United States and November
29th in Europe included with the
PlayStation 4 is going to be the
controller an HDMI cable as well as a
pair of earbuds which will double as
your headset moving on to the Xbox one
it will run you five hundred dollars and
be released sometime in November or
early next year in some parts of the
world and in the box included is the new
Kinect a headset controller and HDMI
cable I was able to try both consoles
and controllers at e3 this year the new
Dual Shock for the PlayStation 4 is a
major improvement over the last version
as not only is a little bit bigger but
more importantly it's a lot more
ergonomic so it's much closer to the
Xbox 360 controller than the ps3 it also
does have a touchpad in the center of
the controller as well as a built-in
speaker however I still prefer the Xbox
one gamepad so it's very similar to the
Xbox 360 controller which is a good
thing however they have tweaked a lot of
the ergonomics as well as improved the
d-pad it also now does have Rumble
motors inside the triggers as well as no
more hump for the batteries on the back
of the controller moving on to the
consoles something that's hard to tell
from pictures is that the PlayStation 4
is much smaller than the Xbox one so
this is even more impressive when you
consider that the PlayStation 4 has its
power brick built and whereas the Xbox
one while being much larger also has a
giant power brick to go along with it as
far as specs go they're very similar as
both the Xbox one and ps4 have eight
core AMD Jaguar CPUs clocked around 1.6
gigahertz as well as integrated AMD
graphics the ps4 does have the graphics
advantage with both a 50% larger GPU as
well as 8 gigs of faster gddr5 memory as
opposed to ddr3 in the Xbox one both
consoles can play both blu-rays as well
as DVDs and of course game discs and if
you like to go the digital download
route all games will be available day 1
on both consoles however as far as these
digital downloads go some of these can
be absolutely massive
up to 50 gigabytes at times to store all
these massive games both the Xbox one
and ps4 come standard with 500 gigabyte
hard drives however just like with the
ps3 the ps4 does have a user replaceable
hard drive so if you'd like you can swap
that out with something else as far as
motion controls go like I said earlier
the Xbox one does come standard with
Kinect however it does not mandatory and
you do not even have to plug it in if
you don't want now the PlayStation 4
does have the PlayStation 4 eye and that
is actually an optional accessory which
will run you about $60
unfortunately there's no backwards
compatibility so you won't be able to
play your 360 or ps3 games on your new
console however Sony does have Gaikai
streaming plan for the ps4 which would
allow you to stream ps3 games online
however this is just a plant and we'll
see if it ever actually shows up in this
generation online gaming is going to be
paid both on the Xbox and the
PlayStation so that of course would be
Xbox Live the Xbox one and PlayStation
Plus for the PlayStation 4 now these are
going to run you $50 from PlayStation
Plus per year and $60 for Xbox Live per
year and both of these services do come
with free games every month if you have
a 360 or ps3 you can bring over your
Xbox Live or PS plus membership to the
new console which will bring all of your
trophies and achievements over however
you will not be able to play any of your
digital games unless of course you're
using your old console just like the 360
if you don't pay for life on the Xbox
one you are losing out on some features
including hulu netflix and the ability
to record and stream your games whereas
all these features are free on the ps4
regardless of you pay for PlayStation
Plus or not however the Xbox one does
have an NFL app as well as Skype built
in alright so that was a lot of
information so basically right now at
least on paper the ps4 is looking solid
as not only is it smaller but it's also
more powerful and $100 cheaper than the
Xbox one however next time I will go
over the games which of course is a huge
reason why you might want to buy the ps4
or the Xbox one but definitely be sure
to let me know what you guys think
what are you leaning towards ps4 Xbox
one pros cons all that kind of stuff
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below anyway
thank you guys so much for watching if
you enjoyed definitely be sure
subscribe to the channel to get lots
more Xbox one and PlayStation 4 coverage
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
