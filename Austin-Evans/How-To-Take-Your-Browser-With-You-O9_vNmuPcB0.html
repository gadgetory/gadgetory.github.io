I'm here with the video that should help
a large guys out I know I've used it a
lot basically i'm going to show you guys
how to install google chrome on a USB
stick now before you again I'm you say
say this very quickly this is not Google
Chrome OS this is just the browser
Google Chrome now if you might be
wondering why would you want it on a USB
Drive it's pretty simple any time you
tend to use another person's computer
whether it's maybe like a library at
school at your friend's house whatever
reason a lot of times you're going to
run into the fact that you're going to
be using Internet Explorer and obviously
you know most people don't like Internet
Explorer myself included so you know
it's nice to have a backup and when you
install google chrome on a USB drive
like i'm about to show you it also has
the added benefit of saving all your
history and everything on to the concert
that USB Drive so you're not you know
messing someone else up with all your
different sites or whatever and you know
any downloads and that kind of thing
it's all contained on the USB Drive so
yeah let's go ahead and get this one
started
okay so before we can let me just give
you guys a little bit of background on
what what google chrome portable is all
about basically google chrome portable
is just like the name says it's a
version of google chrome the full
version this basically just been tweaked
so instead of having to install it on
every computer you go to you just can
install it once on a flash drive plug it
in and open run it from there it's
pretty simple obviously it's not going
to be as fast is something that's been
fully installed and everything on your
main computer but it will especially if
you're using a computer that's like an
explorer 6 or whatever long as you don't
have an ancient a flash drive it'll pry
definitely outrun it so it's something
to keep in mind so let's go ahead and
just do this real quick um the address
to go ahead and download it I will have
in the description as always it's real
simple just go ahead and download the
package pretty small once you've
downloaded it you have the you have it
like this so let's go ahead and I'll
quickly show you because you can mess up
the installation if you're not if you're
not paying attention so i'll go ahead
and quickly show you guys this so you
just open it I'm just lecturing at your
language and then you just go ahead and
click through here and you go ahead but
obviously you know except license
everything but now this is where you're
going to need to stop for a second you
want to make sure that you're going to
be installing it on your USB Drive so be
sure to click browse go ahead and click
computer and then go ahead and pick your
USB Drive my case it's this one so I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm going to go ahead
and download it because obviously I
already have it but you would go ahead
and hit ok and install the install takes
anywhere from five to 15 minutes it's
going to go ahead and download the
google chrome and do the whole deal so
it depending on how fast your USB drive
is it shouldn't take more than 15
minutes though anyway let's go ahead and
show you guys the brows are working now
oh hey guys so quickly i'm just going to
go ahead and show you guys how to launch
it and just
really quick taste of the performance so
obviously just go ahead and go into my
computer and find whatever drive your
USB Drive is listed my case it's G so go
ahead and double click on now we'll note
if you have files on there on there
already it's not a big deal as long as
there's room it really should make a
difference for me i'll go ahead and
wiped it out because there's nothing
there was nothing important but it
doesn't really matter and also i will
note if you do uh because this runs just
like google chrome on your computer so
if you have a smaller hard drive or you
have not a ton of room left you might
want to clear some out because it will
download like cookies and history and
that sort of thing it's not gonna you
know blown out I mean it's not gonna be
a huge amount of space but you know you
don't want it to run out because I know
that's just not cool anyway so go ahead
click on the google chrome portable file
and then you'll just see the little
application go ahead just double-click
on it now like i said i'm using a pretty
old be up USB drive so it's much slower
for me than it will be for you
especially if you have a newer one
anyway so go ahead give it a second to
load i know i'm used to be I'm used to
using chrome you know everything being
instant so you got a you know give it a
second but once it looks like it's
loaded you can go ahead pretty much do
whatever you want so you know let's say
go ahead and hit up gizmo though because
I got that loaded and you'll see that
it's not quite as fast as chrome it's
definitely quite a bit slower but still
I mean if you're comparing it to like
internet explorer 6 or something I mean
it's it's no contest I mean and it's
really good because like I said you're
saving all your history on your USB
Drive so any sites going to aren't going
to be all over someone else's history so
yeah guys that is it that is google
chrome portable fully featured chrome
and you just put it on a USB drive plug
it whenever you just take wherever you
go if you do someone else's computer
just plug the USB Drive in open it up
and you're good to go anyway guys thanks
