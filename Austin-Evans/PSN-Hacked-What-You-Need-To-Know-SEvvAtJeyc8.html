update on what's going on with PSN so I
was on Twitter earlier and I just popped
up everybody started talking about it
basically what's happened is is that
Sony's finally come clean with what's
going on for the past week with PSN so
if you're not familiar and I'm sure most
of you guys are PSN has been down for
about a week and they really have been
very vague about what its the problem I
hope they just posted a full blog update
not how I recommend you get in check it
out in the link in the description but
basically the gist of it is is that
someone hacked PSN and stole a lot of
data so I'll actually read through to
you guys basically what happened is is
that someone hacked into PSN and stole
your name your address including your
city state and zip code and your country
they stole your email address that you
use to open up PSN your birthdate your
PSN password and login information now
that's the important thing I do want to
mention now that's not your email past
or anything like that that is just for
PSN however if you use that same
password so for example you know if it's
1 2 3 4 5 6 and your password on your
emails the exact same then it is a high
chance that someone whoever stole this
can use that to access your email or
indeed any other site on the entire
internet that you used it so it's
Facebook or anything like that so what I
highly highly recommend is if you reuse
the password and I know all of us are
guilty of doing that from time to time
if you reuse dirtiest and password on
any other site anywhere I highly
recommend to go change that password as
soon as you can I know that's just good
just good advice in general always
change your passwords everyone smile but
this is especially important as most of
the time when they steal this kind of
stuff the number one thing they want is
your password saying get your email
Facebook all that kind of stuff span
there's a lot of stuff that you do not
want to happen so how you recommend go
change all your passwords if you ever
reuse the same password from PSN now as
far as the other day that they stole
they of course stole your PSN handle and
online ID so they have all that
information and of course with your name
and address all that kind of stuff
definitely a really bad deal
they also possibly would have stolen
your profile data which anything you
would put your profile as well as your
purchase history and billing address
definitely not a very good deal they
also probably stole your password
security answers so you know like what's
your mother's maiden name all those kind
of questions anything you put in PSN
very well could have been compromised so
this is a really bad deal if you have a
Playstation 3 or PSP you have all this
information out there there's really
nothing you can do right now other than
change your passwords and just keep an
eye out now they do not believe that
your credit card data or your debit card
or anything that was stolen however they
can't entirely rule it out so what I
recommend there I wouldn't be super
worried but what I do recommend is just
take a look most credit cards and
everything you can go online and check
your statements and whatnot just kind of
keep an eye on that next you know a
little while make sure there's nothing
you know fishy nothing pops up there and
if there's a course contact your bank or
whoever owns your credit card so guys
just wanted to do this quick update for
you a really bad deal but the most
important thing I really want to get
this across please change your passwords
if you've ever reused it and definitely
keep an eye out for you know spam mail
junk mail all that kind of good stuff
and you should be okay now if this you
feeling this helpful please share it
around with any of your friends who have
PSN let everyone know what's going on so
everyone can be prepared as far as
what's going on anyway guys definitely
stay tuned I will be back and I'll make
another video if there's any more
updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
