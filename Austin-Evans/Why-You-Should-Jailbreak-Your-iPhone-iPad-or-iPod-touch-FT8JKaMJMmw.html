youth the video going over why you
should jailbreak you know I get this
question asked literally many many times
every single day and instead of just
answering each person individually with
some of the pros and cons of whatnot
instead I'm going to make this video and
explain what jailbreaking is all about
and why you should or maybe you
shouldn't jailbreak so of course if you
guys are already jailbroken you may want
share this video with your friends who
are interested or whatnot let's just go
ahead and jump right on in right now we
have an untethered jailbreak for all
devices on iOS 5.2.1 so then close the
iPad to the iPhone 4s and all the
previous generations of devices now this
is sometimes becoming a lot rarer it
used to be that we would have a fully
untethered jailbreak and you know be out
every couple weeks order for all these
different devices however Apple has
really really cut down on how hard it is
to make these jailbreaks so instead of
having you know maybe like a week or two
you're having months and months so just
take for example the iPad 2 it's been
out for nearly a year now over in that
year time span there's been a grand
total of two jailbreaks for it so if you
are interested in jailbreaking
I recommend that you do it now while
there is an untethered jailbreak for
everything if you wait you update your
firmware and it could be months and
months before another jailbreak is
developed one of the best reasons to
jailbreak is for the customization now
while sure iOS now you can you add a
background or something but for the most
part it's still very lockdown
experienced iOS is what it is however
with jailbreaking this is not the case
at all there's no such thing as lock
bound so if you want to do some small
subtle tweaks like for example have a
scrolling dock with Cover Flow you can
certainly do that or if you want to go
more advanced for example you want to
install an Android theme or a Windows
Phone theme or some kind of anything in
the middle or in fact you can make your
own fingers all kinds of possibilities
and that's one of the great reasons why
I love jailbreaking you can really fully
customize the look and feel of your
device jailbreak tweaks are one of the
biggest reasons to jailbreak so what is
this is is basically just some kind of
add-on for your iPhone iPod Touch or
iPad which will add some functionality
so take for example espy settings when
you install that when you swipe down
your notification center instead just
seeing you know weather and a few you
know pop-ups and notifications and
whatnot
you actually have full access to a wide
range of system toggles so instead of
having to dig through you know settings
or whatnot you can just turn off Wi-Fi
or you can turn on 3G Bluetooth
location services there's all kinds of
stuff and you can even reboot your
device just straight from there so SP
settings is a great example of a really
really great tweak
another example is zephyr so typically
when you're doing iOS multitasking you
double tap the home button and then you
swipe through find the app that you want
in the little tray tap on it and it will
bring you to that app a little Zephyr is
much simpler all you need to do is
literally swipe to the left or swipe
from the right it will bring you to the
previous or the next application on top
of that if you're interested in leaving
the app instead pack and hit the home
button you can just swipe up and it's
gone and those are just two of thousands
of awesome city tweaks that are
available however I do want to be clear
that jailbreaking does have some cons
for example if you do update you will
lose your jailbreak period so you never
when you're jailbreaking you never ever
want to update unless you do know that
there's a fully untethered jailbreak on
the next version of your firmware so for
example i OS 5.1 comes up tomorrow you
jailbroken on 5.0 5.1 do not update
until there's a jailbreak otherwise you
will lose your jailbreak lose all your
tweaks all those cool things that you
gain by jailbreaking and then the con
can mean stability and performance
issues so the way I like to explain
jailbreaking to people is like this when
you have it your normal device it's
non-jailbroken it's very lot beyond you
can install apps but when you exit them
they really don't do anything there's no
way to customize things in general
however when you jailbreak it's like you
turn your device into a mini computer so
let's say you have your computer of
course you have full access to install
whatever you want so you can install
call kinds of crazy themes you can run
all the programs you want and that's
great it's fine you have that full
capability however if you run a ton of
crap on your computer it's going to slow
down it's just the way it works you've
got tons of stuff running your computers
guys spend a lot of time making all the
stuff run well same thing goes for
jailbreaking if you have a ton of tweaks
things this that running on your device
yeah it's going to slow down that's just
the way it works however by that itself
jailbreaking doesn't really slow
anything down as long as you're moderate
as far as like what you install like you
keep like maybe a few things as long as
you just don't like install everything
have everything running you guys
shouldn't notice any major performance
hit especially on the new iPhone 4 as an
iPad 2 they really really run nicely
with a jailbreak the last thing has to
do with warranty now technically when
you jailbreak your device your warranty
is totally null and void so if Apple
wants I can look at you device go up I'm
sorry we'd love to help you because of
this bro
for at broke or whatever but it's
jailbroken while technically Apple says
no don't jailbreak this and that almost
never do they actually really like void
your warranty or you know deny you
service I know many people who brought
their devices in who that were
jailbroken that have been jailbroken in
the past indeed some of them were like
blatantly jailbroken with all kinds of
themes and stuff and generally app will
go ahead and fix it no problem however I
do want to be clear there's always a
possibility Apple can look at your
device go up no sorry what I got to do
anything but in general just restore
your device before bringing it in and
you shouldn't really have any problems
so anyway guys it's gonna be about it I
hope you guys who are may be considering
jailbreaking enjoyed this and if you did
feel free to check my channel I post all
kinds of tutorials and whatnot whatever
a new jailbreak comes out a new firmware
Zandi that kind of stuff that you need
to know about I make a video so if you'd

that stuff
