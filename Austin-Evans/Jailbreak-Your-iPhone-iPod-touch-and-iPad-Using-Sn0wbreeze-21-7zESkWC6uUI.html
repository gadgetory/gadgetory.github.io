tutorial showing you how to jailbreak
your iPod Touch your iPhone as well as
your iPad using snowberries 2.1 now
before we begin anything I do want to go
ahead and give you the standard warning
that you will need to go ahead and back
up all of your data in iTunes before
attempting to jailbreak I know this is
very simple all you do is plug in your
device into iTunes let it fully sync and
you'll be good to go okay so the first
step is going to be to download
snowberries 2.1 I'm making go ahead and
do this at the link listed in the
description below so all you do is go
ahead and come to the website and scroll
right down here and go ahead and click
download for Windows ok so at this point
we are ready to begin
so since we'll go ahead and open up
snowberries and then come over here and
click Next so this screen will ask you
to go ahead and give it and your IPSW
file basically what this is is a
firmware file for your respective device
whether it be an iPod and iPhone or an
iPad so basically what you're gonna need
to do is find how to find this so you're
either going to need to go ahead and
look for on your computer or you might
need to go ahead and download it so go
ahead your best bet is just to Google
whatever you're looking for once you've
found it go ahead and click browse now
go ahead and select your firmware and
click open ok so once it finishes
verifying your firmer go ahead and click
Next now it will ask you what do you
want to use simple mode or expert mode
now personally I recommend going ahead
and using expert mode even though it
says expert is really just gives you a
few more options and to be honest
there's really not a whole lot downside
to using it now I'm going to go ahead
and walk you through all of the
different options in expert mode so to
begin with let's go I can go to general
now you will see a lot of different
options on everything from activating
your iPhone installing SSH and if you
have an iPhone 3G or an iPod Touch
second generation you also see some such
as background wallpaper battery
percentage and native multitasking now
pretty much all of these are optional so
you can go ahead and mix match whatever
you like personally I recommend going
ahead installing SSH definitely is a
very good idea and as soon as you do do
this it will tell you how to pick change
your password which is important of
course you can do that after the
jailbreak
so I recommend going ahead and
installing SSH and then if you have an
iPhone or an iPod Touch that have these
options
not a bad idea to at least do native
multitasking and again totally optional
up to you what you want to install okay
now we can go ahead and click Next
and that's one really the nice features
of snow breeze is the fact that you can
go ahead and install custom apps and
sources already through the snow buries
itself instead of doing it on your
device
however again this is totally optional
and if you don't want to you do not have
to do this right now
so I'm go ahead and skip this for now
and now that's going to be hit so all
you need to do is go ahead and click
build IPSW and hit next so at this point
it's going to go ahead and take a few
minutes so it's best to just go ahead
and sit back give it a few minutes to go
ahead and complete okay so as soon as
snow breeze finishes you're right go
ahead and begin the jailbreak so this is
gonna be pretty simple all you need to
do is put your device into DFU mode so
I'm go ahead and show you how to do this
first step is to go ahead and hold the
power button until your device shuts off
so and you can see here we had the side
ten lock
I shut off and we're ready to begin okay
so this is going to be a time series of
buttons you're going to go ahead and
press that and that in a sequence I'll
go ahead and walk you guys to it so go
ahead and click start we're go ahead and
prepare to press the home in the power
button make sure you guys can see here
I'm now gonna hold them both you never
over it go ahead you'd hold him for
about ten seconds now we're about to
release the power button now we're gonna
go ahead and release the power button
and to continue holding the home button
they're gonna see here's Ben go ahead
and continue holding it and that's going
to go ahead says 30 seconds usually it's
a little bit less than that and there we
go so now as you guys can see here I'm
all done and now it's going to go ahead
and be running I read so this won't work
for all devices obviously but it will
work for the iPod Touch 2nd generation
so all you need to do is go ahead and
just follow the instructions on the
screen and you will be good to go so you
see here device is all off and now it
says that your device is now in a pwned
DFU mode state ok so at this point we're
going to go ahead and restore our custom
firmware made by Snow breeze onto our
device so more than likely iTunes will
go ahead and pop up on its own if not go
ahead and open it and it should say that
you have it there's an iPod or an iPhone
in recovery mode so go ahead and hit
okay ready to go so now all we need to
do is go ahead and hit restore oh don't
just click it you need to go ahead and
hold the left shift key and then click
it okay so now go ahead and go to your
desktop and then go ahead and select
these snow buries IPSW now all you do is
when go ahead and hit open you know go
ahead and ask you what do you want to go
ahead and restore it which obviously you
do and this one go ahead and take just a
few minutes so I'm go ahead and be right
back as soon as it's done okay so that's
it
this is iTunes is done feel free to go
ahead and unplug your device and then
take a look the scroll it's the last
page you will now see City is installed
so congratulations that's it you are now
fully jailbroken so go ahead and enjoy
so anyway guys if you do have any
questions comments anything like that
feel free to leave them in the comment
section below and I will do my best to
get back to as many of you as I can
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
