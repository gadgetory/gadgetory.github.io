talking a little bit about the latest
Apple firmware update so in case you
didn't know apple today released iOS 4.0
point2 for the iphone and ipod touch as
well as iOS 3.2 point2 for the ipad now
these updates are literally consists of
nothing but fixing the jailbreakme
exploit now jailbreakme is probably the
easiest jailbreak ever it's super simple
you open up safari however if you I bake
your device you will no longer be able
to use jailbreakme at least for the
current time unless they update it but
it really guys just don't update because
it could be a very long time before we
can actually go ahead and do it now as
always there are a lot of people who
accidentally update or weren't paying
attention or whatever so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you there is one way to
go ahead and jailbreak retail break it
back if you are on 4.0 point2 now this
actually uses red snow now red cell is
actually one of my favorite jailbreaking
programs and it's really it's really
pretty simple I've actually done a video
on red snow before and this is the same
kind bris know but the but the way you
do is just a little bit different so if
you need to go ahead and jailbreak I
will go ahead just continue watching the
video and I'll show you in just a second
however there's one major problem with
this if you do want to jailbreak on 4.0
point2 then there's only a couple
devices at sports basically if you're on
4.0 point to the only devices you can
jailbreak are the iphone 3g all models
of iphone 3g as well as the original
ipod touch 2g mb model okay so if you
have an MC model ipod touch an iphone
3gs and iphone 4 for an ipad or even an
ipod touch 3rd generation you will not
be able to jailbreak if you're on 4.0
point2 period now i'm sure that there
will be a jailbreak maybe in a week
probably in a month or two months or a
while but currently you're going to be
totally locked to add jailbreaking so
guys I'm gonna go ahead and show you
otherwise you can just quit watching the
video now if you're just you know
staying on your current firmware but if
for whatever reason you do need to go
ahead jailbreak on 4.1 I'm sorry 4.0
point2 just quite continue watching the
video okay so before we begin I do want
to make really clear that this was only
going to work if you have an iPhone 3G
or an ipod touch 2g with the mb model
okay now if you have any other device
whether
an ipad and iphone anything else other
than those two very specific devices
this will not work ok so just might be
really clear if you have any other
device you are going to have to wait but
if you do have one of these two devices
it's not that hard to jailbreak so
you're going to need two things first
you can need your iPod or iPhone from
where and this is not going to be four
point zero point two you're going to
need the ipod or iphone 4.0 firmware
okay so you more than likely we are
going to already have this on your
computer if not just google it is really
simple you should be able to find it no
problem okay so once you have the
firmware for preferably on your desktop
it's not a big deal and then you're
going to need redsnow so I'm just go
ahead and show you really quickly here
so all you need to do is go to the link
in the description and it will take you
to the download page for redsnow so this
is really simple I do recommend reading
through it it's always a good idea to go
ahead and read you know extra through it
but again I gots I'm going to explain
all this to you pretty much so it's not
a big deal so just come to the bottom
and either go to the download links for
OS 10 or windows so just pick whichever
you want and that's all good so now
let's go ahead and open up redstone now
what you need do is browse for your
firmware and then you're going to go
ahead and pick out that firmware that
you just downloaded or you found on your
computer or whatever the 4.0 firmware
wasn't hit open give it just a moment
then I'll ask if it's an NB model or an
MC it is you now obviously this will not
work with NC so you do need an MB so
just go ahead and click no okay so
you're going to go ahead and hit next
we'll go ahead and download the
jailbreak data very simply there we go
ok so now guys it is very very simple
all you need to do is go ahead obviously
keep make sure installed cydia hooked up
and then the rest of these entirely
optional I'll just go ahead and just go
through them really quickly so you can
do verbose boot which basically will
allow you to go ahead and instead of
just looking at the picture or a boot
logo that you're going to show you the
text as stuff loads it's not a big deal
but if you want you go and do it you
want to upload a custom boot logo or a
custom recovery logo as well as you can
enable multitasking home screen
wallpaper and battery percentage now
we'll mention that if you want to enable
any of these three they will tend to
slow your device down so you know do it
at your own risk I haven't all enabled
on mine but a lot of people don't want
to deal with you know it being slow so
just pick whatever you want today all
you have to do is click next now
you will need to put your device into
dfu mode to do this simply plug your
iPod or iPhone into the computer and
then go ahead and hold the power button
white until it says slide to shut off
then go ahead and do that okay so once
you've done this go ahead and click Next
and just follow the very simple
instructions telling you how to get it
into dfu mode it's not that hard and if
you do drop a button or something like
that it's not really a big deal just go
ahead it will reboot and just redo the
cycle again ok guys so that's it for my
tutorial showing you how to jailbreak
for your iphone 3g or ipod touch 2g on
iOS 4.0 point2 ok guys so again I didn't
really want to stress this if you're not
already on 4.0 point2 if you didn't do
it by extent do not update because there
really is no reason to do it so guys
this is just you know a back-up plan in
case you had a problem whatever go ahead
just run through redsnow otherwise guys
just stay clear of it you'll be just
fine anyway guys thanks for watching
