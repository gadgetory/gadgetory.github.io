operating system on the amazon kindle
fire i'm playing around with this for a
day or so now I've got some thoughts
some good some not so good so I figured
I'd go ahead and share with you guys so
the first thing is that this runs on
android 2.3 AKA gingerbread now android
is very popular OS for phones as many of
you guys will most likely know and this
is a good and bad thing now the way
amazon toxic an all-new you know they've
redesigned it and they basically just
kind of took some pieces of android and
added a lot of their own and it is true
this is a very customized experience
this isn't like any android device I've
ever tried however Android is still
definitely here and to be honest I don't
really think of this as an all-new let
Oso really think of this as Android with
the skin so go ahead and give you guys a
quick walkthrough up top left here is
where our notifications are so there's
this very similar to Android instead of
just dragging it down you just tap it
and for example here we go we have a
notification air about a playback error
rather so it's really nice to know i
also do out of time and up here is where
we go ahead and select many of our
different controls now this is very
important the amazon kindle fire lacks
several key buttons as well the home
button and I'm sorry as far as physical
buttons go it likes a home button as
well as a volume control now this is a
bit of a problem for me however all this
is in the OS so for example right down
here tap on that that's the home button
and if we want to change the volume I
can certainly do that from right here I
know but there's nothing wrong with the
way it is in the OS the problem is these
are kind of buttons I'd like to you know
be able to have on the device so for
example you know if I was listening to
music last night especially a perfect
example I was listening to music last
night i was listening to one of the
speakers and that plugged my headphones
in and volume I had it blasting on the
speakers and I listened to it on my
headphones it absolutely just blasted my
ears out because I didn't change the
volume and so instead just being able to
hit it real fast or anything I had to go
in while I was killing my ears I had to
hit this and then hit volume and then
drag it down which was a big pain in the
ass and it really hurt my ears just so I
don't mean to be complaining or anything
but it is a bit of a problem how there's
no buttons like that but enough of that
let's go out and continue on with the
tour so right here we have a search menu
now the keyboard on this is actually
fantastic i really really do like it
you know it's a nice size on a 7-inch
screen so we can type out whatever we
want so let's just go and type out
Duncan 333 03 yeah the keyboard I can't
say enough about that on the keyboard
really does work well it's very similar
to the Android but I believe they've
reskinned it a little bit but yeah so
from the search menu we can search from
our library so if we had any video
content like that what can tap over here
and search for the web so I'll pull up
all kinds of web searches like that so
kind of nice thing to do allow you to
search and all that kind of stuff just
straight from the device now up here we
do have a variety of different like hot
links to oh I don't suppose not hot legs
but likes to normal applications so r
example we can go to newsstand I'll try
to be brief here may give you guys the
little example actually let me make sure
you guys book since actually have some
books on here so for example in books we
have a couple of options so we can pick
on the cloud so these are all the books
that i have purchased or gotten through
amazon on top of that we can also look
at the ones that are on the device
itself and if we want come over here
unless i want to go ahead and continue
reading one of these books i can just
simply tap on and it will download and
it will be on the device and I'll be
good to go this source really quite
nicely and I do like how they've
integrated all these amazon services if
i want to click over here it will take
me to the amazon store where i can buy
more books which is a kind of obvious
but yeah definitely does work very nice
i like how they did this ah same thing
goes for music video all that kind of
stuff works quite nicely i'll kind of
skip on that save on time but i will
show you guys apps now apps are well of
course the South have an app store it is
a full tablet and there are quite a few
absolutely come installed installed few
of these like Netflix and most of these
have installed but it does come with
some major ones such as the email
application facebook contacts
quickoffice and a couple of others like
that so again this is on my device if I
had any apps i had purchased for example
here's a couple of them that come
pre-installed pandora acceptor etc i can
just simply tap on them since they've
been pre-purchased i suppose but they
don't actually come on the device and
again i can come to the store and browse
through you won't get too in-depth into
this part however there are quite a few
different applications and they do have
one major free app every day so for
example today it's going to be bejeweled
2 which actually not too probably pick
up a nap i like bejeweled there are lots
of different apps it's not as big of an
place is for example the android market
which you cannot easily get on here you
can sideload it if you want but it
doesn't come pre-installed or anything
like that and while I don't really have
a major problem with the amazon appstore
it is just nothing spectacular all right
so what about done here of course we had
this little Curacao there's all of our
most recent applications there's nothing
we can do about this so you want to say
I want to get rid of this you can't
swipe it or anything like that basically
going way to get rid of something like
this is just to let it scroll back
forever so I mean it's nice meeting you
see here we have books we have
applications music web page pretty much
anything you do on the device will show
up here that definite would like an
option to go ahead and yell swipe some
things away and if we want to scroll
down here we have what's known as a doc
so we can add some certain things so the
nice thing is we can add anything we
want here so so I want to add a book
simply hold on add to favorites and if
we scroll them here man we have a link
to the book and of course take this
right there as any guys it's gonna be
about it for my tour of the operating
system on the Amazon Kindle Fire
definitely some pros and cons the
responsiveness isn't amazing that's kind
of hard to tell on a demo you really
have to get your hands on one and feel
for yourself for a two-hundred-dollar
tablet I don't really have any problems
but ah there's they could be a little
bit quick I just look at that you
definitely really recommend before you
buy my these test it out and kind of get
your hands on and see how responsive it
is and all that kind of stuff because
it's kind of hard to show you guys in a
video anyway if you enjoyed this video
definitely sure to leave the thumbs up
and if you're interested in more videos
