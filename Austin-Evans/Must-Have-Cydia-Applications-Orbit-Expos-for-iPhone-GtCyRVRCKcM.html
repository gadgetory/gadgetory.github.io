I'm here with a yet another video in my
series must have Cydia applications this
one's going to be on an app called orbit
or what you might know it as expose for
the iphone and obviously ipod touch you
know guys I've done a lot of these but I
gotta say this one is among if not the
best it is really it just really very
cool it's going to be really helpful
it's just really something cool to have
so basically the move go ahead and show
you guys I've just restored by pots they
don't have a whole lot apps on here but
I did make a couple extra pages so you
can see here just put a couple just so
you guys can see this and of course this
would work much better if I had you know
like eight or nine pages full of apps or
whatever but you know this works pretty
well in a previous i showed you multiply
icon mover which would allow you to you
know move and clean up your springboard
easier which is horses a pretty big
problem well this one is kind of this is
kind of that takes care of moving them
this takes care of navigating so you
know let's say you have eight pages will
you go to a flick flick flick you know I
mean that's a pretty simple thing but
come on a whole reason you jailbreak
obviously is well a lot of is to
customization so with orbit you can go
ahead and do that just instantly with
the press of the button I will say a
couple things before show you guys it is
a paid application and I know you guys
kind of aren't too big on well most of
you aren't too big on paid City
application guys this one's definitely
worth it i mean it isn't a big boss repo
and it is a dollar ninety-nine but i
mean is that it's pretty good
considering what you might pay in the
app store something like this I mean
it's a no-brainer so I think you
actually see here I've got it and
everything but I'm here it is right here
so if I hit it here we go so basically
this is exposing now it only shows I'm
gonna have like five pages and course
scammed a lot of focus very well but you
see there's like one here one here three
here and like pop here so if I click it
there's I'm on this page look again I'm
going to be on the
page just go back back and forth through
and it's just that simple guys um you
know it's not something amazing you
smell like once you said you can go wow
how to ever live without that but I mean
it's a little simple just with one tap
the button just put on your dog or
whatever you think it'll be handy just
flip to next page simple as that anyway
guys that's it that's the whole thing
deal that's orbit or expose basically
for your iphone um highly recommend guys
you take take a look at it and yeah it's
really pretty cool thanks for watching
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
