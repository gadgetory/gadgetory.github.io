Jobs was released unlike many other
books that discuss bits and pieces from
various points of view this goes over
all from how Jobs was adopted all the
way through the release of the iPad to
an iCloud the book begins with the early
days of jobs and woz practing ATT's
network with devices known as blue boxes
helping lay the groundwork for the pair
to begin Apple computers it's also very
blunt and honest about jobs including
how he was almost entirely out of his
daughter's life for years his surprising
sensitivity they went along with his
harsh brash nature as well as his
insistence that doing drugs in his youth
was one of the best experiences of his
life one of the things that struck me
was the incredible cast of characters
some of the well-known tech giants of
today including Bill Gates or integral
parts of the story of how Apple came to
be as well as the genesis of Microsoft
of course Jobs held nothing back in his
opinion of gates the book also goes into
detail with Steve Jobs as involvement in
Pixar and his ouster and eventual return
to Apple to save the dying company he
also talks about the origins of some of
the most popular Apple devices of today
such as the iPod iPhone and iPad for
example when designing the iPhone there
are two main models they were
considering p1 which would be a phone
based around the click wheel and p2
which would used a large multi-touch
display Paul of course the final version
had a multi-touch screen it would have
been a sight to see how the iPhone would
have been with a click wheel instead the
Steve Jobs biography is a hefty 16 56
pages however I must say I thoroughly
enjoyed every bit of it as I devoured
the book during the past few days if you
were interested in the history of Apple
or even just want to look back at the
incredible time that it was started in I
highly recommend you give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
