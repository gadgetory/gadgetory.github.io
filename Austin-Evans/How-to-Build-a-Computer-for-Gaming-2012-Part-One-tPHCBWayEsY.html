here at the full tutorial on how to
build a gaming computer with the current
generation of consoles stuck in 2006
there's never been a better time to
build yourself a gaming PC to start with
let me go over the parts which are all
from my latest $500 budget gaming build
if you're building that computer then
perfect
but even if you're building a different
machine this tutorial still applies I
won't go into detail on each part so if
you want to know more feel free to check
out that video and then come back here
when you're done to build the computer
you should have a decently sized
workspace and as far as tools go all you
really need is a phillips screwdriver
and a knife
you should also work on tile or hardwood
floors as if you build on carpet you
could potentially build up some static
electricity which could harden your
components it's also a good idea to
touch the steel case before handling any
sensitive parts to ground yourself out
the first step is grabbing our case
which for this build is an antique
300-plus doubt the unboxing knife and
pop the cap on the box you'll find a bit
of foam and under that the instructions
which of course we aren't going to look
at we're rebels like that flip the box
upside down and then pull the box over
the case but then just pull the plastic
wrap off and flip it right side up
now that we've freed the case it's a
good idea to look it over to check if it
was damaged in shipping if everything's
good move around to the back and do the
fourth thumb screws holding the side
panels on slide both the left and right
panels off so we have room to work
inside you find a small box of
accessories which will contain two small
bags of screws put these aside as we'll
be needing them a bit later push the
case off to the side for a bit and grab
your power supply inside here is another
manual the power cable a few small
screws and the supply itself grab it and
remove the plastic wrap now let's
install it make sure it's oriented
correctly with the cables coming out the
back and then place it on the bottom of
your case there should be metal tabs to
make sure you get it properly aligned
but the best way to check is to look at
the rear of the case there are four
screw holes you'll need to keep the
supply in place double check that all of
these are lined up if not readjust the
supply until it's all good grab the
small bag of screws you get with the
power supply in your screwdriver drop a
screw into one of the holes and tighten
it decently but not all the way in case
something needs to be readjusted then go
to the hole opposite where the first
screw is and do that one then just
finish the last two screws now that
everything is in the proper place go
back and tighten each screw down to make
sure the supply isn't going anywhere
nicely done
we have the first component in our build
installed push the case back for a bit
and grab your motherboard in here you
should find a pair of SATA cables one
straight and one angle and the i/o
shield for your ports set the
motherboard aside for a second and below
you'll find the manual and drivers DVD
set this one aside as it actually is
helpful later on now gently pull the
motherboard out and set it on the bag
one thing to keep in mind is that the
motherboard is one of the most sensitive
parts to static so when you were
handling it always touch it by the
plastic parts you should also leave it
on the anti-static bag instead of
letting it sit on your table before we
move on let's take a look at a few of
the important features of the board
first of all is the CPU socket which is
the name implies is where your CPU goes
to the right of this are the slots where
you'll install Ram below the CPU socket
you should see your PCI Express slots
these are what you'll plug your graphics
card into as well as various other cards
like Wi-Fi or capture cards toward the
bottom of the board are four SATA
connectors which are for connecting hard
drives on some other boards you'll have
two types say two 2 and say 3 the only
difference is is that SATA 3 is faster
and works better if you have an SSD
there are more important bits on the
board but those are the main things you
need to learn now we have your processor
if you're using an Intel CPU like we are
the process is identical but AMD CPUs
installs slightly differently plus the
Box open and inside you'll find the
manual along with the core i3 sticker
stock heatsink and fan along with the
CPU which is a little too easy to
overlook like the motherboard this is an
extremely delicate part so only touch it
by the edges when handling it to install
you'll need to push back the arm holding
the socket closed and lift the
protective cover off now line up the two
small notches on the CPU to the notches
in the socket and gently rest it down do
not apply any pressure at all it should
rest nicely by itself lie the cover back
down and firmly press the arm down under
the clip it will give a lot of
resistance but don't worry just press it
all the way down until it's secure now
you've got one of the hardest parts of
the bill taken care of moving on we have
to install the heatsink for this build
I'll be using the stock Intel cooler
however if you're using an aftermarket
cooler then it's best to look up a
specific tutorial as they all install
differently the stock cooler is easy on
the bottom you'll find thermal paste
already applied all we need to do is
align it over the CPU with each of the
four pegs inside the holes
the motherboard then press each down by
starting on the opposite corners until
they click into place once it's
installed you can lift the motherboard
by the heatsink slide the motherboard
off to the side and grab your RAM for
this bill we'll be using a pair of two
gigabyte DIMMs which will give the bill
four gigabytes these aren't extremely
delicate however it's still a good idea
to only handle them by the heatsink or
edges on the bottom you'll find a series
of gold pins with a slightly offset
knotch you'll see a matching notch in
the slot on the motherboard which means
they can only go in one way pop open the
clips on the side and then drop the RAM
in press firmly on both ends until it
snaps into place then just pop the other
DIMM in the same way and you're good to
go that's it for part 1 of this tutorial

leave this video a thumbs up and check
out part 2 which will be on screen now
