information so here are five tech meds
number one is that leaving your phone
plugged in overnight hurts your battery
it happens to everyone
you get home at the end of the day with
a nearly dead phone and leave it plugged
in all night so it's fully charged when
you wake up is this a good idea though
the short answer is yeah this is totally
fine
so phones are pretty smart about this
sort of thing as the battery starts to
fill up it automatically slows the rate
of charging for the absolute best
battery life charging a little bit
throughout the day will help keep your
battery healthy for longer if you want
to plug your phone in overnight it's
totally fine another phone related myth
is that you need to close apps on your
phone if you open up your multitasking
odds are you'll see a ton of open apps
but is this a bad thing not really
operating systems like Android and iOS
are really good about managing memory
unlike a computer that will start to
slow down if you leave stuff running
mobile lessons will automatically close
apps when you need more memory and
automatically reopen them when you come
back because of this having the RAM on
your phone full is actually a good thing
it means that you're taking advantage of
having as many apps ready to go as
possible sometimes you might need to
force closed a misbehaving app but
besides that let your phone figure out
what to keep open here's a classic one
you need an expensive HDMI cable we've
all been in a store and seeing this
super diamond ultra platinum mega HDMI
cables that run you a hundred bucks but
you don't really need these unlike older
video cables HDMI is digital this means
that the signal is 100% identical
regardless of what cable you're using
whether it costs five dollars or 500
don't fall for the marketing and more
expensive cable won't get you better
image quality either you get a signal
over HDMI or you don't the only time
we're spending the extra cash makes
sense is if you need a long cable normal
HDMI cables will be totally fine up to a
length of five meters
however higher-end cables can be as long
as 15 meters and these will cost you a
fair bit more for the vast majority of
people though you can safely avoid the
pricey HDMI cables and just get yourself
a cheap one next is the myth that all
tech specs are created equal when
shopping for a new phone or computer
it's easy to compare the specs on the
Box more is better right not necessarily
so I've done several videos on this but
you can't always take specs at face
value take for example my recent fastest
phone comparison on paper the Galaxy s6
with its eight cores should easily beat
out the iPhone with only two however an
actual
thing they were surprisingly close the
same thing goes for things like
megapixels sure more is better in theory
but a lot of the time a high megapixel
count can give you worse results than a
lower one don't get me wrong specs are
absolutely important however they're not
always as straightforward as they seem a
myth I hear a lot is that your computer
shouldn't run hot in a perfect world all
computers would run at room temperature
but in reality running warm can actually
be a good thing
with devices getting thinner and thinner
it's not uncommon to see processors
reaching 100 degrees Celsius a new
devices such as the new MacBook but is
it safe pretty much with no fan to cool
it the Intel Core M processor inside the
macbook relies on the aluminum chassis
to dissipate heat this means that the
hotter the CPU is allowed to be the more
freedom it has to write at a higher
clock speed this also holds true for
more traditional computers as long as
it's below the safe temperature limit
running hot often means you're allowing
the computer to reach the highest
performance that it can anon Tech did a
great test of this that shows how a
laptop that is tuned to run cool can be
much slower than one that's allowed to
run warm while cooler is usually better
modern processors are totally fine
running warm so what are some tech myths
you've heard let me know in the comments
below if you enjoyed and want to see
more videos like this definitely be sure
to subscribe to the channel anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
