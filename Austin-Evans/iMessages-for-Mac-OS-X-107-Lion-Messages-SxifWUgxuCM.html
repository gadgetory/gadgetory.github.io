here with the demo of iMessages for Mac
and know this isn't some hack or
anything like that this is actually the
full official messages that is available
from Apple now why do I mention this is
beta however after using it for a little
bit it doesn't seem to be too bad at all
and what it does is it actually replaces
I shed on your computer as you can see
here you can it pretty much rolls
everything into one so you can do
FaceTime iMessages and you also have the
old I chat so aim Yahoo Google etc etc
and this is only going to work on OS 10
ten point seven point three which is the
latest version of Lion so if you haven't
updated you're going to need to do it
but you can download the free beta of
iMessages rather it's just called
messages here but see if you guys a
little demo so overall it's very similar
to what you will find on iOS so you have
your you know your little bubbles and
you can also put your little profile
picture which is actually new so show
you guys that real quick here so you
just click change my picture and you can
see here you have the little slightly
scary-looking picture but you can take
it with your webcam which is actually
pretty neat anyway it's going to give a
little demo what's up now as you can see
here you do get read receipt so just
it's exactly like on iMessages on your
phone or of course on ipad or ipod or
whatever it works very similarly so you
have you know your read receipts and if
I want I could just say you know create
a new message and I actually really
can't show it to help because I have of
course I don't show my context and
everything but you can send a new
message to somebody but right now I'm
talking to tie a demo I know one kind of
weird thing I noticed is that it
actually sends the messages to not only
your Mac on the messages application but
it also sends it to any device you have
so for example my iPhone is over here
it's on silent but it's like going off
every single time I send a message or
Tysons me one back yeah seems to be
pretty good although I'm yeah there so
it's kind of interesting I definitely
like the idea of it of course I messages
I've actually been using it a lot since
I got iOS 5 and it really works really
nicely so anyway guys it's gonna be a
quick little video if you guys want
download for yourself again link will be
in the description of the video
pretty cool application if you used I
messages I highly recommend download it
give it a shot and of course stay tuned
to the channel I will be doing some OS
10.8 mountain lion videos various
guys we'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
