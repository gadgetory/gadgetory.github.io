here with a review of crow for the
iphone ipod touch and ipad crow is a
very different type of game than you
usually find on iOS with a heavy
emphasis on the setting and feel of the
game you play as a crow and the game is
split half into a free-roaming flight
mode and half into an on-rails fighter
while the gameplay is definitely very
unique the real drawers and the
fantastic setting and theme throughout
the game you'll find different
narratives which will explain a bit
about the story and try and convince you
to either spare or curse the boss of
that level while I'm free flight mode
you're able to look around at the level
4 destroy points along with trinkets
these allow you to upgrade various
skills such as shield attacks and more
and are quite important towards the end
you can also discover challenge maps
which can allow you to get more upgrades
as well as provide a fun little
diversion for you to get ready for the
boss fights as far as the core gameplay
goes on paper extensive Harry bizarre
but it's actually not bad the crow goes
on the rails and you're able to move it
by dragging your finger around the
screen sometimes you need to avoid
obstacles and collect power-ups but the
majority is the combat each enemy and
level is different but usually you're
either swiping to attack or drawing a
circle to form a shield all of the
season is magic which regenerates as you
fly and pick up the power-ups and how
you use your magic definitely require
some planning in the later boss fights
it's hard to bring a cross on video but
one of my favorite parts of crow is the
theme the graphics overall look great on
the iPad 3 is Retina display although
sometimes you can notice things look a
bit rough when it gets up close the
music is also just excellent
crow definitely isn't a perfect game my
first playthrough had issues that glitch
that made me force quit and I grind it
away at the final boss for over 20
minutes before realizing the way to win
is by using a mechanic the game hadn't
really even explained or used before on
the flip side the presentation was
fantastic for an iOS game and the entire
premise of The Crow was quite
interesting and kept me hooked all the
way through for the two hours or so it
took to complete it might not be for
everyone but I have to say the crow is
one of the best games i've ever played
on iOS if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
