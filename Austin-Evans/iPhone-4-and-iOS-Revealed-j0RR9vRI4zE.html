finished up and man was it filled with
stuff so guys first big thing actually
the only really thing they talked about
was the next iPhone it is the iPhone 4
yeah an iPhone 4G and iPhone HD the
iPhone 4 so guys know it's pretty cool
look I admit um in case you're wondering
all the leaks from no Gizmodo and all
the fake ones I mean that penguins those
prototype ones we've seen 100% legit
that is identical to what the iPhone 4
looks like but we have a lot more news
and it has been a really just hectic you
know two hours of watching it and so you
know they're adding more stuff and more
stuff but personally go ahead and
struggle with all things that were not
then no new carriers let's not get me on
Verizon's not against sprint it will
actually it looks like it will actually
now support t-mobile 3G bands but of
course you have to jailbreak on a lot
for that so and I got something go ahead
go through a few of the new things so
guys one of the major things is that it
is thin okay guys it is the thinnest
smartphone on the market and it's pretty
cool of course it's got the new squared
off design as well so it's a lot smaller
than the original but it still does that
the 3.5 inch display speaking of the 3.5
inch display it is now 960 by 640 I'm
just like everybody had predicted and
it's a very very high resolution screen
probably the moment the highest
resolution screen available on any phone
right now on the one they call they call
the Retina display and the reason they
do it is because actually the screen is
so high resolution that if they made any
more high resolution the human eye could
actually not see it it's pretty cool
okay guys so briefly going over the
specs they didn't really tell a whole
lot they didn't tell the RAM but they
did say that's have an Apple a4
processor but they didn't say what speed
it's at or anything like that
I assume it's going to be less than the
one Giga one gigahertz in the iPad we
don't know now another thing is that it
does have a gyroscope so along with the
gyroscope you have the compass and you
have excel longer it's going to be very
very precise somewhat similar to how the
Wii the Wii Remote and with the motion
plus it's got a lot of points in data so
as you turn the iPhone it's very very
precise now guys one of the bigger
things I thought was the cameras and
this whole situation
there's a lot of really cool stuff so
the first thing obviously is that it
does have a camera obviously it actually
has two the front-facing camera but what
gets that one a minute the back facing
camera is five megapixels that's not
huge but it is a very high it's very
high quality lens and it does shoot 720p
HD video at 30 frames per second which
is fantastic they showed some of the
video and it looks really good so really
guys this almost could replace the
camcorder is very very high quality but
the main thing is that iMovie is coming
to the iPhone fantastic in my opinion
it's not just like you know like cut and
paste a couple of little you know Clips
is full iMovie
I mean you go ahead and cut transitions
titles everything and the best part is
it actually will output 720 video so
guys is the full 720 video editor in
your pockets of the iPhone of course
they might take a very long time to
render these High Definition clips but
they show you a brief clip of you know
how a movie that have been shot on
iphone and edited and I move for the
iPhone and it looks really solid iMovie
will be $4.99 though so I don't I think
500 500 $5 will be definitely worth it
but we just have to wait and see no word
on whether this will be work on iPad or
any other device
we do know that just we'll be working on
the iPhone for now for well the part
that wasn't so great in my opinion it is
the front-facing camera in the
application which is called FaceTime
which is a really bad name but um
FaceTime guys this was probably the big
disappointment it's not amazing so
basically with FaceTime yeah it's like
no this is just like you expect you know
it's it's voice and video so you know
you're looking at the screen and you
know you see the other person but there
are some pretty big problems with it the
first of which is that it's Wi-Fi only
for now apparently it will be public
upgraded to 3G maybe next year but right
now pulling the work over Wi-Fi so
that's one big negative number two and
this one guys is the main problem for me
it only works from iPhone to iPhone ok
so if you have another iPhone for you
know like let's say a friend of yours or
whatever who is also on Wi-Fi
guys can talk but otherwise you can't
talk me on your computer or anything
else besides just on an iPhone 4 so guys
those two things alone that's that just
not that I mean that was the one more
thing he said and I don't know guys that
was not I was not impressed at all with
it if it was over 3G that'd be better
and if it wasn't just limited to an
iPhone if you could talk to you know
your friends or whatever on computers on
skype or stuff that'd be great so I'm
just hoping that there'll be a Skype
application that we updated that will
work for that ok guys so now we have all
that stuff out of the way let's get to
the big part the price is going to be
the same as on the 3GS it's going to be
a $199 for 16 gigabyte and $299 for a 32
gigabyte so depending on what country
you're in it should be almost the exact
same price now there are a couple of new
things that it does you can still get in
white but the big difference is it is
full white just like the prototypes we
saw it looks pretty cool I got in it a
couple other things are is that it will
be launched June 24th ok so guys in June
2014 go ahead and pick yours up in
addition you can pre-order June 15th and
I imagine this one will be one that you
will definitely want to preorder on guys
now the last thing was iOS yeah guys it
actually is called iOS now of course I'm
talking about the iPhone OS 4.0 but now
they've renamed it the i/os switch
between eye ads ipods iphones iOS imovie
i mean i don't know why they're getting
with this but iOS is going to be coming
out June 21st
three days beforehand and it's going to
be free for everyone but of course not
for the iPad it's not out of that for
that but the iPhone and iPod Touch 2nd
and 3rd generation and iPhone 3G and 3GS
you'll be able to get IOS for free
that's it that's a good change um they
actually released a gold masters so if
you're a developer you can go ahead and
download the final version right now
today otherwise you'll have to wait but
still guys iOS looks pretty decent
so guys that is my entire wrap-up of the
Apple WWDC event it was almost two hours
and they were constantly this left and
right I'm going to shoot like a new
guitar hero app which is actually
right now a lot of a lot of stuff such
as farm bills now on the iPhone but yeah
guys so I'm pretty impressed
iPhone 4 looks really really cool um so
yeah guys stay tuned I'll be probably
doing more videos about the iPhone 4
especially like jailbreaking all that
kind of stuff so yeah anyway guys thanks
