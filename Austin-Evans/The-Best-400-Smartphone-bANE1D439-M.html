$400 smartphone so ZTE reached out and
wanted to sponsor a no-holds-barred
comparison with the axon 7 compared to
some of the hottest new phones of this
year on one hand I have the 1 plus 3 now
there's been a lot of hype around this
phone and for $400 you could do a lot
worse I also have a little bit of an
unusual choice with the iPhone SE and
while this might look like a much older
iPhone inside it has a very modern
internals the thing that jumps out to me
most about the axon 7 is the seamless
curved back so this was actually
partially designed by BMW design works
and it shows it's a really interesting
look for a phone there are no hard edges
pretty much anywhere it wasn't that long
ago that even high-end flagships could
be sometimes made out of plastic looking
to use Samsung while these might be
mid-range phones the specs are
absolutely flagship class so the oneplus
3 as well as the ZTE axon 7 have the
latest Snapdragon 820 which will find
and furnish all the high-end phones this
year the iPhone is no slouch either it's
rocking the same Apple a9 processor
straight out of the iPhone 6s screens
are actually one of the biggest
differences between the three phones so
the iPhone has a much smaller and much
lower resolution 4 inch 11 36 by 640
display it's okay but really this is
straight off of the three-year-old
iPhone 5s ZTE opted for a 5.5 inch 1440p
AMOLED display and it looks great well
it might not get quite as bright as I
would like colors are great viewing
angles are great and that 1440p
resolution means it is incredibly sharp
the oneplus three has the same size five
and a half inch AMOLED display however
it's a low resolution at 1080p that by
itself isn't a huge deal well it's not
quite as sharp as the X on display it's
totally fine but the bigger issue is the
color accuracy the oneplus three panel
tends to be a little bit cool and the
colors just don't seem to pop the same
way as they do on the axon software-wise
one plus three it has a fairly close to
stock Android experience there are a
couple minor additions however nothing
really too crazy it's very much vanilla
Android the ZTE definitely does have
more of a scan which I'm usually not a
fan of however the Exxon 7 does it
fairly tastefully the iPhone runs iOS so
take it or leave it it's pretty much the
exact same across all iPhones another
big difference is audio so will the
iPhone and oneplus have a single bottom
firing speaker the axon has dual
front-facing speakers
it also supports high res audio as well
as it supposedly has a pretty decent
headphone yeah that's no joke as far as
cameras go this is another case where
these are absolutely flagships one thing
I've always appreciated about iPhones is
they're consistent if you take a picture
you're usually pretty much guaranteed to
get something decent it might not be the
best picture in the world but you're
pretty confident that you at least got
some kind of shots well plus three is
actually really sold this is a nice
sharp photo so one thing I've noticed
with the axon 7 is a while I can take
some really nice photos it can be a
little bit hit or miss sometimes this is
especially noticeable in video where
sometimes you can get really
cool-looking shots in 4k or even slow
motion however sometimes it doesn't
quite grab focus or it's just a little
bit off I really do like the axon 7 and
a big part of that are the speakers now
while they might not matter as much to
you as they do to me but having good
audio on a smart phone makes a big
difference it also helps that has a nice
screen good build solid battery life
there's not a lot to complain about
speaking of ZTE hooked me up with an
extra axon 7 to give away to you guys to
enter drop a like on the video and leave
a comment below and I will randomly pick
a winner two weeks from today anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
