state of jailbreak video so today I'm
going to be talking a little bit about a
couple of big things for one there are a
ton of big gilbert's going around and I
really want to warn you guys stay away
basically as a short life you guys know
as you know when jailbreaks come and
there's like a little lag period in
between jailbreak secular is now lots of
scammers lots of you know people just
kind of jump up go hey I've got a
jailbreak and then it's just a scam
maybe it's you know going to steal your
information maybe it's gonna just do
nothing maybe it's a virus you know you
don't know but guys I really want to
warn you away there are no current
jailbreak for 4.1 right now okay so guys
you know some of them oil rain totally
fake rainbow rain fake there's even like
there's a the green poison which
actually isn't real Jerry but somebody
bought the domain greenpoison dot info
and they're like hey come download the
jailbreak just fill out this little form
guys fake there is a real green poison
there is a real crying dev team who
actually is working on it however Perry
website is green poison calm not info so
josh is really be wary they're like I
said there is no current jailbreak for
4.1 there's out for everyone just yet
okay so you know if you're wondering
about any of those jailbreaks just don't
worry about they're totally fake and a
lot of them pretty much all the more
viruses or something nasty um so
continuing on though there actually are
some a few updates for you guys about
jailbreaking on 4.1 etc so actually
there is another program snowbreeze
actually will be ported to 4.1 in The
Fairly near future so guys I don't know
some of you guys my nose snowbreeze
which is a I custom ipsw builder it's
been around for a while and it looks
like it's going to be updated to work on
4.1 now guys it's it's still in the beta
stages but i believe it is working right
now so i'm not sure it might be fairly
close to completion so i can say guys
i'll try to keep you updated as soon as
actually is released to everyone i
actually don't have a list of devices
that will support on that
really sure i do believe most of the
older devices you know the ipod touch
2nd generation iphone 3g etc etc i think
those will probably supported i'm not so
sure if it will support any of the newer
models I don't think so but I'll like I
settled up and keep you guys updated as
far as that goes I'm so guys just want
to make this really quick video because
literally I've gotten so many comments
and messages asking hey there's this
jailbreak real hey can you show a
tutorial on how this works excepteur etc
and all of them are so fake and you know
viruses and all that kind of stuff so
really want to warn you guys away from
any of the geo brakes there currently is
no jailbreak for 4.1 it's available to
everyone okay I just want to say that as
many times as i can really tip so you
guys yeah i totally understand when
there is a jailbreak i absolutely will
cover i absolutely will put a video on
this channel i'll give you guys the full
tutorial all that kind of stuff so that
you guys go that it is real and all kind
of stuff so guys just want to let you
know that and also a little update
letting you know that snowbreeze is on
the way for some devices fairly soon as
well as of course the chronic dev team
which is working on another joburg for
all devices so the short of it is if
you're on 4.1 there is there are
multiple jailbreaks on the way so just
be patient don't fall for any of these
hacks and these scams and you will be
good to go anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
