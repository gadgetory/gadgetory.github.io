you how to enable animated boot logos on
your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad now the
way we're going to be using this is
redsnow now this is the updated version
of red snow from a few days ago when I
shouldn't you guys the tutorial so if
you've already run redsnow and we're
gonna keep that but if you've already
run redsnow then you don't have anything
to worry about you can just rerun this
over the top of it and all that will do
is enable animated boot logos so if
you've already done that good to go
otherwise i will give you guys a quick
tutorial showing you how to jailbreak
really simply as always you need to hook
your ipod iphone or ipad into the
computer and let it back up through
itunes and this is compatible with all
the same devices from the previous
jailbreak so it means the ipod touch 3rd
and 4th generation the iphone 3gs iphone
4 and the ipad 1 this does not spoil the
ipad 2 yet there's another jailbreak
coming for you guys so if you have an
ipad to just hang tight for a little bit
longer so let's go ahead and get this
started so two things we're going to
need as the ipsw for our device this
should be pretty simple especially if
you just did the redsnow jailbreak you
probably already got hanging around if
not check out the link in the
description i will have a link showing
you how to find it or download it
whichever you need to do you also need
to download redsnow which of course will
also be in the description so if you're
on Windows going to be really simply
need to right-click the redsnow program
and click on properties you need to come
over to compatibility tab and add it run
this program in compatibility mode for
windows XP service pack 3 now I did have
a couple of questions from the last time
now XP service pack 3 is what works best
for me however if that's not showing
under operating system or anything like
that feel free to try a different one it
should work the same way you can just
experiment around or case scenario it
just doesn't work and you just have to
restart it so not a big deal you also
want to run this program as an
administrator now this only applies if
you have Windows Vista or Windows 7
simply do keep that in mind so we're
going to run the program here and we've
you guys a quick little demo so just
like on the other jailbreak it's going
to ask those for our ipsw at this point
you should hopefully have it so we're
just going to have it process the
firmware really quickly here okay so
once it's successfully identify this
hour ipsw we can click Next
take just a moment to prepare the
jailbreak data will be good to go just a
really quick warning here of course just
to be sure before we go any farther you
should have your ipod touch iphone or
ipad plugged into your device all right
it is your computer and should be on
four point three point one it does not
matter if it was previously jailbroken
using redsnow or snowbreeze or not as
this will course like i said will run
over your previous jailbreak without
causing you any issues okay so once it's
finished you will see a couple of
options here now if you have not
jailbroken before be sure to check and
make sure that install city is checked
however if you already did install cydia
and you've already jailbroken we want to
unclip best so as you guys can see here
already have city installed so I'm going
to not install cydia again now there's
going to be a couple of other options
including custom bundle on a couple of
others however the what we're looking
for is allowed boot animation so as you
guys can see here you can install boot
animations from Cydia so we're going to
be good to go just be sure that you want
to enable this no matter what if you're
Jill which is this the first time you're
jailbreaking or you're just rerunning
this over okay so next we're going to
need to come over to our device and put
it into dfu mode so let me give you guys
a little tour on this here so with your
ipod or iphone of course you should have
it all backed up same warning as always
this you should not lose any data in
this jailbreak but there's always a
chance and if you have it backed up in
itunes you don't have anything really to
lose so what we're going to need to do
is have our device plugged in we need to
turn it off so by simply holding the
power button and then slide to power off
now what the one thing that a lot of
people have problems with is you guys
can see there's a little pin wheel
spinning wait until that pin wheel stops
in the screen goes totally blank
sometimes this just takes a couple of
seconds other times it can take a minute
or two so be sure they did is actually
off I bless you could run into some
problems as you can see here the pin
wheel is still spinning but we can just
give that just one second we can
continue on with the jailbreak okay so
now we need to put it into dfu mode this
is going to be a really simple procedure
to hold the power button hold the power
n home then release the power button I
know of course will walk us through it
so I click Next it's going to hold the
power button for three seconds we're
going to start holding the power and the
home for 10 seconds and of course the
countdown will do that so you guys can
just keep an eye on that and it'll will
walk you through it pretty easily and so
now we
remove the power button and continue
holding the home button till it says we
get the all clear it says 15 seconds
almost always it takes five or ten in my
opinion but they're real so now we can
let go of our iPod or iPhone and just
let redsnow work its magic ok so it just
finished so as soon as we're done you
should still see city and now appear in
your device or if it was already on
there you won't really notice any
difference over now you can download
animated boot logos from Cydia so anyway
guys that was a quick tutorial just
showing you how to do that yeah well
maybe was not such a quick tutorial but
not a big deal and if you want those
animated boot logos this is definitely
the easiest and fastest way to get them
