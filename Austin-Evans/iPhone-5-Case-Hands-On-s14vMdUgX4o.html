an iphone 5 case now i'm sure you guys
all follow the news and saw that we did
not get an iphone 5 and this was not the
correct design did we just did get me
for us what were I definitely think it
would be interesting to take a look at
what an iphone of this size would be
like in addition I kind of doubt this
design just appeared out of nowhere we
probably will be seeing it at some point
in the future so I think it'd be worth
it to go ahead and give you guys a
little overview of what the iphone 5
could have been like alright so so start
with here is the case itself now I'm not
so sure how well you guys can see here
but it does definitely have a paper
designs by refocus camera over here you
guys can see here is a bit thicker on
this and then this end but I will say it
is very very thin so if I bring in an
ipod touch case which of course is even
thinner than the iphone for you guys to
be able to tell that it is not so
straight away you can tell us see here
it is a bit thicker especially on the
end on another thing you can see is that
it is a lot bigger bigger obviously the
iphone 5 was supposed to have a 4-inch
display and a judging from this case i
can absolutely believe that so you know
just to give you guys a little size
comparison again ipod touch 4th
generation which would be even smaller
but as far as the screen everything else
goes is pretty much the same size and it
fits easily inside the case so i don't
have any problem assuming there will be
an iphone 5 or rather a 4 inch version
of the iphone 5 so rolling over on the
bottom here that really would have been
anything since it would be so thin i
imagine we just had the 30-pin dock
connector there may be a speaker or
microphone or something like that but
certainly would not have been very thick
at all over on this side you would see
the the volume rockers now i will
actually pull in my ipod touch here and
you guys buy again ghost camera you guys
be able to see that has these ipod touch
style volume rockers which i'm not the
biggest fan of i kind of do prefer the
volume on the iphone 4 however you know
not not the end of the world and i
suppose if they're really going for
thinness that wouldn't be a big deal up
top here you guys will be able to find
that there is the headphone jack I'd
entirely sure that could perhaps be a
microphone of some sort or something
else and you do have the sleep/wake
button and around on this side nothing
and on the
back you guys will be able to find that
there would be the cutout for the camera
as well as probably the microphone so
it's gonna be a bed and let me just give
you guys this little size comparison
again I'm going to be using an ipod
touch in this can't give you guys a good
idea so if I slide this in here you'll
see that the ipod touch has a lot of
room so you need to see the ipod touch
now it actually fits the the thickest
points just a little bit thicker than
the ipod touch but when you get down to
the narrower it is actually a little bit
taller so for an iphone to be about the
size and ipod touch as far as the
thickness goes as well as of course
having a larger screen you guys can see
here that there's plenty of room that it
could expand I think it's really
interesting so of course we don't
actually see this iphone 5 so you know
for all we know it may have been a rumor
but in my opinion it would did this
didn't just come out of nowhere you know
somewhere somewhere how an iphone 5 or
iphone 6 whoever did leak and that's why
all these case manufactures decided to
make cases so well of course it's not
going to tell us a whole lot about this
right now if you guys were in you're
curious about what the iphone 5 may be
like and of course with the iphone 6 or
you know if this design is real what we
may see you next year it's definitely
what you might want to take a look at
anything guys it's going to be about it
if you enjoy the video definitely be
sure to leave the thumbs up and if
