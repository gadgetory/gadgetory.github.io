but what is this is the MacBook Air why
does it still exist in 2013
surprisingly Apple released a new
version of the MacBook Air this week
it's a pretty minor upgrade but for
computer that's essentially been around
unchanged since 2010 that's not bad
what's interesting about the air is that
this is actually still one of the most
popular Mac's that Apple sells so well
they have updated most of the other more
modern Macs
I think a lot of people look at the air
and say yeah that's all I need some side
we get the air itself now to be fair
this design really has not changed since
2010 but it's still a nice looking
laptop so it's all metal and it's maybe
not quite as nice as something like some
of the newer Mac books but this is not
an old terrible piece of hardware at all
one nice thing that hasn't changed is
MagSafe so while there are a lot of
advantages to going with USBC and
thunderbolt there's something really
nice about having a magnetic cable that
if you say trip and fall over your cable
and yet I'm looking at you can
open up the air and you should see that
it looks very familiar
now that's not a huge downside so the
keyboard the trackpad especially the
build quality does feel good and
especially in 2010 this was pretty solid
but when you're buying a laptop that
literally came out today it looks
exactly the same as something that came
out seven years ago you've got a problem
the first thing that jumps out to me
when using this air is how bad the
screen is so well some things from 2010
hold up pretty well that TN panel
definitely does not so it is a 13.3 inch
display with a 1440 by 900 resolution
low but not the end of the world however
the color and especially the viewing
angles here are terrible I mean look at
this you can barely see it I get
straight you can kind of see it a little
bit but it's so bad like for a
thousand-dollar laptop this should be a
deal-breaker so to put things in
perspective this is the LG grant I'm
going to be doing a video on this soon
but this is also a thousand dollar
laptop and when you look at the screen
on this compared to the MacBook Air it's
not even close now if Apple wants to
keep selling the MacBook Air in 2017 by
all means go ahead there are legitimate
advantages to having a MacBook like this
still around but besides that they have
not updated the screen in this many
years and it looks this bad is crazy if
this screen was on a 200 laptop I would
complain about it on a thousand-dollar
laptop no to be fair it's not all bad
with the MacBook Air so this is the new
12-inch MacBook now this is kind of a
successor to the air and that is a very
small and thin laptop and when you put
it side-by-side with the air you'll see
that it is a much much smaller laptop
it's definitely not perfect though so
this is the USB C port well that's a
nice thing to have on a laptop it is the
only port on the 12 inch macbook now
that can cause some big problems when it
comes to using one single port to not
only charge the computer but connect to
an external monitor connect to USB
accessories it all has to happen to the
single port wears on the 13-inch air and
that is not a problem this guy has a
mini DisplayPort that also doubles as
sender bolt to a full size USB 3 SD card
reader and on the flip side you have one
more USB 3 port as well as the MagSafe
power adapter so while the MacBook Air
is not the perfect laptop it definitely
is not dongle life ready there has seen
update for 2017 but the upgrade is
incredibly minor so it's gone from 1.6
to a 1.8 gigahertz Core i5 processor
does the same egg whites of memory and
128 cakes of SSD storage what hasn't
changed is the actual processors inside
so the air is still rocking a 15 core
processor
whereas furniture all the mac books and
most Windows laptops these days on the
seventh gen it really feels like an
upgrade just to say hey look guys we can
put the 2017 badge on it now take a look
good performance and the air has
definitely fallen behind so not only is
it slower than the 12-inch MacBook which
has a much lower power core entry
processor it's also much slower than the
LG gram which is about the same price
but has a much newer Core i5 - beefier
performance is not the be-all end-all
for the MacBook Air one of the other big
advantages here is battery life so with
the way that the 13-inch is spiked with
its fairly large battery you should
expect around 14 hours on a charge which
is really solid the only issue is other
laptops such as the Graham have
absolutely caught up to that number one
area where the air definitely does hold
up is with the keyboard and trackpad so
the keyboard itself actually still feels
pretty decent i slightly prefer what you
get on the newer Mac books but I do
think a lot of people like the extra key
travel and the trackpad is good so again
it's not quite as new and quite as nice
as some of the newer force touch
trackpad well I still feel like this is
the better tripod than pretty much any
Windows laptop you can buy when it comes
to actually using the air it does feel
reasonably snappy so yes if you look at
it compared to something else on a
benchmark it's not going to be as fast
for more basic usage like web browsing
which honestly is probably what everyone
does on MacBook Airs anyway it does feel
pretty good the screen definitely does
let it down but besides that it's a
pretty solid machine the value
proposition with the MacBook Air is a
little bit weird so in one hand it's
$300 cheaper than any other maxes that
you can pick up on the other it hasn't
really been thoroughly updated in quite
a few years it also only comes with a
128 gigabyte SSD in the base
configuration now if this is just your
Facebook machine and sure that can work
out but other than that once you start
upgrading it it just doesn't make any
sense
the MacBook Air with a really impressive
laptop when it came out in 2010 however
if you're buying a new laptop in 2017 it
just doesn't make sense so what do you
guys think about the MacBook Air let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
