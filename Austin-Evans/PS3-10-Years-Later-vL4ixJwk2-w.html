years old so this is the og original
launched ps3 I got to say things have
changed and talked about a console that
was ahead of its time I mean the first
prototype for the ps3 they showed had
two HDMI ports at multiple Ethernet USB
I mean in theory if they actually went
completely insane you could have been
doing multiple screens of gaming with a
ps3 oh it's so heavy - so on launch day
there were two editions there's a 20
gigabyte version which was lacking a few
features such as Wi-Fi and this was the
full fat 60 gigabyte which had all kinds
of extra stuff and you know what this is
actually probably the best ps3 that they
ever made I mean there are extra stuff
like having memory card readers so not
only could you read SD cards you also
could do memory stick and even compact
flash on the launch ps3 there are also
other nice touches like having four full
USB ports which is actually more than
any PlayStation senses had and even
though this thing was a whopping six
hundred dollars at launch Sony was still
losing money on every single one they
sold so inside it was rockin the
brand-new cell check which in theory was
kind of like an eight-core chip but not
really it was a very unique architecture
and on one hand it gave the ps3 a ton of
power on the other though it made it a
lot more difficult to develop for which
especially with the Xbox 360 around made
a lot of games look not quite as nice on
the ps3 until much later in its
lifecycle one of the big advantages the
ps3 had over the Xbox 360 was the
blu-ray drive so 360 may do with
standard DVDs just like ps2 and Xbox
used Sony stepped it up with a full
blu-ray drive on the ps3 and even though
this thing was six hundred ollars at
launch that still made it by far the
cheapest blu-ray player you could get
when it came out not only did that mean
the ps3 was ready to watch HD blu-rays
right out of the box but also meant the
games could have a lot more space on the
discs in fact a lot of Xbox 360 games
ended up coming on multiple DVDs where
pretty much all ps3 games were able to
fit on a single blu-ray this really was
a very close console generation so the
Xbox 360 had some bandages but for
example it had memory card slots
whereas all ps3's had at least some kind
of hard drive on top of that this had no
Wi-Fi at launch whereas the ps3
did so there were definitely advantages
here however the ps3 also cost a couple
hundred dollars more than the 360 so
here we have the entire PlayStation 3
lineup and the thing is the original fat
one was kind of the best so while there
were some small changes on the slim and
the super slim like losing those extra
USB ports and the card reader but the
biggest difference was that the original
PlayStation 3 could also handle ps2
games not only does the fat ps3 have all
that power with the Cell processor it
also essentially had the guts of a
Playstation 2 inside so when you want to
boot up a ps2 game you're actually
running it on native ps2 Hardware now we
have SOCOM 2 so this is a ps2 game that
is running on the PlayStation 3 so the
first thing it does is it gives us a
upscale 1080p image so while it might
not be native HD or anything this looks
a lot better than playing on a ps2 with
something like a component cable one
very cool feature of the launched ps3
was a little actually compatible with
Linux so if you're on a version of the
firmware that's earlier than 3.21 which
this happens to be on and you can
essentially turn your PlayStation into a
computer to show what I was capable of
in 2010 the US Air Force took 1760
PlayStation 3s tied them together and
basically create a supercomputer these
things were no joke that means that the
launched ps3 is actually fairly valuable
as well there were some fad ps3's that
could do ps2 games via software
emulation by the time the ps3 slim came
out there was no way playing ps2 at all
of course it wasn't all bad the ps3 slim
was a whole lot smaller and a lot
lighter and importantly it was also more
reliable so while the original ps3's
were awesome they were a little bit
prone to failure certainly not as bad as
the Xbox 360 however the yellow light of
death was absolutely an issue for not a
ton of these still around then in 2012
they launched the super slim this was
pretty much the same thing as the slim
but it was just cheaper and had this
terrible sliding door for the discs not
the best upgrade 10 years later and we
had the new PlayStation 4 pro now this
is definitely a faster console it's
actually kind of impressive at how close
these are in a lot of aspects for
example they both still use blu-ray
drives and while the ps4 Pro is just
barely gotten beyond 1080p the original
ps3 still completely supported it
those graphics though so this is one of
the ps3 launch titles resistance fall of
man this was this was cool back in 2006
I mean even today it's not that bad sure
it's a maybe a little rough around the
edges but that okay one thing that is
ancient is that my triggers aren't
triggers this is how I crouch next we
have Need for Speed carbon so this is
another one of the ps3 launch titles and
again considering those chosen sticks it
doesn't look too bad so honestly I think
the big thing that really stands out to
me are not the graphics but the controls
um it's a little floaty err than I'd
like especially out of a racing game
however again doesn't 6 this is not bad
next we have Ridge Racer
so this is another one of the ps3 launch
titles and something that really jumps
out to me is that it actually looks
noticeably sharper than the others so
I'm not sure if it's necessarily running
at 1080p but I do think it's running at
least it's somewhat of a higher
resolution and it also takes advantage
of the sixaxis motion controls you can
see by my sick drifting skills oh is a
trip to dual wall so sixaxis was
essentially Sony's answer to the Wii
motion controls so while it wasn't quite
as full featured as the Wii Remote you
did get some sort of rudimentary motion
controls so you can see them steering
sort of decently here and Ridge Racer
it really wasn't picked up by as many
games but it was a nice gimmick to have
and now we have the last of us going
from the launch titles to this route
just goes to show how much horsepower
the ps3 had Meli's is a fantastic
looking game and honestly probably one
of the best looking games on the
PlayStation 3 period but it's also an
amazing title this might be one of my
favourite games of all time 10 years and
85 million consoles later while the ps3
might not have been quite as popular as
its predecessor it's hard to argue that
it's not one of the best consoles of all
time so what was the first time you got
to try a ps3 definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
