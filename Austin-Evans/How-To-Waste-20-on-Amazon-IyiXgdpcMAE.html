yet another episode of Ken wastes our
money on Amazon this time with an
impressive twenty dollar budget you
really kept yourself kind of in check
this time single hint this is a knife
where'd you get a knife for let me guess
when you've got twenty dollars to work
with you get a little violent
alright that's got some power I do have
to ask though how is this mystery tech
this is just really cool-looking knife
so if you're interested in the measure
one-handed opening knife how much was
this twenty bucks
a relative bargain item number two a
pillow new cosplay Ken what did you do
what did you do oh it's pink I don't
like pink we all know what's gonna
happen now right so Ken can I ask how
much was this twenty dollars yet again a
wonderful Kimberley to purchase that I'm
totally not regretting letting him use
the company card for what is our next
item you're just I'm trying now so we
can see this is a customs declaration
from Hong Kong post before I open this
ken can you confirm is this actually Tec
yet or no
you got me to Bitcoin how much were
these $20,000 their actual Bitcoin hey
Ken I got you a raise
it's one whole Bitcoin who said Bitcoin
wasn't real currency I'm sure you can go
in spin this at my local Bitcoin store
so we got a Bitcoin we've got our onesie
we've got a knife I'm afraid to ask
what's next
why are you bringing over Cheetos okay
the world's smallest vacuum okay this is
actually kind of tech how much is this I
think you overpaid you know we watch
these videos it's like oh how to waste
$60 on Amazon how to waste a hundred
dollars in Amazon you're like ha that's
kind of dumb but literally can wasted
all of our money on Amazon also I've
just gotta say that my ankles are
incredibly unhappy right now just
because like this is way too small so
just know that while I look ridiculous
up top downstairs
hole oh well I have cheeto all over my
hands oh well that actually kind of
works a little bit
this is my life now anyway I'd like to
thank you all for tuning in to this
episode of I don't know what happened
can probably has more products I'm
probably not done it makes me feel
better thinking that I actually might be
done with this video right now a
SmartWatch just when I think I'm about
to lose all hope Ken drops the hot new
tech on me how much is this 20 bucks
all right you know let's I like how the
Box just says SmartWatch as if you know
you need to know anything more than it
was a SmartWatch put this next to the
Apple watch though and you can see it
it's a little bit thicker
some might say alright our SmartWatch is
up and running wait what insert sim oh
oh we're gonna answer it similar 8'o
t-mobile we are up and online if I
online I mean we have a SIM card in as
$20 SmartWatch because we make poor
decisions
I guess Ken hit me with your digits
hello you are really quiet this is the
quietest phone call I've ever been on
you can hear me I can't understand three
words that you're saying right now
is the $20 SmartWatch good not
particularly is it better than the other
tech that King got for this video
absolutely
next item please okay
a mysterious black box that says sound
cue Oh a speaker all right oh that
actually looks kind of cool so it's all
metal around the outside you got a soft
rubber foot on the inside here's what
actually sounds like
you couldn't even plan this it's like
everything is either terrible it's a
joke from Ken or it doesn't work okay
we're back up I'm gonna try one more
thing I try one more thing because it
worked for a second it works for like
one second hey guys Austin and today my
mission is very simple to find the
weirdest tech of CES 2018 and I should
be pretty easy okay I'm a lot of weird
stuff here so the razor booth isn't
actually does work it just breaks that
for a few seconds okay guy well you
almost got it Ken you were very close
please tell me we're almost done because
this suit is incredibly warm I've been
informed that I need a laptop for this
particular product how much is this
seven bucks okay sounds better
that really yes Oh
so for some reason you've made it this
far through the video and want even more
feel free to subscribe to the channel
where ken can torment me even more with
this really really dumb stuff anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I'm going to go reconsider my life
decisions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
