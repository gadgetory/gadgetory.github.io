of coral motion studio 3d now this
program allows you to do some really
nice 3d animations and rendering so for
example if you're doing some intros or
whatever it's going to be a great way to
go so let's go ahead and give you guys a
demo now I'm a giant noob with this but
yeah if I can make something decent you
guys definitely can so we're going to go
ahead and create a d3 live intro today
we're going to go in just a few minutes
so it's not going to be a particularly
great but yet we'll see what we can do
alright so there's a lot on the screen
but what we're going to do is you're
going to take it step by step so the
first thing is we're going to insert
text which is up here on the top left
now here we can pick out our fonts and
our sizes and all that kind of stuff so
I'm just going to go ahead and type in
d3 live here and there we go so once we
have it here on our main screen we can
kind of rotate it and you'll see it in
full 3d space but we'll go ahead and
undo that get back where it was and go
ahead and get started so the first thing
is is the color I don't like that gold
so we can come down to the timeline
click the color and then we're going to
click the surface color and click black
that's typically what d3 live logo is so
it'll look nice and as far as this
background I'm not really liking that so
let's go to the background tab now
there's lots of different modes for
example if we just wanted like a white
background we could do that there's also
magic textures so we can do some magic
textures it was also gradients video and
image I'm just go ahead and pick out an
image I've already made myself a
gradient so we'll start with this
alright so this is kind of like the
beginning of it now what I want to do is
I want to create a 4 second intro so
down here on the bottom left we can
select the number of frames so since
this is a 30 frames per second intro
we're going to go ahead and make it 120
which equals 4 seconds all right so now
we have all the basics in place now
let's see what we want to do umm so I'm
thinking just as something really simple
is I want the d3 Live logo to zoom in
and do an entire 360 so what I think I'm
going to do is select the camera here
now from this we can select like
different sides if you want to look at
it from you know the back and the front
and all that kind of stuff but we're
just going to do something really
standard instead move this back so we'll
zoom it out um say fair bit something
like that
alright so now that we have this let's
go ahead and do some orientation so
right along here we'll select
the 30th frame or as close as we can get
and come up to the y-axis and type in 90
so as you guys can see here spins around
90 degrees and we'll just keep doing
this all the way through so we'll come
to the 60 degree and make it 180 and
keep on going to here do 270 and finish
it out with 360 degrees so make it just
do an entire 360 degree spin now as you
guys can see I'm using these the XY and
z axes of course if I want to I can
manually just drag it but that's really
precise it's a lot easier so let's go
ahead and click play as you can see here
looks like a nice smooth animation to
spin around all right so we're getting
there now I think what we want to do is
have it zoom so we'll come over to the
camera icon now at the beginning of the
timeline we have it you know zoomed out
so all the way at the end we can go
ahead and zoom this distance all the way
in so if we play it again guys and see
here it will be spinning and fly
straight into the camera so I think that
looks really nice now that's the basics
of it you see here took no time at all
and of course it's not particularly
amazing but not too bad now we can go
ahead and go into effects there are a
lot of effects and I'm definitely not
going to try to show you guys them all
but there are some cool ones so for
example let's do oh I don't know shadow
so we'll add a shadow here and we have a
shadow which I don't particularly think
that looks that great so let's undo that
we can also do fire so if I want a
flaming d3 live logo and of course of
course we need to fling d3 Live logo so
there we go we have a flaming d3 Live
logo actually actually looks really cool
but I think what we'll do is we'll just
do some motion blur just to kind of give
it a little bit more of a realistic
effect so it's gonna run a little slow
but that's just because we're of course
doing all this rendering in real time so
spin around and fly it straight into the
camera so that's going to be pretty much
it I'm pretty happy with that I think it
looks cool so let's go ahead and export
it out now there's a lot of options for
exporting your images or rather your
models so you can just export as in
video overlay you can export as a 3d
model so for example and all kinds of
different programs in fact I didn't clip
this on but we can turn on the and graph
so if we turn this on as and see it'll
actually be in 3d so if you do like
actual 3d work with your 3d models and
that's not confusing but I
do that anyway so we can also do some
just simple things like exporting it we
can export it to video studios so if you
guys use video studio Pro X 4 you can
just export it straight in there which
is pretty simple but we're going to just
do drill something really simple and
export as a file so we'll do a VI 30
frames per second it looks great to me
and we'll just do d3 Live logo and save
so you guys can see up top here it kind
of shows you frame by frame shows you
how long it's been going how long thinks
it has and all that kind of stuff
overall I don't think it turned out too
badly especially with a little bit of
background music or some sound effects
or something I think it'd be a pretty
decent intro for three or four minutes
of work anyway guys it's going to be
about it if you're interested in picking
up motion studio for yourself I believe
it's going to run you about a hundred
dollars or so which is not too bad and
there is a free 30-day trial which you
can test it out see if you like it and
all that kind of stuff anyway guys it's
going to be about it if you enjoy the
video definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
