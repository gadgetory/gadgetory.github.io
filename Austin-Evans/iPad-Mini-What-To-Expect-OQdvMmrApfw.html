here the what to expect on the ipad mini
so of course we've been hearing rumors
about the ipad mini for a very long time
right now however it's time to finally
go ahead and take a look and see exactly
what we're going to see probably in just
a couple weeks first of all let's answer
a simple question what exactly is an
ipad mini anyway every single ipad so
far has shipped with a 9.7 inch display
no there's nothing really wrong with
this size in fact it's perfect for a lot
of things it's not for everyone I mean
imagine if Apple only sold a 15-inch
laptop the general consensus is that the
ipad mini will have a seven point eight
inch screen now this is actually a good
compromise and it's actually quite a bit
bigger than what you'll find on other
competing tablets like the google nexus
7 and amazon kindle fire HD the ipad 3
is a great tablet however has its price
at five hundred dollars no matter how
great it might be there's always going
to be a barrier as far as people being
able to afford something like that
however when you start talking about two
and three hundred or tablets it gets a
lot better for a lot more people the
combination of a smaller size and lower
price point definitely makes sense for
an apple but if you buy an ipad mini
what are you going to be getting for
starters probably not a Retina display
the current rumors are pegging it to
have a seven point eight inch screen
with a resolution of 1024 x 768 this is
the same resolution from the ipad 1 and
ipad 2 and it will look slightly better
as it will be on a smaller screen but
don't expect anything to be challenging
your ipad 3 anytime soon internally it's
likely going to be very similar to other
apple products so from the iphone 5 will
most likely borrow the apple a6
processor along with a new lightning
cable and from the ipod touch and ipad
it will most likely use the same 5
megapixel iSight camera interestingly it
looks like Apple borrowed a lot from the
ipod touch while designing the ipad mini
so taking a look at it from the front it
looks like the screen is actually going
to take up quite a bit more space than
on the ipad give you a much smaller
bezel especially on the sides on board
the ipad mini should come with a version
of iOS 6 most likely iOS 6.1 with a
couple of minor improvements but overall
it's going to be very similar and used
compared to the current iPad at this
point just like the iphone 5 so much of
the iPad Mini has been laid the pretty
much the only thing we're waiting on is
Apple to officially confirm it already
we shouldn't have to wait long according
to a wall street journal apple's already
mass-producing the ipad mini and it
should be set to launch within the next
few weeks combine that with rumors of
the ipad mini event could be in as
little as a week and a half it looks
like we've got ourselves an ipad mini
anyway i'm curious to know what do you
guys think about the ipad mini
personally i'm excited about it i'm a
big fan of the Google neck
7 and a lot of that is just due to the
fact that I kind of like that size of a
tablet so I'm interested to see what
Apple gonna do with something just a
little bit bigger but again definitely
be sure to let me know what you think in
