best up to making videos don't delete
the channel one of those important
things is just getting the shot
so no matter what phone you have what
camera you have the important thing is
actually just gets a video yeah that's
the thing right there moving up to a
camera with full manual control and
interchangeable lenses though can make a
big difference the camera we're using is
the sony a6300
well it is a little bit pricey you do
get a lot of really nice features
including a small body and most
importantly a really nice-looking 4 K
image one of the big advantages of
shooting with a DSLR or a mirrorless
camera are those interchangeable lenses
so right now we're shooting on a very
wide 10 millimeter lens
however move over to this Sigma 35
millimeter lens and we're getting a
completely different look so the
background is much more compressed we're
getting a shallower depth of field now
the actual look you want to go for is
completely up to you with the ability to
change lenses can make a huge difference
to your shot shutter speed is also
important since video is nothing more
than a series of still frames playback
quickly to make it look like there's
actual motion having a little bit of
blur in between the individual frames
helps to really sell the effect so
typically you want to shoot at a shutter
speed that is double your frame rate for
example if you're shooting at 30 frames
per second you want a one sixtieth
cheddar same thing if you're shooting 24
like we are right now you want 148 or
150th on the shutter to get a nice
smooth effect this is what you don't
want to do so we're now shooting at one
500th of a second shutter and as you can
see the effect is a little bit choppy
it's just not a smooth video look next
we have aperture this is simply how much
light the lens is letting into the
camera so a wider open aperture means
that you're collecting more light it
also means that you're getting a
shallower depth of field by closing down
the aperture like we've done here we're
letting a lot less light in the sensor
now that can be helpful on a bright day
like today however on the flip side that
means that pretty much everything is
going to be in focus next up is ISO this
is digital gain so you can think of it
like the brightness culture in Photoshop
you can turn it up and you're going to
get a brighter image however typically
that means that you're going to also
have to trade-off with noise in a darker
area lower eyes those are basically
always better but sometimes you just
don't have a choice so with a newer
camera like this a 6 to 300 you're
getting
- shooting fairly low light with a
really clean image yeah I didn't
actually have a camera lifer started
making videos I took screenshots from my
iPod and I did app reviews so I didn't
actually have a camera until probably
like six months into my channel you get
started that's the most important part
all the crazy fancy expensive gear in
the world will not make the video for
you you still have to do it yourself
skills will come with practice
absolutely I'm staring at the microphone
right now something else is important is
audio so if you have good audio most
people probably aren't going to notice
however if you have bad audio it's
basically a deal-breaker to get better
audio you really do need to get an
external microphone so this is what the
end don't like on the a6 is 300 sounds
like it's sort of decent that's really
not ideal now you're hearing me on the
rode videomic go this is an inexpensive
mic that makes a huge difference and
they'll go on pretty much any camera
that has a mic jack another option is to
use voice memos on your smart phone now
this might seem a little bit goofy
however it actually works surprisingly
well now you are going to need to do a
little bit of work to sync the audio
after the fact and editing however it
can sound way way better than your
camera if you really want to go crazy
you can get a shotgun microphone so this
is going to get you the best quality
however also means that you need to plug
it into either camera with XLR ports or
an external audio recorder no matter
what you're using for audio you want to
be mindful of levels levels levels
levels levels so if it's too loud you're
never gonna get that audio back however
if it's a little bit too quiet you can
always bring it up a little bit in
editing and editing is one of the most
important parts of making a video there
are a lot of different editing
software's that you can use but these
are some of my favorites a great option
is DaVinci Resolve now this actually
started out as a color grading tool
however they've since add a lot of great
editing features and the best part is
not only is it free but it works on both
Windows and Mac another great option on
the Mac side is iMovie not only is it
free but it's a lot easier to use
especially if you're new to video
editing this is a great place to start
stepping it up
we have Adobe Premiere which works on
both Windows and Mac now this is a lot
more advanced you're getting more tools
but it's going to cost you last but not
least we have Final Cut Pro 10 which is
what I used to edit all of my videos now
this is Mac only however the advantage
is that the performance is second to
none
once you get into editing you're
probably going to want graphics and
that's where graphic stock comes in
we're awesome enough to sponsor this
video for example the beginning of this
video was shot in San Francisco so I can
go to graph
stock and pick out a royalty-free image
to use in my video without any to worry
about copyright there's more to it than
just stock photos as well graphic stock
has tons of other options including
illustrations and vectors which are
perfect for video if you're getting into
video you should definitely check out
graphic stock at the link in the
description or by going to graphic stock
