iPhone and iPod Touch games now of
course the herbs so many great apps and
great games in the App Store and
whatever a lot of time it can be a
little bit difficult to find them as
there are just a lot of really bad ones
in there as well so then I'll go ahead
and go over my top 5 and hopefully help
you guys find a couple of cool apps now
this is one of those really really
popular apps that you know it's
constantly in the top you know one or
two or three apps in the App Store
however something you guys probably
haven't seen it so I'll go ahead and
give you guys a little look at it I'm so
cut the rope is well just listen to the
name implies you need to go ahead and
cut the rope and feed the little monster
guide to go ahead and feed him at candy
so I'll go and just show you guys that's
a pretty simple game but it's very very
fun
basically what we're going to need to do
is we need to get this piece of candy
into that got a little guys mouth now
the objective is also you want go ahead
and collect with starters so don't drop
that go ahead pop of that and there we
go so a lot of these are easy but I do
get more difficult as you go along and I
believe there are quite a few of these
levels here so we're gonna go ahead
actually you cut the rope there's all
kinds of different things where I'm glad
just this one's a pretty easy one you
need to cut the rope as they go along
and there we go there's a lot of
different elements though you know
there's little things that blow you can
push it you know you don't wanna get
near the spikes so like I'm just like
that you don't want to do that I'm Jay
guys that's pretty much it cut the rope
it's a very simple app it's only a doll
in the app store so this is definitely
something that everybody should at least
go pick up you know it might not be the
most difficult game in the world but
there are so many levels that'll
definitely keep you entertained for
quite a while the second app is a boys
fix picks now if you guys have watched
my channel for any length of time you
know that this is one of my favorite
apps ever this is such a great game so
basically it's a puzzle based
accelerometer game it's rather an
accelerometer and paste puzzle game and
I get this right uh-huh
so basically the entire thing is jeans
go ahead and use Excel wrong so I did
you show you guys how to do this so
basically it's you know you entirely use
accelerometers you tilt the iPod or the
iPhone one more to the other you can see
here it actually gives a pretty decent
3d effect so it's going never go we get
this baseball that's all you do just
tilt it right honestly if we can go
ahead and get a little something
different here so that's not too bad I
think basically it's the key is really
simple short movements to I can get it
as you can see here it's pretty
cool-looking as far as the just the
great art work seriously
just such such fantastic looking pixel
based artwork there we go and there are
150 of these so here this is this is
more of a city sort of one I mean this
really reminds me is some of the old
games or rather some of the old books
like you know when you're in we're like
I Spy and stuff like that just with the
looks of the stuff there's so many
different things and really you know I
spend a lot of time just looking at the
night in trying to beat the puzzle just
trying to uh just enjoying than just the
great artwork I mean as you can see
they've spent a lot of time on it figure
this one out here usually the bet the
key to this really is to go ahead and
find like one thing like for example
take a look at liking of the elephant
and try to get it lined up and
everything else will kind of fall in
place so see here it's kinda hard to do
this through the camera but yeah I guess
something like that I guess I'm better
you guys can see here such a great game
avoid fakes picks quite definitely look
it up in the app store really a great
great game now let's go ahead and take a
look at another game that's not so
popular but definitely should be in my
opinion which is gal con labs now I've
been a huge fan of gone for a couple of
years now is one of the first apps I
downloaded on my iPod touch when I got
it and it's just continued to improve
and get better so basically it's a kind
of hard to game to explain to be honest
basically you have different kinds of
little planets and then you need to go
ahead using the touch controls and take
over the other ones so I'm go ahead just
pick crashes my favorite mode there are
five different modes but I want to show
you one here so basically we take this
and we can actually go ahead and sit
send our little spaceships that's go
ahead and you can take a zip make sure
you guys can see here but basically you
need to take your little spaceships and
and we're already failing but you take
the little spaceships and then you need
to go ahead and just move them across to
the different planets and then crash
mode you actually go ahead and you can
go ahead and actually they little ships
crash into each other so there we go
that was pretty simple let's go ahead
and do I got to the menu there are
several other ones let's see here let's
do billiards basically this is one where
all the plants are continuously moving
so I'm gonna go ahead just grab some of
these and the bigger planet that you
grabbed the more the faster it will
replenish your ships so go ahead and
just jump over here the billiards is not
my favorite mode just because it's kind
of a kind a little hard to keep track of
exactly what planets you're going to but
let's just go ahead and just send a
massive wave and we should be able to
win this pretty easy so you guys that is
gallon Labs one of my favorite ones
there's also a standard key icon you can
go ahead and pick that up as well but
one of the really cool things I won yet
that's what just jump out of here now
what other cool things it does have a
multiplayer and I won't show that but
multiplayer is even more fun because
you're actually against real computer
opponents it's ranked all kinds of great
stuff so guys definitely go ahead and
check it out in the App Store gaol
collapse the next game is mini course
it's constantly for the game I Dracula
if you've ever played that but
definitely with a very very cool look so
we're gonna go ahead and just play I
know I'm not gonna be very good just for
the NOI I can't hold it so I use my
fingers a little bit oddly but go ahead
and jump in so basically as you can see
here with let's do not even see what I
do just clicked so basically you just
need to run around hit whoa okay I hit
the wrong about to die but uh did you
see here normal it's a lot easier than
this but you need to go ahead and not
die for as long again Wow Oh difficulty
level oh yeah yeah so I'm dying already
basically oh man this is not good but
this game is a lot of fun you go ahead
and basically you can pick a different
weapons different power-ups and you just
need to avoid getting run into by these
guys so you just shoot them but you can
see the graphics are just excellent and
you know there's actually a lot of cool
things you actually unlock new
characters
whoa and I'm already dead so definitely
not go ahead hit a goat on the hardest
difficulty but that's a pretty short
look at mini Gore and again a really
really great game and I have a lot of
fun playing it so they Cal look at okay
so the next step I will be taking a look
at is real racing now if you're a fan of
any kind of racing games on you know
that maybe the PlayStation of the Xbox
or something like that then you will
absolutely love real racing this is very
similar to maybe like Gran Turismo for
the iPhone the iPod Touch so that's
going just without you talking let's
just jump right into a track let's just
pick first car up siding that mean -
well okay I got the wrong controls but
whatever basically it uses
accelerometers controls with some really
nice graphics and well I just like I
talked let's just go I just show you
guys how this works so the controls are
very customizable you can go ahead and
do gas and brake or you can have it have
it pretty much just steer you can really
have a lot of options here so let's go
ahead and jump in and you can see the
graphics are really really nice so yeah
I got the wrong control setup but
whatever so the controls work really
nice especially with the end cockpit
view and this is really hard to drive
through the camera but so yeah oh yeah
actually I went a little bit too fast
basically it's kind of automatically
brake and automatically hits the gas for
me I'm usually like to go ahead and you
know hold the left and the right on the
sizes of the screens go ahead and do
that but not a big deal it's a lot of
fun there's a lot of different cars that
you can get there aren't that many real
cars oblate the only one is just a
Volkswagen which I have here but there
is a there's a nice variety of different
races and different tracks and stuff you
can see here the gameplay is really very
solid the graphics are really just
excellent I mean close to PlayStation 2
I would say maybe not quite there but
pretty close and obviously you know it's
running really nice and smoothly there's
also a multiplayer quite a few different
options and oops didn't mean to do that
but yeah guys so there you go that is
real racing and that's actually gonna
wrap up my top 5 iPhone and iPod Touch
games so anyway guys go ahead and
definitely take a look at all five of
these Oh
have links and all that kind of stuff in
the description of this video so you
know you need to look up the names and
all that kind of good stuff you can find
it there anyway guys thanks for watching
