the top five holiday - are you doing I'm
doing your video it's my video okay
alright hey guys this is Austin and here
are my five top holiday tech gifts
sponsored by master on my was better
first up we've got the Traxxas Slash RC
car this thing is no joke
it's a 1/10 scale electric car that can
hit speeds of 30 miles per hour inside
you've got the straightforward remote
that handles steering and acceleration
in the car itself which is huge the body
shell is removable to get at the battery
as well as to adjust things like the
shocks under the hood it's all business
this model is two wheel drive with a
motor around back and big rubber tires
once you throw double-a batteries in the
remote it's good to go and it's fast
really fast
well they might not be quite as exciting
I've been seriously loving the great Oh
SRA de headphones these are handmade in
Brooklyn and just like the SR 60 es I
recently looked at they've got some
retro style which I personally like but
there's no arguing that they're super
well built the materials are basic and
even the ear cups are simple foam but
what you're paying for is the audio
quality there's something special about
the sound from these not only is there
great separation between the instruments
but they've got a very classic warm
sound part of this is because they have
an open back design it helps to give
your music a more wide-open field but
that also means other people are
definitely going to hear what you're
listening to
for the price though they're absolutely
my go-to headphones next we have the
gaming PC combo the LG 34 inch ultra
wide monitor and the desk keyboard for
ultimate unlike most displays this is
not only ultra wide but it's also curved
with a resolution of 34 40 by 1440 this
is an absolute monster it almost feels
like a pair of normal monitors put side
by side without the ugly bezel in
between this makes it cool for gaming
too you get an extra wide field of view
for a more immersive experience and the
panel itself is awesome with great color
and viewing angles it's got plenty of
inputs as well including DisplayPort to
HDMI and Thunderbolt to complete the
combo we've got the Das Keyboard the
first thing you'll notice is the total
lack of lettering on the keys this is
using a keyboard on expert mode like
you'd expect with a das keyboard it's
well built and this model is rockin MX
Brown mechanical key switches it is a
bit weird to use a keyboard without
labeling but it's actually not too bad
once you get used to it and it's got
dedicated audio and media controls on
with the pair of USB 3.0 ports on the
back we've also got the nikon d750 wild
mirrorless cameras and even smartphones
have made huge gains in the last few
years there's still nothing quite like
shooting with a beefy DSLR you get a ton
of accessories including a strap
external battery charger and of course
the camera itself even paired with a
fairly basic lens it's got a satisfying
heft in the hand and as a more pro
oriented body you've got plenty of
buttons and controls in addition to that
24 megapixel full-frame sensor it's
capable of pulling in some fantastic
images which shouldn't be a huge
surprise the default picture profile is
fairly aggressive but in addition to
tweaking the JPEG processing you can
shoot RAW and adjust the images as much
as you'd like 24 megapixels might not be
anything crazy these days but it's still
a ton of detail and with that full-frame
sensor there's a lot of depth of field
available it also has a decent
the mode it's capped at 1080p but you've
got a flat picture profile option they
can help you pull everything you can out
of the image my buddy John and I teamed
up with mass drops to not only give you
guys a couple great videos but also to
do a giveaway mass drop is an online
community where you can get tons of
killer tech deals so if you guys want to
win everything in this video as well as
in John's video all you do is make sure
you're subscribed to both here on John's
channel and go sign up for Matt's drop
at the link in the description anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
