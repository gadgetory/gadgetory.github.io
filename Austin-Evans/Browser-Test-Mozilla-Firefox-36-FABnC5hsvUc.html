browsers around it combines a huge and
full featured ad on catalogue decent
performance and has more users than
safari chrome and opera combined now on
its 3.6 release it adds built in one
click theme support slightly improve
performance and a host of smaller
changes using the SunSpider JavaScript
benchmark firefox 3.6 comes out behind
opera Chrome and Safari but still far
ahead of Internet Explorer 8 the same
holds true we look at the Mozilla dromio
benchmark although once again it hangs
only a small amount behind the rest
looking at Celtic Kane's test firefox
lags much farther behind than the
previous scoring less than half the
points the chrome did in google's v8
benchmark it also falls behind by a
considerable margin although it doesn't
do nearly as bad as the graph makes it
look moving to the acid three tests
which doesn't focus as much on outright
speed firefox 3.6 narrowly misses a
perfect 100 school instead nudging a
still impressive 94 using the
Peacekeeper benchmark a great overall
browser test brings together the
browsers nicely with Firefox Safari and
chrome all very close for second place
so while Firefox may not be the fastest
browser that's only part of the test
starting out the browser is always a big
indicator of overall speed and here
Firefox does a decent if not spectacular
job from a cold start which is an
indicator of how long it will take to
load with the computer just booted
Firefox opens in a bit under three
seconds which isn't too bad at all the
warm start simulating restarting the
browser after it has been opened
recently isn't quite as impressive but
it still gets the job done in under two
seconds when you get into memory however
is where Firefox really shines
with only a single tab open it takes a
bit more memory than safari and internet
explorer but once it's been loaded up
with eight tabs it's only uses a bit
more memory than chrome uses with just a
single tab for over or low ram computers
this is great and will definitely make
your life a lot easier Firefox is a
browser that is something that you just
can't judge off the bat by default it
doesn't look that great but with the
belt end personas support you can
instantly try out thousands of different
themes performance is on top of the
class and yet it certainly gets around
just fine and the speed difference isn't
entirely obvious while it's customizable
just like chrome and opera instead of
being just a nice to have thing you
basically entirely customize all aspects
of Firefox with its excellent add on
site you can download themes flash
blockers weather checkers email clients
and much much more Firefox is a great
browser it works well on all platforms
including Linux and Mac if the level of
customization is really really solid the
only thing is holding it back here are
at somewhat dated interface and only
decent speed there's no denying that is
a great browser and its place in the
finishing order has less to do with
Firefox as faults that does that the
other two browsers are just so good that
said firefox 3.6 brings back a
third-place finish now feel free to go
back to the main video via the
annotation on your screen to see how the
rest of the browsers did
