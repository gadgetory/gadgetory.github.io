tech is featuring a watchband for air
pods the perfect friend keep your air
pods and the allow go wrist fit easily
and securely so the idea here is that
this is an Apple watch band that you can
also use your air pots with okay well
yep that's about as straightforward as
it gets
can you take this part oh wait I don't
need to use this what I just put this on
the Apple watch band yeah I don't know
why they include this but whatever we're
gonna ignore that I'm gonna put this
back on my watch
so if you really want to show off how
big of an Apple fan you are that's a
look so you can you know be listening to
music on your watch running sort of like
in a super cool hip Apple ad you know oh
wait a minute I want to take a call
alternatively if you don't have an Apple
watch you can use this as a standalone
accessory to make sure that your air
pods are nice and secure on your wrist
what is this is it why is this on
Japanese oh it's 2680 yen
oh yes you got this in Japan so it's a
speaker for the switch okay
really so it's got a USB C port on the
bottom which I assume you just dock a
switch in but it's also got a headphone
jack and it's also got a USB C for power
and so if the speaker plugged in I can
drop the switch on and it will charge
the switch so that's nice and then if I
plug the headphone jack in I guess we're
going to have audio you jump into a game
and see oh that's actually pretty loud
alright so I guess if you're in Japan or
you can pick this up for like 25 bucks
it works I mean it does exactly what it
promises it's just a little bit of a
weird concept
ohhh-kay the surface suddenly appeared
and I have this mysterious white package
not good probably tap wearable keyboard
and mouse
this looks really dumb oh wow it's just
straight up like a bunch of little like
ring looking things so you're supposed
to put this on your hands and then it
looks like these are all actually
connected so it's more like a glove I
would generally do not understand at all
how this is going to be a keyboard and
mouse but okay so I am paired now let's
see if I can actually type something so
okay vibrated but not typing we're going
to abandon the surface and try to use
this on my phone whoa okay that actually
does go to work so wait hang on so my
first finger is s wait su shoe who you
oh oh oh I T whoa hang on wait so two
fingers oh whoa Wow you've got to
relearn the entire alphabet and where
everything is the way this works is it
has accelerometers in each of your
little finger ring things so as I type a
letter and theory it picks it up it
actually doesn't seem to be too far off
but you've got to completely relearn
where every single letter is I will say
I kind of get it but for $180 you'd
better be seriously committed to
relearning everything that you've ever
learned about typing and you know
looking cool okay the wired controller
light for PlayStation 4 this is actually
something we saw when we were doing
mystery Tech in Taiwan last time and I
really wanted to pick it up but uh Ken
didn't let me now I see why the idea
with this guy is that it is a much
smaller PlayStation 4 controller so as
opposed to having this sort of standard
controls and especially the standard
grip instead you're gonna get something
that's going to be a lot smaller all
right well that's a cable but what we're
getting here is a very very unique
looking controller I mean look at that
for way less than half the price of a
normal ps4 controller as long as you
don't mind it being wired and at least
really long wire so what you're getting
here is definitely a little bit of a
different button layouts so we have our
touchpad button which functions as a
single button but we've also got our top
triggers and pretty much everything
where you would roughly expect it except
it's just much much tighter I will say
for my hands this feels a little tight
like I definitely sort of them kind of
got that claw grip going but okay I was
like pretty good I was pretty good yeah
I've got to say me it's actually an
interesting little controller especially
if you're able to find it and I'll do my
best to find an amazon link for the US
here in the description actually not a
bad little pickup I think it's all just
about as good as I hoped it would be
okay so this is a package from dangerous
things no for real I mean actually the
box says dangerous things on it this is
a viewer submission oh sweet
wait no that's right a bad thing right X
nti injection kit what hi is this a joke
box because this looks a little
suspicious like the printing is like
super low quality Oh next level human
augmentation oh oh I know what this is
is it one of the things that you implant
and yourself to like it's like a little
NFC tag oh no no I'm not doing this I'm
not doing this oh no oh yeah before
opening the seal polar bag visit our
instructions on how to inject yourself
dude no absolutely not no way oh look at
this
whoa it's like a giant medical pad for
when you bleed all over the place
Wow so I've seen a little bit about
these the way this stuff works is
there's going to be a tiny little NFC
radio and that if you're really serious
about this kind of body hacking stuff
you could inject it into yourself and so
say it's like underneath your skin on
your hand or something you could use it
to say unlock your phone or I guess I'm
like your but actually what are they all
they say yeah like house key computer
whatever the case is but essentially
it's like having an NFC tag inside your
hand nope nope nope nope nope nope nope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
