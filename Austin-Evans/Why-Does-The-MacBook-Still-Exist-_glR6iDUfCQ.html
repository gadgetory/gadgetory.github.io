MacBook and when it came out back in
2015
it wasn't exactly received very well
which begs the question why does this
still exist in 2018 or 2019 I guess the
biggest issue with this machine has
always been the single port the USBC is
great but the issue just like I said in
my original 2015 video is that a single
port means that you were stuck forever
as a resident of dongle town yes my
friends dongle town is right down the
road from garbage town and just a little
ways away from knotch City know these
days USBC has become a lot more popular
so a lot of accessories do support it
natively but the problem still here is
if you want to do I don't know something
like plugging in something as well as
using a charger at the same time you
just can't do that without a dongle and
that's simply not an issue that you have
to deal with on other Mac's or well any
other laptop you buy like literally any
other laptop complicating all this is
the current Mac lineup so we have the
12-inch MacBook the 13-inch MacBook Air
as well as the 13-inch MacBook Pro
without touch bar all these systems are
almost the exact same price they share a
lot of similarities and it just doesn't
really make a lot of sense right now my
friend Quinn from snazzy labs did an
excellent comparison between all three
which you guys should definitely go
check out but the gist of it is is if
there's a lot and come with these three
laptops which kind of means that the 12
inch is the odd one out now that doesn't
mean that there are no advantages to
using the 12 inch macbook first of all
this is one of the thinnest and lightest
laptops that you can buy today full-stop
there is something to that we have a
full-fledged Mac OS running here on a
laptop which is really about the same
size as an iPad it also has the
fundamentals down not like do you have a
very sharp and accurate screen but you
also have one of the best touch pads in
the game the speakers are there the
battery life is pretty solid I mean a
lot of the main things that you look for
in a laptop aren't here and accounted
for with the 12-inch MacBook that is
until you look just a little bit closer
the keyboard for example is the older
style butterfly switches and while
they're fine the new ones in the MacBook
Air and I only feel a lot better but
they're also more durable the webcam is
also famously potato quality with a
whopping 480p resolution
I'm not really sure why they still exist
in 2018 or 2020 the performance but this
is a family laptop which is a big reason
why it is so tiny but because of that
you give up a fair bit of actual speed
so with especially that quarter in three
model it's fine for a lot of basic use
so if you want to do web browsing and
maybe a little bit of very light audio
and video editing it's fine but anything
more heavy it does start to chug a
little bit on this guy put this all
together unless you just have to have
the smaller size the MacBook doesn't
make a ton of sense right now that got
me thinking though I had a little chat
with my buddy John about what exactly
the feature might hold for the 12-inch
MacBook this is my friend is a 12-inch
MacBook are you familiar with such a
wonderous computer is this what they
call it Mac that's what they call Mac
where do you think about the MacBook
where it is today like as far as the
12-inch MacBook it's been updated a time
or two over the last few years but for
the most part this is pretty similar to
what came out in twice extreme or 2015
right well yeah it's not been updated in
a while I think it should be 12-inch
MacBook yes 13 inch MacBook Air yes
get rid of the MacBook Pro without touch
bar yeah and if you want a MacBook Pro
not that the touch bar is what you know
separates a pro the quad core does
that's what the big deal is that's what
people miss a lot of the time is that
the 13-inch MacBook Pro without touch
bar is dual-core do you remember when
they announced the non touch bar MacBook
Pro they're like this is great for
people who are upgrading from an air
like they specifically called out is
like the air replace yet and I think
that was like that takes place of the
air it's just I think old smell they
realize it's the stupid name people for
vanity or for whatever it is they want a
MacBook Air yeah what do you see as the
future of knowing the Mac but
specifically what do you see is the
future of the 12-inch MacBook because I
really do feel like this doesn't make a
lot of sense to buy right now like I
feel like this is way too close to that
MacBook Air and to that Mac Pro Apple is
playing the long game and they're okay
with making short-term sacrifice in
regards for the future so the iPad pro
is this magical life-changing device
that you might go sell everything for
why that's why I'm excited is because it
plants a seat for the future so I think
that's like seed one which sets the path
for this I feel like everyone's so stuck
in the past of like wool x86 is a
different
platform it's never gonna happen but why
do you want to stick in an archaic
system if you look at where x86 is
attractive in the last few years we've
gotten performance improvements but they
then you know 5% here 10% there whereas
you look on the arm side specifically
with what Apple's been doing with their
a-series processors it's like oh look
20% 50% 100% there's these massive
performance gains to the point where I
would think that in most any way you
measure it in MacBook a 12-inch MacBook
is not as powerful as the 8 cores that
are inside that iPad right you've got
that GPU I mean there's a ton of power
there people always say why doesn't
Apple put Mac OS in the iPad one if they
did that it has to be x86 and they would
just erase everything that's in the
future yeah - you know the other thing
is why don't they put their pro apps on
the iPad why why don't they do that give
me final quick gimme logic I guarantee
you they have a Final Cut version that's
ready to go on the iPad I guarantee you
they have logic but they don't need
Apple to put their apps on they need
everybody else in like Photoshop coming
to arm is huge and the interesting thing
is like right now they're already doing
like a hint of the future where like
their t2 chip or whatever like it is
doing Co processing along with Intel
very good point I guess my thought here
is it with the 12-inch MacBook this
seems like the prime candidate for it to
be like the very first Mac will be
powered by an apple a 12 or a 13 or 17
whatever the case is but an apple
processor again
Apple is playing the long game
short-term sacrifice long-term game you
guys want to know more from John he has
an entire series about why the iPad is
the greatest invention known to mankind
used by professionals of all sizes and
shapes and you can go check that out I'm
gonna go back to talk about max though
can I shoot one of your videos and edit
it on the iPad pro yes you can't
actually that would be great yeah I'm
gonna do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
