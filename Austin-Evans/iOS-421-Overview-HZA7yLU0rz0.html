hands-on of iowa's 4.2.1 Inez has just
been released I've had a little bit of
time to go ahead and mess around with it
and tested a little bit and ready to
give you guys my full overview so of
course 4.2.1 is not going to be a huge
update yeah it's mostly just a lot of
smaller things i've something a lot of
it though is really catered towards the
iPod Touch 4th generation in my opinion
just because it has a lot of speed and
stability improvements that we're kind
of lacking in the previous 4.1 so let's
go ahead and jump right on into what all
of this new let's go ahead just open up
the web browser and one of the biggest
things is absolutely going to be air
print and now air print is something
very similar simple rather you can go
ahead and print any web page just
straight from Safari to your
airprint-enabled printer now I do not
actually have one of these printers so I
actually can't vouch for how well it
works although there are very few
printers that are supported and I go
ahead and kind of a little bit of
hacking page to go ahead and enable some
other printers but I haven't gotten into
that so - I can't tell you over I can't
show you how it works I'm so I'm go
ahead just go look on this page and do
keep in mind this works on you know
pretty much any webpage don't worry you
know obviously probably want to print
out something a little bit better than
this but to go ahead and enable it all
you have to do is press down here and
you know you get your standard things
such as add bookmark etc well for now
you have an option called print now in
print this is pretty simple you know I'm
gonna go ahead and click this obviously
like I said I don't have any printers
hooked up so normally you will go ahead
and just select your own thinking why
didn't you select how many copies you
want and then you just click the print
button very simple but it's a really
cool idea to go ahead and allow you to
go ahead and print web pages straight
from your iPod touch your iphone and
especially your iPad the next thing is
airplay now airplay is a very very nice
concept there's not a whole lot you can
do with it right now however I
definitely see layer on this is going to
be a really nice feature
basically what airplay does is it allows
you to shoot music movies as well as
photos from your iPod your iPhone or
your iPad over to a connected device now
right now pretty much the only thing
that you can do this with is the Apple
TV you can also go ahead and string
music through an airport express to
speakers but like I said Apple TVs
to be the main way to do this so it's
pretty simple you can just go ahead
there's a button and a video go ahead
and show it because there's not a whole
lot to a point to it however airplay
will definitely be very handy once there
are a lot of the devices that it does
support now let's go I move on to
probably my favorite feature of 4.2.1
which is speed improvements so here's an
iPod Touch 4th generation I just open
the camera app and you can see boom
already opened now I'm sure you know if
you have an iPhone or an iPod Touch 4th
generation you know that the camera app
always takes very very long time to load
and indeed everything is very quite very
very fast so you know go ahead and just
scroll through here through the Apple
website you know safaris just as fast as
ever you know I'm really impressed with
how the speed improvements because
especially with the iPod Touch 4th
generation before hand there were a lot
of there's some bugginess there's some
lag especially there's a lot of lag when
opening some applications however for
the most part I've seen that is pretty
much all been erased in 4.2.1 everything
was run very nice and smoothly and then
a small new feature is that the addition
of a volume bar so as always you have
you know when you double tap to enable
your multitasking know through your open
apps go ahead and you know I have a
YouTube video I could be playing it but
the cool thing is you can now go ahead
and control your volume again not a huge
deal I prefer to hear you use the button
probably most of the time so it's
definitely a nice little feature so
that's it for my overview of iOS 4.2.1
it's a nice update especially if you
have the iPad which of course it comes
with all the iOS 4 features but for the
iPhone the iPod touch not a huge deal
airplay and air print are both nice
however they're both fairly limited
I mean airplay if you have an Apple TV
that's great but otherwise there's not a
whole lot you can do with it and same
goes with air print unless you wanna get
into hacking and everything unless you
have a very few a small amount of
printers that it does support you're not
going to be able to use either so and
not a huge deal however it's absolutely
worth it from my point of view just for
the speed and stability improvements but
like I said my runs much faster
everything seems quite a bit snappier
which I am very very thankful for
standard warning if you do jailbreak
stay away from this there will be a
jailbreak I'm sure very soon but as
always if your jailbroken
any update you will lose your jailbreak
and you might not be able to get it back
for a little while so you guys
definitely keep that in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
