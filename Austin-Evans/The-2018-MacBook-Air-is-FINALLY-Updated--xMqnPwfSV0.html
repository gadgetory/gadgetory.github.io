Brooklyn Apple announced two brand new
Macs a Mac Mini as well as a completely
refreshed MacBook Air which is helpful
when you know you don't update your
computers for a few years the last
MacBook Air was a big deal it really did
change with the way a lot of laptops
look and feel even to this day and
thankfully we actually finally have a
modern version of it you know it's got a
Retina display like every other laptop
has had for the last few years with a
13.3 inch 2560 by 1600 resolution
this looks leagues miles light years
weight way better than the last
generation MacBook which still had a low
resolution TN panel honestly that was
the biggest issue with me with using the
MacBook in 2018 it just looks so old and
dated and has thankfully been fixed this
year the rest of the laptop looks a lot
like a mixture between the 12-inch
MacBook and the 13-inch MacBook Pro on
the left side we do get Thunderbolt
three ports we have two of them which
are thankfully both fully enabled unlike
the standard 12-inch Maxwell quit only
has USB C and on the right side we still
have
the headphone jack that joke will make a
lot more sense if you watch our ipad
video which is live on instagram TV
right now which thankfully are
unthankful e dropped to the headphone
jack for some weird reason you go check
that out like in the description or
things a little bit more interesting is
when you look inside the macbook so now
we have a single option for a cpu it is
an eighth generation Core i5 processor
however it is fanless with only two
courses of posta quad cores like most
other systems
now that is largely due to the fact that
this is an incredibly lightweight laptop
but still doesn't really give you a lot
of options the MacBook Air is not going
to be a powerhouse anytime soon the
trend continues when you look at the
rest of the options there are very few
different configurations of the MacBook
Air so it does come in three colors
silver Space Gray as well as gold but as
far as actual specs go you've always got
that Core i5 and your only real options
are either 8 or 16 gigs of ram and
somewhere between 128 gigs of storage
all the way up to 1.5 terabytes
can we talk about that for a second
though 128 gigs of storage that's just
not enough in 2018 and sure if you use
this as a glorified netbook or something
that's very very sort of focused I guess
on web browsing I know why would anyone
I can't even come up with the reason why
anyone would wanna hundred twenty eight
gigs of storage the worst part is it's
still $1,200 with that 128 gig SSD you
want to get something a little bit more
usable you have to step up to the 40 on
a dollar which does have 256 gigs of
storage take a look at the keyboard
trackpad speakers and this will look
very familiar if you are used to the
13-inch MacBook Pro so it does have the
new third-generation butterfly switches
they still don't feel amazing but at
least these shouldn't get all jammed up
with like dirt and dust and stuff and
the tripod as always is pretty much as
good as it gets I wasn't able to try the
speakers in the very loud hands-on area
but again if it's anything like that 30
inch it should sound really nice also I
forgot to mention it does come with
touch ID so it's built into the power
button but it does not have the touch
bar like the larger MacBook Apple still
claims a full 12 hours of battery life
which should be pretty accurate the old
MacBook Air was definitely an endurance
champ and beyond that the actual size of
the laptop has gotten a little bit
smaller and it actually is noticeably
lighter which is impressive considering
that the old MacBook Air was definitely
light already
these MacBook Airs are available for
pre-order starting today and they will
be going on sale on November 7th
starting at that sweet sweet price of
$1200
yeah they also still sell the old
MacBook Air - if you really want to go
old school or spend less than thousand
there are a lot of rumors that this
MacBook was gonna be cheap right people
are throwing are like 800 bucks or a
thousand 12-under dollars is not a crazy
price I mean it's better than the old
MacBook it's just a little disappointing
to not see it just a little bit farther
down the range probably because the
thousand dollar price point is now taken
up by the bigger iPad pro so that's
actually to be fair it's probably more
powerful system moving on to what
actually might even be more exciting for
me personally is the brand-new Mac Mini
if you take a look at it on the outside
it looks basically identical and that's
true because the chassis hasn't really
changed besides they've changed the
color over to space grey on the inside
though this is a way more exciting
system so you guys will remember our
last video on the Mac Mini you'll know
that it was a little bit underpowered
because it was essentially a MacBook Air
and a shell however this year we've got
actual full desktop processors so it
starts out with a quad core Core i3 but
you can option this out with a core i5
or Core i7
both of which have six cores to work
with that's a lot of power for a little
tiny Mac Mini can you feel my excitement
because I'm ready the extra power makes
a big difference especially considering
that there's a lot of other properly Pro
level features that you can get with the
Mac Mini so starting out with it does
have four Thunderbolt three ports so you
can easily connect an external GPU so we
did see a have a demo of Final Cut
running really nice and smooth with the
full six core processor tons of memory
and that external GPU but on top of that
we've got some serious specs - 64 gigs
of ram and 2 terabytes of SSD are all
options and if you want to go full Linus
tech tips on it you can option the Mac
Mini with a 10 gig Ethernet port which
is kind of a big deal so by the standard
it does have a one gig port as well as
two USB a a HDMI and those four
Thunderbolts but for a hundred dollars
to upgrade to 10 Gigabit Ethernet that's
a really big deal I know personally for
us we're totally going to be using this
as our ingest station to be able to now
a backup footage but also to dump it to
our server just like the area the Mac
Mini is available for pre-order and you
can pick it up on November 7th however
unlike the MacBook Air it's actually a
lot cheaper this guy starts at $800
don't let that fool you though because
that's what the core i3 you guys she max
out the Mac Mini and over 4000 dollars
where you throw everything at it
including the memory the SSD the whole
works
oh yeah and that my friends is almost
everything that was announced at the
Apple event today the other main thing
was a brand new iPad pro but we did an
entire video on Instagram TV talking
about that said let's be sure to go
check that out of the link in the
description and while you're there maybe
take a look we actually been doing a lot
of IG TV videos lately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
