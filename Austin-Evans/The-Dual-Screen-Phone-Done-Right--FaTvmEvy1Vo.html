next dual display edition and it is
seriously cool huge shout-out to vivo
for partnering with me on this one and
giving us early access to the next to
show you guys pop open the box and we
have the next dual display itself okay
this is really cool so what's really
special about this phone is it not just
have a front display but it also has a
secondary rear display with some really
cool tech oh man I saw photos of this
beforehand I did not realize exactly
what I was getting here you know when
you're at a school or something and
you're like trying to text easily you
just like flip it upside down like oh no
no I'm putting my phone face down people
do that I feel like I'm out of touch
with the kids oh look at that we have a
bumper included with the phone now
actually just between us these are my
favorite type of cases skins are great
cases are great but having a bumper on
your phone is totally the way to do it
which kind of makes sense right if you
have a screen on the back of your phone
you don't exactly want to cover it with
a case wait does that a headphone jack
because the next has all the fun goodies
you would expect out of a brand-new
smartphone we have an N display
fingerprint sensor so if you look at the
phone from the front you will see that
we have the fingerprint sensor but if we
flip it over we have the facial
recognition so if I tap that and
immediately unlocks using my face wow
that's actually really clever because
usually you have to choose between
either having a fingerprint sensor or
having that facial unlock but here you
literally have whichever one is more
convenient for you up front we have a
six point four inch 23 40 by 1080p and
will that touch screen what's cool about
this is it's fully bezel as' and it does
have a pretty impressive 91% screen to
body ratio that is because my friends
there's no Knox to be found so around
back it is a 5.5 inch 1080p and will let
an all let me think about that right
that's pretty much the same spec does a
lot of high-end flagships from not that
long ago and it's the second display if
you want more screen resolution just
flip over the phone that is super cool
now with two screens you might expect it
needs a giant battery but the good thing
is you actually only really ever use one
screen at a time so it really doesn't
make a big difference and it is
outfitted with a pretty impressive 3500
milliamp hour battery I think a big
reason why this works so well is that it
is using a pair of OLED panels because
they are so thin it doesn't really add
any extra bulk to the phone I mean this
is just as thin as a standard single
screen phone so weird to think that a
standard single screen phone seems out
of date now when you've got dual
displays on all sides of your supercool
smartphone inside this is loaded with
flagship level specs it has a Snapdragon
845 10 gigs of ram as well as 128 gigs
of storage when I first saw this phone I
expected that the screen would be a
gimmick right I mean sure it's nice to
be able to frame up selfies or something
but the more I think about it what are
you really giving up by having a second
display it doesn't add any extra
thickness in fact it might even help
your battery life right if you or say
running low on battery and you want to
use the rear screen I bet it's a little
bit more power efficient since it's
smaller and on top of that I mean what
are you giving up right
I mean maybe wireless charging I guess
but on the flip side you have well a
screen on the flipside
I'm sorry I couldn't resist what's cool
about that second screen is that I can
use it in games like pub G so right now
I've mapped as my fire button to the
right side and if I want jump are you
tap on the left it's a pretty cool way
of doing it of course we can't talk
about this phone without discussing the
cameras so there are three around back
there's a 12 megapixel main camera with
oh is there's a 2 megapixel low-light
optimized camera and then there's a time
of flight camera which is used for the
3d effect as well as for determining
exactly how far objects are away from
the phone so with the back screen
enabled I can see myself pretty clearly
so if I take a selfie with the AI Beauty
mode and we also do have the portrait
mode so oh wow so the beauty mode is
definitely a little bit aggressive but I
think a lot of people will like that
look even though I like uh something
that's a little bit less filtered that
portrait mode actually looks really good
too there's also a 3d face scanning mode
so if I move my head slowly whoa dude so
I can change the way my face looks now
yeah let's let's change my eye span so
now with that saved Oh so it's I guess
putting that 3d model of my face over my
real face man I look like so beautiful
there's also mirror mode so this enables
both screens at the same time so if I'm
taking a photo of Ken for example he can
critique me from his side to make sure I
actually get it right
wave wave say hi it's pretty cool it was
very cool I feel like I could do an
entire video just like this this is what
video looks like straight off the vivo
necks unlike a lot of front-facing
cameras out there this is a much bigger
sensor and because that looks a lot
nicer and this is what the video looks
like when you're shooting on the rear
camera or these shooting in these
standard mode the stabilization if she
looks to be pretty solid one of the main
advantages of the vivo next is it
because it doesn't have a standard print
facing camera we have a much nicer
sensor and much nicer lens and some cool
features to go with it to put this to
the test we are outside at night time
with the train in the background to see
just how good the selfies are I'll guess
in the video in the
photos but I want to see the selfie wow
I look way too happy here one of the
main advantages here is the lunar rank
so in addition to having a pair of
lights which do act as a fill we also
have a colored circle and this can
actually automatically adjust based on
the lighting in your area so if I sort
of get something like this that fills it
up nicely and what's cool you actually
get some interesting flares from those
lights on the camera it's a super unique
look to be clear I mean this is a good
camera even without the light but the
fact that you have the extra options
does make a big difference that looks
really nice if I want I can completely
cut out the background and make it all
monochrome - this works well of course
though it does not stop there we also
have video capability as you would
expect because I've our video capability
let's see how it is in low-light the
little like video looks pretty good a
big part of that is because we do have
the lunar ring to help kind of fill a
little bit of light in but even so it is
of course nighttime the vivo negative
dual display Edition is seriously
impressive if this is a taste of what
the phones are going to look like in
2018 and beyond
then I've got to say I am on board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
