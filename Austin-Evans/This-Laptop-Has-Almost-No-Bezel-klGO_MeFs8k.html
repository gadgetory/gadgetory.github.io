the Isuzu end book s13 and you will see
that there is a lot going for it I want
to give a real shout out to a soos for
hooking us up with these Zenbook a
little bit early this won't be going on
sale until around March or so so we have
a slightly pre-production unit but
beyond that this thing looks dope this
is a 97% screen to body ratio which
means that you're essentially getting a
14 inch screen and a 13 inch laptop
sighs now the way they do this is with
very thin bezels on the sides as well as
a little bit of a anti notch or a verse
notch you got a little a little tab
maybe instead of moving the webcam down
below the screen or onto the keyboard
this actually seems to be a pretty
decent approach it gives you a little
bit of something to grab when you're
opening up the laptop and it means that
you still do have a decent quality
webcam don't get me wrong it's not
amazing with a 720p resolution but this
is so much better than if it was like
yes they're the keys of this is the
bottom bezel it's there but you just
can't see it
so that's thanks to the ergo lift hinge
so when you actually open up the laptop
what happens is that it slightly
elevates the keyboard and that is a
couple of advantages including making a
little bit more comfortable to type on
giving you more cooling and importantly
totally making it look like there's not
a bottom bezel of the screen at all it's
a really clever piece of technology and
engineering and it's just smart it's
also helped that this is a solid display
no it's not a touchscreen it is only
1080p resolution but honestly I prefer
that for battery life and importantly
the panel itself is very high quality
it's very accurate and it is one of the
brightest laptop displays we've ever
tested bezel little smartphones kind of
taken over and laptops are starting to
take that trend but what's cool about
this is it actually makes a big
difference right I mean you're getting a
legitimately bigger screen and a chassis
which is just as small as a lot of the
other 13 laptop so we've been using the
last few years it's one of those things
where there's no real downside there's
no real gimmicks here it's just some
smart ideas and a cool way of making a
laptop just that a little bit much
better that brings us to the second
claim to fame for the Zen book s this is
the world's thinnest laptop with
dedicated graphics and yeah that's
pretty thin 13 millimeters the NVIDIA MX
150 inside is hardly the most powerful
GPU in the world but it is a huge step
up over integrated graphics this is
enough power to play most games as long
as you don't mind turning down the
settings a little bit so for example
here in fortnight I've got it
20p medium we're able to get a pretty
consistent 50 to 60 frames per second
the only issue is is that because this
is so much power in such a thin and
light laptop it means that it does run a
little bit warm especially on the
keyboard and the fans they can spin up a
little bit it's not crazy loud but it's
definitely much louder than most
ultrabooks open it up and we see that's
actually Wow okay so first of all it has
a dual fan setup which does make sense
considering we do have not only a CPU
but we also have a GPU also I just
realized this is unstoppable
are they like trying to keep
jerry-rigged everything else so it does
look like you can swap out the nvme SSD
but it's really impressive is just how
big of a battery they're able to fit
this is a full 50 watt hours so usually
when you add a GPU to a laptop it means
that not only is it pulling more power
so you need that bigger battery but on
top of that there's less room for an
actual battery as far as the physical
space you've got to add room for the
cooling the GPU but here they've got
pretty much a full size cell and you've
got the power to back it up so in
addition to the MX 150 you have a
whiskey lake eighth-generation core i5
or Core i7 you also have up to 16 gigs
of ram and all the way up to a one
terabyte PCIe SSD build quality is solid
so not only is the keyboard deck very
rigid but even the screen really doesn't
have any flex to it a big reason for
that is because unlike most other
laptops out there this starts life as a
single block of aluminum which is then
CNC milled down to get what you see here
and that's usually reserved for very
expensive laptops such as razor as well
as Apple options so it's nice to see on
a Zenbook and I think it's probably part
of the reason why they're able to get so
much power into such a small and thin
form factor the fundamentals are all
here the keyboard feels great thanks to
the ergo lip design the touchpad is a
little bit on the small side but it
works and it does have a fingerprint
sensor and you have a decent selection
of ports new Thunderbolt 3 but you do
have two USB see a micro SD card reader
as well as a full size USB a I'm really
impressed with the Zenbook s not only
has the bezels display nice but more
importantly for me you're getting a lot
of performance here without sacrificing
the form factor I don't have to carry
around a heavier laptop
to have my GPU as well as have my 14
inch screen the only downside here is
that price is not enough yet so as long
as this is reasonably priced I think
that they've definitely got a winner
