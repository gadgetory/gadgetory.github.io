reality the future of racing my friends
over Castrol Edge invited me to check
out their latest project to pull off a
race between two drivers wearing virtual
reality helmets but driving real cars
all right so it is one week until the
virtual racers shoot so let's see if the
thing is actually gonna work you guys
will probably remember Adam and Glen
from the original Castrol Edge virtual
drift shoot earlier this year these guys
are crazy enough to take everything up a
notch this time by making an actual race
in virtual reality
and then around mid-august we got a
phone call saying hey do you guys want
to do another version we're just like
yes yes we did and then we're like cool
or anything like December January we'll
film and we're like they were like
October take a look at the tech they've
put together though and you'll see these
guys are legit they've built a custom
camera rig that uses a pair of
high-speed cameras a 3d camera for depth
tracking on top of a precision GPS
tracker to feed info about where the car
is back to the computer and its really
powerful man because it's crazy you
think about we have all these different
sensors like to make that all come
together as one without some insanely
advanced heavy algorithm is a nightmare
it's just an incredible time right now
to be working where open-source is so
widely available that you can literally
turn a bunch of like thrown-together
hardware into a tracking solution in
less than two weeks not only are they
turning a real car into the world's
coolest game controller but they've also
built a full game world and track for
the drivers to see inside the oculus dk2
headsets it all works off a laptop that
pulls data straight out of the car like
wheel speed and throttle position that
all comes together to make what should
be one seriously awesome race alright so
this is the racetrack that we're going
to be using for the shoot today so it's
kind of more like an autocross sort of
things you can see there's like these
different cones they're gonna be set up
if this was a normal track it was like
normal drivers I mean obviously these
guys are very talented this would be no
problem but considering is me wearing a
VR headset and they're racing against
each other this is gonna be tough this
is an actual world first to not only
have a race in virtual reality but with
actual cars on a track both drivers have
Ford Mustangs that are powered by
Castrol Edge with titanium FST but
otherwise their stock with the exception
of the camera rig on the hood lidar on
top for tracking and a pair of laptops
inside to handle all rendering and
positioning
on the street and I was blasted you - it
just feels it's not quite yeah you brain
expected it's easy to think the Castrol
Edge could just fake all this for a
commercial but I've got to give them
serious props for making this real and I
had to give it a try oh oh here we go
oh it's good man there's a bunch of
rocks there no not forget oh yeah after
trying it unconvinced there are some
serious uses for this kind of tech
imagine turning any parking lot into a
racetrack without worrying about running
off the road or into another car it
might not replace racing any time soon
but they're really onto something with
this I've got to give a huge shout out
to Castrol Edge from biting me out and
sponsoring this video definitely go
check out the full virtual racers video
over on their channel to see how it all
came together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
