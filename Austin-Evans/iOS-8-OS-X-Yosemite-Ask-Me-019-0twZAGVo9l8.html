hey guys this is Austin what are your
thoughts on iOS 8 and OS 10 Yosemite so
I watch WWDC like I'm sure a lot of you
guys did and I'm actually pretty
impressed
so iOS 8 I think is a solid upgrade so
nothing that's huge revolutionary but a
lot of little things that really do seem
to be focused more on the power user
side so things like being able to
replace the keyboard something that
you've been able to do on Android for a
long time but it's cool they kind of
bring that kind of stuff over to iOS
Simpson goes for things like widgets
that's not a huge deal but it's
definitely kind of a nice little
addition and lots of smaller things that
overall kind of add up to be a much
better experience on video somebody's
side I think it's an even bigger upgrade
so OS 10 is been around for quite a
while and while there's definitely been
some upgrades the look has actually not
changed that much especially when you
compare to something like Windows XP to
Windows 8 it's big difference so I think
one of the big things that I'm excited
about in Yosemite is the fact that it's
going to work better with iPhones no no
not everyone uses iPhones but the fact
that if you do it makes it a lot simpler
I mean you can take phone calls on your
Mac you can reply to texts you can start
like writing an email on your phone and
bring it over to Mac and vice versa I
think that is an awesome feature and I
would totally love of Microsoft kind of
borrowed it for Windows 9 how do you
deal with the hordes of fangirls you
encounter on the streets every day well
I mean it's it's it's dangerous for one
because there's just so many of them
just everywhere just you know so I like
to stay inside and I don't actually like
to go near them so you know I know
they're everywhere but I've never seen
him because I want to stay inside and
stay safe because hordes are dangerous
you know I'm like zombies like zombie
horse right like those are things you
want to stay away from so fangirl hordes
same thing they're they're not zombies
but they're they're close so I stay
inside all the time how do you feel
about the direction Microsoft is taking
with the Xbox one so I talked a little
bit about this last week with Microsoft
removing the Kinect from the Xbox one
bundle which will save you $100 if you
don't want Kinect and then they recently
allows you to use the Xbox one
controller on a PC which actually did a
video on if you guys want check out and
that they're now also going to be
freeing up a little bit more of the GPU
resources so previously around 10% of
the GPU of the Xbox one was dedicated to
connect you know with audio tracking in
the video and all that kind of stuff but
now that the Xbox one Kinect isn't going
to be mandatory that's going to be freed
up for games so you might see some
things like maybe a little bit higher
resolutions or better anti-aliasing just
a little bit more horsepower available
to the Xbox one so I'm happy with all of
these choices I think that Microsoft is
really kind of making a good decision as
my phone goes off but I'm gonna keep
talking I think it's a good overall
thing for Microsoft to kind of improve
the Xbox one across the board can we
expect GTA 5 for next gen this e3 I
don't like to make predictions but I
would hope that we will I mean GTA 5 has
been one of the most successful video
games of all time and that's only on the
Xbox 360 and ps3 so you can imagine how
well it'll sell on ps4 and Xbox one and
PC so yes I very very much hope that we
will see grand theft auto 5 next week at
e3 are you Linus's long-lost relative I
don't think so
what a MacBook Air be good for like
video editing definitely it's a
surprisingly powerful little laptop so I
actually use a MacBook Air 11 inch
myself when I travel so it's really
great for when I go to like trade shows
like CES and III so I can carry it
around in my bag all day long really
doesn't weigh all that much yeah it has
plenty of power to handle kind of basic
simple editing like I do at events so
it's not gonna be able to handle giant
complex After Effects projects but for
doing the kind of videos that I usually
do is more than good enough is the Xbox
360 slim worth buying now with the Xbox
one released absolutely so the Xbox 360
if you've never had one is a great
console with years and years and years
of awesome games so if you ever play
games like Mirror's Edge and fallout 3
then the 360 is a great way to get into
those games and on top of that a lot of
the fantastic games for the console are
really cheap so you can go and spend
just a little bit of money and get a ton
of awesome games to keep you occupied
for a very long time when did you first
know you love to tech it would probably
be with the arcades so when I was
younger and I've know I've told this
story before but I used to love going to
the arcade especially when I first got
into school like kindergarten and first
grade and that kind of stuff
I loved going to the arcade playing like
Hydro Thunder and pac-man and cruise the
USA that was just absolutely like my
favorite thing to do so my dad finally
got tired of taking me down there so he
bought me Aboriginal PlayStation one and
as soon as I got that I was totally
hooked
I just loved gaming I've loved
technology just this magical thing
that's just awesome and I absolutely
love it if you guys have any more
questions feel free to hit me up on
Twitter Facebook or Google+ and I'll
have all those links in the description
