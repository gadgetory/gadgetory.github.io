today I have a video that's going to be
extremely simple
I can even sum it up into two words iPad
jailbreak yeah you heard me right
so of course yesterday April 3rd the
Apple iPad came out and actually if you
guys check I had a video just a little
while back basically talking a little
bit about the iPad jailbreak and
basically I asked everybody when do you
think it's going to come out well I
don't think many people thought one day
or about 20 hours or so but that's what
it is see you guys go ahead go ahead and
tell you everything we know so far and
yeah it looks like some really good news
anyway let's get this one started
ok guys so he's go ahead and tell you
what's going on so it's been really
really busy all day yesterday of course
people getting their iPads and I guess
well about earlier this morning muscle
nerd with one of the members of the dev
team who've jailbroken most every single
iPhone I bought ever so you know they're
definitely trustworthy basically he put
up a videos showing him basically just
not fully jailbreaking exactly but he
had root access basically he could type
a command in and you know he could kill
applications reboot the device all
without touching it so you guys go ahead
check out the video I will have a link
there as well I'll have the pictures
from it to see what it actually looks
like now I gotta keep in mind this is
actually not a full jailbreak whatsoever
now it is you can get in there and you
can actually do some stuff in there like
you know like kill stuff everything but
basically what we're waiting on now is
for them to actually port a full
jailbreak we don't know exactly how easy
it's going to be all that kind of stuff
so the jailbreak is there and assuming
that nothing changes which unless you
ask Apple updates the firmware soon it
shouldn't but basically and of course
just kind
you know this I'm sure if you've ever
had an iPhone before but I definitely do
not update your iPad firmware anytime
soon because this jailbreak might go
away the next update
but basically what they can do now is
very simple they can have full access to
it okay now it's going to take a while
like I said for them to build everything
out they've got to create applications
that will work they have to port over
all kinds of stuff such as Cydia for the
much larger screen so it might take a
little while but technically it's
already jailbroken and you know all the
way basically we're waiting on now is
just for everything to get built and you
know that's just a matter of time
so the jailbreak is called spirit or at
least that's what they're calling it
right now of course in my change and it
looks like it's going to be a very very
simple jailbreak and on a set of quick
sidenote it looks like this jailbreak is
actually was originally made for the
iPhone and iPod Touch and it just so
happens that works on the iPad which is
how it happens it fast so just it should
be pretty cool to know that I've got
original iPhone iPod Touch especially
the ones that require a tethered
jailbreak right now should be able to
have the same kind of unto the jewelry
because iPad so anyway guys that's about
it we don't know any more information on
it could be you know a week until it's
released could be a month doesn't really
you know I mean no one knows but it is
coming for sure and it looks like to me
really really cool so now let me go
ahead and give you guys a shout out now
if you watch my video previously I was
talking about how I when the iPad was
jailbroken I asked her by post comment
saying hey what what time do you think
it would come out well not many people
guess two days in fact once if people
did Volcom skater for life guess the day
came out which is pretty close it was
early this morning like last night
something like that and I PI PJ Egypt
also said it's not black brain but it's
close enough so you guys good job you
both won yeah okay you didn't win
anything but
but yeah guys so that's about it I will
definitely keep you guys up to date on
any more information as soon as the iPad
jailbreak actually comes out and people
can use it but for now guys sit tight on
a baby or anything like that
enjoy your iPads and sit tight for the
full jailbreak anyway thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
