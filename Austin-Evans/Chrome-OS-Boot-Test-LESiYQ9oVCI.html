bit of a speed test on Google Chrome OS
so of course I have here with me as
cr-48
and of course one of the biggest things
about Chrome OS is the fact that it's
going to be very fast you know it's
pretty much just a browser without any
operating system or at least as little
of an operating system as possible so
what I'm gonna go ahead and show you
guys today is a speed test of how it
boots how it wakes up from sleep I'm
just kind of give you guys a feel of how
much faster or slower this might be
compared to your normal computer so that
any further ado let's just jump straight
on into it so go ahead just hit the
power button now you guys can see here
it boots up pretty quickly now it's not
an instant boot you guys will see here
it does not take that long but
whatsoever so I would say maybe 10
seconds or so of course we will see here
there we go so we're all set up and
ready to login so as you can see that
was not too bad definitely not instant
but certainly not half bad now let me
wet and showed you what's even better
which is the wake up and slick times
this is pretty much made as well of
course you can shut it off and of
courting you know you will need to shut
it off from time to time but the vast
majority of the time you'll be able to
just go ahead and put it to sleep it's
got a pretty good battery life I believe
that you said it has about five days
worth of standby time hopefully you
won't have it in standby for that long
but so you can definitely go ahead and
put this just close the lid and you'll
put it to sleep so I'm going to show you
guys so it's obviously on right now so
let me go ahead and close it and open it
back up and it's already back on and now
that's not rigged racing that's not it
actually does fully go to sleep and wake
up that quick you guys want to just show
you guys again we'll let stay off for a
couple of seconds okay and open it back
up and the result will be the exact same
it opens and closes and of course that's
not and this is not like tricked or
hatched or anything this is exactly how
fast it takes so I don't know the exact
time but I mean yeah by the time you get
this screen all the way up it's pretty
much going to be good to go a lot of
that is of course due to the Chrome OS
it's very lightweight it doesn't really
use a whole lot of system resources in
addition to that and the cr-48 also does
have a 16 gigabyte solid state drive so
that really does make it quite a bit
faster anyway guys definitely stay tuned
for more Chrome OS videos as well as a
overview of the cr-48 which I will be
posting soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
