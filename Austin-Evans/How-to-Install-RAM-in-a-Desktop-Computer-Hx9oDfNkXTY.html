to your computer is simply adding more
RAM this will oftentimes speed up a lot
especially if you have an older computer
with not very much RAM at all but it'll
also do a lot of things such as I help
you run more programs and do a lot of
stuff like that you guys it's very very
simple to do so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys how to add RAM to both of
these desktop computers these are both
older but it basically should work
pretty much any kind of normal desktop
that you're just fine the first thing
you're going to need to do however is
find out what kind of RAM and how much
you need okay so really simply go to
there will be a link in the description
it's at the website called edge tech
this is a company who sells Ram you
don't necessarily have to buy the RAM
for them but they're a pretty good
resource to figure out how much RAM you
need for your computer so simply type in
whatever the name of your computer is be
as specific as you can it will should
pop up what kind of computer and it'll
say like what type of RAM you need for
example maybe like PC 133 if you have an
older desktop etc etc will tell you what
kind of RAM it'll tell you the maximum
you can put in there and then it'll also
tell you how many slots that has
available stuff like that it's a great
resource would definitely recommend
check that out figure out how much you
need what type of you you need and then
buy it
either's from them from amazon from
somewhere else it's not a big deal ok
guys so now that you have your RAM and
you're ready to install it there's just
a couple things you need to know real
quick obviously guys it needs to be
unplugged I hope it goes without saying
bail go ahead and save anyway make sure
everything is unplugged mouse keyboard
everything it all needs to be unplugged
and you know let it sit for a few
minutes it you're not in a huge hurry
make sure that there's no electricity
one and run-through whatsoever just to
make sure that you're safe another thing
is if you see right here this your
computer might have a seal now if it's
an older computer you not have to worry
about that usually these seals are there
so that they can tell like your warranty
if you've gotten into a computer and
tampered with it and you don't mess with
it so guys if you have a newer computer
and especially if you see one of the
seal that's a pretty good indicator you
might want to be a little bit cautious
do a little bit of research and see how
to do it if you can go ahead and do this
without voiding your warranty but if you
have an old computer likely you do if
you're adding more into it if you have
an older computer then that's not gonna
be an issue
so just do your research so anyway guys
it's why the way to open up a computer
is very simple if a computer is
different but for example this computer
this top panel comes off or well it's
the it's when you've looked it up but
I've flipped over on its side to get at
it guys this is very simple usually
it'll be a panel like this look around
your computer for example you see I've
got these two screws that kind of get
tips me off that that's how to get in
and you pull it with that but just guys
look at your computer whether it's
horizontal or vertical look you'll
usually be the top or the left or right
panels so just look at it in this case
it's very simple to get at all we got to
do is just unscrew these screws and we
don't even need a screwdriver so that's
great so we just unscrewed these two and
like I said that has a seal on the side
it has a seal on the side you would have
to cut I would have a cut that a long
time ago but you know you might have to
do that and then you guys don't be
afraid to you know use a little muscle
I'm just gonna do it like this pull it
back like that lift it up and a little
bit come on and there you go
so now you're inside the computer and
your age go ahead and install your RAM
okay guys so that computer is how most
of them be there will be a couple screws
but if you're lucky because this is one
I'm going to actually doing the ring
upgrade on then it's going to be very
simple so this computer is probably the
simplest one I've ever worked on you
just pull this tab back and it's a
little niche right there you just take
it force and there we go
we're inside the computer ok so guys so
once you have the case off you should be
looking at something pretty similar to
this okay now don't be intimidated by
all you know the cables and written
wires and all that kind stuff don't work
don't worry about that stuff guys that's
not an issue all we're going to be doing
is upgrading the RAM now every computer
is different but usually you'll be able
to look and actually see at least one
maybe two sticks Ram
telling the case of this computer today
actually does not have any random at all
installed right now which is why we'll
be installing this right here okay so
guys most Ram will look like this
different types we'll look at the
different a little bit different I'm for
example a laptop Ram is usually much
smaller than this but generally it
looked like this
pretty similar ok guys so now before
we're ready to actually install the
remnants of the computer there's one
more tip obviously like I said before
everything is unplugged but what you
need to do is make sure that there's no
static electricity so have something
metal to touch and it's really good you
can do it this not on carpet especially
you know that wearing socks or anything
like that they can you know get yourself
static electricity because believe me
guys inside a computer one little bit of
a static electricity can you know break
a lot of stuff anyway guys it's really
simple so I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in
like I said guys this normally is a lot
easier because you know you can see but
for this example I don't have any RAM in
here but so as you can see here guys
this has three slots okay so I'm always
put it on the inside slot if you can we
just put these two little tabs back it's
really simple guys
just reach in here and of course you
know try to knock any cables loose but
it's not a huge deal just usually in
there pretty tight so it might take just
a minute but there we go
so now it's in okay so just take the two
ends and then just press it pretty
firmly and there's one side down there's
that side down then just kind of take it
just remove it a little bit make sure
it's in there pretty securely and we're
done guys the ramp is in now obviously
this works pretty much the same oh yeah
you all you should have to do is press
it down
okay these should just flip into place
as soon as this gets pressed down if you
happen to really force it you might want
to make it make sure that it is in
correctly because Ram has a tendency to
actually make it look like you can put
it in one try some forward or backwards
but it always will go in learnt one of
those two ways so guys don't try to
force it if it's really being tough just
see if you can flip it and see if it
fits in that way but anyway guys that's
just a quick tutorial on how to add RAM
to your desktop computer it's a really
simple upgrade Ram is very cheap these
days so if you're leading to speed up
your computer or whatever it's a very
very good thing so I definitely
recommend you guys check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
