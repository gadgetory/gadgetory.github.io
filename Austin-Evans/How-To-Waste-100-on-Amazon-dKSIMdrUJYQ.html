time for yet another mystery tank this
time at $100 the expendables kunai
throwers is this like Naruto wait wait
no Oh gladly immediately recognize the
knives like wait a minute I used to want
one of these when I was 13 oh I feel
like I'm gonna give right now this looks
really bad isn't it
the next item please
the Dorjee x53 ken is this actually real
technology not some dumb joke to make me
look dumb on camera the doogee x53 has a
5.3 inch display with an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio dual rear cameras and one gig of
ram ah okay how much was this $70 of
course everyone should always take their
phone buying advice from a random we're
doing the internet wearing a Naruto
costume because reasons from the front
it actually does look like a much more
expensive phone than $70 and then if you
flip it around to the back I mean with
the dual cameras and the metal build
doesn't feel all that bad okay it
doesn't want its power on it's got to
like power button so it's got one which
looks like the power button it's groove
but there's another button here that's a
little lightning symbol on it but
neither of those actually turn on the
phone plug this guy in and come back to
it a little bit later design your own
headphones street arts actually think
looting the video in this rate literally
just a pair of super cheap looking
headphones as well as some markers and
paint is the bad idea alright so let's
just see if we can make it Ken okay
totally good it's like the finger off oh
no I'm gonna make a leaf to match my
headband okay so this is our stencil now
do we want to use the paint or the
marker let's start with the marker and
go to the paint to the other side oh
look we have an orange marker to match
my awesome jackets on today
episode of art class of austin we
crudely drawn some headphones in the
attempt to find some style okay so
that's the one side done um for this
side let me see if I can paint oh it's
just squirts ah so after waiting a
little while the paint is somewhat dry
see if I can barely peel this back so
that's uh this is really the look I was
going for the whole time I think if you
got take a closer look you'll see this
sort of the art that I was inspired by I
really wanted to kind of show my inner
artists with these headphones so let's
just plug them in and see what they
sound like because I'm sure it's gonna
be just as great as my wonderful heart
okay I can actually really clearly
described what these headphones sound
like so imagine you're going to a
concert for one of your favorite artists
you spend the entire time with your
fingers in your ears
what is bits black this is the backpack
oh is it a backpack with a speaker wait
a minute how much was this this is $100
this better sound pretty decent well
okay so I guess to be fair there is sort
of some extra function because you do
get a 5-volt out via USB so I guess in
theory if you want to know how to listen
to music but you could also run a USB
cable out through the the little hole on
the top and charge your phone well this
isn't good our digi phone after being
plugged in for like 20 minutes still
doesn't absolutely nothing besides
bootloop all right so I've connected the
tracks to my phone and the first thing I
notice is that it's got this cool LED
but what I've also noticed is that it
just kind of hums wait talk chop wood
wait this is this is a speaker wait hold
on talk talk one two one two hey guys
this is Austin why is this a thing okay
so that's what the buzzing noise was but
those really bizarre there's also some
other things that can control the light
so I just turn on and off from this low
controller
it sounds great actually doesn't tell it
that the real problem though is that how
do you not look like the biggest dork in
the world with one of these on your back
although I guess I'm one to talk on our
head
okay I think my name problem with this
is that while it sounds decent it sounds
like any kind of fairly cheap Bluetooth
speaker I don't hate it I don't love it
though it's so weird what we call it
weird all right what do we get next oh
hey I this doesn't look like total
garbage
with twenty point one megapixels five
times optical zoom a twenty six
millimeter wide angle lens and HD movie
720p this well obviously it's not gonna
be great but what do you say was 80
bucks 80 bucks yeah that's actually not
gonna be crazy alright oh okay that
looks like it's straight out of two
thousand seven throw an SD card in here
and it actually isn't super terrible
looking so it makes these wonderful
noises but II figure I mean we're
getting a 20 megapixel sensor 720p video
it might not be that bad you see here
that that takes a while all that is
incredibly soft okay let's try some
video we're not recording 720p video so
let's just kind of see I mean it
actually considering that we look at all
kinds of terrible phones this this
doesn't actually not look that bad oh if
it comes in focus
dude the stabilization on this is
actually kind of crazy I mean I'm like
shaking the camera around a little bit
and it looks a little blurry but it's
actually not that bad is this going to
be as good as say a decent smartphone
well in some ways it actually might be
on par especially considering that you
have that zoom lens but I wouldn't
exactly go throw your brand-new galaxy s
9 out the window
you actually got something reasonable
Ken this is actually something that
people might want to buy I don't know
what to say why is this oh it's so heavy
oh-ho what why is this so heavy
what isn't here Oh yep that's a
cannonball
oh it's why is it so Whaley kisses a J
bearing what it's completely coated in
oil I mean this is cool
but why what is it it was just a very
nuts it is just a giant bearing that
weighs like 20 pounds oh it's so coated
and oil and you bought it anyway of
course you did um how was this tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
