video just letting you all know that
next Monday Apple will be showing off
several new things at WWDC now one of
the biggest things we always expect to
see is the new iphone however I don't
think we'll be seeing at WWDC this year
most likely we will be seeing a new
iphone probably sometime in September
however we will be seeing some pretty
cool stuff including OS 10 lion I know
we have seen line before it's not going
to be anything dramatically new but what
I do expect is it will be a few new
things they've added on including
perhaps you know some new features or
whatever and of course we should be
seeing a release date and price and now
another big thing and that's probably
going to be the most important thing
about the whole deal is iOS 5 so they
will be showing off iOS 5 of the event
and since it's been over a year since
iOS four came out I'm really looking
forward to seeing exactly what all they
put into it what all is new i'm really
looking forward to a major overhaul a
lot of new cool stuff to see on our
iphones ipod touches and iPads now the
last thing i want to talk about is I
cloud now if you guys have been keeping
up with rumours and whatnot there's
actually been a lot of talk about I
cloud which is going to allow you to
upload your various songs and buy songs
through itunes and then you'll be able
to listen to them on various devices
well it looks like it is official well
it is official as they announced it they
will be showing off iCloud at WWDC
interesting in Italy Annette though they
didn't say anything about music what
they call it is an upcoming cloud
services offering so what that means
we'll definitely have to wait and see
well I my money is personally on is it's
going to be some kind of replacement
from mobileme but again we'll have to
take a look anyway that's about it and
just of course want to make a quick
video let you guys know what was going
on and if you're not going to be able to
be near a computer on Monday morning be
sure to follow me on twitter facebook i
will be posting live updates as the
events going on of course love you
watching it very closely so if you guys
want to see exactly what's going on as
it happens be sure to follow me there
anyway I didn't really curious to know
what exactly are you guys looking
forward to most personally a western
line and it looks pretty decent but I
don't really think we'll see anything
amazing and personally I not a hunter s
it's sold on iCloud i'll definitely be
taking a look at it but nothing really
from what I've heard it seems too
exciting so definitely the number one
thing I'm looking forward to is iOS 5 I
really want to see some cool new
features but definitely sure to let me
know what you think in the comments
