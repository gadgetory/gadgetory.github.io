talking about the next generation of
Windows operating system Windows 8 so
recently there have been a lot of leaked
build of windows 8 they've been
circulating around the internet and from
what we've seen there are definitely
some nice new features that are going to
be coming so i'll go ahead and talk
about a few of them so the first one is
better tablet support now Windows has
been available on tablets for quite a
while in fact way before everyone
thought of the board iPad even on
however they've all been still really
rooted in their desktop base sure yeah
there might be a keyboard there might be
you know better multi-touch supporters
there are a few things in windows 7 and
there are some okay windows 7 tablets
however windows ables to be the first
version of Windows that has been fully
optimized for the tablet OS so this
should mean is of course better
multi-touch support you know windows
these days is almost made for styluses
so you're gonna have real nice
multi-touch to support but also should
be optimized for ARM processors I know
what this means is that there are two
major types of processors it's available
in the market well three technically but
we're just going to talk about two so
there's the standard processor which you
might find and you know your laptop or
your desktop and that usually made by
intel or AMD and well that's great it's
not particularly power efficient on the
other hand this is called an ARM
processor which we might find and you
know your iphone or android phone or
force anything major tablets well
windows 8 will support both of these
architectures so you know if you want to
run windows 8 on your you know laptop or
something you can absolutely do that
however there will be a specialized
version for tablets that will run a lot
better I should have really nice battery
dies because it can use those more
powerful power efficient chips so that's
definitely one really good thing that
I'm looking forward seeing in Windows 8
another thing is the windows App Store
Anna for thur App Store springing up all
of the place of course you can get in
the mac app store there's the Chrome App
Store or belly bit called the web store
but basically in that store and then it
also looks like there will be a Windows
app store and this is not going to be a
particularly amazing thing in my opinion
it's probably mostly just going to be a
general store that can just allow you to
get a few applications games that kind
of stuff a little bit easier I'm to be
honest how actually would be surprised
if they put that out for windows 7 or
something just because it's a really
basic and simple feature but I
definitely would expect to see this in
Windows 8 the next feature and this is
really going to be one of the defining
features of Windows 8 is the addition of
the Metro UI now if you guys are
familiar with the Metro UI it's of
course started out on the zune HD is
available on all the windows phone 7
devices on it looks like it will be
making an appearance on the desktop with
windows 8 um so Metro UI is a very cool
very very nice little you I in my
opinion is mostly based on tiles and
it's a very artistic and nice-looking
your user experience so if you guys are
interested in seeing more bad definitely
recommend just take a look at like a
windows phone 7 device or something you
really get the idea of how Windows 8
could work for the same segment of d3
live I'm going to be taking live
questions from everyone in the chat as
always every episode be through live is
filmed in front blog TV and we have 50
people in here right now so let's go and
just take a couple of questions about
Windows 8 is Windows 8 well I mean I'm
sorry do you think windows 8 will boot
faster than 7 or Vista yeah I would
imagine so typically that's what they're
always trying to do is optimize the boot
process KY speed up and force windows 7
was a little bit better than vista and
I'll imagine the windows 8 will continue
to be faster but if you're looking for
like an instant boot up times like
Chrome OS something I don't think we're
gonna see anything like that unless they
just totally redesigned windows which it
doesn't look like it it looks like
they're going to continue to keep the
base of windows 7 and just upgrade it
just you know add stuff on top of that
just like they did windows seven on
Windows Vista what do you think the
price will be of Windows 8 most likely
the same is you know the same upgrade
prices I believe one of the sevens about
a hundred dollars for a system builders
coffee I think it's about 170 or so for
the standard coffee so yeah that's just
what they'll do I don't I don't imagine
they'll make it white cheaper or white
more specific than I think you'll
probably be about the same um what what
do I think Metro could become the tattle
you I of Windows 8 i'm actually yeah we
were talking about this little bit on
the live stream before we media
reporting I think that's an interesting
concept because obviously you know
there's a very different UI that you
need if you had a tablet or if you have
a desktop you know obviously desktop
you're using mouse and keyboard wears on
a tablet you know you're just touching
so um I think that there are definitely
some interesting things to say about
that I mean on the one hand I could say
that they could make two separate
versions of Windows one for tablets and
one for desktop you know for the tablet
version to be totally tough to optimize
with the Metro UI where you know you go
through all your folders of thing but
it's it's more of a metro UI looks more
like a traditional tablet and I could
have more of a traditional like windows
seven style UI for the desktop laptops
all I kind of stuff on the other hand
though that might be a little bit much
typically don't like to break it apart
and you make two totally separate
operating system so i think we'll have
to see about that but it definitely is
think the thing that there's something
to keep an eye on i think that no matter
what we're going to see at least some of
the Metro UI trickle down into Windows 8
well windows XP finally be replaced by
Windows 8 I hope so it's kind of
surprising in fact I believe even though
even up till right now windows XP is
still the most popular operating system
in the world which considering it's like
10 years old that's not half bad but
yeah I think windows XP I mean obviously
they're not they finally quit making
windows XP computers pretty hard I think
you still get it there's a few different
ways but for the most part everyone
still not getting on windows 7 so yeah I
think by the time windows 8 comes around
windows XP will probably not be around
or it it won't be not that many people
will be using and I suppose what do I
think of the portable workspaces
features of Windows 8 yeah that's
actually a great point I didn't get into
in the main video is one thing that is
planning to be supported in Windows 8 is
portable workspaces so you ever use
Linux you're probably familiar with it
you know just take like Lennox you put
whether your favorite distribution you
put it on a USB drive and you can go
wherever you want and boot off that no
matter what computer you're really on
well it looks like windows 8 will
support a very similar feature although
how the licensing work on all that kind
of stuff I think there are definitely
some some questions there on MAGIX
projects Windows 8 Windows 8 computer
and some stuff like that but yeah I
definitely think that will be a really
nice option anyway guys that's it for
