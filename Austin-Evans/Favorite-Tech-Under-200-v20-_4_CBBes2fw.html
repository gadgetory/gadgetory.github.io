my holiday gift guide 2015 edition king
things off is the Samsung gear VR
virtual reality is becoming seriously
legit and the gear VR is one of the
first headsets you can actually buy what
separates this from other models is that
it relies on your phone to do the heavy
lifting you'll need either a samsung
galaxy s6 or note 5 it might seem weird
to base a VR headset around a phone but
there are actually quite a few
advantages to this approach this frees
you up to not only be able to move
around a bit but also to use the gear VR
on the go it also allows the headset to
be reasonably priced as the main
hardware is all built into the phone
you've already bought that hardware is
no slouch either the Galaxy line has
terrific high-resolution AMOLED displays
that are perfectly suited for VR use and
the Exynos chip set inside can handle
some surprisingly solid games get into a
game in the gear VR is one of the nicest
looking setups out there if you've never
tried virtual reality it really is crazy
just how immersive it can be and the
cool thing about this is that the oculus
software allows you to do more than just
play games by watching video and apps
like twitch Netflix and Hulu for $100 if
you own a new galaxy smartphone the gear
VR is absolutely worth a look next up we
have the SanDisk connect wireless stick
and big thanks to SanDisk for sponsoring
this gift guide it looks like a fairly
ordinary USB flash drive but it's got a
trick up its sleeve Wi-Fi download the
app on your Android or iOS phone or
tablet and you can access photos and
video right off the wireless stick with
up to 128 gigabytes of capacity this can
also be helpful if you need a little
extra storage on your phone from the app
you can upload photos and videos right
to the drive which is really handy you
can then connect up to three devices
wirelessly to view the files on top of
using this as a backup for data on your
phone it also works as a normal USB
flash drive plug it into a computer and
you can put whatever files you want on
it with the added benefit of charging it
up at the same time especially when you
consider the price the San disconnect
wireless stick is a really cool piece of
tech to share files and even use as a
backup moving on we have the GoPro Hero
GoPros are massively popular and for
good reason
there are terrific little cameras that
have all kinds of uses the standard hero
pairs a 5 megapixel camera in the
standard size GoPro body which means
it's compatible with a massive range of
accessories the camera itself is small
enough to fit in the palm of your hand
and while it might not have the easiest
menus to navigate in the world for the
most part you charge it throw a microSD
card in and you're ready
go it shoots video at 1080p at 30 frames
per second or 720p at 60 and the quality
really isn't half bad they might lose
out on the higher frame rates in 4k
video of its bigger brothers but it's
also nowhere near the same price and
delivers good enough quality for the
vast majority of people with the
included waterproof housing you can do a
lot but with the huge variety of GoPro
accessories you really can't go crazy
with it there are a lot of expensive
drones out there but you eight one eight
a delivers a lot of the same fun without
worrying about wrecking a thousand
dollars worth of gear it's incredibly
light which makes sense as not only is
it easier to fly but it's less likely to
break when you crash it and you'll
probably crash it the controller feels
good with a small screen and buttons to
change modes and trigger photo and video
recording it's seriously fun to fly too
it's got a gyroscope to be more stable
up in the air and can even do cool
tricks the battery lasts about 7 minutes
which is okay but it's easy to fly and
is an absolute blast to play with the
built-in camera is of the very best
potato quality but for what's
essentially a toy it's passable at about
50 dollars it's a lot of fun if you guys
enjoyed this I teamed up with Amazon to
create part 2 of this video going over
even more awesome stuff so definitely be
sure to go check that out at the link in
the description anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
