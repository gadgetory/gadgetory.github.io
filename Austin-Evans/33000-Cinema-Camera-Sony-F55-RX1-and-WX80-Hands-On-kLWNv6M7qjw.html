live here at CES 2013 and the Sony booth
going over some of the really cool
cameras they have to show so let's take
a look the first game we have is the
Sony rx1 now this looks like a normal
little point-and-shoot but it is
absolutely not it is one of the first
cameras in fact it is the first small
camera like this to have a full-frame
sensor which is in fact to the exact
same sense of this and my huge just a
lot of that I'm filming this right now
on top of that also does have a fixed
lens so it's a 35 millimeter f/2 would
be nice to have a bit of zoom or be able
to exchange lenses but this have a
manual aperture ring as well as a very
very nice smoothing for a smooth focus
focusing lens on top of that it's also
very nice and compact unfortunately
though the big thing is it's gonna be
$2,800 so very expensive stuff but this
is really cool and again nothing that
you can come anywhere close to getting I
let you have a huge DSLR and pay a lot
more money for lenses and a lot kind of
stuff now getting to the higher end
stuff we have these sony at 55 now this
is a full professional reckons you guys
may be able to see here it is a full 4k
camera so of course this is what you'd
be able to shoot movies all kinds are
really really high-end stuff as far as
the specs go of course it does have a 4k
sensor and she's up to 60 frames per
second what are you doing 2k you can do
it well over 200 frames per sec which is
really cool now this is definitely
pricey of course as you would expect
from something that looks this awesome
she's going running about $33,000 in
February something just a little bit
more my price range is they knew so many
WX 80 now this is a tiny little camera
enough you guys can top it like it's
like sighs my hand really really tiny
but it's got a lot of cool features who
why it's got a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor
with full 1080p video so you should get
some pretty good image stabilization and
all that kind of fun stuff now on top of
that also does have Wi-Fi built-in so
you can go ahead and connect it to
various different devices so for example
you if you have a Sony smartphone you
can use it as a remote really really
cool stuff it's also very very small as
I mention that yet so you guys have it
some of the really cool cameras that
Sony has launched at CES 2013 and I got
my eye on a net 55 but uh $33,000 just a
little bit steep anyway guys if you
enjoyed this video definitely sure to
leave it a thumbs up and subscribe we've
got lots more CES 2013 coverage on the
way right now anyway guys I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
