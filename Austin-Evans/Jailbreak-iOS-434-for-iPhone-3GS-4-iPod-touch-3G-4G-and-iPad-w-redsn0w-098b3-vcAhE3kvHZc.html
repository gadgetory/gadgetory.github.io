showing you how to jailbreak your iPhone
iPod Touch your iPad on the latest four
point three point four firmware now
before I begin there are a couple of
things I do want to go over first of all
the jailbreak we're going to be using
red snow does not support all devices so
what it does support is the iPhone 3GS
the iPhone 4 the iPod Touch 3rd
generation the iPod Touch 4th generation
and the iPad 1 this does not currently
support the iPad 2 on top of that this
is a tethered jailbreak now if you're
not familiar with what that means
basically every single time you turn off
your device and not just logging it but
actually turning it off if it runs out
of battery or for whatever reason you
will need to rerun the program so it's
not a big deal I've certainly used
tethered jailbreak in the past it's not
a big deal but what it is is a bit of an
annoyance so you definitely should keep
that in mind now because I know I'm
going to be asked this question a lot if
you are already on some earlier version
of iOS like 4.3.3
there is literally no reason to update
to 4.3 point for all that will do is
just give you a lot of headaches and
you'll be forced to use this tethered
jailbreak which is a little bit more
complicated of course than jailbreak me
so well I highly recommend is if you
have the choice stay away from four
point three point four to do the
jailbreak you will need two things first
of all you will need the red smoke
program itself now this is available for
both Windows and Mac and this tutorial
should apply equally to both operating
systems so of course you will be able to
download that from the link in the
description now on top of that you will
also be able to download the four point
three point four IPSW also known as your
firmware file now you very well may
already have this file on your computer
in which case that I will have another
link in the description showing you how
to find it otherwise you can just be
able to download it really quite simply
so whichever way is easiest for you
alright so once you're ready to begin
there is one other step if you're on
Windows and this is going to be really
quick if you're on Windows Vista or
Windows 7 you need to right-click the
executable file and hit properties you
need to come over here to compatibility
like run this program in compatibility
mode for Windows XP service pack 3 if
you have some reason you don't see xp
service pack 3 you try xp service pack 2
or something earlier than that but just
by doing this a little ensure that it
will work on top of that click run this
program as an administrator click apply
and click OK if you're on Windows XP or
some version of OS 10 you do not have
worry about this at all alright so let's
go ahead and open up the program
and you will see here very simple
operating rather very simple UI if
you've ever used red snow before you
will have no problem navigating this I
will go ahead and give you guys the full
tutorial anyway so the first step is to
click browse and we need to just find
that IPSW that we downloaded and/or
found so for convenience sake I have it
on my desktop
but of course wherever you have it you
just go ahead and navigate there and
click open simple take just a moment to
process your firmer and then you can
click Next and now at this point it will
patch the kernel and do a couple of
other jailbreak things this may take a
couple of minutes or may take just a
couple of seconds and be ready to
continue on now at this point you will
see several options depending on your
device and the most important thing is
you need to make sure that install city
is checked that is the jailbreak a store
that is definitely what you want
there's also install custom bundles if
you know what that is you certainly can
feel free to do that but for most of you
guys I'm sure you will just need to
leave that unchecked if you have an iPod
touch you may want to enable battery
percentage I always like to do that's
very a neat little thing and you can
also enable multitask gestures I go
ahead personally recommend that you do
this I'm all it means is in the settings
tab you can turn on multi-touch gestures
and swipe between your apps and whatnot
but of course that's entirely optional I
now down here you will see entered pwned
DFU mode right now and who tethered
right now now I will show you guys that
in a second that is what you will do
when you need to rerun right snow in the
in the path or in the future rather and
I will show you guys how to do that in
just a minute
alright so once you have installed city
and whatever options you have ready go
ahead and click Next and we can continue
on at this point you should grab your
iPod iPhone or iPad and connected via
USB to your computer now one thing I
recommend it's not necessary for the
jailbreak to work properly but I do
recommend it is that you should go ahead
and allow iTunes to fully sync with your
iPod iPhone or iPad to make sure that
you don't lose any data in the jailbreak
now you shouldn't lose anything
beforehand but of course this is just a
precaution if anything goes wrong or
anything like that you will be
definitely covered alright so once you
have everything connected we're ready to
begin now we're going to be putting this
into DFU mode idft mode is simply
holding the power button for three
seconds holding the power and the home
for 10 and releasing that and holding
the power button I mean the home button
for about 15 seconds I will walk you
through it of course the program also
does have a countdown timer so it should
be very simple ok so let's go ahead and
click Next
three seconds so ready set go now go
ahead and continue pulling the power
while we're still holding the home and
allow that to countdown for about ten
seconds reading two one remove that and
continue holding the home button it says
15 seconds pretty much just hold it as
long as you need to until it will head
and pops up all right so we're all done
here as you guys can see it's working
properly you should get a downloading
jailbreak data notification on your
device you'll see it's going to be
running through a few lines of code and
whatnot and there we go so you guys will
see all kinds of cool textures running
down your device that is perfectly
normal that means it's worked at this
point we can just ignore red snow we're
all done with that everything else
happens on our device this will take
just a few minutes to run through and
get all the code ready so I'll be right
back as soon as it's done okay so now
that it's all done we can go ahead and
slide to unlock you should see now see
that the city is installed however if we
click on it you'll see it actually does
not do anything yet so there's one more
step let's go ahead and boot tethered
just come to the exact same process as
we did before just select your IPSW file
and a lot to process and then let it
prepare the jailbreak data patched
kernel all that kind of good stuff but
instead of running the jailbreak again
and you know install Cydia all that kind
of stuff instead we're going to just go
ahead and click just boot tethered right
now
at this point we need to put our device
into DFU mode once again
now unlike last time when it just ran
the jailbreak instead this time it's
actually going to just boot as tethered
since you only take just a moment let's
go ahead and say exploding with line
rain and all that kind of good stuff and
there we go so it's gonna reboot upload
the kernel and we're gonna pretty much
good to go
okay so we're all done now so finally if
we scroll over to our last page we
should have Cydia but instead of before
you'll actually see an icon so we click
on that it'll actually open up ask who
we are so just select whatever you like
hit done and there we go guys so that's
it now actually yeah I do have Wi-Fi
hooked up so at this point I'll just run
through download all the packages that
kind of stuff but at this point we're
all done just let it set up and get all
the stuff downloaded and whatnot in your
fully joe broken so anyway guys that's
it for my tutorial showing you how to
jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad
on four point three point four of course
