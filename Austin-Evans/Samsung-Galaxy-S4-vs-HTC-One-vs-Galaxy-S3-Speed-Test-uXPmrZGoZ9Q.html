here with the speed test between the
brand new Samsung Galaxy s4 the HTC One
as well as the galaxy s3 first off we
have quadrant which measures CPU
performance as well as how well each
phone handles gaming considering that
both the one and galaxy s4 have similar
quad-core processors compared to the
Galaxy s3 with a dual-core it's
definitely at a disadvantage and the
results show this well with both the one
and galaxy s4 coming out in a dead heat
at around 12,000 and the galaxy s3 it
nearly half that with about 6,000 next
we have Geekbench which is another
overall benchmark to measure the
performance of these devices this is
another great test of both normal usage
along with checking out exactly how well
each of these devices can handle
graphically intense games and here we
see the galaxy s4 with a very impressive
score of 3229
followed by the one at 2811 and finally
the GS 3 with just 1393 points the next
test 3d mark focuses purely on how well
the phone stack up with a very detailed
and complicated game unfortunately I
wasn't able to get the galaxy s3 to
complete the benchmark but both the 1
and GS 4 were able to handle it no
problem and both did an entirely decent
job at keeping up the final scores were
pretty close as well the one with six
thousand four hundred and eighty-one
points and the GS 4 narrowly beating it
out at six thousand seven hundred and
eighteen points last but not least we
have + row bench to test how fast the
internal storage of the phones is the
galaxy s4 posted an impressive 75
megabytes per second read speed and 15
mega byte writes where the HTC One
delivered 58 and 18 Meg's and the galaxy
s3 delivered only 45 and 7 megabytes per
second based solely on the benchmarks
the galaxy s4 is a huge upgrade from the
s3 delivering over double the
performance at times making it a solid
upgrade spec wise the comparison with
the HTC One is much closer as both
phones deliver very similar experiences
however in almost all cases the Galaxy
s4 was slightly quicker giving it the
wind this time since of course specs
aren't everything I'm interested to know
which is your pick definitely let me
know in the comments below if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my unboxing of HTC One and if you
enjoyed be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and subscribe for the full
review
of both the HTC one and galaxy s4 anyway
guys I will catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
