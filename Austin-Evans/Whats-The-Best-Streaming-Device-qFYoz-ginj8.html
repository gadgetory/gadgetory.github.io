options for streaming which one should
you go for getting things off is the
Nvidia shield and I have to give him
video props here they wanted to sponsor
a no-holds-barred comparison which is
awesome up against it is the all-new
fourth generation Apple TV which is seen
a major overhaul the Roku 4 which
delivers 4k on a budget and the new
Amazon fire TV gaming Edition unlike the
majority of streaming devices the shield
looks a lot more like a game console
powered by an NVIDIA Tegra x1 processor
it's no joke when it comes to
performance and it has everything you
need to take advantage of it with the
included game controller even though
it's on the larger side it's a
comfortable gamepad with a rechargeable
battery and traditional layout of the
buttons and stakes
it's outfitted with a 4k HDMI 2.0 port
gigabit ethernet 2 USB 3 ports microUSB
along with microSD this is important as
with 16 gigabytes of storage out of the
box you'll probably want to add a
microSD ease a USB Drive or even opt for
the 500 cake pro model moving on we've
got the new Apple TV on the surface this
looks basically identical the main
difference is that it's taller than the
last generation but still small enough
to blend into your setup included is a
new remote a lightning cable to charge
it along with a small power cable for
the Apple TV the remote is about the
same size of the last one but it has a
glass touchpad along with a few
dedicated buttons like volume in Siri
the Apple TV itself is pretty basic when
it comes to ports there's an Ethernet
jack
along with HDMI USB C and the power
cable
there's no expandable storage but it
does come with 32 gigabytes with a 64
gig option which is helpful next up we
have the Amazon fire TV this is the
gaming Edition which comes with an
updated controller and a 32 gigabyte
micro SD card but that's not the only
difference the new fire TV also supports
4k unfortunately it's only 4k at 30
Hertz but it's better than the Apple TV
that doesn't support 4k at all the
controller is really nice though it's a
big improvement over the last version
with nice balance and a tapered grip
it's a small set-top box with the USB
port microSD slot Ethernet HDMI and a
power connector you'll definitely want
to use that microSD card to the fire TV
only has around five gigs available out
of the box lastly we have the new Roku 4
this is quite a bit larger than the fire
TV it looks like someone squashed and
older Roku its unassuming enough to
blend into your setup though and comes
with a solid remote it's not as premium
as the app
ZV but as a headphone jack and volume
control built-in while the hardware is
important in the end it really comes
down to what you can do with it the
Nvidia shield is running Android TV
which I really like it's great to
navigate and gives you a seriously
useful voice search Austin Evans ok
that's that's cool there are solid
amount of streaming apps available for
the shield and it also works with Google
cast from your phone that gives you
access to a ton of services it also
supports 4k 60 frames video from Netflix
and YouTube especially if you use google
apps Android TV really makes sense the
Apple TV is also a nice improvement over
the last generation everything from the
set up which uses your phone to subtle
things like video screen savers make it
a nice experience to use it has a very
nice interface and while some of the
apps like YouTube aren't quite as nice
there's a good selection of video apps
available the fire TV is a slightly
different take on things the interface
is a series of main sections with
additional options on the sides which
works but it isn't the most intuitive
way to navigate it is quick though as
you'd expect and you'll find all the
staples like Netflix Hulu HBO now along
with Amazon Prime video but there's one
big exception YouTube there is a
third-party app that uses the web UI
which is usable but as a heavy YouTube
user it's a bit of a disappointment
things are a bit behind on the Roku side
the interface looks more dated and it's
not as quick to get around as the others
it's easy enough to navigate but it just
feels out of date in comparison there's
a good selection of apps but many of
them like YouTube and especially Google
Play just feel dated the voice search
works for some things but it's quite a
bit behind the others Breaking Bad one
of the biggest advantages of the shield
is gaming with the controller included
in the box you can play some serious
games like half-life 2 as well as the
Talos principle both of which looks
seriously impressive for a streaming
device it even handles more ambitious
titles like war thunder pretty well if
you have a decent internet connection
you can also strain PC games using
GeForce now it's like Netflix for games
you pay eight dollars a month to stream
as many titles as you'd like in practice
it's cool there's a slight amount of
latency but it's usable especially if
you're connected via ethernet the game
selection is a massive but with a free
three-month trial it's worth a shot
the Apple TV handles gaming a little
differently you'll mostly find games
that were originally made for the iPhone
mini games look nice which considering
there's an Apple a8 under the hood
should be a huge
prai's but while the remote is fine for
casual games it's not really meant for
more serious titles with TV OS being so
new time will tell how the game library
turns out but for now it's all about
potential the fire TV takes gaming more
seriously you'll find staple like
Minecraft Pocket Edition which works
well here especially with the impressive
controller and games like tell tales
minecraft story mode to make sure you're
getting your minecraft fix you've got
some Ultra classics too like GTA san
andreas library isn't massive but
there's some pretty quality titles the
Roku technically gains but it's not
really in the same league as the others
unless you're down to play snake all day
in which case you're totally set if
you're really into Roku it gets the job
done but there are better options out
there the fire TV is technically cheap
this option here if you don't want the
gaming Edition and while it's good
there's not a lot to recommend it over
the others there's a lot to like with
the Apple TV but it's not a massive leap
over the last generation and you really
need to be deep in the Apple ecosystem
to get the most out of it when it comes
to gaming the clear winner is the shield
it's also a solid streaming box as well
with support for 4k and a massive
library of apps when you include Google
cast so which is your favorite streaming
device let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
