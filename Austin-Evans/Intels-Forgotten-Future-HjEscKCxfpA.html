not look like much but inside is one of
these strangest stories in Intel's
history so this is the Intel nook 8 I
three cym Intel have been selling these
little nuts for quite a while and some
of them pretty cool last year we took a
look at this skull canyon nook which had
a proper amount of gaining power and a
tiny package with a lowly core i3 inside
this does not look nearly as impressive
and that's because it's not at least on
paper
so traditionally intel has used what is
known as the tick tock model not to be
confused with tick tock the tick tock so
essentially there are two different ways
of building a new chip first of all you
just start with the big stuff the
architectures the things will actually
legitimately make it faster year-on-year
once you do that the next iteration we
just take that design and shrink it to a
smaller process node so if we get a
little bit of Michael's toys action let
me show what happened just a couple
years ago not is that really bad Square
even though I have a ruler anyway so say
that this is a previous generation this
would be 14 a mere which is pretty much
what all single Intel processors use
today this strategy works great until
they hit the ten nanometer node now this
is what the Canon like chip inside is
based on and unfortunately well they
have some road bumps so the evasion
going to a smaller process note is that
you can cram more more transistors into
a smaller and smaller area so if we have
a quad-core processor and this is very
simplified what you're getting here is
basically the same number of cores but
just in a smaller area which means that
not only is the chip either cheaper to
produce or you can actually fit more
cores so in theory if you had a 10
nanometer chip which is the same size as
the old one it could be a 6 core design
as opposed to a quad-core one so when I
say 40 nanometer and 10 nanometer what
I'm referring to is the process
technology used to actually build these
chips so think of it like this if I'm
trying to draw something really precise
it's the difference between using like a
sharpie and a pen it is a much finer
grained tool which it could be much more
precise with the small of the tip to be
more precise and the more stuff you can
cram
to these tiny tiny little lines this is
absolutely key to the reason why
computers have advanced so much over the
last 50 years every time you get a
smaller and smaller process node it
means you can more densely pack it with
transistors which can be spent on things
like the CPU the GPU really this is
absolutely the reason why things are a
hundred million times faster than they
were in 1972 now the downside here is
that these smaller and smaller you get
the more difficult it is to actually
pack all these transistors
I mean seriously at a certain point you
hit the atomic level where there's
things don't really get much smaller
from 2006 to 2014 every two years until
we're able to shrink the process over
and over and over again that is until
2014 where they hit a huge huge wall now
this force Intel to get very creative
with their updates without the advantage
of being able to constantly change their
process instead they did things like add
more CPU cores to pretty much their
entire lineup which brings us to the
cannon Lake CPU inside this nook now
originally it was supposed to ship as a
seventh generation part all the way back
in 2016 as you might imagine things
didn't quite go that smoothly so why
should anyone care about this little
knock because inside this is running
Intel's ten nanometers can and like
processor and up until this point is the
very first and only device that's
shipped with it so to compare I have
well maybe not a perfect apples to
apples comparison however this is an
aspire a five it does have a very
similar with respect to core i3 just a
14 nanometer version as opposed to the
10 nanometer inside the nook put these
two side-by-side and they're about as
close as it gets
they're both dual-core processors they
both have hyper threading they both have
a two point two gigahertz base really
the only difference is the laptop has a
slightly higher turbo and three point
four versus three point two besides that
it's gonna be about well this is about
as close as I can get a comparison so
first of all let's start out with key
bench no I'm not expecting any huge
performance differences but what's
interesting about this is that the
Kenlake chip inside is pretty much
entirely undocumented now yes on the ark
Intel site you can see that it does
confirm at least this 10 nanometer but
besides that this is an entirely new CPU
architecture which has basically never
been talked about before it's unusual
because usually when
until brings out a new series of chips
they're way more on top of talking about
the different specs and everything that
they've done to improve it but with this
it's like it was a weird half-step then
they're never actually really fully
acknowledged okay
so very very close the Nook is very
slightly quicker in single-core and a
little bit quicker in multi-core but
honestly that's close enough that I
would consider it to be basically a draw
next let's give sentiment a try in any
case it definitely does not look like
Kenlake is any kind of major improvement
as far as IPC goes it's very very close
so in this one the laptop wins by a
little bit 353 versus 331 I'm pretty
sure that's entirely just that slightly
higher turbo I want to give a huge shout
out to Ian from a non tech Vern le
helping me research for this video but
also doing a terrific write-up all about
the incredible saga that was Intel's 10
nanometer process the fact that this is
a product that is in my hand in 2019 is
kind of incredible because for all
intents and purposes Kenlake has been
completely shelved at this point so
where are things today
well Intel has pretty much given up on
the Canon Lake chips in favor of going
straight to ice lake which in theory
will be shipping later this year on a 10
animated process with improved
architecture essentially it's a take on
a talk rolled into one
meanwhile we have the nook is what is
arguably one of the only examples of an
Intel future that we never got to
experience although judging by the
performance wasn't all that exciting to
begin with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
