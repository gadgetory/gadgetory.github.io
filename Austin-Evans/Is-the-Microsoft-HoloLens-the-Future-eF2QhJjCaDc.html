ridiculous I must look right now hey
guys this is Austin is the microsoft
hololens the future well there's been a
lot of talk about virtual reality
headsets the whole lens is something a
little different you're able to walk
around and fully interact with the world
with straight Minority Report stuff like
floating web pages and Holograms for a
Developer Kit it actually comes with a
pretty solid unboxing experience open it
up and you'll see the hololens comes
with a cool carrying case inside though
is where the real magic aids what really
jumps out of me is just how polished the
hololens already feels compared to early
VR headsets like oculus this looks like
a product you could buy today which I
guess shouldn't be a huge surprise
coming from a company like Microsoft the
crazy thing is this is fully untethered
there's no need to be attached to a PC
to handle stuff like rendering or
needing to set up a bunch of sensors
around your room there's some serious
power inside too Microsoft is still
being very vague about what actually
makes it all work there's some custom
silicon inside but it seems like a lot
of the heavy lifting is being handled by
the sensors it doesn't get warm or even
uncomfortable after wearing it for a
while and the battery will last around
three hours which is impressive for
what's essentially a full holographic
computer that lives on your face pull
the hololens on run a quick scan of the
room and you're ready to go the thing
that makes the hololens special is the
holographic display this isn't like a
traditional screen as it's fully
transparent until there's something to
actually see it only does this make
interacting with the real world dead
simple since your vision isn't obscured
it also means the Holograms can be
incredibly sharp what really blew me
away is the tracking it's almost perfect
walk around the room move around as much
as you want it doesn't matter if you put
a browser window against a wall it's not
going anywhere which can actually lead
to funny problems like forgetting where
you put something in real space it's
easy to imagine a desk setup where
you're using the hololens and you have
different browser windows and research
projects on your desk on the wall in
front of you this is really cool stuff a
lot of what makes this special comes
down to this being something that adds
to your vision not replacing it
altogether you can still see everything
around you and talk with people but
there might just be aliens flying around
the room or a browser tab on the wall
behind them the biggest learning curve
is control the hololens relies in a
couple gestures like clicking with one
finger and opening your hand to pull up
a menu these work where they can get a
little tiring to constantly have your
hand held out in front of you to select
things what's interesting is that the
screen doesn't work off excisional
resolution since its measured and raised
light but there's clearly more detail on
the hololens than any VR headset I've
ever tried even small Tech's from across
the room is readable which is something
that even the recording can fully get
across the biggest issue is the field of
view it's fairly small so I'm recording
with this super-awesome iPhone mount so
this is actually pretty close to what
you would see through the hololens so
you can see it looks nice in the
tracking is good however example if I
look at something like this the field of
view is not enormous so you can see that
it's still a little bit transparent
alright so you can kinda see behind that
window and everything the field of view
it's decent enough and especially with
things that are kind of transparent like
that like this looks fine this looks
fine it's only when you get to bigger
more complex things that you really
realize that it's a little bit lacking
there's also some color shifting you can
notice in the screen especially in pure
white areas but again it's really not
that bad it's clear that Microsoft
focused on the hard stuff like making
the tracking work and fitting all this
Hardware inside a fully portable headset
the hololens really is something you
have to try to fully appreciate with the
hardware already being so polished the
biggest thing holding it back seems to
be getting developers to actually create
software for it but since it's running a
version of Windows 10 it's not too crazy
to port stuff over and since this is one
of the very first developer kits it's
just going to take time I've got to give
a huge shout out to my friends Adam and
Glen from master shapes for letting me
borrow their hololens and shoot a video
they're awesome and so is the hololens
this is absolutely the future so what do
you guys think about the hololens let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
