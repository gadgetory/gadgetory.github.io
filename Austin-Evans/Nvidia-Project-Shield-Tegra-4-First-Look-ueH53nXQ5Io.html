from CES 2013 at the Nvidia booth with
their brand-new project shield now this
is powered by their brand-new Tegra 4
quad core processor which promises
really powerful performance can run 4k
TVs and all kinds of stuff so let's take
a look so if you take a look at the
project shield it looks a little bit
funny
so there is a 5-inch display and below
that is what almost looks like an Xbox
360 controller and they just kind of
merge together now looking at the
pictures before I got here I was a
little skeptical it was a little sketchy
but now that I've seen it actually does
look like it's fairly ergonomic so
instead of using something like a 3d s
or feet or something like that which is
a little bit flat actually has
definitely something you can grab onto
project shield runs Android so the cool
thing about this is totally unscanned so
you can go ahead and grab all of your
games from the Play Store pretty much
anything
Angry Birds whatever will work on the
project shield now they aren't letting
us get our hands on it's from an Euler
guide through this plastic booth but it
definitely looks like a pretty big
console so even though it's going to be
portable not necessarily pocketable
you'll see about that part as far as
when you can get your hands on one of
these it should be available a little
bit later on this year for an
undisclosed price so we'll see I'm
definitely betting that's gonna be a
little bit more expensive than something
like a normal phone of course since you
have the full you know gaming controls
and all that kind of fun stuff but
definitely is a very interesting look
and especially with Tegra 4 it is just
as powerful if not more powerful pretty
much any other kind of handheld console
and in fact it's getting very close to
xbox and playstation level graphics
which is awesome anyway guys if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more CES 2013 content like
this be sure to subscribe anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
