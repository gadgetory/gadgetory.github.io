one of the most popular games in the
world right now one of the things that
makes it special is it will run on
almost anything so unlike some of our
previous videos where we restricted
ourselves to a mere single laptop today
we're going to be playing fortnight on
every single platform that it supports
so you may live with this the 200 HP
stream from our first fortnight video
this is not exactly the greatest
experience in the world but it is about
as low end of a PC as you could possibly
play fortnight on with a cool 360 P
resolution and all settings set to low
our avatar do is looking a little bit
pixelated but importantly we are going
to be recording over HDMI so we don't
interfere with any of the performance of
this laptop oh boy alright we're in the
game and that is a smooth eight frames
per second wow this is really really bad
look at the textures the filtering is
really really on point I mean that's a
big blob that's a mildly shell-shaped
blob a bunch of tree blobs we've got a
cliff blob oh we've got some really
nice-looking tree blobs up here wow
that's actually oh wow that wait what
but okay that's that's a really unique
looking tree blob you know what let's
just move on to something that's a
little bit better than a $200 basic
Windows computer so this might sound
like a bad idea but for that we'll also
run on the Mac so here I have a maxed
out 2016 15 inch MacBook Pro now it does
have dedicated graphics so you shouldn't
expect anything too crazy it will run
the game oh that's not good the game
just crashed on the Mac okay yep okay
that's not working so the Mac port of
Fortnight is not exactly great as you
can see by my face right now if that's
too low in for you where you can step
all the way up to the iPhone se which
amazingly enough is actually still
supported by fortnight even though it's
hardware from the iPhone 6s one of the
first things you'll notice is that while
the UI is fine on something like a
laptop or even something like a ps4 when
you shrink it down to a 4-inch display
it is very very hard to see as you can
imagine fortnight running on the iPhone
se is running on its lowest settings
however it actually is not going to be
unplayable
so one of the things you do have to keep
in mind is that while this screen itself
is going to be sub 720p it's not gonna
be the sharpest sort of presentation in
the world but I've got to say on such a
small display it actually doesn't look
bad a lot better than most other mobile
games framerate wise it's not going to
be the smoothest thing in the world but
we do look like we're keeping a
relatively close lock to 30 frames you
don't have an easy way of actually
counting a framerate on the mobile site
but I mean not bad even though the SE is
a couple years old it still does have a
reasonably decent hardware so in
fortnight comes out on android in the
next few months I'm really curious to
see what kind of hardware that's going
to support but as far as I can say for
the SE this is totally playable a little
bit on the lower side but yeah not bad
step up to the iPhone 10 and you're
going to be getting a surprising jump in
quality so eventually jump into the menu
here just like on the PC we have a bunch
of different quality settings and the
iPhone Tim will default to epic now the
iPhone 10 does have that wider aspect
ratio well it looks a little bit weird
when we're recording when you're
actually playing it on the phone it does
fully take up the screen it does give
you a bit of a wider field of view the
difference in quality settings is also
pretty apparent now this is not going to
be writing at the full resolution it
looks like it's something a little bit
closer to maybe 900 P or even 1080p if I
had to take a guess but the quality
settings I mean you can see the texture
filtering the view distance everything
looks to be a lot smoother although
frame rate still seems to be pretty
close to 30 frames per second now of
course an issue with both iPhone
versions is that you do have to use the
touch controls now personally I
definitely prefer something like the
switch where we can actually use the
physical controls but hopefully
especially with the Android version
coming soon there will be some
controller support added for now though
this actually isn't going to be too bad
as far as a first person or third person
shooter goes the right size which you
use to scroll around the left side is
what you use to walk and it's easy
enough to just tap on things to select
them but controllers are always better
not sure this is not going to look as
good as some of the other devices that
will be trying here in the video but for
a lot of the game I mean look at this
we've got like nice reflections on the
water
we've got decent draw distance the
lighting really doesn't seem to be
hugely impacted and that seemed like God
raised or anything here but it's not
going to be that far off from something
like a console or at least in theory
next up we've got the ps4 you know as
long as you haven't tried to login on
your switch or anything so this is going
to be supported of course on the ps4 Pro
as well
but for this video actually I wanted to
look at how it's going to perform on the
standard original launch ps4 well the
biggest changes with the ps4 Edition
over what we've done so far is that we
actually get a smooth 60 frames per
second now it's not going to be a
complete lock but this is so much
smoother and especially when it comes to
the responsiveness is going to be a lot
more competitive than any of the other
systems that we've taken a look at so
far so the ps4 does target 1080p
although typically speaking when you're
running at 60 frames per second it's
running at a slightly lower resolution
but we do get the upgrade detail and
most importantly we get that smooth
frame rate I can't tell you how much but
it's just so much better actually don't
know this off the top of my head but I
would guess that the ps4 is probably the
most common way that people are playing
for tonight so if you weren't of course
you can run it on ps4 pro we're gonna
take a look at some of the higher-end
console stuff in a minute but the
important thing to know is that even on
a completely stock base ps4 that came
out you know in 2013 we're getting a
nice smooth frame rate and we're going
to be getting those what for the
ultimate console experience you're going
to want to pick up an Xbox 1x Milly's
this have a lot more power with a full 6
teraflop GPU but that power is going to
enable us to play at basically a locked
4k 60 frame per seconds may not quite
locked that's going to be a big jump
over the ps4 as well as especially the
base Xbox one this is the way to play
Fortnight so not only are we going to be
getting that nice smooth frame rate
we're also going to be getting the 4k
resolution as well as the upgrade
settings so stuff like draw distance
texture filtering we're going to be
getting some slightly higher res
textures yeah this looks pretty nice and
on top of that we're still playing on
console so it's not quite the maximum
experience that we can have with
Fortnight just yet next up we have the
newest version of Fortnight this switch
Edition so as a console that as you
would expect is going to be a little bit
more powerful than the iPhone se we are
going to be getting the full experience
here say for the wall save-the-world
mode but does anyone actually play that
some of the biggest issues with the
switch port actually is Sony's fault so
if you've ever logged in to your epic
account on a ps4 you're actually locked
out of logging in on the switch which
caused a lot of people a lot of hassle
although thankfully I never played on
ps4 with my main account so we're good
ah yes the joy of physical controls
don't get me wrong the iPhone version is
fine and for touchscreen controls it's
really
not bad but playing with joy Kahn's
really does feel a lot better and it
actually is not really going to be a
huge difference regardless of whether
you're going to be playing in doctor
mode like we are here or in portable
mode on the switch you're still going to
be getting the same controls just a
little bit of a graphical difference and
while a much much bigger screen so the
switch does operate with a dynamic
resolution up to 950 as I got shot in
the back so if it had a higher
resolution I totally would not have died
there because I need the extra pixels to
see people behind one of the downsides
are playing on the switch is that unlike
on the Xbox one and ps4 we are going to
be limited to 30 frames per second but
don't get me wrong it actually does a
reasonably decent job of holding to that
but when you're playing against other
people on consoles who are running it
double the frame rate you're just not
going to have as responsive of gameplay
it's not going to quite hold up last but
certainly not least we have a high-end
PC so this is actually not a dedicated
game PC this is what we built to do
streaming on but we've still got some
solid hardware inside including the
second gen arise in 720 700 X running at
about 4 gigahertz as well as 16 gigs of
RAM and a gtx 770 7770 to show you just
how far you can push fortnight we're not
even actually running it on maxed out
settings here so we've got sets of 1800
P and on high settings so in theory if
we had something like a Titan we could
push it even farther but importantly
we're getting a near 4k res and we're
still able to stay above 60 frames per
second for the most part once you get to
something like the Xbox one X going up
to PC actually doesn't make a huge
difference really where you're seeing
the major advantages earned stuff like
high frame rate support if you want to
play on a high refresh rate monitor and
of course you get full mouse and
keyboard support but the visual quality
I mean look at this this is just
obscenely nice-looking it doesn't hurt
the Fortnight is very colourful very
nice looking vibrant game yeah that's
nice and smooth so with a full 8 quart
rise in CPU which honestly is slight
overkill for this game but the gtx 1070
does make a huge difference of course if
you want to go higher you can go higher
but as far as a near 4k experience goes
I'm not really gonna complain here
alright I will say it's not too bad
playing for night on touchscreen it's a
lot better on a actual controller when
you get a mouse and keyboard especially
with a nice
setup that you're able to get at least
60 frames-per-second on for tonight
feels so much better
it's crazy of how this video started and
where we are now so that my friends is
fortnight on every single system that
you can play it on right now
so everything from a 200 ollar potato
quality PC all the way up to something
that actually can play it it basically
4k maxed out but of course the real
question is how does the Android version
gonna lock oh boy I can't wait to play
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
