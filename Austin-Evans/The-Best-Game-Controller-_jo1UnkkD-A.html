ton of different controllers to choose
from but which one is the best find out
I gathered a few of the best ones around
and to start with we have the
PlayStation 4 Dual Shock 4 this is a big
improvement over the last generation
however there are a couple other options
that you might want to look at including
the Xbox one elite now this is a control
that honestly I think is probably one of
the best that I've ever tried you have
customizable things like the d-pad you
can adjust how the sticks are there's a
lot that you can do even with paddles on
the back however we can even take it a
step farther if you really want to get
on that customization game Xbox has a
design lab option so essentially what
this allows to do is take a standard
Xbox one controller which is already
good and pretty much customize it
however you want and by customizing
however you want I mean give it a
different paint job you actually can't
get all of the extra buttons and stuff
from the elite money unless you get one
of these but that's really you designed
it we built it well let's see what I
actually designed alright it's orange so
this is the masterpiece of a controller
that we made it's got that whole
creamsicle vibe with the orange get the
orange grips and the white everywhere
well you have a little bit of grey on
the thumb sticks as well as the buttons
and if you want to take it one step
farther you can add a message to the
controller so I added my gamertag also
my twitter and my facebook and my
history on to Felicio checking out
what's in the description but on top of
that you can also get on your controller
and of course since this is a standard
Xbox one controller
it comes with double-a batteries because
I don't know
Microsoft hates rechargeables I have no
idea if you really want to take things
to the next level you can get a scuf
controller now this is the version for
the Xbox however there also is a ps4
version did you order this controller I
don't know if I actually know what this
controller looks like this is so this is
a Ken's special right here I picked out
the awesome creamsicle look of this one
this scuf controller I have no idea what
it looks like oh no oh no Ken what is
this what is this
can we okay so it is the ugliest
color all time mmm good that is yeah
okay um so if you want to scuff
controller that looks like this your boy
can all hook you up I guess do you see
that scuf controller its red and black
why don't you get one of these look what
look you know what this feels like this
feels like when you go in to like Subway
and okay what options would you like and
you have that moment of panic of like I
want anchovies and spinach and Bologna
and the the sweetbreads and then you get
this and then you wonder where you at
roughly I should you like the texture on
the back of this thing it's very you
know it feels almost like a like a truck
bedliner if you ever felt one of those
like kind of rubbery things um that's
definitely not going anywhere
something else you get with scuff are
paddles so this is one of the things you
can customize before you order the
controller so we went all out and got
all four but these are mapable to say
like your face buttons or basically
whatever you want I believe I mean to be
fair this is like by far the most
expensive controller here so what expect
it to be cool but this is Larry what's
cool is all of these controllers will
not only work on the console but also
for PC so on the Xbox one side of things
they all work out of the box if you plug
them in via USB in the newer ones such
as the Xbox one design lab controllers
have Bluetooth built in if you don't
want to use bluetooth you can also pick
up the adapter so this is just a little
USB wireless adapter for the Xbox one so
even with some of the older controllers
that don't have bluetooth plug this into
your computer and you're good to go
the same thing applies for ps4 so if you
pick up the DualShock 4 adapter for PC
it actually works for Mac too if you
want to do that for some reason then you
should pick up this guy plug it in and
you're up and running with the DualShock
4 now that's what you want the
advantages of the DualShock 4 is that
it's cheap so right now it's around $45
or so but you usually can find them for
around 50 and that's cheaper than
much anything else here and of course
you can get a standard Xbox one
controller for about that price Lucian's
you get into the custom options it gets
pricing so the design lab controller is
$80 now that does give you full
customization of all the colors and
buttons and everything and from $90 you
can get your name engraved on it so it's
not that much of a price premium however
when you get up to the elite it gets
pricey this guy is a hundred and fifty
dollars mind you it does come with this
carrying case which not only is a nice
place to store your controller but you
also get a ton of different options for
it so for example you can add your
paddles which just pop right on here and
what's cool is all these are completely
magnetic so if we want we can get all of
our paddles and with the Xbox one elite
you actually have a button right up top
here so you can slide between two
different profiles so that's easy and on
the Xbox you can actually select tons of
different profiles and have them saved
so for example we can have a custom
controller set up for say Forza even one
for Call of Duty one for battlefield
whatever you want the idea that
everything on the elite controller is
based on magnets is really cool too
so if you want say a domes thumb stick
you can easily swap that on or if you
want something a little bit taller it
just pops right on you're good to go and
like I said earlier the scuff is
definitely going to cost you so if you
just want more of an aesthetic build
some kind of like the design lab you're
talking about and around $120 range
however if you really want all the bells
and whistles with the custom grips and
the paddles and all that kind of stuff
this thing is gonna cost you the big
question though is with all these
controllers here sure it's nice to see
which one looks the coolest but which
one is actually the best one for gaming
can you gonna like make it Pier at a
rate yeah just a bruise right there this
is gonna like you ignore all like my
mouth noises like add actually like a
cool sound effect and then like as I
wave my hands I got a puff of smoke and
then the computer peers got that so to
start with we have the design lab
controller now even though on the
outside this is a custom controller on
the inside it's pretty much exactly the
same as any other Xbox controller
because of that it's solid so while sure
it doesn't have some of the cool paddles
of the
yeah illipe what's cool about the design
lab controllers is that since they're
all based on the updated Xbox one
controller with bluetooth and the
headphone jack it means that while you
can still use this with the PC and the
standard wireless adapter if your
computer has bluetooth you can just pair
it right up and it's going to work right
out of the box next we have the elite
controller so they're actually a couple
of advantages to this and one of the
more subtle things is just the feel of
the controller so it's a little bit
heavier and I really like the slightly
kind of that's a grippy sort of texture
but it's like a very soft rubber um it
doesn't sound like it would be good on a
controller but it actually feels nice
next we have the scuf controller so this
one's a little bit more of a mixed bag
on one hand it feels solid so I like the
grip and the way the thumb sticks our
way it actually is really nice however
the thing is you're paying a lot for
this and honestly it doesn't really feel
that much different than another Xbox
controller the thing is I prefer the way
the elite controller does customization
so say I'm playing horizon 3 right now
and I only want two paddles well so easy
just taking them off or say swapping
thumb sticks out whereas with the scuff
what you order is pretty much what you
get last but not least we have the dual
shock for now if you're on a PC you
actually have a lot of choices how are
on the ps4 it's pretty much this or a
scuff now on the PC you can get the dual
shock for to work and of course it's not
a bad controller but it's going to
require some work like the Xbox
controller if your computer has
bluetooth you can pair it that way and
otherwise you can pick up the wireless
adapter or use a USB cable however
unlike the Xbox controller it is not
natively supported in Windows so what
that means is either you have to rely on
a couple rare games that actually
natively support it which is not easy to
find or you need to use a program such
as ds4 for Windows now that's going to
let this emulate an Xbox 360 controller
and as you can see it works just fine
once you get it set up but it is not as
smooth as just plugging it in and
getting it going like the Xbox one so
what is the best game controller now if
you hadn't noticed it didn't include
every controller of all time and that's
for good reason these are my favorites
however if I had to pick just one it
would be the standard Xbox one
this is controller I feel like is a
really nice sweet spot of something
that's nice and comfortable to use it
has a
lot of cool features this works pretty
much everywhere that you want to gain if
you have a little bit more money to
spend the elite controller is a good
option but my biggest problem with it is
that while I do prefer to the Xbox
controller
it's triple the price and honestly it's
hard to justify so I'm curious what's
your guys's favorite controller
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below and of course if you guys
want to check out any of the ones I took
a look at in this video the links will
be in the description anyway guys thank
you so much for watching and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
