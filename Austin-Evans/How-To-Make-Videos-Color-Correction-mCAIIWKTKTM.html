of videos on how to improve your video
quality so then going to be talking
about how to use video editing and color
correction to make your videos look
better so I have filmed to test clips
for Wes here so today we've got a just
kind of a shot of some plants and
whatnot kind of billowing in the wind we
also have a shot of some clouds which
you guys kind of actually that's a
thunderstorm starting to develop kind of
neat little time lapse of the clouds so
let's go ahead and show you guys how I
did this so so start with let's just
grab the clips and just do some color
correction on them questions going to
vary where it is and you know the
details and all accounts stuff depending
on your what your video whether it is
but as long as it's a halfway competent
edit or should have at least some form
of color correction built in all right
so there's a few different things that
we have here so we have a the hue so we
could adjust that a little bit basically
it's just kind of the overall colors of
it I'm actually going to leave that
alone but you can certainly do a lot to
kind of make the video pop and whatnot
but again I'm gonna leave the hue alone
and instead of go ahead and take a look
at the contraception rather saturation
is just how colorful the video is for
something like this it's all green it's
all nature we really ought to bump the
saturation out but you guys can see here
it's a little sound horrible but a
little bit washed out so let's crank up
the saturation some one tip when you're
editing your colors is small small small
changes don't go grab it and drag it to
fifty percent you guys can see if I you
know drag the saturation way up its
going to look awful yeah I mean that
that's just that's just kind of absurd
and the same thing if I crank this
situation down it's actually not awful
it's actually rather nice there so you
can get still get some green here but
everything else is about black and white
but again this is a kind of nature scene
so I think having a decent Madison
someone right about there is going to be
good another thing you can learn is that
there's no really there's it's not like
you can do it wrong I mean if you drag
everything up and down mate look awful
yeah that's kind of wrong but a lot of
is just kind of in your opinion what you
think looks good if you think you know
should be really dark and contrast high
contrast you want really really
saturated and really bright I mean it's
kind of just kind of comes down to your
own judgment on what you
so let's take a look at the brightness I
think we may want to go just a bit
higher on this somewhere around or 66
there we got Alex about right and then
we can also edit the contrast and the
contrast you guys to see if I turn it
down kind of makes a little bit grey
kind of brings out some more of the
details but a lot of time you can see it
kind of washes it out on the other hand
if we cranked contrast up and we'll just
well it'll just look awful so at this
point we're going to do ahead and do
something a little bit more moderate the
video was pretty close when I shot it so
doesn't require that much so it's good
sincere that's actually looking pretty
good and if i reset everything kind of
show you guys what it looked like
forehand employee this is what it did
look like but after our video editing
and color correction we've got this so I
think that looks much nicer now
something else you can do and this is
just some things totally optional I did
was I made it look anamorphic sincere
had these black bars on top and bottom
some letterboxing basically I did this
just to make the video look a little bit
more cinematic now this works a lot
better if you have a wide angle lens if
you got a nice wide shot it doesn't
really do anything that great obviously
we're cropping off some of the top and
the bottom of the frame but if you want
to do this it certainly will make it
look a little bit more movie like and
whatnots but of course that's totally
optional but I think it rather adds to
the scene alright so the next thing is
and in fact let's go ahead and select
this is our videos will scrub through
here and out there and let's edit our
video of the clouds same premise we're
just going to go ahead and do some
little bit quicker adding here since you
guys should hopefully understand the
basics of it so a little bit of
saturation I think that's a shoe me
bright now pull handle at gamma the
contrast I think there's going to be a
bit high ya think yeah there we go plot
some of the detail in the clouds you
know with a shot like this it's all
white and blue and kind of moles
together so we want to kind of bring out
some of the shadows and some of the
individual clouds and then let's go
ahead and turn the gamma down now gamma
if I turn it up you guys can see here it
kind of well whitens it damp game is not
quite as easy to it's not quite like
brightness make sure you having a hard
time explaining it but hopefully you
guys going to tell the effects having
that looks really good are there
yeah i think it's about perfect as soon
as you can see here again i will reset
all this and show you how to show you
what it looked like before and then
after so wait for my computer to catch
up here so this is what it looked like
before and after some video editing it
looks a lot better we can still see the
blues it still looks much much better
and of course i also did and do a time
lapse on this so as you guys can see
here compared to the beginning shot that
i did is kind of slow obviously i did
about two minutes of video and sped it
out to about 10 12 seconds or so so I I
sped up quite a bit so you can see the
kind of the clouds forming thing goes
for the first shot you know I just
didn't do any time lapse but I did do of
course the color correction and did the
over light and make it look a little bit
more cinematic anyway guys that's about
it for my video children how to make
your videos pop more now this is
certainly by no means and comprehensive
guide there's a lot more you can do with
color correction and there's other
little tips and tricks that you can do
this is what I like to I want to make my
biggest look a little bit better at more
color contrast you name it kind of
helped them pop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
