little bit of spring cleaning I guess
you could say and organizing my tons of
junk and actually it kind of got me
thinking while I've got it all out
spread all over the place
wanna make a video and kind of show you
guys some of my well pretty much all of
my great old tech I mean I've got all
kinds of stuff from you know original
game boys I've got you know an old DS
box
I've got iPod me I mean guys I've got
all kinds of awesome awesome old stuff
and I think you guys probably be pretty
interested in so yeah guys let's
questions you get this one started
okay guys so for the first thing I've
absolutely got to do is cover my very
very first video game console ever boom
the original PlayStation 1 yeah guys I
remember seriously I got I got this one
when I was 5 years old or so it was
great
I used to always go to the arcade and
stuff and my dad finally got tired of
you know paying to $3.00 the arcade like
all the time finally got me a
Playstation and I played this thing
seriously guys I probably played this
thing for seven eight you know I
probably played it I mean just forever
of course he got most you guys probably
seen the original PlayStation I mean
it's pretty large
actually I here we go Gran Turismo 2
guys seriously I spent so many years
playing this single game it is not even
funny I mean seriously
but the PlayStation 1 and also you know
if you guys want to hold on just a
second actually some of the games I got
and believe me when I say I got a lot of
games I mean all kinds them I won't go
through them all but I mean real fishing
pick up sorry my lights Conn kitchen
monopoly and my grand turismo which
actually came with two discs it's cool
actually there's the other disc you saw
the other one in there and then all kind
let's see if I gotta put my favorites
and see see I was pretty young had old
Rugrats games even hmm let's go through
a couple of these Harry Potter that was
actually a really fun game I remember
that got that long time ago fun game
awesome game here need for speed three
hop your shit up oh that was awesome
hardcore I don't go through all these
guys I won't go through all of these for
you guys but actually out here purpose
go through see here this guy shows you
how long I played the PlayStation this
was when the first games I got NASCAR 98
and this is one of the last ones NASCAR
2004 you can see I plug the PlayStation
4 a very very long time
okay guys that was PlayStation my very
first video game any kind of video game
love it love it love it you know just
just amazing
um so ii actually actually was the
second major thing I got continuous
video games
it's my Super Nintendo thank you guys
seeing this from the Nintendo console
wars but I got this honestly I did not
even when I got this probably a year or
two after I got my PlayStation back then
I really wasn't into graphics and stuff
so that was fine actually I actually
have couple cool things I'm go ahead and
do some unboxings of some old stuff
something last bit that
space invaders I actually found this
just the other day space invaders with
the original gang in the box and
actually I think I might have the owner
let the other one actually have the oh
the actual original paperwork I thought
this guy's might be fun
sit here warranty registration here we
go this who purchased the game what kind
of stuff that I should be able to some
reason
consumer information in with precautions
booklet how to go through some of this
stuff someday too but uh see here the
actual game and actually this one is
practically brand new I think I played
just once and for some reason I put it
back in the box and never play it again
so I'm not really sure what that was
about
but I actually have save the box from
the battleship now actually this game I
did like quite a bit and of course we
had the battleship and I did play the I
cassette I played this a lot actually I
don't know really why I saved the boxes
I guess I I was I had a fighter I had a
PlayStation back by then and I didn't
want throw away boxes pretty smart I
have that original battleship guide but
yeah I said the Super Nintendo was not I
only had a couple games for it and it
really wasn't a major thing to me back
then I mean I was just kind of like you
know something I had I figured I think I
actually I got this like when they quit
making them I've bought it it was really
really cheap I don't say that $40.00 or
something it was really cheap and I
bought it and I figured hey I'll go
ahead and see what this this Nintendo
deal is all about so pick this up
definitely really cool it's actually
practically brand-new really I never
really played it of course like I said
you guys wanna see more about this check
out the Nintendo console wars like the
first I won all right went over this in
depth but pretty cool I gotta admit that
okay guys so moving along seeing as I've
got a lot of old game console systems
and everything as well go ahead and go
to my first ever portable handheld now
this guy this so freaking many members
it's unreal my original Game Boy Color I
got this I can tell you guys a long
story but basically I got this back when
I was I don't know how old it was but
that was back I think is like 99 2000
something like that right when Pokemon
got huge
and you know my school absolutely was
just going crazy over it every kid had
one number you know you go to recess and
I mean seriously it gets the point where
everybody pulled out the gameboy in
battle nobody was even you know running
around or anything the teachers used to
go crazy it was it was hilarious but
yeah this game boy actually this one I'm
actually playing this actually right now
silver version and that was awesome
I'm actually decided to go play a couple
games on this it still works I'm perfect
love that color
so yeah game we'll call it awesome and
I've got a lot of really cool games and
stuff should just go through my one
actually if you guys this one's actually
I didn't know this at the time this is
actually called a brain boy it was
actually a pretty rare thing it only
worked with silver it actually worked
with a couple from Pokemon games it was
basically a cheat and to tell you how
big Pokemon was this thing only worked
with just a couple Pokemon games maybe
it was it was the Pokemon was that big
but to work it plug it in at this I mean
you plug the game in like that and then
you just turn on and it would allow you
to do a bunch of sheets and stuff I
showed you don't have enough time to go
through it all and then if you see right
here the focus is colorizer if you took
some of the old game boy games the old
pokemon games you could put it in here
and hit the colorizer button it would
change colors of course you can do that
on a gameboy color anyway but that was a
pretty cool deal let's see what else we
have
um just a lot of games a UVO game Tarak
Harry Potter Pokemon test drive that was
actually a really cool game that this
part you put up put a battery in there I
think of the triple-a and you put a
battery in the cart and show you guys
and you put battery in and actually yeah
actually rumbles which is really cool um
you know is a Game Boy game another
Pokemon game gettin those those pretty
big into Pokemon I mean of course I have
like literally guys I have like 50,000
more of them
you know I don't have them all right
with me right now
plus they're all and other places I also
had a gameshark I was big in the
cheating I remember these game sharps
actually guys these game sharks they
actually had a thing where you put the
codes in to cheat on different games
what was funny about these was that
actually expected you to cheat make your
own basically gave you instructions on
how to find your own hacks and it was
ridiculously complicated and I'm sure no
one ever did it at least I never did but
I always saw this hilarious that they
actually expected you to you can
actually use this and you know come up
with like 30 digit code on how to you
know walk through walls on game or
something like I always thought that was
hilarious okay guys so that's it for
right now and believe you're gonna say I
have so much more
I will definitely cover it later but for
now guys just leave it this but I've got
a question do you want me to do reviews
of any of these three I also have tons
of other stuff or maybe like you know
some of these games like the game sharp
or something seriously guys any of this
stuff you wanna know more about just let
me know and I will probably do a review
on it or something but anyway guys stay
tuned I will definitely be doing
literally prob about 20 more of these
videos to cover all the stuff up god
I mean it's unreal I spent like every
cent I had some time in those five -
well today on all kinds of just gang
boys Playstations Xboxes gang boys again
just all of it so yeah you guys I hope
you enjoyed this little walk through
memory lane and I will definitely be
doing many many hundreds more I think
