episode two of the ultimate smart home
paying things off we have the google
onhub router well it doesn't look like a
traditional router this has one big
advantage antennas a lot of them crack
the Box open and you'll see it's pretty
straightforward you get the on hub along
with a power adapter and a pair of
ethernet cables it's got a speaker on
top and a removable shroud which hides
the power connector USB 3 port and pair
of ethernet jacks they set up just plug
it in and download the onhub app for iOS
or Android and it walks you through
getting everything up and running it's
actually pretty smart you can see how
many devices are on the network and even
see the real 10 speeds or how much data
is being used by each device the biggest
advantage is if you live in a place that
has poor Wi-Fi reception the on hub has
6 2.4 gigahertz antennas 6 5 gigahertz
antennas and an extra antenna that scans
for the best bands to use in congested
areas I was consistently able to pull
rock-solid speeds in areas where the old
router gave out and on hub also supports
controlling smart home devices like
Bluetooth smart we even more following
that we have the amcrest Pro HD security
camera and big thanks to empress for
sponsoring this episode
pop open the box and you'll see the pro
HD itself own with a few accessories
like the power adapter and optional
mounting hardware it works over Wi-Fi
but you'll need a 2.4 gigahertz Network
it also works over Ethernet though if
you're able to hardline the pro HD has a
motorized head for some pretty sick
shots well you know that me look around
the room it also has a 1080p camera that
looks pretty legit and a 90 degree field
of view on top of the 1080p footage it
also has a night vision mode which works
up to 30 feet away for when you just
have to see what's lurking in the
shadows you can also talk through the
pro HD the built-in speaker you can also
connect a separate microphone speaker to
it if you want to go all out
it all works over Wi-Fi or Ethernet
using the AM crestview app on your phone
you can fully control the pan tilt and
digital zoom to check out what's going
on and start a recording it's saved to
either the cloud a local recorder or a
microSD card you can even set it up to
send you an alert when it detects motion
or even connect a wired alarm system
next up we've got the new Google
chromecast the last version was one of
my favorite pieces of tech and the new
version is rocking a much flashier
design which makes sense because it's
going to be behind the TV and you're
never going to see it again
unlike the last version which was a
dongle with the HDMI built-in the new
chromecast has a flexible cable
is helpful for plugging it in into
tighter spots behind your TV you will
still need to power it with micro USB
but since most TVs already have a USB
port free it's a pretty easy setup the
cable attaches to the chromecast with a
magnet which is nice for travel but it
is a bit bigger than the last generation
on the flip side it has seen some
internal upgrades most notably vastly
improved 802 11 AC Wi-Fi support which
should make things much more reliable
especially in areas with poor Wi-Fi
signals the real draw remains the same
though the chromecast can turn any HDMI
TV into a smart TV that you actually
want to use everything is controlled
from your smartphone or from the Chrome
browser there's a new chromecast app
which allows you to search through
content on your device but the easiest
way is to just hit the cast button that
automatically shows up in most apps it's
one of the best ways to quickly get
content on your TV while is limited to
1080p for $35 it's hard to complain so
what do you want to see in the next
episode let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
