state of jailbreak video and Dayton
wouldn't be talking about iOS 4.3 along
with the iPad to a celestone with iOS
4.3 which is of course the most recent
release for all models are all latest
models of iphone ipod touch and ipad so
there is good news on this front of
course iOS 4.3 came out just a few days
ago this is really bring a whole lot as
far as the features go but obviously we
need the lace updated chill break so 4.3
there is a jailbreak it is being
developed as far as when we can expect
to see this of course that's anyone's
guess could be soon could be maybe in a
couple of weeks a month but do you know
that there actually is a tethered
version of this jailbreak you guys can
check it out i hate's know who's a
really great developer he's got a lot of
great great jailbreaks he does have
snowbreeze and of course i'll have a
link to a tutorial to use that in the
description so if you have a certain
amount of devices you can jailbreak on
4.3 however do note that it is tethered
at the time being and until the solution
is being worked on but like I said guys
know ETA we don't know you know when
developing jailbreaks you know you can
say it'll be out next week and then ran
into a snag and it could be a month or
so just know that the tethered one is
here right now and the untethered one is
being worked on I know let's move on to
the iPad to the ipad 2 obviously it's a
little bit different know when there's
new hardware on a brand new device comes
out i usually takes them a little bit
longer to figure out what bugs work here
and there and all that kind of good
stuff however there's also good news so
calm x which i'm sure most of you guys
know he created the spirit and
jailbreakme jailbreaks has jailbroken
the ipad 2 and what's really impressive
is he doesn't even have one he came up
with an exploit and sent it and he did
all remotely using someone else's ipad
so very very impressive stuff comex is
used it's just a really really great
jail breaker and he does have a
jailbreak ready for the ipad 2 and i do
you mind that just because it's working
you know there's still polished need to
figure out exactly how it's going to
work on all that kind of stuff but again
very good news if you have an ipad 2
like i do a jailbreak will be coming in
the
near future of course most of the stuff
that's left is just to figure out
exactly how it's going to work on all
that kind of stuff so anyway guys that's
it just want to keep you all up to date
on the latest jail breaking news again
just a recap ipad 2 jailbreak will be
coming in the near future iphone ipod
touch and current ipad jailbreak there
already is one but it is tethered Ted's
not really the way you want to go most
of the time so you'll probably want to
wait for the untethered which should be
coming again in the near future that's
it guys give any questions comments feel
free to leave them in the comments below
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
