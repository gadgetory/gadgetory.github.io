here with an unboxing of the HTC Droid
DNA with a 1080p screen quad-core
processor and Android 4.1 this is an
absolute beast on paper so let's take a
look the DNA comes in a very cool
looking box which slides open to reveal
the Droid I pop the lid and we have the
phone itself so let's set it aside for a
second while we finish the unboxing on
top you'll find a tool to eject your SIM
tray which definitely comes in handy
inside the box you'll see a Quick Start
Guide in a couple languages some
information about the International GS
and roaming built into the phone more
information you can safely never read
and the cards that contains your micro
SIM if it hasn't been pre-installed
you'll also find a USB charger for
topping the DNA off and rather long
microUSB cable to charge and sync
now that the boring stuff is out of the
way let's get to the phone peel off the
plastic covering the screen and we're in
business along the right side is a red
accent which contains the volume rocker
and on the left side you'll see it's
free and clear up top is the center a
sleep button in your headphone jack
which are all tightly packed together
and on bottom you see a micro USB port
hidden behind a flap which I'm really
not a fan of the back of the phone is
where the 8 megapixel camera and LED
flash resides and you'll see it's coated
and a nice feeling soft touch rubber
with Beats Audio branding in the speaker
down bottom lastly up front is the 2
megapixel front-facing camera and red
speaker grille easily the most
impressive part of the phone is the
5-inch display with a whopping 1920 by
1080 resolution I'll go more in depth in
the for review but my first impressions
are that this is by far the best screen
on a phone period it's powered by a
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor 2
gigabytes of RAM and is running Android
4.1 jelly bean with the sense 4 plus
skin so there you have it my unboxing of
the HTC Droid DNA if you're interested

phone feel free to check out more videos

button and subscribe anyway I'll catch
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
