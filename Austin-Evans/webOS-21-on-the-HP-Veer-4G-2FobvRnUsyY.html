overview of webOS 2 on the HP veer 4G
now I've been using the beer for the
past few days and what I'd really like
to do is give you guys an overview of
webOS it's really a fantastic operating
system and then the 2.0 release it's
even better
slot screen is very simple just swipe -
you know it's what little thing to
unlock you also actually lock it again
if you have notifications or for example
I'm listening to music right now you can
play all that from the lock screen as
well very very handy and convenient but
once you open it up you'll find that
it's a very different experience if
you're coming from for example iOS or
Android instead of doing like a list of
apps or widgets or something like that
you see all of your open applications
this is basically for all intents and
purposes the home screen now if you want
to get into apps just pressing this
little thing right here it allow you to
scroll through applications
extras you can create new I open this up
here you can add launcher pages not kind
of stuff but it's very simple and I do
prefer this it's very nice to just get
at all your apps and it allows you to
really multitask easily now speaking of
multitasking that's probably my favorite
part of webOS so in fact I'll just show
you guys see I can see here I've got
some Angry Birds
of course all this is multitasking in
real time I've got the web browser you
just see it's not like it's you know
taking a second to load all the stuff is
in real time and in fact let me show you
guys here some of the gestures and
whatnot now as you might have noticed
there's no home button in fetch when the
phone is off it's very hard to tell
which is up and down without the little
speaker there now what this bottom here
right there it's a little LED and it's
just touch sensitive so the way it works
is let's say I want to back up so I just
swipe to the left and it will take me
back to wherever I was and this is
basically like a back button anywhere so
if you're if you're used to Android
that's the same you just use that
gesture and it backs you up in a variety
of applications and also if you swipe up
it will bring you back into the
multitasking where let's say I'm done
with the browser take it and go swipe it
away and we're good to go so really
fantastic stuff and even with the veer
which is certainly not going to be the
most powerful webOS device
absolutely has no problem multitasking
very very well now one other thing I
want to show you guys is just tight now
this is something new in webOS 2 rather
and what it is all about is it allows
you to I basically do searches and all
that kind of stuff it's somewhat similar
to spotlight search on
i phone so if i slide the keyboard out
here keep the whole phone and screen
unless they want search for Angry Birds
so I just start typing Angry Birds and
you'll see that it will search between
your apps and will let you search on
Google if you want I'm going to let you
search your mail your contacts all that
kind of stuff to figure out exactly what
you were talking about pretty neat stuff
now of course on the bottom here you
there's just all these if I want to get
rid of the camera or I want to have it
on the second you can do that really
simply I'm up top here yeah I don't
really have any service right now baby
will tell you if you're connected tell
you the time and if you tap up here not
there you know tap up here you'll see
it'll tell you the date your battery you
can toggle on Wi-Fi bluetooth airplane
mode all that kind of good stuff very
simply so I'm getting rid of this but
anyway so that's a general overview of
it I'll get into the really specific
stuff but one of the biggest things I
would you want sure you guys like the
multitasking I will show you how a video
runs on it so we flip around here you
can see how a video will run pretty much
just like you would expect so this is my
unboxing of the veer but we can sweat
that out the way now one other thing I
do want to show you guys is in the
browser in fact I better open that back
up the browser is actually fairly
competent so if we slide the keyboard
out again keyboard is pretty good but
I'll leave that for the veer review so
if we want to go to stage a jailbreak
one more time open that up and the
browser while it's very small on this
2.6 inch display it doesn't support
flash so if we go into a page with flash
give it a second to load this one sports
flash but when you go into a thing with
a page with flash like for example
there's a flash ad it will allow you to
tap on it there you go there's a YouTube
video if we want to tap on it once the
page is done loading we can certainly do
that it will load up the flash and just
like on an Android phone you can watch
your flash videos and whatnot very
simply on webOS and there are several
other things the for example you have
Google Maps YouTube there's a lot of
stuff and definitely a little bit
outside the scope of this video but what
I do is give you guys an overview kind
of show you some of the cool things
about webOS and as far as the intricate
sieze and you know this and that Ness
and I'm not really going to get into
that in this video but suffice it to say
webOS is a fantastic operating system
does have a lot of potential it's a
little quite fun to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
