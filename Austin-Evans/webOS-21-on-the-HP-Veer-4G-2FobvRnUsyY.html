overview of webos two on the HP viewer
4G now I've been using the beer for the
past few days and what I'd really like
to do is give you guys an overview of
webos it's really a fantastic operating
system and then the 2 point 0 released
it's even better lock screen is very
simple just swipe to you know what
little thing to unlock you also actually
I'll lock it again if you have
notifications or for example I'm
listening to music right now you can
play all that from the lock screen as
well very very handy and convenient but
once you open it up you'll find that
it's a very different experience if
you're coming from for example iOS or
Android instead of doing like a list of
apps or widgets or something like that
you see all of your open applications is
basically for all intents and purposes
the home screen now if you want to get
into apps just press them this little
thing right here and it allows you to
scroll through applications extras you
can create new I open this up here you
can add launcher pages not kind of stuff
but it's very simple and I do prefer
this it's very nice to just get at all
your apps and allows you to really
multitask easily now speaking of
multitasking that's probably my favorite
part of webos so in fact i'll just show
you guys see i can see here I've got
some angry birds of course all this is
multitasking in real time I've got the
web browser you Justin see it's not like
it's you know taking a second to load
all the stuff is in real time and in
fact let me show you guys hear some of
the gestures and whatnot now as you
might have noticed there's no home
button in fetch if when the phone is off
it's very hard to tell which is up and
down without the little speaker there
now with this bottom here right there
it's a little LED and is this touch
sensitive so the way it works is let's
say I want to back up so I just swipe to
the left and it will take me back to
wherever I was and this is basically
like a back button anywhere so if you're
if you're used to Android that's the st.
you just use that gesture and it backs
you up in a variety of applications and
also if you swipe up it will bring you
back into multitasking where let's say
I'm done with the browser take it and go
swipe it away and we're good to go so
really fantastic stuff and even with the
veer which is certainly not going to be
the most powerful web OS device
absolutely has no problem multitasking
very very well now one other thing I
want to show you guys is just tight now
this is something new and webos to
rather and what it is all about is it
allows you to I basically do searches
and all that kind of stuff it's somewhat
similar to spotlight search on
I phone so if I slide the keyboard out
here keep the whole phone screen I let's
say I want search for angry birds so I
just start typing angry birds and you'll
see that it will search between your
apps and will let you search on Google
if you want I'm going to let you search
your mail your contacts all that kind of
stuff to figure out exactly what you
were talking about pretty neat stuff now
of course on the bottom here there's
just all these if I want to get rid of
the camera or I want to have it on the
second you can do that really simply I'm
up top here now I'm not really have any
service right now babe will tell you if
you're connected tell you the time and
if you tap up here not there don't tap
up here you'll see it'll tell you the
date battery you can toggle on Wi-Fi
Bluetooth airplane mode all that kind of
good stuff very simply so I'm get rid of
this but anyway so that's a general
overview of it I'll get into the really
specific stuff but one of the biggest
things i want you guys like multitasking
and we'll show you how a video runs on
it so we flip around here you can see
how a video will run pretty much just
like you would expect so this is my
unboxing of the veer but we can sweat
that out the way now one other thing I
do want to show you guys is in the
browser in fact I better open that back
up on the browser is actually fairly
confident so if we slide the keyboard
out again keyboard is pretty good but
I'll leave that for the veer review so
we want to go to stage a jailbreak one
more time open that up and the browser
while it's very small on this two point
six inch display it doesn't support
flash so if we go into a page with flash
give it a second to load um this one
supports flash but when you go into a
thing with a page with flash like for
example there's a flash add it will
allow you to tap on it there you go
there's a youtube video if we want to
tap on it once the page is downloading
we can certainly do that it will load up
the flash and just like on an android
phone you can watch your flash videos
and whatnot very simply on webos and
there are several other things the for
example you have google maps youtube
there's a lot of stuff and definitely a
little bit outside the scope of this
video but what i do is give you guys an
overview kind of show you some of the
cool things about webos and that's
where's the intricate cease and you know
this and that Nets now I'm not only
going to get into that in this video but
suffice it to say webOS is a fantastic
operating system does have a lot of
potential it's really quite fun to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
