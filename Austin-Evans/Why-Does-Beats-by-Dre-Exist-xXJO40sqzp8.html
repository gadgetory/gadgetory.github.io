one question and one question only
why do beats by dre exist so in front of
me I had nearly the entire lineup of
current Beats products everything from
the beats EP all the way up to the
studio threes so if you're an audiophile
you're probably not going to be
interested in beats at all
however in 2018 I'm curious to see how
much things have changed as actually
some of these were a little bit
surprising to me case in point the beats
EP now actually we did do a video on
these a couple years ago when they first
came out you can think of these
basically as the entry-level beats at
$130 retail and usually between 90 to
100 bucks actually in stores they're
about the cheapest beats you can get
your hands on like most beats they do
feel pretty nice so now they do you have
this metal of your mechanism which is
going to be able to adjust in and out
but the entire beats are going to be
made with soft touch plastic some pretty
nice feeling ear cups they definitely do
feel their price what are they sound
their price is a different story however
for some background I'm going to be
listening on a google pixel to using a
USB seat a headphone adapter now this
might not be the highest end audio setup
but this is the way that would typically
listen to music the EPS are only
available in a wired version whereas
finish all the other beats I'm taking a
look at are going to be wireless as far
as listening to music I'm going to be
using Spotify streaming 320 kilobit mp3s
I mean the bass there's a lot of bass
there's a lot of bass but for hip-hop
especially it's not going to be bad as
you expect by dre headphones yeah yeah
so you get to another kind of track
which is going to give you a little bit
more of a balanced sound where there's
actually some differentiation between
the lows the mids of the highs and you
see that they get a little bit muddy
especially in the mids they sound good I
mean don't get me wrong I feel like a
lot of people could pick up this pair of
headphones put it on it's like wow you
know there's so much bass it's so punchy
but if you want something that's going
to be a little more balanced these are
probably not going to be your best
option
which is where this comes in this is a
pair of status audio CD ones if you've
watched a channel for a while you've
probably see me recommend these many
many many times and that's for good
reason this is a pair of headphones that
lives in my bag every single day now
these aren't going to be completely
neutral there is going to be some
accentuation of the bass but they're in
general going to be much much flatter
and much more
even than something like the beats now
the main reason I'd like these guys is
not because they do have an over ear
design something that I find comfortable
when I'm doing longer editing sessions
or listening to music but they're also
really affordable at 60 bucks is
difficult it's not basically impossible
to find a better pair of headphones than
these yeah so you know what I'm gonna be
completely honest with you I am a little
bit biased because I listen to these
headphones so much I do like the sound
but I think the biggest difference here
is that while no they're not going to
kick you in the face of that bass you
are going to be able to hear the full
song there's nothing that's going to be
super muddy it's a lot clearer of a
sound and that's something personally
that I like a lot next up we have the
beats X's now this is going to be the
first in their line of wireless
headphones and as you can see as they're
sort of the earbud style they're going
to be a lot smaller but still promised
that same super punchy sound so as beats
by dre is owned by Apple now there's a
couple of interesting things about the
beats X that do take advantage of that
first of all they are going to be
charging with a lightning connector as
opposed to microUSB so if you already
have an iPhone that makes a little bit
simpler and they also do have the Apple
w1 Wireless chip now that's actually a
big deal if you do have an iOS or a Mac
iOS an iOS device can you have an iOS is
an iOS a thing I don't think that's a
thing although if you don't have an
Android phone or well anything else
they'll still work like normal
headphones there's just an added benefit
if you do have an iOS I'm stop making
that joke all right one of the nice
parts about the w1 chip is that
literally all I had to do is pull these
as a box press the button and I'm able
to connect them and they will be good
not only on my phone but also on
anything else that uses my Apple ID okay
there's still pace so something else
this actually do a really good job of is
isolate you from sound now it does
depend on the ear tips you need to make
sure they fit well in your ears if you
get a good pair they actually do a
really good job of blocking everything
else out especially if you're going to
something like gym or whatever they
should work pretty well to really test
these out though I'm gonna see if I can
get them to come out of my ears
oh I know this giant thing isn't the way
how do you like jumping jacks like I was
like seven I'm just trying to think of
like my normal workouts don't involve
anything crazy maybe feel like running
or something they felt pretty well but
the main competitor to something like
beats X is actually going to also be
from Apple the Apple earpods are one of
my favorite pairs of headphones it's
almost like a trend of like I'm taking
my favorite headphones against Beats in
this video or something what makes
airpot special is they're of course
going to be fully wireless little
earbuds so if you've ever listened to
these stock headphones that come with an
iPhone you'll probably be pretty
familiar with how these sound definitely
not great it's hard to argue with having
something that's no wires no cables it's
going to be fully passing the workout
test as long as they actually fit in
your ears and they also do come with a
charging case which makes everything
super simple
the real pitch for air pods is not
necessarily going to be in sound quality
but convenience next up we have the
beats solo 3 Wireless and when most
people think about beats by dre
headphones they think of these
headphones now you can say a lot about
beats by dre headphones but something
they always deliver is a nice unboxing
experience change the way you hear sound
well yeah I guess that's a thing you
might have to do so if you open up the
carrying case what you're going to find
is actually a pretty nice looking pair
of solos so that is something that I
definitely cannot take away from Beats
they do look nice so whether it's to
your particular taste or not is
completely up to you but I do get why a
lot of people will pick these guys up
more as a fashion statement than
something that's going to be purely for
audio you do also get these 3.5
milimeter cables so if you don't want to
use them wirelessly you can just plug
the men assuming your phone still has a
headphone jack of course build quality
wise they feel pretty decent so beats by
dre are known for maybe subtly enhancing
the design of their headphones with some
strategically placed heavy metal to make
them feel more premium but generally
speaking they feel alright however i've
had plenty of occasions where people
have shown me their broken solos so your
mileage might vary on that one alright
Wow
I forgotten it's been a while since I've
won solos I forgotten how tight they are
on your head I mean I don't think I have
that big of a head do I I can say that
all of the beats I've tried so far
aren't quite as punchy as those EPS now
don't get me wrong there's definitely a
lot of bass here but it's not quite as
overpowering yeah what's this for like
two minutes and my ears are already like
sore and sweaty it's no contest so far I
feel like the solos sound better than
any of the other beats I've tried so one
of the interesting things about these
guys is that while they retail at 300
dollars you can actually pick them up
for closer to 200 and that is not the
case for the comparison that I have in
mind now that is a much nicer looking
carrying case so the Beats Studio 3
Wireless are going to be the flagship of
the line as long as you don't count the
beats Pro which are sort of more DJ
headphones I guess but these are men
that's read now for the all-important
does this actually make my head hurt a
little bit it's a little bit of a
tighter side as far as the fit but it
also is going to be an over ear design
which is going to be a lot more
comfortable and it's not squishing my
ears like the solos did that's not bad
so these guys are going to of course
have that Apple w1 chip and there are
going to if we go into the box be
powered by micro USB and come with the
same 3.5 millimeter headphone cable
although thankfully this one's going to
be in red to match your super cool beats
so you turn on the studio threes they do
default to having their noise cancelling
on but if you jump into the options you
can turn them on and off and you can
also use a button command on the side if
you're not using an iPhone okay so I'm
gonna be completely real with you the
last time I listen to studios was a long
time ago they just sound muddy like
these headphones should cost three
hundred two dollars retail now to be
fair we were able to pick these up for
two hundred twenty bucks and generally
speaking they are on sale for a lot less
than that
but yeah man I'm really surprised I
would generally feel like the solo sound
a lot better and I'll tell you what
almost definitely sounds better they
wonderfully named Sony WH 1000 X mark
twos now these are widely regarded is
some of the nicest best sounding
Bluetooth headphones on the market and
well they're pretty much right in
addition to the standard Deutsch
cancellation which sounds pretty good
there's also going to be an ambient mode
so you can turn that on with a button on
the headphones but the easier way to do
it is while you're listening to music
you
just put a hand over the earcup it's
going to beep at you and not like does
it dumb the actual volume of your music
or turn it down
can you tell music I don't think you did
music anyway regardless you're going to
now be able to turn your music volume
down but also turn on the microphone on
the headphones so you can actually more
easily hear your environment take your
hand off the headphones and your music
comes up to the full volume really
clever stuff okay first of all back
should sound like a good balanced pair
of headphones there's plenty of bass
there's plenty of accentuation on sort
of the nicer more punchy parts of the
music but importantly as I accidentally
trigger Google assistant they're all
hustle are going to be able to just
sound like a good solid pair of
headphones what they are going to be
more expensive so while the MSRP for
both these guys is going to be a pretty
pricey $350 these guys will actually
cost threw in 50 bucks the beats can be
found for as little as 224 the studio
threes that now that might not sound
like a bad deal but don't do that just a
bad idea get these guys or something
else honestly just so why do beats by
dre exist in 2018 oh because people keep
buying them I actually do see some
reasons why you might want to pick them
up the style is obviously something
that's going to be very subjective and
thanks to all the sales a lot of these
are actually much more affordable than
they used to be that being said while
some of them are not bad like the solos
and even the EPS if you want some really
punchy headphones you can pretty much
always get something that's going to
sound better for the same money if not
less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
