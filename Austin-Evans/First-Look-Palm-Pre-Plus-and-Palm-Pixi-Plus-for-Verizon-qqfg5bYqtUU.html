the palm pre and pixi as well as
availability on Verizon both get their
names changed to the pre plus and pixi
plus and gain new features such as more
memory RAM and more let's get this one
started
the palm pre plus looks largely the same
but with a few important tweaks the
first thing you will notice is that it
has lost its solar navigation button
below the screen it gives the pre a
sleeker form factor in an uncluttered
front view along with a slight outside
refresh is a built-in touchstone
inductive charging battery back cover
which used to cost extra well it's not
all that need you certainly also won't
hear any complaints that the ram has
doubled in the pre plus as has the
internal memory from 8 to 16 gigabytes
the pixi plus also hasn't changed much
but as with the pre there wasn't that
much wrong with it in the first place
the first and certainly biggest change
is the addition of Wi-Fi something the
original pixi sorely lacked as the pixi
is only a couple months old there aren't
many upgrades beyond that save for new
touchstone back covers one of the most
promising upgrades for both the pre and
pixi is the addition of a new mobile
hotspot application using the new app
you can use either of the new phones as
a mifi hotspot once enabled this will
let you tether your EVDO cell signal
into Wi-Fi for any of your devices such
as a laptop the palm pre plus and pixi
plus both or verizon exclusives so don't
expect to see them on sprint anytime
soon but you can expect to see both
phones on verizon soon very soon as in
January 25th no word on pricing yet but
it will likely be only moderately higher
than on sprint if not the same
definitely some good news for two of the
best phones around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
