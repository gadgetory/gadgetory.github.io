time to give beats another chance
so it is been a long time since I've
used beats so if you still in a pair of
studios and there are okay headphones
they're a way way way overpriced now
Apple basically bought beats by dre and
coincidentally they also released the
new solo two headphones so I said let's
let get them another shot and see if
they've actually gotten any better or if
they're still overpriced and sound
terrible
and we are the beats experiment so these
are the beats solo twos we have the
beats solo twos these are the new beats
solo2 s so here are the new solo twos
here are the solo twos I have the new
beats solo2 supposedly better
what are your takes especially the solos
have never been a big fan of a tiny
little ear cut not my style
the padding for mine are like I think a
little bit smaller
okay just seems like this might actually
cover my ears a little bit better and
actually keep the sound in there not bad
I mean these are on the ear
I like around the ear just because when
I listen to music or anything I like to
listen for a long time not only are
these comfortable but they're they're
very ice is a very isolating foam I
don't know if you notice that like
putting it on you're good yeah it's a
very isolating foam just do a good job
running onto your headphone it does a
good job of blocking noise out a lot of
people think because they're on your
headphones they're a little bit like
harsh on the ears like kind of like I
can't look lightest after an hour being
cumbersome they're pretty comfortable I
got I can definitely wear these longer
not could my feet mixers
I'm he's mostly plastic all around well
I heard a little creaking there and he's
durable if I was not looking I
blindfolded I could almost think that
these are kind of like these are cheap
$20 Sony headphones
definitely sounds like Drake December to
get they get really loud like compared
to my headphones these are way louder
because I can turn my audio up all the
way and that's that's pretty libelous at
least eliciting a doctored right there
are zero mids no mitad everything
scooped there bass-heavy there's almost
absolutely zero mid frequencies in these
headphones I've heard the same type of
sound coming out of you know headphone
audio technica so what do you prefer
like in sound I do like a lot of faces I
like because I know a lot of people
really like that I do because I do end
up listening to hip-hop a lot obviously
there's a lot of bases a lot probably
too much these are very and and it is no
longer a myth or a rumor for me hey
these are bass head I normally just use
apple headphones oh because normally if
i'm using headphones I'm really just
skating and have a phone my pocket
they're not bad headphones that's a
misconception there's somehow this logo
implies they're Toys R Us or whatever
see they don't sound like bad they don't
sound bad what is good what I think is
good is way different from what you
think is good for some people that's
going to be a sound that they like and
that's a very subjective thing right
they're trying to enhance your listening
experience by telling you how they think
the music should be EQ best thing about
these just aesthetics visually I can see
the appeal I like the look up until I
like that red nice dude those headphones
look good no no these is a beautiful
looking headphones they're getting color
matched I think it's totally reasonable
it's just it's XS for me this isn't a
product that I absolutely need to have
let's be honest they're just a fashion
statement you know at the end of the day
that's good that's what they are when
you're dealing with fashion products
when you're dealing with products that
make a statement you always paying more
than what that product is worth I'm
gonna go back to the Gucci bag leather
on the bag doesn't cost that much money
right but people are attempting to make
a statement a Rolex watch are you going
to go around tell the guy his watch
sucks
of course we'll watch shouldn't be
$30,000 of course not but ultimately
people have to
make up their own mind about where they
see value and where they're going to get
the experience and they're going to get
the treatment that they expect I bet
this was a nice unboxing experience it
was very nice it was very nice
the attention to detail was there this
is an experience from start to finish I
can't hate on that I can't even I'm not
gonna wear them it's not my choice but
I'm also not gonna hate on it it's your
choice
