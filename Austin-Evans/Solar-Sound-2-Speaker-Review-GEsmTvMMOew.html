and review of the solar sound 2
Bluetooth speaker by debo tech
industries so guys I'm gonna go ahead
and open it up I'm gonna do an unboxing
show you guys what all is in it and then
after I've used Parral I will go ahead
and take a look at the review I'm
sexually well opening this actually I
would like to thank debo tech for
sitting this out to me for free to
review so definitely I'd like to thank
them for that
so actually this is a nice packaging
here so let's go ahead and take a look
here we do have a little pouch suppose I
guess that's what you put the speakers
in I know we do have some cables let's
go ahead just take a look at what all we
get and we do get a mini USB to USB
cable and search tractable that's cool I
believe you use that to charge we do
have a three and a half millimeter to
3.5 millimeter so this is basically the
hooking in like one end to your iPod and
one to the speaker it also does feature
bluetooth but of course I will get into
that in to review and sing what else we
have in a little bag of goodies here and
then we do head yeah just a little USB
charger and when you pull out here so
just a really nice compact USB charger
so you go ahead and you can plug it in
and of course this is a Bluetooth
speaker so technically you don't really
need any of these wires but obviously
it's nice to do they include and lastly
but certainly not least we do have the
silver sound manage gift box that way we
do have the solar sound to speaker so
what I'm gonna do guys just go ahead and
show you guys real quick I'll go ahead
and use this speaker for a little while
tested do all that kinda stuff I'll be
right back with the review okay so I've
had a decent wallet to go ahead and test
out the speaker system and overall I'm
pretty impressed
before we get into any of the importance
all the specifics let's just widen just
give you guys a tour around the device
so starting on the front you will of
course say there's not a lot here there
are three capacitive touch buttons now
you can see here they're totally flush
they worked pretty well and of course
you have your volume as well as your
back you have your next as well as your
on and off and you have your volume up
as well as the next track it does work
pretty well this is the logo and
actually does have a couple of LEDs in
there which kind of blank according to
know when it's syncing or
there was pairing it's charging all that
kind of stuff over on the side here we
do have one of the 1 watt speakers and
you do have one on either side now we'll
get into the audio quality in just a
second around the back you will see
there are a few connections you do have
a line in so while of course the speaker
system you can go ahead and use entirely
wirelessly but why charging it via solar
power and obviously it does have a
pretty decent battery in there I mean go
ahead and just charge it that way and if
you have bluetooth on your maybe your
iPod or your cell phone or whatever you
can go ahead and just do it all entirely
wirelessly however there's a pretty good
chance that you know you might not
always be in the sunlight or whatever so
in that case you can go ahead and just
used obviously the included USB charger
and it's tractable USB cord so that
works pretty well it does charge quite a
bit faster using usb but you know of
course if you do have it you know it's
not a big deal to I just said in a
windowsill or something it does charge
fairly quickly it takes roughly about a
day or so from a full totally dead
battery to you know if you leave in a
window to fully charge up but again not
all that bad I'm an addition you also do
have line-in lineout so maybe for
example you have like an iPod that
doesn't support bluetooth or make your
cell phone doesn't or for whatever
reason you can go ahead and use the
included three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack
so those work pretty well so let's go
ahead of give you guys a demonstration
so turn it on hit the little button
there we go so you can hear it is on
play so let's go I can give you guys a
brief demo of the audio quality so guys
before I begin I do want to let you know
obviously it's not gonna be perfect test
you're having to deal with both my
camera microphone as well as YouTube's
processing so the quality is probably
gonna be quite a bit less
however hopefully you should get a
pretty good idea so with my ipod fully
connected via bluetooth let's go ahead
and start playing and of course this is
a track from Kevin MacLeod's actually my
outro
so here you go guys that's that's a
pretty brief little thing I'm showing
you the audio quality um generally I
found that blue over Bluetooth it's
pretty decent
now obviously you of course you really
always have to keep in mind this is a
very small speaker system and you know
don't spec you know something ridiculous
sound out of it but for the size it's
really really pretty solid now as far as
Bluetooth um generally like as you can
see here my ipod very very close and so
the quality was really quite good um
however when you get it a little bit
farther away that I found Bluetooth kind
of kind of like pauses and stuff so for
example like you know I was like holding
this in my hand and this was like in my
pocket and it kind of cut out a few
times and it kind of wasn't perfect so
that has less to do is you know this
future system and more to do which is
Bluetooth in general so it's not a big
deal to you you know if you're gonna be
saving this down and you know you know
maybe like there's a party or something
I definitely do recommend go ahead and
plug it in via the three-and-a-half
millimeter audio cables it does give it
a better sound and obviously you don't
have to worry about bluetooth or any
issues like that but of course if you do
want to use it as Bluetooth it will work
pretty well as long as you just do keep
it fairly close guys that's pretty much
it for my review of this speaker system
I'm really pretty impressed with it I
like the fact that it does charge via
solar you know it the audio quality is
surprisingly good for something like
this this size I am pretty impressed
with it and obviously I really do like
the idea of it being an entirely
wireless unit you know you don't have to
plug it in if it's you're if you're in
the Sun you would never have to plug it
in and if you have something Bluetooth
you never have to plug it in with audio
cables either so really you can honestly
go out like this
be good to go pretty much forever well
maybe not forever but you know anyway
guys if you're interested I will have a
link in the description you go ahead to
find out more about it um I think for
the price is a pretty solid product
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
