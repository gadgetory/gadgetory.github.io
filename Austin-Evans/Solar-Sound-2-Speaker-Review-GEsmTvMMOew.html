and review of the solar sound to
bluetooth speaker by debo tech
industries so guys I'm go ahead and open
it up I'm going to do an unboxing show
you guys what all is in it and then
after I've used brawl I will go ahead
and take a look at the review I'm
sexually well opening this actually
nothing okay I would like to thank demo
tape for sitting this out to me for free
to review so definitely i'd like to
thank them for that so actually this is
a nice packaging here so let's go ahead
and take a look here we do have a little
pouch suppose I guess that's what you
put the speakers in and we'd have some
cables let's go and just take a look at
what all we get and we do get a mini USB
to USB cable and a search vegetable
that's cool i believe you use that to
charge we do have a three-and-a-half
millimeter 23 a half millimeter so this
basically the hook game like one in to
your ipod and one to the speaker it also
does beat your bluetooth but of course i
will get into that ended review sing
what else we have in a little bag of
goodies here and then we do had yet just
a little USB charger and going to pull
out here so just a really nice compact
USB charger so you go ahead and you can
plug it in and of course this is a
bluetooth speaker so technically you
don't really need any of these wires but
obviously it's nice to that include and
lastly but certainly not least we do
have the solar sound manage gift box
either way we do have the solar sound
too speaker I'm so what I'm going to do
guys just going to show you guys real
quick i'll go ahead and use this speaker
for a little while tested do all that
kind of stuff i'll be right back with
the review okay so I've had a decent
wallets go ahead and test out the
speaker syste and overall I'm pretty
impressed us before we get into any of
the importance all the specifics let's
just want to just give you guys a tour
around the device so starting on the
front you will of course there's not a
hawt here there are three capacitive
touch buttons as you can see here
they're totally flushed they work pretty
well and of course you have your volume
as well as your back you have your next
as well as your on and off and you have
your volume up as well as the next track
it does work pretty well this is the
logo and actually does have a couple of
LEDs in there which kind of blank
according to know when it's sinking or
rather wet pairing
when it's charging all that kind of
stuff over on the side here we do have
one of the one watt speakers you do have
one on either side now we'll get into
the audio quality in just a second
around the back you will see there are a
few connections you do have a line in so
while of course the speaker system you
can go ahead and use entirely wirelessly
but why charging it via solar power and
obviously does have a pretty decent
battery in there I mean go ahead and
just charge it that way and if you have
bluetooth on your maybe your iPod or
your cell phone or whatever you can go
ahead and just do it all entirely
wirelessly however there's a pretty good
chance that you know you might not
always be in the sunlight or whatever so
in that case you can go ahead and just
used obviously the included USB charger
and is tractable USB cord so that works
pretty well it does charge quite a bit
faster using USB but you know of course
if you do have it you know it's not a
big deal glad you said in a windowsill
or something it does charge fairly
quickly it takes roughly about a day or
so from a full totally dead battery to
you know if you leave in a window to
fully charge up but again not all that
bad I'm in addition you also do have
line-in lineout so maybe for example you
have like an iPod that doesn't support
Bluetooth or make your cell phone
doesn't or for whatever reason you can
go ahead and use the included
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
so it does work pretty well so let's go
and just kind of give you guys a
demonstration so turn it on you should
hit the little button there we go so you
can hear it is on play so let's go i can
give you guys a brief demo of the audio
quality so guys before i begin i do want
to let you know obviously this is not
going to be perfect test you're having
to deal with both my camera microphone
as well as the youtube processing so the
quality is probably gonna be quite a bit
less however hopefully you should get a
pretty good idea so with my ipod fully
connected via bluetooth let's go ahead
and start playing and of course this is
a track from kevin macleod essentially
my outro
so here you go guys that's that's a
pretty brief little thing I'm showing
you the audio quality um generally i
found that blew over bluetooth it's
pretty decent now obviously you of
course you really always have to keep in
mind this is a very small speaker system
and you know don't spec you know
something ridiculous sound out of it but
for the size it's really really pretty
solid now as far as bluetooth um
generally as you can see here my ipod
very very close and so the quality was
really quite good I'm however when you
get it a little bit farther away that I
found Bluetooth kinda kind of like
pauses and stuff so for example like you
know I was like holding this in my hand
and this was like in my pocket and it
kind of cut out a few times and it kind
of wasn't perfect so that has less to do
is you know this future system and more
to do which is Bluetooth in general so
if it's not a big deal to you you know
if you're going to be saying this down
and you know you know maybe like is a
party or something I definitely do
recommend go ahead and plug it in via
the three-and-a-half millimeter audio
cables it does give it a better sound
and obviously not to worry about
Bluetooth or any issues like that but of
course if you do want to use it as
Bluetooth it will work pretty well as
long as you just do keep it fairly close
and so Emma guys that's pretty much it
for my review of this speaker system I'm
really pretty impressed with it I like
the fact that does charge via solar you
know it the audio quality is
surprisingly good for something like
this this size I am pretty impressed
with it and obviously I really do like
the idea of it being an entirely
wireless unit you know you don't have to
plug it in if it's your if you're in the
Sun you would never have to plug it in
and if you have something Bluetooth you
never have to plug it in with audio
cables either so really you can also go
out like this be good to go pretty much
forever well maybe I forever but you
know other guys if you're interested I
will have a link in the description you
go ahead to find out more about it I
think for the price is a pretty solid
product anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
