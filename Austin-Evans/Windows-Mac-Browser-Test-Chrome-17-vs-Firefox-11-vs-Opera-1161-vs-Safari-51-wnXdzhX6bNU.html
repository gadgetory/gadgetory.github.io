here with my latest browser test
comparing chrome 17 Firefox 11 opera 11
61 and Safari 5.1 for this test I
changed my method by adding a very
popular request a Mac all tests were run
on both a core i7 desktop as well as the
core i5 MacBook Air this isn't useful
for comparing OS 10 versus windows cores
but it will help you choose which is the
best browser for your OS to start with
we have the v8 benchmark which measures
JavaScript performance for sites such as
Gmail on Windows chrome dominates as
always with Firefox and opera behind
over on OS 10 Crump still wins out over
Safari doesn't much better here not only
beating the other two browsers but also
being better than Safari on Windows now
bad considering the rest of the browsers
are roughly half as fast on the macbook
air next we have one of my favorite
overall benchmarks peacekeeper which has
been redesigned since my last browser
test on Windows chrome wins out over
opera which typically takes this test
and over on OS 10 Chrome contains twin
out over both Safari and opera as
peacekeeper not only test speed but also
compatibility with various web standards
winning gear means a lot continuing on
we have the particle acceleration test
which focuses on how well each browser
takes advantage of hardware acceleration
for Windows Firefox 11 gets a perfect 60
frames per second with chrome also
getting a respectable score on OS 10 it
flips as Safari is the one with the
perfect score with the other three
browsers know what close as you can see
this is another example of just how much
better Safari is on Mac compared to
Windows next up we have the html5 test
this has been a staple of my browser
tests for quite a while and it simply
measures how well each browser adheres
to the latest web standards chrome ekes
out a victory here however all four
browsers clear the test with a score of
over 300 which gets too big thumbs up
from me lastly we have memory usage here
I let up both of the browser's with five
tabs consisting of popular sites such as
Hulu on Windows both Firefox and Safari
I did very well with opera not too far
off in chrome being the clear loser on
OS 10 I had some issues with the
consistency of my results for both
Firefox and Chrome but impressively
Safari uses up just over 100 megabytes
of RAM making it the best browser for
memory usage I've ever tested with two
different noses there are two different
stories here on Windows Chrome and
Firefox from
my top picks chrome is still the fastest
browser speed wise polar Firefox has
better hardware acceleration intends to
take up less memory which is important
on PCs with less power on OS 10 Chrome
remains great but Safari is a very
strong choice with close to chrome
levels of performance combined with
excellent memory usage and hardware
acceleration if you enjoyed be sure to
