have had on the device formerly known as
the crunch pad now known as the juju if
you've been following the very
complicated saga you'll know that who
exactly owns the right to make the juju
is up in the air right now but at the
least it looks like the juju will be
sold soon so let's take a look at what
it's all about the juju is a generously
sized tablet similar to the often
rumored Apple tablet it features a 12.1
inch capacitive touchscreen and a single
Hardware button for power everything
else is done on screen it runs on a
custom UNIX operating system very
similar to Google Chrome OS meaning that
very little information is stored on the
device itself rather it is merely a web
tablet to allow you to get online and do
your work on websites such as Google
Docs however it does feature a built-in
four gigabyte flash drive to save your
login information and perhaps more the
juju has built-in Wi-Fi but not 3G
meaning that it won't be very useful on
the road unless there's a Wi-Fi hotspot
nearby no important tech specs were
mentioned in regards to the processor or
RAM but they did mention it can render
HD video whether it's 720 or 1080 wasn't
clear battery life is okay at five hours
and boot times are about as you would
expect on a tablet fast they claim about
ten seconds from hitting the power
button to surfing the web and the demo
was certainly close to that while it was
a brief first look the juju looks very
promising from the hardware side of
things there's a lot of conflicting
information especially in regards to
whether fusion garage actually owns the
juju at first glance the tablet looks to
be a solid piece of hardware
though and the price of $4.99 isn't
entirely unreasonable although higher
than had been quoted earlier it will be
available to order December 11th this
Friday
personally I'm not convinced yet but it
could be a major player and then soon to
be lit up tablet space we'll find out
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
