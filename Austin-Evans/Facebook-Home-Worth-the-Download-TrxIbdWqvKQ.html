here with a hands-on of the brand new
Facebook home for Android it's very easy
to install all you need to do is make
sure you have the most recent versions
of the Facebook app and the facebook
Messenger app downloaded then you can
install Facebook homes straight from the
Play Store however I will mention it's
only officially working on a few phones
right now including the galaxy s3 note 2
HTC One X and only in the US so what
exactly is home you can think of it as a
new skin for your phone that brings a
lot of Facebook features right up front
for example as soon as you unlock your
phone you'll see a stream of pictures
from your Facebook feed and you can
immediately start scrolling through them
to see what's up
you can like by double tapping anywhere
on the screen which is actually kind of
fun to play with when you're ready to
unlock your phone you'll find your
profile picture as a little bubble you
can drag left to open messenger up to go
into your apps and right to open the
last app you had running if you use a
passcode lock on your phone beware
though with the default settings anyone
can like and comment before fully
unlocking the phone and the integration
is a bit half-baked for now unlike
normal Android the app view is still
extremely simple with a list of pages
where you can organize apps however
widgets aren't supported yet above is a
quick menu where you can update your
status along and snapping a picture to
be uploaded to Facebook and scrolling
over to the left brings you to a list of
your apps once you're in an app
everything looks basically normal but
home is still only a button press away
surprisingly one of my favorite features
of home is chat heads
these are little notifications that will
pop up and allow you to hop in and reply
to a facebook message we're normal SMS
and then go back to whatever you're
doing without ever leaving the app best
of all this is now built into the normal
messenger app so you can even use chat
heads with a different launcher so what
do you guys think of Facebook home right
now it's a bit basic but chat heads
alone makes it worth the download for me
but definitely be sure to let me know
what you think in the comments below if
you're interested more feel free to
check out my last video going over your
questions including the ps4 vs a gaming
PC if you enjoyed definitely be sure to
