browser options which one should you use
since the last test there have been a
few big updates with a launch of Windows
10 and the new Microsoft edge browser
the Mac side has also seen an update
with El Capitan so to test I'm using a
2015 13 inch MacBook Pro that's dual
booting both OS 10 and windows it's
pegged out with a dual core Core i7
integrated iris graphics 16 gigs of
memory and a fast SSD the first test is
peacekeeper which is a good general test
of a browser's performance on the window
side Firefox does well with edge falling
a bit behind move over to OS 10 and
you'll see Safari puts in an impressive
showing with Firefox still doing well
next up is octane which is more of a
pure JavaScript speed test things are
very even on Windows 10 with chrome edge
and opera and a dead heat in Firefox
coming slightly behind on Mac
interestingly Safari drops back quite a
bit where Chrome and opera continue to
do well moving on is the html5 test this
measures how each browser supports the
various features of the Internet Chrome
and opera pull this one out which isn't
a huge surprise since opera is based on
chromium where both age and Safari fall
quite a bit behind another interesting
test is browser scope security which
checks how many major threats each
browser can block again opera and chrome
pull up the win here with Microsoft edge
coming in right behind a slightly
different test is the unity WebGL
benchmark this is all about measuring
how well each browser handles more
intense games on Windows Firefox pulls
out an impressive win here over the rest
of the field and on Mac it's a similar
story although Safari does respectably
well too for a more real-world test I
timed how long it took for each browser
to open and load the Google homepage
here Microsoft edge gets a big leg up on
everything else with chrome coming in a
bit behind and on OS 10 Chrome and
Firefox are the quickest but all four
browsers do well the amount of memory a
browser uses makes a difference
especially on less powerful computers so
here I loaded each with eight tabs and
checked how much RAM they needed on
Windows 10 Firefox is the most
lightweight with opera and chrome coming
in a bit behind things are surprisingly
close on El Capitan Safari pulls out a
slight edge but all for close enough to
not make a huge difference so when you
put it all together which browser should
you go for on Windows Chrome is the best
all-around choice it performs well and
doesn't have any major flaws
Mack it's a toss-up between Chrome and
Safari Chrome tends to perform better
but Safari is more optimized so what
browser do you guys prefer let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
