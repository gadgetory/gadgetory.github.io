so you guys may have seen a little video
called building the ultimate ps4 where
Ken picked out a selection of
accessories of varying actual usefulness
well today the ps4 pros turn first off
we have the crucial MX 300 SSD so the
ps4 pro comes stock with a one terabyte
hard drive but it's a pretty slow
mechanical drive whereas with the MX 300
we're getting much faster game load
times with a full SSD installing a drug
is pretty easy what you do is sort of
pry off this little piece on the back of
the ps4 with a Phillips screw driver
there's just a single screw holding the
standard hard drive in place so once we
pull the stock hard drive out there are
just four screws that hold it in the
cage and we can just drop the SSD in now
like I said you can use a hard drive or
an SSD because we're building the
ultimate ps4 pro having that faster
speed is nice but if you just want more
storage space this is a really easy way
of doing it just make sure you're using
a two and a half inch drive it's no more
than nine point five millimeters thick
but say a terabyte isn't enough space
for your ps4 well that's where this game
drive comes in so this is a USB hard
drive with an additional two terabytes
of capacity so this is a specific ps4
branded Drive but it actually really
doesn't matter pretty much any USB 3.0
hard drive that's over 256 gigs of
capacity should work
so all these do is plug it into one of
the USB ports on the back and now we're
up to three terabytes with our ps4 pro
but that's not even close to being done
next we have a cooling fan for the ps4
pro now in our building the ultimate ps4
Xbox one videos we did try these inner
coolers and on the Xbox it was basically
useless and on the ps4 maybe a little
bit less so so when you consider that
the ps4 pro has so much power without a
ton of ventilation in theory something
like this could work but I'm a little
suspicious so something like this oh
yeah okay I mean I actually do kind of
appreciate how it does sort of follow up
with the little kind of triple stack
design it actually doesn't look too
crazy although it's falling off already
around back there are two fan speed
settings as well as an auto mode so I
guess when the ps4 Pro gets hot this
will start kicking up the fans the only
real issue here besides the
that's probably not going to do anything
is that it is powered via USB you know
normally this will be fine you plug it
into the port back here and no issues
however because we're starting to load
up more and more accessories we're
running out of ports or so you think
this is a USB hub for the ps4 Pro and
yeah things are about to get goofy in
here so just like the cooling fan this
should snap right into the front of the
ps4 Pro so it takes up both of the USB
ports in exchange gives us four USB 2.0
as well as the USB 3.0 yes
okay that uh that Archie does kind of
fit so things are starting to look just
a little bit goofy with the ps4 Pro
however it's time to take it up a notch
so this is the G story gaming monitor
for the ps4 pro now the idea is just
like the ps1 this is a game market that
will actually go on top of your ps4 so
you know how many people were
complaining when the ps4 Pro came out
that it looked a little bit like an Oreo
with the triple stack design well I feel
like this is gonna improve things with a
quadruple stack design fun so I think we
just used these little clips hold it
into place yeah actually not too bad
alright so that that is looking a lot
more like the ultimate ps4 Pro you
sometimes when we're doing a video I
just have to kind of like take a step
back and go oh wow right this is my job
I get to do this this is like a thing I
can do every day here we go yes so the
first thing I'm noticing this monitor is
actually not bad it is full 1080p this
might look totally impractical but
because the display doesn't add anything
to overall footprint of the ps4 Pro it
actually could make sense that tight
area such like a desk or in a dorm room
the panel itself also isn't too bad
so yes it's not going to be quite the
same experience as a full 4k gaming
monitor but the color and especially the
contrast is a lot better than I would
expect for $210 not that after
formatting our USB Drive we now see that
in addition to our one terabyte SSD we
also have two terabytes available on
that hard drive now this is actually a
really useful thing for Xbox as well as
ps4
then it makes it a lot simpler to be
able to just plug something in load a
ton of games on it and especially when
we have an SSD the games that you play a
lot you should keep on the internal
drive but set that you only play
occasionally just throw it on the hard
drive and forget about it the cooler is
a little bit harder to justify so yes if
you take a look at it it is doing
something as far as being able to
exhaust more air out of the ps4 Pro but
it's much louder than the ps4 by itself
and it's not like it's going to keep it
from bottlenecking or and give you any
extra performance the USB hub is also a
little bit questionable so while it is
nice to have that USB 3.0 pass-through
as well as the four additional ports we
are actually having some problems
plugging into the hard drive it kept
sort of disconnecting which makes me
think that this might be something easy
to skip so this is the ultimate ps4 Pro
when it actually turned out better than
I was expecting so as always links to
all these parts will be in the
description and I'm curious what do you
guys think about our ultimate ps4 Pro
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
