phone f1 when Shelby reached out and
want to sponsor a video on their brand
new poco foam brand which specifically
includes the f1 as their very first
phone I had one question what exactly is
this with a price tag of around $300 the
poco phone f1 might be the best deal and
smartphones right now so inside now
you're going to be getting a giant
battery but you're also getting a full
flagship grade Snapdragon 845 processor
and a 300 on the phone pop open the box
and what we're going to find is well
first of all a whole lot of yellow but
we also have the poco phone f1 itself I
don't think that were digging three
people to get a phone out of the box
before but you can know that they
definitely very securely shipped the
Polka phone have fun
so the addition to the base model of the
poco phone there's also going to be the
armoured Edition which is what I have
here now this on the back while it looks
like it might be fake it's actually a
real aramid fiber which is commonly used
in stuff like bulletproof vests and
high-end sports gear I'm not supposed to
do this Ken's not like you have to do
this but
ya know 30 not bad it does feel pretty
sturdy I've got to say I'm really
enjoying sort of just like the general
feel of the device it is very different
than all the glass and aluminum phones
we take a look at I appreciate it show
some nice little touches like it seems
like the fingerprint sensor is glass or
maybe like ceramic but it actually gives
a little bit of a nice look to the back
of the phone in addition to the USB C
port on the bottom of the phone which
does support quick charge 3.0 you're
also going to find a headphone jack yes
my friends he had another phone in 2018
which has still kept the headphone jack
an excellent friend it will probably be
gone by next year but you know now
there's devils going to be a notch as
well as a Chen but something interesting
they've done is actually do a pretty
severe curve on the edges of the display
and say you will find these snapdragon
845 now this is going to be the exact
same as what you're going to find other
high-end Android flagships definitely
nice to see at a phone at this price and
on top of that this model is going to be
rocking six gigabytes of RAM as well as
120 gigabytes of storage even though the
phone is going to be fairly thin in
light it actually does have a full four
thousand milliamp hour battery which is
nice to see especially considering that
some other thousand-dollar flagships
also have the same size battery but this
is going to be much much less expensive
to keep everything cool poka phone opted
to go with liquid cool tech for the f1
no traditionally a chip was going to be
able to just dissipate all of its heat
on the back of the phone and through the
body but using this it's going to be
able to allow you to run it a little bit
cooler for a little bit longer one of
the main advantages here is that even
when you're doing extended gaming
sessions the phone shouldn't get that
hot and very importantly for a mobile
chip like this
it shouldn't overheat and it shouldn't
go anywhere near to the same level of
throttling that you could have you had a
terrible cooler on your phone
not that anyone's ever done that so to
thoroughly test how this works I
wouldn't play a full game of pubsey
mobile and see just how hot the phone
gets again though this is thorough
scientific testing not me just looking
for an excuse to play punchy Mobile
there should be no surprises with an 845
onboard we have no problem playing even
fairly intense Android games such as pop
G mobile pretty much maxed out
whereas I come from
hey there we go I can totally play
against real people who are totally not
BOTS I'm actually kind of surprised the
back of the phone at least in touch
doesn't even feel warm yet let's
actually pull out the thermal camera and
see
so when here it seems like there is a
little bit of a hot spot right beside
the camera but even to the touch I mean
it's only just slightly warm the pooka
phone is rocking dual cameras around
back so it's got a 12 megapixel main
shooter as well as a 5 megapixel
secondary shooter which is primarily
used for portrait photos but does a
decent job it's not completely perfect
as far as cutting you out for the
background but it's not going to be bad
let's try the normal shooter that is
actually pretty good so it does have AI
tech on board to be able to analyze
damage and tune it based on what you're
taking a photo of and for the most part
it actually does a really good job of
enhancing the images all I know is it
looks nice so I can't complain about
that there's also going to be pretty
decent slow-motion on board it can shoot
1080p video up to 240 frames per second
as we shall now demonstrate are you
ready that actually looks really good
that's not bad dude that's actually
really clean yeah you're something else
that's pretty impressive with that clip
is that she did a pretty good job with
autofocus even though obviously I'm
moving very quickly it almost held me
the entire time we also do have a pretty
decent front-facing camera as we shall
now demonstrate right guys it's a really
bad selfie I mean the cameras great
don't get me wrong it's it's uh I know
what's going on with my face that's not
OK
they've actually got a pretty decent
sensor on here I can actually tell
because you're actually slightly out of
focus just being right behind us now el
Poco phone might be a new brand Xiaomi
most definitely is not so well the f1 is
not going to be some crazy high-end
flagship what it is is a very reasonably
priced phone that absolutely will get
the job done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
