on LastPass LastPass is an excellent
password manager allows you to keep all
of your various passwords to all the
great online sites that you use secure
in one location that you can use on a
variety of browsers operating systems
even mobile devices so it really really
gets at me when I see people who use bad
passwords solution you're like one two
three four five six but even you know a
lot of times they're better than that
but still you know what kind of a weak
sort of password and then when you use
it for multiple web sites now don't get
me wrong I used to do this you know it's
really simple to get one good password
and then just use it for all the online
websites just using a Facebook email
maybe even your bank all that kind of
stuff now well that's nice and
convenient if all it takes is any of
those sites that you'd like to go if any
of them gets cracked or has any issues
whatsoever and your password gets out
then that person who has it now has
access to your entire online database
and all the websites all of everything
your email sometimes even your bank I
mean it can be really scary if you lose
access to all of your data so the way
this LastPass works is addicted all of
your passwords secure in one location
and it keeps it portable so today I'm
going to be giving you guys a demo of it
on opera and of course I don't like to
do that but I'm going to give you be
giving you guys a demo on opera now this
is available for a wide variety of
browsers pretty much all the major ones
including opera Chrome Internet Explorer
you've got Safari and you have Firefox
this also works for all opera all major
operating systems including including
Windows OS 10 and Linux there also is a
paid version this is the standard
version of LastPass which is what I
recommend is totally free if you want to
pay for a premium version which as it
believes about twelve dollars a year you
can get access to a few extra security
features and you can use it on your
mobile devices such as the iPhone
Android webOS blackberry and a couple of
others but again I'm going to be showing
you the basic version of it and I'm
going to be showing it on opera so for
opera you just install a simple
extension it's very simple and then you
will have a little pop-up dialog up on
the top right of your screen now this is
where all of your options are now I've
already logged in if you whenever you
turn on your computer you will need to
enter your last your master password for
last
ass which will unlock your vault and
allow you to get it everything so there
are several really cool things about
this now I want to actually open this up
there are a few major things so one of
them is generate secure password this is
something that I found is really really
helpful so of course it's one thing to
come up with you know clever passwords
that you can remember for various sites
hell over with LastPass you can make
them totally randomized so for example
let's say I'm creating a new password so
I want a 15 length password with
numbered uppercase lowercase numbers
special and yes that sounds great so
this is my new password that's obviously
a long password I'm never going to be
able to remember that but what I can do
is click Save on LastPass and now that
password assuming that I just signed up
for some website that password is saved
so I don't need to remember it LastPass
remembers that really long complicated
password anytime I go to that website
I'm going to be good to go
and the good thing with creating really
long passwords like that is that they
are next to impossible to crack now
obviously nothing is impossible to crack
but it's really quite good and now there
are a couple of other features if I go
into this tools I'm use there's also a
really cool thing called the security
check which allows you to go ahead once
you add it all of your various passwords
are into LastPass will actually go
through all of your passwords and say
hey you've reused this password at three
sites this password is slow and I don't
know why it's asking that but it will
kind of give you an audit as far as what
all you some of your passwords might not
be very good if you've done them more
than once and it will allow you to
change them very simply so that's
definitely a really good feature let me
go to the major part of LastPass which
is your vault now to get into the vault
you will need to login using your master
password and of course always make sure
that your master password is good now
before I continue I do we just want to
mention one thing about LastPass I know
some people kind of get a little bit
anxious when you have all your passwords
in one place however the thing is a lot
of time you might already had that so
for example if you use one of your
standard browsers for example if you use
you know whatever browser it is and you
have all those passwords saved more than
likely all it takes is a single virus
and all those passwords can be taken
it's pretty simple to usually to pull up
your various safe passwords whereas in
LastPass you need to have your master
password indeed there are additional
things such as multi-factor
authentication which will for exam
for the with the grid it'll allow you to
pull out a grid like battleship and pick
out you know different numbers and
letters which will help increase the
security of your account so let me show
you how this works so for example let's
say this is my yahoo account now I can
pull this up and actually see my
password I can see my username all that
kind of stuff and it will automatically
give me options to autofill or auto
log-in same way goes whenever you go to
a sign app or change your password it
will offer to create a generate a brand
new password so there's a lot of really
cool things about LastPass and I highly
recommend that you guys take a look at
it
you know that's what I use I really
enjoy being able to not really worry
about all my passwords can have some
really long randomized passwords for
various different websites to kind of
help me give it a little bit better
sense of security so you guys if you
guys are interested in checking out
LastPass I'll have a link in the
description again works for pretty much
all browsers all os's so might as well
give it a shot and if you have a lot of
bad passwords or even indeed if you had
some pretty decent passwords but you
want to just step it up a notch LastPass
is going to be a great way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
