here with had brand new gaming PC for
five hundred dollars so the last time I
did this bill was back in July of last
year
well that was an awesome build at the
time there have been a lot of new parts
that have come out and a lot of cool
things that we can upgrade to make this
even better to give you guys an idea of
the performance obviously I can't test
every single game ever on this I chose a
few games that are very graphically
intensive and tried them on the 500 all
PC to see how they ran to start with we
have battlefield 3 with the resolution
set to 1920 by 1080 in the campaign I
was able to use ultra settings with the
anti-aliasing off and in multiplayer
high settings worked for very well far
cry 3 also works very well here again
with the resolution set to 1080p
I found that high settings were the
sweet spot here as it was easily able to
stay well above 30 frames per second
next up we have Crysis 3 which is one of
the best-looking PC games ever for this
one we had to turn this things down to
medium however do keep in mind that even
computers that cost twice as much as
this can sometimes struggle to write it
on high to kick the build off we're
going to be using an Intel Core i3 3220
now I recently did a comparison between
the core i3 and a pair of AMD CPUs and
this was the clear winner making it a
good fit for this budget PC so this is a
quad core processor clocked at 3.30
Hertz however it does have Intel
hyper-threading which allows Windows to
see it as a quad core CPU and a lot of
games will I should be able to leverage
that to run even faster for about $130
this is a great fit for our build for a
motherboard we wouldn't be using an MSI
b75 m AP 45 now the reason I like this
board is it comes with a lot of features
that you need and nothing you don't so
for example it does have a SATA 3 port
which means that if you ever want to
upgrade to an SSD it's very simple and
it also has cool things such as USB 3.0
support another very nice thing about
this motherboard is that if you ever
would like to upgrade you can ditch your
core i3 and grab a Core i5 or Core i7
and it will work without a problem all
for about $65 for a graphics card we
won't be using an EVGA GeForce GTX 650
Ti now this is a fantastic mid-range
card which of course like I was saying
earlier will be able to play games such
as Crysis 3 and battlefield 3 and
basically anything else you throw at it
now it does support one gigabyte of
gddr5 memory there is a two gigabyte
version of this card however I find that
to be just a little overpriced so said
to stick with the one can go by version
for this one it is also very
overclockable so you get some extra
performance
and with support for up to three
monitors it's a very solid card for
about one hundred and fifty dollars for
memory we're going to be using four
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance Ram now
this is assault stuff that I use in my
own build as its call it at 1600
megahertz that's about the sweet spot
for an Ivy Bridge based system like this
now I will be the first to admit that
four gigabytes isn't a ton of RAM so I
do recommend that when you can you can
upgrade this and because this
motherboard has four dimm slots if you'd
like you can bring this all the way up
to 16 gigabytes of RAM however if you
want just stick with the four gigabyte
version which is what I did with this
build is gonna run you about $25 for a
hard drive one using a 500 gigabyte
Western Digital caviar blue now this is
pretty much the only hard drive I ever
use in my budget PC builds and there's a
good reason for that
for starters since it does have 500
gigabytes of capacity that's gonna be a
lot of room for all your music your
pictures your videos your games all that
kind of stuff although I will mention
that and I'll add another link in the
description if you guys are interested
there's also a one terabyte version of
this drive if you want a little bit more
storage on top of that since it is a
7200 rpm Drive it's gonna be relatively
fast and it is very reliable I've used
many of these over the years and never
had any problems so all this for $60
makes it a saw a deal for a power supply
we're going to be using over 430 watt
Corsair CX 430 now this is a great
little power supply that is not only
reliable but it's also efficient with an
80 plus bronze certification
now 430 watts is overkill for the system
as it pulls something more like 150
watts when you're actually gaming
however having extra overhead is not a
bad thing at all this allows you to if
you'd ever like to add additional hard
drives fans lights all that kind of
stuff to your computer without any
problems all for about $40 for the case
we're going to be using an NZXT source
220 now i've recently been using a lot
of NZXT cases in my build and I've
guessed they have been very impressed so
the source 220 gives you a full ATX
sized enclosure which means that you
have plenty room for expansion for your
hard drives pretty much anything you can
think of to throw in there it should fit
now it does have a couple of additional
features including a an extra 140
millimeter fan over the previous version
as well as USB 3.0 support on the front
panel so all this for about 50 dollars
makes it a fantastic case so there you
guys go an awesome $500 gaming PC now do
keep in mind that prices are always
changing so I'll have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video and on top of
that I'll also add some additional
upgrades
so for example if you want to connect to
Wi-Fi you want to add a DVD drive a
bigger hard drive Windows 8 whatever you
want to do well the tunnel links in the
description of this video so be sure to
check them out if you guys are
interested more feel free to check out
some of my other pc builds including the
$350 build that I did last month if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
