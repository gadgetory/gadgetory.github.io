between the iPhone and iPod Touch app
store versus the Android Market so there
are a lot of key differences between
these two philosophies generally the
iPhone App Store tends to be a bit more
of a curated experience it doesn't
really let as many apps in there don't
have this quite as much freedom however
to play they do tend to be a little bit
higher quality compared to the Android
Market which well sometimes you might
find a little bit of a lower quality at
you can pretty much get anything you
want including emulators you know
different scans I mean there's a wide
wide variety of applications so what I'm
going to do for you guys today is do a
little bit of a comparison show you have
some of the pros and cons of each app
store okay so when you first open up
both app stores you'll find a fairly
similar interface so both allow you to
take a look at some of the features so
on the iPhone the iPod Touch you'll
notice there are a few things such as
app of the week
game of the week and you'll see that
there's a wide variety of different
featured apps and there's also a
category for what's hot which is
basically the same thing and you also
can use genius which I actually don't
use but if you'd like to use it you can
allow it to take a look at the apps that
you've bought and suggest new things
based on what you've purchased
previously on the other hand the Android
Market looks a little bit nicer as you
can see here it's got a little bit of a
smoother interface if you will you also
do have the featured apps and something
you should notice is that a lot of these
apps are free and that's going to be a
recurring theme in this Android app so
do tend to be free a little bit more
often but I will get into that in just a
minute up top there's a little carousel
so you can take a look at the some more
featured apps so anything jumps out at
you you can take a look at it you can
also sort by games you can sort by apps
which is of course just all games we can
search by character specific apps now
that is obviously going to depend on
your carrier however on this one
obviously we do have that so over here
if we come over to the iPhone you'll see
that we have a few different things as
far as the top 25 in fact we can go
ahead and go into the apps and is the
same on the Android phone so if we want
to just take a look at the top page on
both it should be a pretty interesting
thing you know over here you can see a
lot of this is like the ROM managers in
fact I'll open this up and that is a
really interesting thing as obviously to
get this these kind of features in a
iPhone or iPod touch you
basically need to jailbreak and now
there's nothing wrong against
jailbreaking the fact i jailbreak pretty
much always but it is much nicer if
you're into customizing modding tweak
not kind of good stuff on your phone
Android definitely has you beat here
obviously some of these do pay or rather
are paid but it's not that big a deal
and certainly it's a lot easier just to
pay couple of dollars and get all the
features you want rather than having to
spend a lot of time and try to jailbreak
and worry about stuff breaking out some
good stuff
now as far as the top paid apps actually
let me back up a little bit here
and go over to the games and show you
guys because typically games are well
obviously they're not the number one
thing but if you take a look at the IRS
App Store all you see is games pretty
much now let's take a look at what the
apps themselves look like so in fact
we'll pull up the same app fruit and
engine on here as well as on the Android
phone as you guys can see here I
definitely do prefer the interface
definitely does look a lot nicer the app
stores pretty much look the same for the
past couple years I mean it's certainly
not bland you can take a look at the
ratings you can see the price if I just
want to tap on that could buy it and
there's just a bunch of information
about it and all that kind of good stuff
if we scroll down we can take a look at
screenshots then again we can go report
problem and read ratings now over here
on the Android phones you can see here
we can read the same a description in
fact I supply the exact same description
is over here you take a look also you
can take a look at a screenshot so that
looks good to you oh yeah come on buy
that app and you also share and take a
look at reviews once again so the way
they work is very similarly on those far
as purchasing apps it does work a little
bit differently now if you have an
iPhone and iPod Touch using the App
Store you have a couple of different
options
now that is tied your iTunes account so
for example let's say you have an iTunes
gift card of course you can go to the
store and buy 15 25 etc etc gift cards
we can just load that up no problem
using that or you can have it hooked up
to your debt credit or debit card if I
want to buy this app just have it
automatically deducted from your account
it works pretty similarly on the Android
side however it is a little bit
different as there's no you know gift
cards or anything like that you pretty
much do you have to hook it up to your
account but I found that it's a pretty
painless procedure on both sides now
I've just got to say this straight up
there's no defense
winter Android is not a million times
better than iOS and iOS is nine million
times better than Android both of these
are really mature app stores they both
have in the tens and ability actually
probably hundreds of thousands of apps
so you're not going to have any issues
the only really reason that you would
have a major issue is if you're looking
for one specific app that might be on
you the iPhone not Android or vice versa
but overall I found that both app stores
are really nice user-friendly intuitive
to use and they also have a wide variety
of apps now as far as the pricing goes
that is something I really want to kind
of dance right now because it of course
it does vary you know hugely between the
devices I'm in fact what you guys to saw
there one apples a dollar twenty and
while it's $0.99 there so occasionally
you know it might be a little bit more
spensive here or there but overall I
actually found that Android apps tend to
be free in fact a lot of the Angry Birds
which are 99 cents on the App Store are
free on Android although they of course
do have ads so you know you're gonna
have a little bit of a trade-off but
anyway if you're going you know trying
to compare between getting an iPhone or
an Android phone just based on the app
store it's going to be kind of a hard
call the Android Market is definitely a
lot more open you can find stuff such as
routing and all kinds of different stuff
like ROM managers in addition to your
wide variety of games and standard apps
on the other hand though the iPhone
definitely does have a bit more of a
curated experience it's not as open
you're not going to see the same amount
of things you know such as to the stuff
that like the wrong managers and all
that kind of stuff but what you will
find is a lot of really nice polished
add some a lot of nice games so no
matter which way you go I really find it
hard to go wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
