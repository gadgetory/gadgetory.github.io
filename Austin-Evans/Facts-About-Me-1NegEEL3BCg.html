here with a video going over seven facts
about me now a couple of my good friends
here on YouTube Lamarr Wilson as well as
time off they both did these videos of
past couple days and since I've never
actually done one of these old-school
YouTube tag videos I figure it's my turn
fact number one is that I actually used
to have really long curly hair so yeah
let me just show you guys one of my old
videos so today we're going to be
talking about a topic that's on a lot of
people's minds this week which is
Minecraft Mobile fact number two is that
I used to be terrified of kissing a girl
now this might not sound that weird but
it legitimately went on for months it
was like the only thing I thought of I
was just so afraid it's gonna do it
wrong or she's gonna laugh at me or
something
dude that was like the worst three
months of my life yeah I was kind of
embarrassing fact number three is that I
almost became a writer so that was like
ten years old or so I started writing
stories and I filled up just tons and
tons and tons of notebooks and just you
know more Docs I just loved writing I
did it for years and the funny thing is
the only reason I stopped it was because
I started doing YouTube now don't get me
wrong I definitely love doing YouTube
and I wouldn't trade this for anything
but sometimes I do kind of think back
and say hey what if along those same
lines fact number four is that I started
making video a long time ago
so when I was younger we actually had a
computer but we didn't have the Internet
if you guys can believe that so what I
did is along with my brother is that we
put in all kinds of like game discs for
different video games a lot of times
back then they had like some
pre-rendered cutscenes and stuff and you
could actually take those right off the
disk and use them as a normal video file
so that's what we did we kind of cut
them up in these really terrible old
editors and made our own kind of
Machinima's and of course they were
terrible and really weren't all that
unique but it was definitely something
that kind of got me interested in video
from a very young age fact number five
was that I used to be obsessed with
Pokemon so yes I'm totally stealing some
from ty but it was true if you were a
kid growing up in the late 90s it was
absolutely insane how much Pokemon stuff
there was and then I'm the one thing I
liked was pokemon cards so I should have
still got my old binder here just all
the different cards I used to have but
man I used to love these things that you
stat well it's a zipper um anyway I had
a ton of those cards and you just play
the games all that
time in fact I still do play the game
sometimes now they're not quite as much
fun as they used to be and for the most
part the games haven't really changed in
the last 10-15 years but it's still an
awesome franchise and probably the
number one video games I've ever played
in my life I sunk so many hours to those
games it's not even funny
fact number six was that my very first
computer was actually an apple Lisa so I
was about 8 years old or so I bought
this for my neighbor who I think I paid
like 30 bucks for it
and I was so excited is going to be the
first computers gonna be awesome
and yet when I plugged it in it had a
password on it and my neighbor didn't
remember the password so it sat in my
garage for a couple years and we sold it
for like 10 bucks now out of everything
I've ever owned all the tech everything
that is the number one thing I regret
that would have been so awesome to have
today is they're actually kind of a
little bit valuable definitely worth
more than that 10 bucks I got back from
it fact number 7 is that I only got a
very first smartphone about two years
ago and it was a palm pixi plus now
don't get me wrong I love this thing was
the very first phone that I bought with
my own money
I used it and I loved it but yeah for a
guy who started reviewing smart phones a
couple years ago not exactly the
greatest start however since then of
course I've switched over to the iPhone
and then more recently I switched over
to Android but yeah two years ago I was
rocking a flip phone definitely the most
embarrassing thing I've said in this
video all right now it's your turn
what's a single funny or interesting or
embarrassing fact about you definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments
below anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video I never sat what I usually do

shake it up a bit
