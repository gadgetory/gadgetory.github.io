the video going over why you're probably
paying way too much for your phone
earlier this year I reviewed the Moto G
a phone that's a lot better than its
price would suggest I honestly thought
that was about as good as it gets on a
budget but Motorola wasn't done there
for $130 off contract the new Moto e is
a very very good smartphone however this
is only half of the story it doesn't
make much sense to save all that money
and buying the Moto e and spend $100 a
month on cell service so for testing I
went with simple mobile a prepaid
carrier here in the US once everything
is set up its totally seamless simple
mobile uses t-mobile's network so you
get coverage basically everywhere
meaning you're really not giving up
anything besides the camera I've been
happy with the Moto ease performance and
normal day-to-day use especially with
the great battery life it comes in a
design that's not too far off from the
Moto X with the same nice curves and
relatively small size which makes it
feel great in the hand it is a bit on
the thicker and heavier side but that
doesn't stop it from being a very nice
phone to use pop off the back and you
can get at the microSD card slot which
is important as the Moto e only comes
with four gigabytes of storage out of
the box if you want to customize the
look you can buy different colored back
blades which snap on and off without too
much trouble
now it's easy to get caught up in aspect
comparison when you're shopping for new
phone how many megapixels does it have
how fast is the processor what
resolution is the screen all these are
important questions and yet they
definitely don't tell the entire story
if all you look at are the raw numbers
the Moto e Falls a fair bit behind its
more expensive competition as far as the
internals go there's just no way $130
phone will match the specs that device
is costing three times the price
actually use the Moto e though and you'd
be hard-pressed to notice a major
difference at all to give you an example
I have the Moto e side-by-side with the
new LG g3 now the g3 is a very expensive
phone it's very powerful it's better in
a lot of ways how responsiveness is
surprisingly close so we're going to
open up the app drawer on both phones
you'll see the Moto e actually has a
slight advantage go ahead and hit the
home button together right now about the
same open up multitasking and jump into
settings and you'll see that the Moto e
absolute
has no problem keeping up reven being
just a little bit faster than a phone
that's over five times the price part of
the reason the Moto e is so responsive
is that it's running nearly stock
Android KitKat this paired with
Motorola's lightning quick updates or
something I wish everyone would just
copy of course there are areas where the
budget price is more noticeable the rear
camera is a pretty unremarkable 5
megapixel shooter that lacks a flash or
autofocus and produces pretty mediocre
pictures it's the same story with the
video so the Moto e tops out at 480p on
the video side which actually isn't the
worst thing I've seen however definitely
would be nice to have a little bit more
resolution one thing I will say
positively about it though is that does
a really good job of cutting out the
wind noise so it is very windy where I'm
standing right now however it does a
pretty good job of dealing with it oddly
there's no front-facing camera either
not the end of the world but of all the
things to cut this seems like a bit much
thankfully a place Motorola didn't skimp
is with the screen we're looking at a
4.3 inch display with a resolution of
540 by 960 it's not quite HD but it's
got pretty decent colour and contrast
with totally acceptable viewing angles
and brightness they also switch to using
a front firing speaker which was a great
move giving you a lot more volume
setting up a no-contract phone is pretty
straightforward you can pick up the SIM
card at a store or order it online and
sample mobile sent out a combo card for
both older phones and new smartphones
like the Moto e just snap the SIM out of
the package then pop the Micro SIM out
of the regular size SIM card it's tiny
but this is all you need to get your
phone up and running on the network just
pop off the back of the Moto e and will
slide right into the phone super simple
stuff you'll just need to go to the
simple mobile website to activate things
and you'll be good to go the entire
process only takes a few minutes data
speeds are pretty solved with the Moto e
however you are limited to 3G now if you
want even faster LTE service simple
mobile actually does support that all
you need to do is just make sure that
you bring a phone that supports t-mobile
LTE price-wise there's really not much
competition take the Moto e on a normal
carrier and you'll get around 2
gigabytes of data for $65 a month
compared to 3 gigabytes of data for $15
less phones like the Moto e make it
easier to completely avoid having to
deal with contracts you get the same
service with simple mobile and you can
upgrade your phone as often as you like
while it's not perfect overall I'm
really impressed by what Motorola was
able to pull off with the Moto e
considering how much you're able to get
for so much less it's really hard to
justify spending six or seven hundred
dollars on a phone and $100 a month for
cell service so what do you guys think
would you ever switch to the Moto e and
simple mobile let me know in the
comments below anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
