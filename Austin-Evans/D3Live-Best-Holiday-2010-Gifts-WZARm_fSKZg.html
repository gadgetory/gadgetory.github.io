episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about some of the best
holiday gifts for 2010 now obviously
every year there's going to be all kinds
of new gadgets new gizmos new video game
consoles all kinds of stuff and
sometimes it can be a little bit
difficult to sort through what's good
and what's bad so let's your go ahead
and give my full overview of what the
kind of the really the best of the best
in my opinion what's really you also be
looking for for this holiday season so
to begin with let's go ahead and take a
look at one of the bigger sellers every
year which are video game consoles now
my cake is definitely going to be for
this it's going to be the new xbox 360
along with Kinect so I xbox 360 if you
didn't know who's been redesigned a few
months ago it's basically a lot smaller
runs quieter has built in Wi-Fi and it's
going to be a lot more reliable so
hopefully a lot of the past problems as
far as old xboxes you're buying and
having a lot of issues has been resolved
with this new model and I think that's
going to be a big seller I think that's
gonna that's a really nice upgrade but
on top of that it's going to be connect
now connect is a motion-sensing add-on
for the xbox 360 basically it looks kind
of like a large webcam or something
basically you said underneath your TV
you're on top and it will actually
motion track you just solely using the
camera I'm in some really nice tech it
doesn't always work the best however
they're constantly improving it and even
as is it is really quite impressive so
definitely if you're looking for video
game systems and video game accessories
and that kind of stuff definitely look
for the xbox 360 and kinect you can get
them in bundles to save some money
depending off you already have an xbox
all kind of stuff so we'll definitely
look at that now continuing on with the
video game systems another thing I would
definitely go ahead and keep an eye out
for is the PlayStation Move I now
personally I kind of prefer connect as
as well as the xbox 360 playstation move
definitely does have some things going
for it so if you've ever played the weed
you know with the handheld motion
controls PlayStation Move is very
similar to that you do have you know us
control in one hand sometimes games need
more than one controller I mean go ahead
and play you know there's all kinds of
motion controls you know there's bowling
but there's also some kind
stuff that's more you know precise than
what you might find on the week overall
though I think if you already have a
PlayStation 3 the move would be a pretty
good idea you don't really have a
PlayStation 3 I don't think the move is
worth it by itself to go ahead and
justify the cost of buying a brand new
Playstation 3 but it's definitely a nice
little add-on so the next thing I'm
going to be taking a look at today is
these cameras eyes so of course cameras
camcorders those are always big sellers
every year and I'm go ahead and take a
look at one major one that I like which
is the Sony Bloggie touch so the Sony
Bloggie touch which is a fantastic name
I know it's really something as
underrated my opinion and it's actually
probably one of the best camcorders that
you can get on a fairly short budget so
depending on how much the price
depending on where you get it anywhere
from 180 to 200 dollars so it's
definitely in that low price point where
you might know as competitors would be
the flip minnow or something like that
however the bloody touches a lot going
for it so as the name suggests it does
have a touch screen but some of the
things that I like about it is that the
touch screen isn't just a gimmick I mean
the touch screen is actually genuinely
useful you know it saves a lot of the
space having to have buttons and dials
and everything which feels no more
professional yeah that would be a
problem but for something very simple
you know it's just you basically just
touch the screen hit record you know to
do the basic stuff the touch is a great
great idea but to couple that with some
really high quality video you know for
the size of it very very impressive
video as well as a great great thin form
factor I mean this thing very very small
built well and overall have no problems
whatsoever if you're in the market for a
moderately priced camcorder the Sony
Bloggie touch is definitely something I
recommend to take a look at so now let's
go to move on to something that you can
sort of consider a camcorder you can
consider a lot of things which is the
ipod touch 4th generation and then the
ipod touch has recently been upgraded
with a lot of new things such as a much
much nicer looking screen and two
cameras so while the son of all you
touch if you're just getting something
solely for you know video recording I
know that's definitely be the way to go
however for not too much more you can go
ahead and get an ipod touch which not
only shoots video takes pictures but
also does someone
more obviously you know you have the
full touchscreen you can play video
games you can check the internet your
email you know the ipod touch and
obviously since the ipod it does you
can't listen to music so the ipod touch
4th generation probably going to be one
of the biggest things this holiday
season it's just just because it's just
a jack of all trades it does so much now
of course it might not be the perfect
thing every little category but you know
if you were wanting to get the same
functionality that does everything the
ipod touch does you'd probably be
driving 10 different gadgets to pull
your parts and then wants to do that so
now when we want to just a couple more
things that I kind of like for this
holiday season and the next thing is
going to be Google TV now if you haven't
heard of Google TVs definitely something
I recommend that you check out google TV
it's basically like a new sort of way of
watching TV so the way you can do this
and there are several different models
some actually are built into the TV so
you can also get one with a built-in
blu-ray player or just a standalone box
very similar to what you might find from
your cable or satellite company however
it gives you a lot of added
functionality so with the Google TV
hooked up not only can you watch TV just
as you normally would with all your
standard no cable or satellite channels
however you have really enhanced web
integration so for example one of the
major things about this let's say you're
watching a TV show maybe watching an
infomercial that you know you like
something about the infomercial what you
want to look it up we'll all you need to
do is press the button on your remote go
ahead push the TV off to the side now
you can go ahead and have full access to
the entire internet and that's just one
small little thing you can go ahead and
have apps you can do all kinds of stuff
straight from your TV so for that reason
well it's not perfect yet our course you
have to brand new technology google TV i
definitely see it taking off and it's a
great idea for this holiday season I'm
so the last thing is probably going to
be one of the more obvious things that
you expect and probably be you know just
sell just millions millions of them is
the Apple iPad now obviously the ipad
has been out for about six months or so
maybe you look at more I don't know
exactly when it came out but the ipad
was just a huge huge seller it of course
it's apple's tablet and it's probably
the best tablet available on the market
so basically what you can do with the
ipad it's very similar
might be able to do with an iphone and
ipod touch over on a much larger scale
so anyone who's ever used a smartphone
ipod or iphone knows they can do a lot
such as emails web browsing etc however
if you expand it without much larger to
something that's it's going to be a much
larger size in your small screen it
allows you to do so much more and for
that reason i definitely would recommend
if you're in the market for a really
expensive gift but it's going to be you
know almost is on par with replacing a
laptop the ipad is going to be a great
way to go okay so for the second segment
33 live will be taking live questions so
as always with every episode III live
it's all filmed in front of blog TV and
we've got quite a few people in here and
as the school i just take some questions
do I think the iphone five will be the
biggest product of 2011 you know the
fish a pretty good question um you know
I phones are always huge apple you know
any apple products always huge but you
know I think it's just a little too far
out to really predict too much about
what we're going to see on the iPhone 5
now if your interests I have made a
previous d3 live episode about it over a
lot that stuff is mostly just what we
expect and really I think it's just
loops who early to say is the ipad 2
coming out soon when what features now
that's a little bit closer the ipad 2 is
most likely going to be coming out in
the next three months I'm lot of people
saying somewhere maybe like februari
march april sometime in that timeframe
which definitely does make sense in my
opinion as far as the features go i
think it's going to be a moderate
upgrade i definitely would expect to see
some cameras on it at the very least to
facetime camera but I'd also expect to
see a lot faster processor so probably
something like the Apple a5 chip or
something something something like that
I just expect to see the ipad 2 I don't
think it'll be some you know and saying
upgrade i think is going to be mostly
the same that think there will be a lot
of nice improvements in it well the ipad
go down on black friday in case you've
some of you aren't from the United
States you won't know but every the
friday after thanksgiving there is going
to be there's a huge sale all kinds of
stores you know drop the prices
tremendously
as far as you know what kind of products
you get you know it's really hard to say
most if you're interested you can go
ahead there are a lot of websites that
are specifically about you know how to
find the best deals and everything and
general I would expect Apple products to
be discounted too much but absolutely
it's definitely a possibility if there's
an ipod touch 5th generation what
features are new and when will it come
out as far as the ipod touch 5th
generation i really wouldn't look for
that the 4th generation just came out in
September and apple updates the other
ipods every September so obviously we're
not going to go ahead and see a new ipod
touch for close to a year now so far as
features and as far as when it'll come
out I really wouldn't worry about that
it'll probably the better part of a year
before we see that so we're thinking
about getting one now would be
absolutely a great time what is my
opinion of Google TV well obviously I
did just touch on this a little bit
earlier but overall I liked the idea and
the concept of Google TV I think it's
got a great idea obviously for a very
long time you know when you get on your
TV you turn it on you flip the channels
that's all you do but now with google TV
and I've quarter a lot of other sorts of
things like this to try to get more
interactive stuff on your TV I think is
really going to kick off a new
generation of TV and personally I'm
really looking forward to it I think
that you know having the idea of being
able to stream your favorite content
watch youtube search the internet and do
all the stuff straight from TV is a
great idea now I do know that Google TV
is not perfect right now you know
there's so there's a few issues however
for the most part I think that you know
it's still a great investment right now
and especially if you want to wait in
your like a few months to a year
especially if you wanted to wait a full
year that would give them a lot of time
to iron out some of the kinks make a
little bit faster and all that kind of
stuff but overall very I'm very
definitely looking forward to Google TV
is the ipad is the gap shacab a good
gift the galaxy tab if you don't know it
is a samsung android tablet basically
it's somewhat similar to the ipad
although it does run the kind of the
competing android operating system the
galaxy tab is not too bad my
I do kind of like it but really for the
most part I just can't recommend buying
it over the ipad it does have some
additional features it does have cameras
which obviously the ipad does not have
it does have a much smaller form factor
of a 7-inch string certainly it is very
much like you actually hold it in one
hand rather than the ipad which is much
larger however overall I do like the
iPad I mean it's got a better operating
system in my opinion as far as you know
it's very very clean simple it was
really very well purpose-built for the
ipad so you know unlike the gouts tab
which has android which is pretty much
reduced basically made for your phone
and it's kind of just jumbled together
to make it look for work for the bigger
screen Apple really did it right as far
as blowing up the iphone operating
system for the ipad now let's say
anything bad is the galaxy tab and you
know I was buying two tablets you know
patty pick to get stevan absolutely be
the second one it's probably the second
best tablet and what I pad is still
better typing so if you're going to
spend that money I would definitely go
with the ipad against add versus
playbook vs ipad verjus HP slate you
know that's kind of a hard question I'm
really looking forward to the blackberry
playbook which is yet another tablet
that will actually be released sometime
early next year but I think it's kind of
hard comparison to make just because you
know you fish fest for six months or so
we're going to have a lot of new tablets
will have a new iPad will have the
PlayBook will have a lot of new chaplet
so it's kind of hard to know to judge
from right now and the game will be
entirely different here in six months or
so ipod touch 4th generation or the ipad
that's that's that that's kind of a hard
question i mean it depends on what you
need i mean if you need an ipod
something is going to be really small
fit in your pocket i can do all the
kinds of different stuff unique
definitely go for the ipod however if
you don't really need something that
small especially already have an iphone
or some sort of equivalent smartphone
ipads probably gonna be the way to go
just because it does it's so much larger
it does allow you to get more done you
know just put that larger screen you
have a nice size keyboard and I should
go ahead and do
more so I would probably go with the
iPad however you know it just little
does depend on you what you need which
games console is better than xbox 360 or
Playstation 3 now that question I'm
going to touch you know there are
definitely big big advantages and
disadvantages to both consoles
personally you know I think a lot of
people would do great if they had both
you know if you could go ahead and get
both that would be the best of both
worlds I'm ever get to pick one the xbox
in my opinion by a very very slight
margin the PlayStation 3 is great has a
lot of really great features such as
blu-ray that is totally absent in the
xbox 360 / I just prefer the game
library the xbox 360 I do like the fact
that it does have connect and general a
lot of times you know the xbox can be
quite a bit cheaper especially if you go
for the four gigabyte version absolutely
