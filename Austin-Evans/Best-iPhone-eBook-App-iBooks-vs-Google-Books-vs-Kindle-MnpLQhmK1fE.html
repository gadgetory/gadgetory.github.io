comparison between three of the top
ebook reading applications available for
the iPhone and the iPod Touch now at
first glance this might seem a bit of an
odd comparison you know books that you
know that they're ok or maybe the iPad
at the Kindle why don't you ever want to
read it on an iPhone or iPod Touch
however recently I found that it
actually is not a bad comparison
whatsoever is I found that reading books
on my iPod Touch is actually really
quite cool so of course you have
bizzy's devices in your pocket all day
long so you're always going to have
access to them unlike something like an
iPad or a Kindle where it's kind of a
little bit of hassle it's not going to
put one of those in your pocket so
beyond that of course the newest
generation of devices the iPhone 4 as
well as the iPod Touch 4th generation
both support the very nice high
resolution Retina display which makes
reading really quite nice it's a very
enjoyable experience so today I'm going
to go ahead and compare if you've
decided that this is the way you want to
go ahead and do your books I'm go ahead
and compare to the three major
applications for book reading namely
Google Books Kendall and iBooks going to
help you guys decide which one you
really want to go with because of course
you can go ahead and download them all
they're all free and what we're buying
all the books and kind of having them
you know some of this app some of that
is definitely not the most ideal
situation all these are made to go ahead
and have all your information in the
books lets you sync it all and have it
all in one place so I'm go ahead and
compare them all and help you decide
which is the best for you now the way
this is going to work because each one
of these is going to be fairly long I
don't want to make a 20 minute video
just to make me watch one after one one
after the other at the other so this is
going to work is that right on the
screen just one second they're going to
be three and annotations over each of
the apps now the way it's going to work
is just go ahead and click whichever one
you're most interested in so if you want
to know more about iBooks click on the
iBooks icon on the screen right now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
