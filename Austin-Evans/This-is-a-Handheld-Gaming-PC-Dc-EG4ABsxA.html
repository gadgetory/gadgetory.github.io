whether you need a domain online store
or website make it with Squarespace hey
guys the Austin this inconspicuous box
right here contains a portable game
console that is a full-fledged PC with
Windows this is the GPD win - and it'll
be clear this is still a prototype so
the final version will have some fit and
finish differences but should give us a
good look at what this guy is actually
going to be like when it goes on sale yo
it's like a little laptop wow this is so
cool so if you guys remember last year
we did a video on the world's smallest
laptop at the time which is also made by
GPD well this actually takes a lot of
cues from that but it actually has
pretty much a full Xbox controller built
in in addition to a tiny keyboard I've
got to say the hardware feels
surprisingly solid so it's all metal and
actually is I'm a member oh yeah that's
definitely metal yeah this is this is
very unusual there's all kinds of weird
buttons and ports it's a full sized USB
port on the back of your tiny game
console so in addition to a slot for the
SSD you will also see the tiny fan now
it separates this from something like
that GPD laptop that we took a look at
last year as this has a proper core
processor and mind you it's a low
wattage core m3 but still it actually
should be enough to play some decent
games there's a pretty wide variety of
ports including a USB type-c which can
also be used for charging a headphone
jack a full size USB 3.0 micro sd we
have a micro HDMI as well as we have
three sets of shoulder buttons take a
look inside the win - and you'll see
it's a pretty interesting little device
so in addition to having a pair of
joysticks you also get a d-pad as well
as your standard XY a and B buttons
there's a little table here that will
switch between Mouse input as well as
just turning it into a game controller
but even on the keyboard there are some
specific options including you've got an
Xbox button so I like to start you can
even use the arrow keys as well as the
WASD now is it a good idea for you to
set your tiny little laptop portable
console thing up and use it with a mouse
in this tiny keyboard no it's not a good
idea at all but you have a USB port so
you can do it so
might not sound impressive with a 6 inch
720p display it actually does make sense
considering that the fairly limited
power of the actual computer or game
console what I call this do we call this
a computer you think I mean it runs
Windows it's a computer raid handheld PC
coming back 2018 fear of handheld pcs do
you hear that that's the sound of
portable power especially not that loud
it's just a little a little high-pitched
I will say one thing now that we're
actually into Windows 720p on a 6-inch
display is very very small inside this
guy is rocking that quart m3 processor
with the integrated HD 615 graphics
eight gigabytes of RAM 120 gig SSD as
well as a pair of 49 hundred million
power batteries which especially when
you're doing longer gaming sessions
should definitely come in handy so
because this guy only has 120 gigs of
storage out of the box I am using an
external drive but let's actually see
how the controls hold up in gaming the
first game I'm going to be trying is
csgo now this is a famous game that is
really well known for how well it is
supported by controllers and how it
really is the ultimate way of playing
the game alright I'm just walking on
with a pistol because I don't know what
the controls are to switch oh it's space
so immediately the performance it seems
decent I definitely need to tune the
sensitivity of these sticks but being
like 45 frames per second on medium at
720p we want to play this the more it
really does feel like I'm playing on a
PC version of the switch the 6 inch
screen even though it's not super high
resolution or anything because it's so
small it makes a lot of games even on
medium looks pretty decent
next we have rocket League now here I'm
also going to turn it down to 720p on
quality settings but I think we should
be playable a game like rocket League
does feel at home on the win not only is
it powerful enough to play it pretty
well the controls feel really nice so
something I'm noticing here is that the
quality of the buttons and especially
the sticks feels solid it feels like
while yes this is going to be a little
bit of an expensive portable would you
see where they spent it it wasn't like
they're just going crazy and oh yeah oh
yeah come on come on come on come on
come on come on oh no next we have GTA 5
no this a claim is able to be played
back at around 40 frames per second with
max said
however while I'm playing it here at
720p on normal I'm getting like 20
frames per second so I'm not exactly
sure how they're getting that number
it's kind of playable just as about as
much as like the Xbox 360 version maybe
but yeah not the greatest experience
even though the controls are good for
the most part I will say it is a little
bit awkward to have three sets of
buttons on your shoulders instead of two
so instead of being able to press in the
sticks for r3 and l3 you actually have
that dedicated button around back and
that's fine but I accidentally keep
grabbing it what I mean to do something
like shoot at someone or something which
is kind of annoying now comes the real
test
can I play overwatch on this guy so at
first glance a portable overwatch
machine sounds like a great idea but I'm
curious to see what the actual
performance looks like so an overwatch
it's 720p on low we do say the framerate
dropping a little bit from time to time
especially when you get into a big
battle but it is usable my big issue is
just a sort of the sensitivity of the
sticks I feel like it does need a little
bit of sort of customization to be able
to really get into it good sweet spot
but it's not bad also what am I doing
here
so should you pick up the GPD when -
well it's a little bit more complicated
than a lot of videos on one hand even
though yeah it's a little bit of a weird
concept then when actually pulls it off
pretty well the biggest downside is
price so it's 650 dollars on IndieGoGo
right now and somewhere north of $800
when it goes for full retail sale the
GPD went to is for a very specific
person for everyone else may interest
you and something called the Nintendo
switch and if you pick up a switch you
can use all the money you save to sign
