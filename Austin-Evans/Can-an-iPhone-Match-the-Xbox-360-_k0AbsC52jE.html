Thrones on my phone when it hit me this
is a full console game in my pocket that
got me thinking how far away are our
phones from consoles anyway after nine
years of tech evolution the iPhone
six-plus can actually hang with the
xbox360 while using orders of magnitude
less power on paper the 360 has the
advantage but it's closer than it seems
thanks to the older PowerPC CPU design
and DirectX 9 era graphics bring the
iPad air 2 in the picture and you'll see
it has the same amount of cores
quadruple the memory and a beefy GPU
they can outperform the xenos inside the
xbox of course specs are one thing but
there's no substitute for actual
gameplay to make things a bit more fair
we're going to connect the iPhone to a
TV using the lightning to HDMI adapter
and use the MOCA rebel controller to get
some actual physical controls iOS and
supported controller since iOS 7 and
they make a big difference for games
like first-person shooters so let's play
a few games and see if you guys can
figure out which ones are from the
iPhone and which are running on the Xbox
the Robb Stark King in the north all
right so do you have your guesses well
the answer is actually all the games are
running on the iPhone now if that
tripped you up you're not the only one
as the line between console and mobile
gaming has definitely been blurring
lately Telltale's Game of Thrones is
essentially the same game on both the
iPhone and Xbox so it's a good
comparison between the pair if you pixel
peep you'll notice some subtle upgrades
like higher res textures and smoother
anti-aliasing on the 360 but it really
isn't a huge difference move over to the
original BioShock and you'll notice a
bigger change although again you're
getting an actual port not a
watered-down version of the game the
biggest concession here is a much lower
resolution which while it makes sense on
a smaller screen is still disappointing
along with the pared down graphics
options arguably more important than the
Hardware differences is that developers
have had nearly 10 years to optimize
games for the Xbox whereas there's a new
iPhone every year that's where metal
comes in like mantle gl next and DirectX
12 Apple has metal which is a
lower-level API to let developers really
dig in to the a7 and a8 to get more
performance the best example of this is
epic Zen garden a graphics demo with
Unreal Engine 4 that looks great period
not even considering that this is
running on a phone modern combat 5 also
takes advantage of metal and while it's
not quite as nice looking it's still a
decent step forward for mobile gaming
the iPhone might not quite be able to
match a console like for 360 but it is
very very close if things keep moving at
this rate the Xbox one and ps4 better
watch out
