brand-new honor 6x so I was calling up
to sponsor this video to give you guys a
sneak peek at the phone before it comes
out so this brings dual camera
technology down to a smart phone that
costs less than three hundred dollars so
whoo I got that like one smooth motion
we have the actual phone itself the
first thing that jumps out to me is this
is a really light phone and I mean that
in a good way so even though we do have
an aluminum build a 5.5 inch display and
a pretty beefy 3300 milliamp hour
battery the phone feels surprisingly
small and light in the hand I think a
big part of that is the fact that's got
a nice tapered edge on the side which
means that when you're holding it it
feels like a much smaller and thinner
phone than it really is this might be
the very first unboxing I've ever done
without stupid paperwork
good job honor even though I'm sure you
actually have to put paperwork in the
final box but what I really want to try
is the dual lens camera so run back it
has a 12 megapixel camera that is backed
up by a 2 megapixel sensor so what this
allows you to do is get some additional
flexibility after you take a shot so for
example you can get some additional
depth of field or even change the focus
after you take the picture so if we turn
on wide aperture mode that's a close we
get to the death and get in focus so
this actually looks pretty good by
itself so I want to adjust it I can
change the simulated aperture so say I
want to close it down and get more stuff
in focus if I open it up say F 1.4 the
background actually falls away pretty
nicely I'm gonna say I've tried a couple
of sort of simulated depth of field
effects with multiple cameras and
usually they're decent they're kind of
ok but I find myself not using them
after a while but this might be one of
the better implementations this picture
looks super clean but we have Beauty
video I'm totally gonna do that
this is 100% beauty video Wow
you know what I need Beauty video in my
life can we just shoot can we turn these
cameras to beauty video mode so in
addition to having those dual lenses to
be able to get some of the cool depth of
field effects it also has a solid 12
megapixel camera built-in so if we turn
on the Profoto mode
so if you get close enough you can
actually get decent depth of field just
with the standard camera and I've got to
say like the sharpness is really nice
enable perfect selfie to make your
selfies even more beautiful Oh we'll see
about that
whoa whoa okay that's um that's the
perfect selfie I'll give them that I'm
not going to say that I take perfect
selfies all the time just most of the
time but this is actually a lot of fun
they've done the camera stuff right here
there are a lot of modes and they're not
super gimmicky right so there's some of
these things that are really
legitimately useful so I don't have to
talk about the phone now or Kai just
keep playing with the camera the 6x is
rocking a 5.5 inch display or the
resolution 1920 by 1080 it's a good
panel color and contrast are both on
point and one of those things is
actually is a really bright display too
and around 450 nits mmm that's actually
really fast so the 6x also has a
fingerprint sensor around back as you
can see it's almost immediate you don't
have to press anything and click
anything you just rest your finger on
the button and it's unlocked
inside the honor 6x it's rocking an
octa-core Kirin 655 processor paired
with three gigs of memory and 32
gigabytes of storage that you can expand
up to 128 gigs if you throw a microSD in
with the efficient processor and big
3340 milliamp hour battery you should be
able to get through a full day of use
with the 6 X which is really nice
considering that it is such a thin phone
so it's specs like that the 6 X can
handle some previous in gaming but the
real test is going to be can a handle
train racing this sounds incredible well
you ate the review good graphics it is
very interesting and with good graphics
I love this game I mean with a review
like that we've got to get some train
racing in uber or we're moving now 40 50
60 whoa 120 130 oh we just raised it
stream no I didn't see there's a train
on the tracks okay so the train life
might not be for me however the honor 6x
can definitely handle train simulator
2017 or whatever this game is called
so if you want to get your perfect
selfie on the honor 6x will be available
for pre-order starting today for $250
it'll be going on sale on January 15th
and of course all the ways you guys need
will be in the description of this video
so what
think about the 6x they'd only be sure
to let me know in the comments below and
I will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
