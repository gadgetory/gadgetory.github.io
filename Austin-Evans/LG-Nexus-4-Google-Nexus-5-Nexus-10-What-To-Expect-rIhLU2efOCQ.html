with what to expect at the new Google
event next week so there's a lot of
rumors going around about all kinds of
things we might be seeing including
Android 4.2 a new Nexus 4 and a new
Nexus 5 phone as well as a new Nexus 10
tablet
it looks like the Nexus 4 is going to be
based on the lg optimus G now this is
actually a really impressive looking
handset no they just have one of the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro processors
technical jargon aside its quad core and
it's probably gonna be about the fastest
thing you can get in any phone out there
it's also of course as a Nexus device
going to be running pure stock Android
take a closer look at the Nexus 4 and
you'll see it has more than a passing
resemblance to the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
now of course this is going to be made
by LG and some of the design things I've
gotta admit aren't really that exciting
to me so for starters if you look at it
it's a very boring phone I don't mean
that in the bad way but in the it's that
particularly exciting way as far as
specs go it's going to have a 4.7 inch
IPS display with a resolution of 1280 by
720 and one paper that looks very
similar to the Galaxy Nexus however this
is not going to be pentaiah which tech
jargon aside it's gonna be better just
just roll with it it's also going to be
made by LG of course who makes some of
the best-looking displays period on top
of that it's also going to have 2
gigabytes of RAM is what I'm going to
have 8 gigabytes of internal storage now
that might sound like a little bit of a
weird thing especially considering that
there's no micro SD card slot but the
important thing to know is that this is
going to be a budget device right now
the rumors are suggesting that this will
mostly be sold directly through Google
so this isn't a huge surprise so for
example if you go to play Google calm
right now you can buy from Google the
Nexus 7 as well as the Galaxy Nexus
however the interesting thing here is
actually maybe the only way to get it in
some places so instead of going and
buying it from a carrier or from pests
buy or wherever else you'll buy it
directly from Google without any kind of
contract and get the phone for probably
somewhere around $400 now before you
guys all freak out $400 it's way too
much keep in mind that this is with no
contract so for example if you want to
buy something like the iPhone 5 without
a contract it's gonna run you something
like $650 where it gets more interesting
is that we may see more than one Nexus
device this year
so several rumors have pegged that
Google is actually going to start doing
more than just one tablet and one phone
of course have different sizes different
prices and all that kind of stuff and
what we may see is an HTC Nexus 5
the other day HTC announced TJ butterfly
now this is a Japanese model phone
however the specs are just ridiculous so
for starters it's got all the kind of
normal things like a Snapdragon s4
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM jellybean
all the kind of super high-end stuff
that you would expect however where it
really really is impressive is in the
screen it has a 5-inch display with a
resolution wait for it
1920 by 1080 so yes this actually has
the same resolution as your 70 inch
plasma TV on a 5-inch phone yes yes now
we don't know for sure that HTC is going
to be making a Nexus version of the
butterflied however the specs do line up
with what we've heard about a supposed
Nexus 5 and considering that the
butterfly is a real phone they've
already designed that got a lot of work
done if they did want to make a Nexus
version of it it would be all that
difficult maybe we change the hardware a
little bit a few tweaks here and there
throw a version of Android 4.2 on there
and they're good to go and if that
wasn't enough Android awesomeness for
you here's another one
it looks very plausible that there could
be a brand new Samsung Nexus 10 tablet
coming now this one is a little bit
sketchy we don't have a lot of
information on it and we don't even know
if it's going to be shipping next week
or next month or even next year the idea
here is that this would be a 10 inch
tablet manufactured by Samsung which was
flawed above the Nexus 7 in the range to
go after the iPad the giveaway that this
is going to be an iPad killers in the
screen the rumored resolution is going
to be 2560 by 1600 now that is pretty
much as high resolution as it gets not
only is that way better than the iPads
Retina display
but even matches some of the best twenty
seven and thirty inch computer monitors
on the market combined all of this with
a new Android 4.2 update and come Monday
that are going to be a lot of really
excited Android fans so I'm curious to
know guys what do you think about all
these new updates personally I think the
Nexus 4 looks pretty good but man that
Nexus 5 has got my name written all over
it don't forget to hit up that like
button if you enjoyed and if you're
interested in the full recap of whatever
google announces next Monday be sure to
subscribe to the channel as I will be
doing a full recap of the event is over
anyway guys I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
