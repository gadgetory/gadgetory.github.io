today I'm here with a review my first a
provisional while of trenches trenches
is actually a really really fun game
tonight nine cents and you know I've
been playing it for a few days now and I
gotta say I'm really enjoying it it's a
it's a pretty unique game it works well
it flows well and it's a lot of fun so
yeah let's get this one started okay so
yeah there's a couple different modes
and trenches but before I begin let me
go ahead just start by kind of filling
you in on what's it about basically it's
set in like world war one and as you can
kind of see maybe it's got a little bit
of a cartoon Castile which works pretty
well so basically it's kind of set in
world war one and you play as the
British and you're against the Germans
and as you might have guessed from the
name the trenches have a lot to do with
it basically you constantly get points
money and call whatever you want but
believe it called points and with those
points you can get more more different
troops where the rifleman snipers
machine guns etc and then basically you
go along and you fight and you go
between the trenches it's pretty simple
but yeah let's just go and jump in
there's two different modes there's
campaign which that's a fun it's a fun
mode you go through different actually
levels in the skirmish which pretty much
lasts there's no real way to end it you
pretty much just play until you lose and
then you get your high score so for this
let's go ahead and show you skirmish so
let's go ahead and do a new game because
where I started that one so you can take
it there's some different game types
let's go ahead to leave that it's also
different maps which you'll see that in
a minute there's difficulty which is
adapted which I like that because it
pretty much if you start to lose they'll
kind of get a little bit easier to kill
and likewise is the part of it along you
go you can go through different ones in
the length which is normal which I'm
just gonna leave out the salon and let's
go ahead and hit play now that's a
pretty fun game you guys will see it
it's it's very cool okay so here's our
trench
now there's some different things if you
see up top we have let me call on some
guys first step talk we have our money
and basically that is continuously
rising and then we get little troops and
they I can they go ahead now if you'll
see here you'll see here go ahead and
tell them to stay in that trench let's
get some more so basically here's some
German so here you see the pretty much
goes on autopilot they fire and they
fire back and forth and you pull in more
more troops so you see here we have a
bunch of scope for some machine gunners
if you would go back here the ways
you'll see that they come from that end
and they'll keep walking across now
obviously the name of this game is
trenches and trenches play a big part in
it because it's really easy to dis much
easier to defend from a trench then
instead of just walking across so let's
go ahead and see here give him a minute
now let's go ahead and just attack so
you all you have to do is just tap them
and drag them and they will start going
so it's calling some more guys so to get
some more reinforcements Lowell waiting
you can see here at the top I've got
quite a few so I'm going to do one of
these two now there's several different
kinds there's riflemen which are you
know the weakest you have sniper rifle
snipers have machine gunners and you
also have mortars but these two are
interactive so basically this is poison
gas and this is a bomb so let's pull on
poison gas so you basically take it and
then let go and now now you have poison
gas conceals grain rather and that will
SAP it'll help and kill them but you see
here they're not stupid you see they're
all backing off but that's no big deal
so let's go ahead and call them some
more guys figure out because I don't pay
attention but you see here that's
holding them off right now so in the
meantime I can be getting a bunch more
guys without doing anything they'll
automatically continue to run if I'm
good let's pull in a ball now there we
go you see here their heads go find it
where it's very cartoon likely it's
pretty cool I'm not pay attention
upright better get going but here pull
him back you tell them to sit in
trenches automatically they will
continue
to go as far as they can but the AI is
pretty smart and it's not like it's not
like you're fighting with it or whatever
I mean you're pretty much you can call
them in and you can pretty much leave
like that it's better to go ahead and
you know control them tell them to fall
back and stuff like that sauce go ahead
now you see here you're it doesn't
matter if you kill them or whatever
they're you're constantly getting more
so let's go ahead and get full call
another bomb and you see here boom there
goes a ton of them and call some more
rifleman in so see here I'm actually not
going to get them down my first french
but depending pretty well let's call it
a mortar show you guys what that looks
like but yeah it trenches is a really
cool game as you can see it really you
might not be able to tell too much but
it's a really fun game I mean it's
really enjoyable it's a lot of fun to go
ahead and you know go through so as you
see here these guys are tacking so let's
go ahead and send everybody travel this
trench right here and here we go you can
see a mortar and mortars just you know
the way and want you to come down it has
will be damage to everybody in the area
first thing you know I like the rifleman
in the normal rifleman but hyper right
one whatever but yeah so you guys that
is just by this let's go ahead and get
out of here but yeah so the guys that is
trenches it's a 99 cent app and its
really addictive you know when I first
got it you know I was going to review it
I figure you know i might play it for
just a few minutes and since the i was
hooked i played for two hours straight
and all on skirmish the same mode and
it's it's great because it's seesaws
back and forth like as you saw i was
back there's like six or seven trenches
along that area and then there's a place
where my guys come from the left and
there you guys come from the right and
you know it goes back and forth you
might be all the way up to their base
and then my ten guys have come out push
you back it's a lot of fun really
addictive and you can play for a long
time so guys I highly recommend trenches
it's a ton of fun and for 99 cents great
it's really polished graphics pretty
cool there's not a whole lot to not like
about
so yeah guys I definitely recommend it
very cool lab anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
