Audi for years in fact my last two cars
including the rs3 that I drive today are
all outies
so when they reached out and want to
give me a q7 for a week and sponsor a
video it didn't take me long to say yes
this is the 2018 ow t q7 and as a big
luxurious SUV is absolutely loaded with
cool tech something that the q7 and a
lot of other modern outies have is
traffic jam assist especially when you
get into bumper-to-bumper traffic
something like this is so much nicer now
mind you this is only going to be
enabled when you're going below 40 miles
an hour so you have to worry about
following exactly behind the car trying
to stay in your lane watching around the
car does a lot of that work for you
it's not going to be full self-driving
but as long as you kind of keep an eye
on things if there's a really good job
of actually keeping you in the right
spot and now that we've sped up about 40
miles an hour the traffic jam it says
turns off but we still do have the lane
key so we're following the truck in
front and it's doing pretty much all the
steering I have to do a little bit less
especially when we get into sharper
corners because you can see here is
following the bend no problem so of
course no driving video is complete
without a little bit of you know actual
driving so no one would suspect that the
Audi q7 is going to be a great Canyon
machine but it handles surprisingly well
a big part of that are the giant 285
summer tires on this guy but for an SUV
that's this big it handles surprisingly
well something you can really notice
with this though is that when you
actually load the air suspension it
makes a big difference so you can crank
it all the way up if you're doing
something like off-roading but for like
a Canyon Drive like this lowering it not
only makes the car feel a lot more
planted I think it just looks really
cool on the outside as well also I've
got to say Angeles Forest is such a
beautiful beautiful driving road
oh man so of course no one to the right
mind is ever going to take a q7 on a
spirited Canyon driver maybe well who
knows but the idea here is that you're
getting a full-size SUV that not only
has all the tech that you would expect
but it also drives like a proper proper
driving SUV I mean I'm literally
impressed when you look at the size of
this thing look how well it actually
handles and what kind of power it's got
I mean can you scared yet there are a
lot of cool convenience and safety
features when it comes to driving the q7
but there's even more cool tech on the
inside and that starts with virtual
cockpit as opposed to a standard gauge
cluster what we're getting here is a
full LCD display now not only is the
entire thing going to be completely
configurable and running at full 60
frames per second but interestingly it's
being powered by an NVIDIA Tegra k1
processor you know the same chip that's
in a certain very popular handheld game
console now a few other Carter's are
starting to add LCDs to their gauges but
as far as I've tried nothing really
touches what Audi's been able to do with
the virtual cockpit and especially in my
car where I can actually pull up some of
the performance stuff is so so cool to
be able just look down and get all of
the stuff I want to see at a single
glance and then the cool option is the
heads-up display so this is going to
give you some basic information like
your miles per hour without having to
take your eyes off the road as well as
your speed limit but you're also going
to be getting other stuff like
information on the assisted driving
tools and if you have navigation running
you're gonna get that all without ever
having to take your eyes off the road
the main thing you're going to be using
inside the car though is the MMI
interface so that's going to be
controlled with the dial here as well as
your little touch pad and you can use
this for a lot of different things so
for example if you're using Google Maps
to navigate somewhere you actually just
use the handwriting recognition to write
out we're gonna go you'll be able to
pull it up from there when you start the
q7 the screen is going to rise from the
dash and this is where your control
pretty much all the main things
including your navigation your vehicle
controls as well as things like car play
I actually really like car play so for
me it's something I use every day when
I'm listening to podcasts music that
kind of stuff and the navigation is also
pretty decent especially now that Apple
Maps is started to catch up to the cool
maps something that's really cool is the
top view camera so the q7 has cameras
all the way around the car so on top of
being able to see say when you're
pulling into a tight spot it will switch
to like the right front camera or the
main front camera or the left front
camera or whatever you're closest to but
you can also do a top-down view so say
you want to see if you're exactly right
up into the spot you can see that of
course the tech doesn't stop there
so even comes across to some of the
smaller things like the climate controls
so you actually have a display in each
knob so when you adjust the actual
temperature you're going to get a full
display which is totally unnecessary and
totally awesome so one of my favorite
parts of the q7 are the seats so not
only are they going to be in this nice
soft leather but they're going to be
heated they're going to be ventilated
and they are going to be massaging yes I
like the massaging seats a lot
don't judge me it's so cool to be able
to have the car sort of driving itself
for the most part on the freeway
listening to some nice music on the bose
stereo and then you crank up that
massage and relax so of course huge
shout out to outtie for sponsoring this
video I'm curious what do you guys think
about all the tech inside the q7 let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
