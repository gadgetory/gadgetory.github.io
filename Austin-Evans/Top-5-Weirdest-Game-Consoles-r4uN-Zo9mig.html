years of console hits and misses here
are the weirdest coming in at number 5
is the Nintendo Wii mini making cheaper
versions of consoles late in the
lifecycle has been going on for a while
but Nintendo really went over the top
with the Wii mini it comes in a red
light finish which doesn't look too bad
but it's about a stripped down as it
gets
want to play online no Wi-Fi how about
GameCube games not happening take one
look at the menu and you'll see just how
basic things are this is made to play
games and that's it you do get the newer
motion plus controller included in red
so games like Wii Sports who are totally
fine but even here were limited to 480i
as there's no component video out the
list goes on and on - like the lack of
an SD card slot and a top loading disc
versus the original slot loading drive
to be fair there is still a solid
library of games but the mini is missing
out on a lot compared to the standard
we'd this wouldn't be crazy on an older
console but the Wii mini was released in
2013 here in the US this definitely gets
weird points all around for number 4
there's the Sega Nomad unlike the wii
mini which was generally kind of
terrible the Nomad had one big selling
point it's a full portable version of
the Genesis it is an absolutely massive
handheld but it has the full internals
of the Genesis pop in a game and you're
basically good to go you've got all your
controls built in along with a color
screen it's not exactly what I would
call great but considering is 20 years
old it's usable it has some cool extra
features too like a controller port and
AV out to connect with TV letting it
fully replace the Genesis unless you're
really really attached to your Sega CD
the weirdest thing is the lopsided
design it slopes down which makes
everything seem slightly crooked
especially the screen unfortunately
being a full game console in a portable
package means powering it is a pain you
either have to plug in or use six
double-a batteries which only lasts a
couple hours release six years after the
Genesis the Nomad wasn't very successful
but it's still unique even to this day
next up at number three is an obscure
one the Apple Bandai Pippin as Apple's
first and only game console back from
1995 this was essentially a small
computer running a modified version of
Mac OS 7 the Pippin was a massive
failure with just over 40,000 sold and
for good reason it didn't make much
sense it's a CD based console which only
had a few games including Super marathon
which was actually bungees very first
console game before they moved on to
hello back in the 90s Apple was all over
the place and this might be one of the
best examples the Pippin was meant to be
a gaming platform that other companies
could license to make their own consoles
using the basics of the Mac such as the
PowerPC processor band I made this one
which came with the bizarre Applejack
controller that it's best to be both a
controller as well as a mouse with a
trackball and left and right click
buttons around back it was a little
ahead of its time with the built-in
modem but for the most part it was just
a really weird experiment and number 2
is the Nokia ngage now this was
absolutely ahead of its time as an early
smartphone that could play games back in
2003 on paper this has a lot going for
it including the ability to run apps
online gaming dedicated physical games
and decent controls try to use it as a
phone though and you'll find the speaker
on top which forces you to hold it in a
very specific way it actually does still
connect to cell networks today and even
has bluetooth but there are tons of poor
choices like having to remove the rear
shell and pull the battery just to put a
game in which is crazy the screen is
small but decent with a backlight but
the taco shape not only looks ridiculous
but seriously you were supposed to talk
into it like this
Nokia followed it up with a QD version
which fix some of these issues but it
was still a pretty major failure if
Nokia try something like this five years
later it actually may have worked out
but as it is modern smartphones have
absolutely replaced what the engage was
trying to be last but absolutely not
least at number one is the Nintendo
Virtual Boy it doesn't get much weirder
than this the Virtual Boy was its own
console that was shipped alongside the
Game Boy right before the Nintendo 64
and was the first serious effort toward
virtual reality the headset has a pair
of red displays that cleverly scan up
and down to mimic a 3d effect the
graphics have a Super Nintendo feel but
it's not bad and most importantly the 3d
works surprisingly well with an actual
sense of depth it likes head tracking
and is fairly heavy so you'll need to
use it on a stand which can get pretty
uncomfortable over longer periods it has
a decent controller but it has the AC
adapter built-in which makes things a
little awkward all of this put together
with a fairly expensive price meant the
Virtual Boy just didn't catch on with
less than a million units sold it was
discontinued less than a year after
release it's a shame considering that 20
years later virtual reality is just
starting to hit the mainstream but
there's no doubt that the Virtual Boy
was one of the weirdest consoles of all
time if you guys enjoyed be sure to go
check out my friend Kevin Kenton's video
going over
some of the weirdest controllers of all
time anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
