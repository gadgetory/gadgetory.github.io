here with an unboxing of the new
Microsoft Surface as one of the first
Windows RT tablets to launch let's take
a look at what you get slide open the
box and you'll see the surface along
with the touch cover if you get the
bundle like I have take off the seal and
we can get it the good stuff first off
we have the surface but we'll set that
aside for a minute you also get a fairly
large power adapter with a magnetic
connector a small getting started guide
and safety info that no one ever reads
the touch cover comes separately along
with another bit of information tucked
away in the box time to get to the
surface itself unwrap the protective
plastic wrap and the tablets free fire
it up and you'll see the 10.6 inch 1366
by 768 display with the Metro UI my
first impressions are really impressive
Windows is very smooth and switching
between Metro and the classic desktop is
just as easy as on the PC along the
right side you'll see the magnetic
charging port which looks a bit like Mac
save a full size USB 2.0 port
proprietary HD video port and one of the
two speakers along the right side is a
volume rocker headphone jack and the
second speaker up top you'll see a lock
button which works like most other
tablets and the bottom is where the
touching type covers connect around back
is the 720p camera and the kickstand
which pops out to let the surface stand
on its own and works very well combined
with the touch cover you can turn the
tablet into something more like a laptop
in just a few seconds and from the side
you can see with the kickstand and
keyboard everything is still quite then
the touch cover is full-size and while
there's practically no tactile feedback
it's a huge improvement from a
touchscreen keyboard and I used it to
type the entire script for this video at
first glance
I'm very impressed with the surface the
hardware solid and Windows 8 is very
smooth but be sure to stay tuned for the
full review don't forget to hit that
like button if you enjoyed and I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
