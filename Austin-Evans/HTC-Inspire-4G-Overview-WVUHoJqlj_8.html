of the htc inspire 4G so there's
definitely a lot to like about this
phone however there are few little
things I'm not super happy with so what
I've decided to do is give you guys a
quick first impressions video now I
haven't this is not a review or anything
only had this for a couple of days but
from what I've used so far I definitely
have you know got some pros and cons
with it so about to share those with you
right now so the first pro and i
absolutely love this is the display now
there's a 4.3 inch display which is
really quite large especially if you
like me and coming from you know like a
3.5 inch to spy on an iphone or
something this is absolutely huge and it
i love it allows you to put a lot more
on the screen so that's in your games
especially in the internet browsing and
just you know text in general it's a lot
easier to read you know big web pages in
fact full desktop sites look really
quite nice on the large display i know
it is a super LCD display meaning that
it's not quite as good as something like
a super amoled but you know like on some
samsung phones but i really don't have
any issues send goes for the resolution
it's not super high resolution it's 480
x 800 which again is basically standard
but i do like it really does look nice
and it's even legible in sunlight so I
mean it could be better but I really
don't have any major complaints and as
far as the OS goes I've had a lot of
people ask me oh is it laggy it's of
course it only has a single core
Snapdragon processor I bet I do wonder
that it's the second generation so it's
a little bit faster and it's bolstered
by a hefty 768 megabytes of RAM so for
an android phone that's plenty you guys
can see here really nice and snappy
scrolling through your home's home
screen effects we want to back out I
have to do that who want to back out you
guys can see here we can scroll through
our different screams really quite nice
and easily same goes for the live
wallpapers you guys can see there's a
live wallpaper and if i want to hold
down here we can pick a different
wallpaper just kind of show you guys it
really doesn't have any major effect on
the performance so let's take a look i
always loved this wallpaper so we can
take a look at this one and just scroll
here and you can see here live wallpaper
works just fine and no issues at all um
now moving on from that one thing I do
want to show you guys is the internet
browser so it's reading a little read it
here let's just go to stage jailbreak
and just gave you guys a little demo of
the browser performance
I know the browser does work really
quite nicely in general I'm actually
liking it again that large display is
nice I'm but I really like is this is
the smoothest android phone i've ever
used as far as a browser goes you can
see here the pinch to zoom is nice you
know you don't get a whole lot of the
checkerboard pattern although this isn't
the greatest website to show you guys
that on but i really does work nice and
smoothly and it does support that flash
so fact we can say that course there we
go i will show you guys it has actually
support flash and sports flash pretty
well so as you can see here this is an
embedded youtube video it's not you know
like when iOS or something is not
optimized from old it's just a standard
desktop browser and if we go ahead and
click on it you'll see that it will
actually start playing so there we go so
it's like we did not want to open that
but as you guys can see your flash does
work now to you know it's not it's not
going to be desperate desktop great
experience but absolutely does run
smoothly doesn't really cause any major
it lies the browser slightly but it's
not a big deal at all now on the other
hand there are a couple things that I'm
not really really all that pleased with
the first is that there seems to be a
little bit of an orientation bug on
occasion it will kind of freaked out I
guess and stick to the orientation that
was in previously so for example
sometimes would open the settings it
will randomly switch to one side and
will not let me change it at all same
thing goes for the browser so nothing
I'm sure what's behind that I don't know
if it's maybe a problem with just this
specific phone or so maybe you're more
of a wide widespread deal but it hasn't
been a huge deal typically if I just
force quit out of the app restarted it
will properly works but I definitely do
want to let you guys know that I've been
having a little bit of a problem there
another thing is the ATT cell reception
this is a 4g phone and i've only had a
little bit of time of course like i said
i haven't had enough time really tested
fully but from what i've tested so far
this definitely does not have 4g speeds
the best i could pull off in fact i can
pull up the speed test and show you guys
here the best editor does you guys to
see here is 1500 kilobits down and 236
kilobits up that's not an ignore that
last night was on Wi-Fi but that is not
4g speeds now again you want to stress
that i have had
really fully tested but that is that's
not all that great on facts i'm pretty
sure you could probably eat fast draw on
3g so I definitely do keep that in mind
and yes I did test that on the hspa+
network by some connection to it right
now now the Clinton shut up the phone a
little bit there's a couple of things i
do want to point out in the unboxing a
kind of mentioned that was a little bit
worried about the volume rocker and the
power button because as you guys can
hopefully see there they are basically
flush they just perjured at just a
sliced amount however i've got to say
that there's really no issues there it's
even though they are basically flush
there plenty tactile both the power and
the rocker the plane tactile you can get
at the no problem as far as the camera
goes have also been mostly impressed in
fact i shot a few pictures of you guys
are interested i will be doing a video
fairly shortly showing you guys the aim
of google 8 megapixel stills as well as
a 720p high-definition video i'll be
doing that shortly overall it's not an
amazing camera still say it's probably
not quite on par with the iphone 4 but
it's certainly not a bad camera at all
and there are some pretty cool shots you
can get with it especially with that
nice dual LED flash anyway that's about
it for my first impressions of the htc
inspire 4G I'm overall been mostly
impressed with it there's a couple
things I'm not really really pleased
with but overall no major issues so in
the guys if you're interested in
learning more about the phone be sure to
subscribe to the channel right up above
I will be doing several other videos
including a full review and if you have
any requests you want to see any
particular videos about the htc inspire
4G you should let me know in the
comments below and I'll see what I can
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
