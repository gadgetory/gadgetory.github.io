hottest game out right now and recently
I did a video trying to run fortnight on
a 200 lap top however after that video
I've had a ton of questions asking what
is a good laptop to actually play for a
night with so here are going to be four
of my favourite laptops at a wide range
of budgets starting at 370 dollars this
is the 2018 Acer Aspire 815 it's
actually the follow-up to the most
popular laptop on Amazon that I recently
took a look at essentially what you're
getting here is no an update to the
eighth generation of core processors but
also some key upgrades that are gonna
help on the graphics side inside you're
getting an Intel Core i3 8130 you know
bump me up to the 8th generation of core
processors means that while this is
still going to be dual-core they've
added turbo boost basically meaning that
as opposed to your processor being
limited like 2.5 gigahertz or so this
guy will boost up to 3.4 gigahertz all
day long this guy's also rocking dual
channel memory now that was an option on
the previous model but you actually had
to go and upgrade yourself whereas this
has 6 gigabytes of ddr3 memory out of
the box now the idea that is ddr3 is a
little bit of a disappointment but the
important thing is is that because we
have integrated graphics dual channel
memory is going to make a big difference
you need all the bandwidth you can give
to that internal GPU we consider that
you're spending less than 400 ollars the
rest of the laptop actually isn't going
to be too bad hardware wise so you're
going to be getting a 15.6 inch 1080p
panel it's not going to be super high
res or super high quality but again for
the budget not complaining at all you're
getting a good trackpad getting a decent
keyboard and you're getting a wide
selection of ports including nella USB C
with Ethernet and USB a and well ok I'm
just saying all this because I really
want to show you that this guy still has
a DVD drive something that pretty rare
on laptops these days so for 380 bucks
got a little bit of everything so of
course you should keep your expectations
in check with this laptop we're going to
need to turn the settings down well
we're gonna turn them all down actually
so it's like for tonight we have all of
our settings cranked down and we were
running at 600 P but the important thing
to mention is that this is a $370 laptop
there we are getting a pretty consistent
30 frames per second in no no it's not
going to be the best way of playing the
game at all but importantly we are
actually able to play it with the idea
that we are spending so
little and running on a laptop which is
so cheap and yet we're still getting a
playable for tonight experience is
pretty impressive it does this a little
something about how epic was able to
optimize the game to really get it to be
playable on such a wide range of
hardware now of course there are some
other things that you're going to notice
when you're playing on the fence
actually not going to be too loud on
this laptop but the screens viewing
angles are fairly narrow so you do want
to make sure that's pretty much going to
be dead-on okay I had to turn it to make
sure it looks good on camera not to my
eyes but the important thing is look
it's for tonight we're playing it 34
frames per second however say that your
budget is a little bit higher than three
hundred and seventy dollars well that's
where this comes in the Acer Aspire five
has to be confused with the aspire B 15
we're just taking a look at now if you
guys have watched the channel for any
length of time you'll know that I really
really like this laptop spending that
extra money is going to get us a huge
upgrade to pretty much all aspects of
performance here so first of all we're
going to be going up from a core i3 to a
core i5 on this laptop that means that
we're going from dual core 2 quad core
processor which is a huge boon well
basically everything but especially when
it comes to gaming four cores is going
to be helpful
the real secret sauce here though is the
NX 150 NVIDIA GPU inside they're going
from integrated to dedicated graphics
even is something that's going to be
fairly modest like this is a huge
difference when it comes to gaming on
Fortnight as you'll see our settings are
going to be much higher than 600 P with
everything turned down with 30 frames
per second at least I really hope so
because I've played this before and it
was much better I come suddenly doubting
my own videos like wait this is this was
faster right but what if it's not faster
and I look dumb the rest of the laptop
is going to be pretty much the same as
far as hardware goes there are some
slight tweaks but the keyboard the
trackpad the screen are all going to be
fairly similar but there are some other
improvements on the internals here
including we go from 6 to 8 gigabytes of
RAM and thankfully instead of having a
slow mechanical hard drive this does
come standard with a 256 gigabyte SSD
jib akin to Fortnight and this is a much
much better experience so not only were
able to bump the resolution from 600 P
to 1080 P but also importantly we were
able to bump up the settings from very
low and turning everything off to a
pretty respectable medium set
and as you guys can see performance is
not going to be bad we're averaging in
the neighborhood of 40 45 frames per
second here now don't get me wrong if
all you have is 300 Evan T dollars
you're going to be able to game on the
other Acer but for my money spending
$200 more to go from barely being able
to run the game on minimum settings does
something that's going to be downright
playable for pretty much anyone is kind
of worth it as far as I'm concerned and
of course this is going to apply to more
than just playing fortnight so how do
you data Kay GPU as well as a quad-core
CPU means that this actually can do a
bit of video editing maybe nothing too
intense or a lot of 4k stuff but it is
going to have the power and it's going
to have the RAM to handle that and on
top of that all of this stuff including
the CPU and the GPU is going to be very
helpful when it comes to you know other
games that are not for tonight as if
anyone still plays those I really hope
you guys can tell how much better
experience this is it really is kind of
hard to justify spending that much more
money than $600 when you can't get
something this this playable now yeah
we're going to be losing a few things so
we're running in the mid 40s on the
frame rate so if we did want to get that
solid 1080p60 experience especially with
higher settings as you guys will see in
a minute we do have to spend a bit more
money but I think for the most part this
is going to be totally playable and most
importantly you know we're not gonna die
because it decides to run it 10 frames
per second in the middle of a battle
which definitely doesn't happen to the
other one at all imagine those that you
have yourself a massive budget of $1,000
to spend on your gaming laptop or more
specifically 950 dollars with that you
can get the brand-new Dell g3 gaming
laptop this is a really interesting
mid-range option so on the inside you're
getting some very high-end internals but
on the outside you're getting something
that looks a little bit more budget so
it's made out of plastic it's got a
1080p display but don't let looks fool
you this guy has the absolute specs to
handle games like fortnight and much
more inside you're going to find a brand
new intel core i7
8750 h they're the full 6 cores to work
with this is almost going to be overkill
for current games certainly for
fortnight so what that extra power is
going to allow you to do is fairly
high-end video editing as well as stuff
like streaming stuff like that is really
going to be very taxing on the CPU so
having a full 6 cores to work with is
going to make multitasking and streaming
super-easy
of course you're also going to be able
to play some pretty high-end games as
well inside the g3 is rocking a GTX 1050
TI
now this is not going to be a crazy high
end GPU but it's going to be very much
in the mid-range and importantly for
what we're going to be doing it's going
to be plenty for that 1080p display
which I will mention is much nicer than
the ones on the much cheaper Acer's it's
still not going to blow you away doesn't
have any like g-sync or anything like
high refresh rates but importantly the
display is definitely not garbage down
which is always appreciate when you're
spending almost a thousand dollars
interestingly Dell offers this and a
fairly wide range of colors so in
addition to the standard black did you
find on most gaming laptops you can get
it in this which is blue or you can get
it in a white and blue which honestly
kind of feel like I should have went
with instead but on top of that you're
also going to be able to get blue on the
inside and what is really cool is that
even the backlighting on the keyboard is
blue it definitely stands out compared
to pretty much any other black and red
gaming laptop out there don't expect any
major surprises when it comes to the
rest of the hardware it is made of
plastic so it's not going to be the most
solid feeling laptop on the world but
there's nothing really that makes me
worry the keyboard is decent the tripod
is actually surprisingly nice and
importantly you are going to get the
rest of the internals to back up that
awesome processor and decent graphics
card a gigabytes of RAM which can easily
be expanded up to 16 gigabytes as well
as a 128 gigabyte SSD that is backed up
with a one terabyte hard drive jump into
fortnight and here at 1080p on high
settings
the g3 actually does a pretty decent job
so right now we're averaging between 40
to 50 frames per second it's a little
bit higher right now since I'm looking
at rocks but this is going to be a
playable experience now what you'll
notice is that while this is definitely
not the huge jump up that it was going
from the integrated graphics to the MX
150 as someone's chasing me and about to
shoot me um but this is going to be a
noticeable difference and especially
when you're playing other games that are
well not fortnight that extra GPU
resource is going to be very helpful
know there may be dance no no no
performance though is actually really
nice here now the difference between
medium and high settings is actually
fairly noticeable you kind of think
about it is like going from ps4 to a ps4
pro or something you're not getting that
same resolution boost but you are
getting what's still a pretty smooth
experience that
is not really going to be held back too
much by performance if high settings
aren't good enough for you though may I
interest you in this the assuit are OGG
703 aka a $5,000 gaming laptop that will
crush everything so not only is this
going to be one of the biggest and
heaviest laptops that have ever taken a
look at for the specs inside are going
to be absolutely ridiculous
inside the asou is rocking the core I
989 50 HK not only is this going to be
the first core I never put into a laptop
but it is obscenely fast so while it's
still going to be six core like the core
i7 model but it is going to clock way
way higher this one specifically has
been overclocked to four point eight
gigahertz keep mind I'm talking about a
laptop here a six core 4.8 gigahertz
laptop that my friends is ridiculous
overkill at its finest also inside this
beast is a full GT X 1080 graphics card
64 gigabytes of RAM 3 SSDs and raid as
well as well some future back problems
if you want to carry this with you every
day it is a little bit large some would
say a little bit ridiculous
others would say kind of perfect I would
say this my friends is the way that
fortnight was meant to be played so of
course we have full epic settings here
because this is going to be a 17.3 inch
1080p panel we're going to be able to
not only max out the resolution but also
the framerate so this is a 144 Hertz
g-sync panel and we're actually being
able to pretty much fully saturate
right now I'm running between 130 and
140 frames per second on full max
settings on my 5 custom helper laptop
how I mention that this thing is
ridiculous yet so there's gonna be a
couple major upgrades between $1000
laptop which most people consider to be
very high-end and something that's going
to be this completely insane first of
all of course we're running on full epic
settings and you actually do notice a
difference in the graphical settings
have definitely been turned up but
almost more important than that we get a
much smoother experience all the other
laptops have 60 Hertz panels and while
they look nice running at something like
a 120 130 frames per second is so so
much smoother
so what you're gonna find here is that
knowledge is a response time going to be
faster but just everything about it is
just buttery smooth it's kind of hard to
see the cross on a YouTube video where
we're obviously not recording in such a
high frame rate but in person it looks
absolutely insane you're such a contrast
in the beginning this video I was
playing on a $370 laptop with integrated
graphics running on minimum settings
like 30 frames per second and now we're
playing on one of the most expensive
laptops in the world with the highest
settings across the board on fortnight
and yeah it's a slightly different
experience I got to say so there you
have it the best laptops to play
fortnight with in 2018 so of course
there's good budget options there's some
really good options in the middle or if
you want to be totally insane and show
off to all your friends you can start
saving $5,000 now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
