that's supposed to last the better part
of a decade having enough performance to
keep up is a big deal to start let's
take a look at the CPU on both the ps4
and Xbox one with both consoles using
custom AMD APU s this is one area where
they're incredibly similar each uses an
8 core processor the ps4 being clocked
at 1.6 gigahertz where the Xbox is a
slight advantage at one point seven five
gigahertz they're both based on AMD's
Jaguar architecture which is fairly low
powered typically being used in
entry-level desktops and laptops
interestingly the Athlon 5150 processor
is almost identical to what's being used
on the consoles just with four cores
instead of eight while you should take
these estimates with a grain of salt it
gives us a good baseline to compare it's
clear that while they might have a lot
of course neither console can come close
to even a modest gaming PC on the
processor side making things more
complicated is that while they have
eight cores they can't actually use all
of them for gaming the ps4 reserves two
cores for the operating system and while
there's a huge advantage in being able
to multitask
that means games only really have six
cores to work with the Xbox has a
similar setup the developers have access
to a seventh core as long as the game
doesn't need to use Kinect or custom
voice commands it's not a massive
difference this paired with the clock
speed advantage gives the Xbox one a
slight edge here while things are nearly
identical on the CPU front get into the
graphics and you'll find some bigger
differences both are using AMD Radeon
graphics but the ps4 has a clear
advantage with a bigger GPU that's
rocking eleven hundred and fifty two
stream processors compared to 768 on the
Xbox one as we're talking about the same
GCN hardware this basically isn't apples
apples comparison the ps4 has a 50%
advantage here Microsoft does have a
slightly when it comes to clock speed
but the end result is still a win for
the ps4 with a total of 1.8 teraflops of
performance over 1.3 on the Xbox another
big difference between the consoles is
memory we're looking at a gigabytes
across the board which is a massive
advantage over the last generation but
not all of this is available only five
gigs are there for games to take
advantage of the bigger difference is
the type of memory while the Xbox one
uses standard ddr3 the ps4 uses gddr5
typically ddr3 is used for CPUs it
doesn't have enormous bandwidth but it's
good for quickly delivering smaller
amounts of data gddr5 is the opposite it
has lots of bandwidth but it can't be
accessed as quickly which makes it ideal
for a graphics card
purely looking at performance the ps4
has a big advantage with 176 gigabytes
per second compared to just 68 on the
Xbox but Microsoft does have a trick up
their sleeve esram
this is a small 32 megabytes chunk of
super fast memory dedicated to the GPU
which can make up a lot of the
difference however it requires the
developers to properly take advantage of
it on the other hand the ps4 can take
the brute-force approach with lots of
fast memory that just works giving it
the clear victory here so what does all
this mean for actual games with very
similar hardware you shouldn't expect a
massive difference in graphics those
consoles support 1080p but mini games
give up a bit of resolution like star
wars battlefront which runs at 900 P on
the ps4 and even lower 720p on the Xbox
one most games like Grand Theft Auto 5
are capable of the full 1080p output but
here you're trading resolution for
performance as both consoles top out at
30fps the PlayStation and Xbox are
capable of 1080p at 60 frames though
less graphically intense titles like
rocket League along with remasters like
the Nathan Drake collection run no
problem on the ps4 4 so 6 is a great
example of a game that's able to keep it
consistent 60 FPS even at 1080p on the
Xbox but this is the exception rather
than the rule most of the time to keep
up the high refresh rate you sacrifice
resolution like in titanfall which only
runs at 792p while on paper both
consoles are similar they each have
their advantages the Xbox one has a
slightly faster CPU but the larger GPU
and faster memory means the ps4 almost
always gives you a better gaming
experience giving it the wind this time
around of course
the slight performance advantage doesn't
tell the whole story check out the last
couple episodes if you missed them
definitely stay tuned for the next one
this comparison isn't over yet
