the nicest piece of laptop hardware that
you can buy Oh what oh that's cool as
you open the box it like presents the
laptop to you I mean no one ever needs
to do that you're only gonna open the
box once that's pretty dope what's cool
about this is this has a Susan's new
Peugeot lips hinge so when I open it
from the bottom it actually elevates the
entire laptop up that's that's actually
something kind of different now this
means that there are some interesting
quirks with the design so if you take a
look at the right side in addition to
having two full Thunderbolt three ports
you're going to find a headphone jack
pretty standard except that when you
actually open up the laptop the
headphone jack is attached to the screen
as opposed to the body of the laptop
kind of trippy but it totally works as
you would expect for a premium laptop it
is going to be entirely made out of
aluminum so I feel like this blue looks
pretty nice especially with the copper
accents what I really like is the red
model of the Zenbook s and it's a little
flashy but yeah before we get too far
into it though actually want to see what
else comes in the box so we have a power
adapter this guy is going to be using
USB C although I assume they will
probably work with other generic
adapters we also get a USB C to USB a
adapter as well as USB C to HDMI a nice
touch to including the box you can also
put the laptop inside the carrying case
that it comes with so it might not be
super premium or anything but it should
help to keep this from getting all
scratched up in your bag so after
spending some time with the Zenbook ass
one of the things that is still jumping
out to me is just how solidly it is
constructed so it is going to be about
thirty millimeters thick which is on the
very very thin side covert there's
basically no flex to it at all I mean
even something like the screen I mean
you can really torque it it's not going
to go anywhere and same thing goes for
the body I mean there's nothing we do
with most laptops but I'm putting some
serious torque on it this is staying
very very solid it's nice to see and
something that's going to be just this
thin or thick depending on your
marketing term of choice the keyboard is
also terrific not only are the key caps
nice and large and actually kind of
looks a little like a MacBook from the
outside but you're going to be getting a
decent amount of travel and importantly
because you do have that ergo lips hinge
the entire keyboard is going to be
slightly tilted up now this is not
something that's very common and well
pretty much any other laptop but I
really appreciate how it just gives a
little bit less strain to your wrists
the trackpad is a little bit on the
small side but it's going to be totally
fine and you're also going to find a
fingerprint
for windows hello support what's nice is
that you're going to be getting to full
Thunderbolt 3 ports on the right side
which are of course going to be able to
support not only an external GPU but all
the different adapters that can go off
of that where there's going to be
another USB C port on the left side of
the laptop all of which can be used to
charge USB video Al's it's a nice set up
even though it would definitely be nice
to have a USB a port the main issue here
is that while the laptop is literally
just too thin to fit any kind of bigger
ports so what there's not a lot to like
is with the speakers of the Zen book s
and that is a terrible transition but
I'm gonna roll with it
on the bottom of the laptop you're going
to find two speakers they sound ok but
first of all is it not going to be all
that loud
and second of all any time that they're
going to be facing on the bottom of the
laptop it just means that it's sort of
hitting the underside and kind of
echoing out there's just not that great
thankfully is Suze did opt to put the
webcam on the top of the display you
know like where it actually belongs and
it's only going to be 720p but it looks
and sounds alright most importantly
though you're not looking out my nose
right now so thumbs up for that the
Zenbook s is rocking a 13.3 inch display
with either a 1080p or a full 4k
resolution both are going to be touch
enabled and the main differences is that
while the 4k panel is going to hurt your
battery life as well as the performance
I have it here and it looks really
really nice not only is it going to be
very color accurate but it also gets
pretty bright with a full 315 it's of
brightness something that is very
helpful when you take this outside and
can still see the screen performance is
not only solid but it's exactly what you
would expect for an ultrabook of this
generation so inside you can choose
between either a Core i5 or Core i7 both
of them are going to be h√± in this case
I've got the eye 78550 you now the
actual benchmarks are well not exactly
surprising considering that it's exactly
the same performance of basically every
other Ultrabook we've taken a look at
over the past year totally solid a big
step up over the last generation if you
opt for the 256 gig SSD which is the
base model it is going to be a SATA base
drive however if you go for the 512 gig
which is what I have here not only is it
going to be a much faster m2 drive but
you also get the option of going all the
way up to a hole once here by the
capacity this guy has a choice of either
8 or 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory my 16
gig ram option does have dual channel
memory which is helpful for the graphics
performance what isn't helpful for the
graphics performance are the
now it's not going to be that bad but
considering that you do have this ergo
lift design which in theory should help
the airflow and kind of cool things down
it does run a little bit on the warmer
side inside this guy is rocking a 50
watt hour battery now that's not going
to be that big it's a little bit smaller
than something like the LG gram and with
the 4k panel it means that you're only
going to be getting around 6 to 7 hours
of fairly regular battery life but the
screen is so nice that I'm actually kind
of willing to give up a little bit of
battery in exchange for a nice sharp
crisp panel if you stack the base model
up to similarly spec competitors such as
the XPS 13 it is going to be a little
bit more expensive however once you
start adding options such as the 4k
display extra RAM as well as a 512 get
gues SD and she tops out at around $1500
still a little bit on the pricey side
but it's actually not a bad value my big
takeaway is that it's hard to beat this
design seriously props to Sue's for
actually doing something different there
are so many great ultra books out there
at that thousand ish dollar price point
that the simple test with its server
left actually does legitimately stand
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
