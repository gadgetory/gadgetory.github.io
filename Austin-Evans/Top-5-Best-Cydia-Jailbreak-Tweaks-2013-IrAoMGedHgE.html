the top jailbreak apps and tweaks for
2013
to start with we have oXXO which is a
great overhaul to your multitasking with
the quick swipe from the bottom you can
see your open apps with full thumbnails
this is a nice improvement over the
stock icons and on top of that you can
also easily close them by pushing the
cards down in addition if you swipe to
the left you get access to your audio
controls including play next and
previous track and the volume swipe over
one more time and you'll see quick
settings including brightness along with
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and mobile data which is
easily one of my favorite tweaks for iOS
what really impressed me is how polished
and smooth auxo is Apple could easily
include this in iOS 7 and no one would
complain definitely worth the $2 moving
on we have another great tweet Zephyr
this is also for multitasking as it
allows you to swipe in from the side to
change apps and it works even better
than on the iPad performance is
excellent and you can customize how many
fingers you want to use as well as
disabling it in specific apps if it
causes problems the gestures also work
to quit apps simply swipe up from the
bottom to close an app which is
especially useful if you have a broken
home button at five dollars it's a bit
pricey but combined with auxo and makes
navigating your apps much quicker
something iOS has been lacking for a
while or widgets but that's exactly what
dashboard X adds all you need to do is
hold down like you're moving or deleting
apps and then press for a second and
then you can add new widgets by default
you can use the Notification Center
widgets however there are many more you
can download in Cydia for example I have
a flashlight widget on my home screen
which is something I love on Android and
an info widget along with the battery
life and a quick tweet link for $2 this
does a lot to make it easy to do simple
things without diving into an app if you
have an iphone 3g unrestricted is an
awesome tweet it allows you to do
anything over cellular including 4G LTE
that you can over Wi-Fi for example if
your carrier blocks FaceTime or an app
for sirs of low quality video while on
mobile data all you need to do is
download the tweak and under strict in
eh you want and it's all automatic from
there it's not for everyone but for $4
this is a must-have for me if you want
to really customize your device your
first download should be winterboard
this allows you to theme almost every
part of iOS including custom icons full
skins for apps and more this is one of
the original jailbreak tweaks so you'll
find thousands of themes that have been
made over the years
many of which are really awesome an
old-school
of mine is glass card which has a huge
amount of icons and gives a nice
transparent look to your homescreen for
free if you're interested in customizing
the look of your device winterboard is a
must these are just a few of my favorite
tweaks be sure to drop your favorites in
the comments below if you're interested
more feel free to check out my tutorial
on how to jailbreak your iPhone iPad or
iPod touch and if you enjoyed be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up and
subscribe anyway I'll catch you guys
