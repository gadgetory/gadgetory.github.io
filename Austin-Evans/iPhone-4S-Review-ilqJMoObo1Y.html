is taking a big bet instead of going
with an all-new design they chose to
stick with largely the same 16 month old
iPhone 4 with internal upgrades at first
glance the phones are nearly
indistinguishable with the same 3.5 inch
Retina display everything is housed in
between two sheets of glass held
together with a metal band that doubles
of the antenna while most phone design
becomes stale out for a few months
there's no denying that the iPhone 4s
still looks and feels like a truly
premium product one of the major new
features is the Apple a5 dual-core
processor coupled with the iOS 5
operating system the 4s is very quick
opening apps and multitasking with ease
the responsiveness and little touches
have always been one of the best reasons
to go for an iPhone and the feeling of
using a well-oiled machine is alive and
well in this latest iteration another
major upgrade is the new 8 megapixel
camera on both backside illumination and
an F 2.4 aperture the photos you grab
are very impressive for a phone the
depth of field is quite reasonable and
there is lots of detail in most lighting
situations video is another upgrade in
the 4s you can now shoot Full 1080p
video at 30 frames per second and as you
can see here the results are quite good
well I need a raincoat tomorrow Siri is
arguably the biggest new feature by
holding the home button for a few
seconds you can ask Siri a wide range of
questions schedule a meeting for
tomorrow at 10 a.m. it's not quite
perfect for example it can't open an app
or do anything too complicated it also
requires a data connection but overall
series one of the best new features of
the iPhone 4s it's not all good news
though
while the 4s did gain a slightly larger
battery between iOS 5 the new dual-core
CPU and Siri the battery light seems to
have fallen off a bit in comparison to
the iPhone 4 while you still should be
able to get through a full day of
moderate usage if you are a heavy user
more than likely you'll run the phone
out before the end of the day iOS 5
comes with the iPhone 4s and has several
nice new features there is now a slide
down notification tray similar to
Android that allows you to take a look
at your new notifications at a glance
you'll also find a new reminders app
which works well with Siri and helping
you keep track of everything you need to
do the addition of wireless syncing with
iTunes iCloud backups and over-the-air
firmware updates are all very nice
additions but on the whole of it iOS
remains largely the same as in previous
versions it should surprise no one that
this is the best iPhone yet it also
shouldn't be a surprise that it really
isn't a huge upgrade there is no 4G
support no larger display no new design
and worse battery life for some this may
be a deal-breaker however personally I'm
quite happy with the 4s it might not be
the absolute best phone in all
categories but it's still an iPhone the
speed and responsiveness is very solid
the new camera is excellent and the
design has roost stood the test of time
now as a world phone available on
several new carriers and with up to 64
gigabytes of capacity
I think the iPhone 4s remains to be one
of the best phones you could buy if you
