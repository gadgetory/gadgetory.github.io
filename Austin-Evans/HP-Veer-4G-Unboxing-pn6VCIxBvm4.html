the HP veer 4G for AT&amp;amp;T so this is one
of the latest smartphones in fact it
comes out May 15th which isn't about
four days from when I'm posting this
unboxing up yeah it's a pretty cool
little phone so before we getting them
about something we just does give you
guys a little overview of the Box pretty
simple it's got a little cover on here I
will say this this box is absolutely
tiny I I'm really looking forward to
seeing exactly how small the phone is
you guys not a whole lot on here so
we'll just break the seal sure but yeah
we do want to give a big thanks to the
folks over at HP for singing this out to
me for review you guys will enjoy this
is that been looking I've really been
looking forward to taking a look at this
phone for quite a while now it's very
very cool looking I'm so we just got a
little cardboard bit here so here's some
information welcome to AT&amp;amp;T thank you
for purchasing of purchasing a beer I
like that I'm gonna show you guys I
think that's all the SIM cards and
whatnot a Quick Start Guide I doubt
there's anything interesting here we can
take a look yeah just it's just gonna
tell a little bit about how to insert
your SIM card and turn it on all the
kind of fun stuff the judge do when you
first get phone so here the veer is and
wow they were not kidding me sniffing
get out of here this is absolutely tiny
in fact to give you guys a little
comparison this is compared to an iPod
Touch Wow that is absolutely tiny so
there we go we've got the little
keyboard wow that is that is old but
anyway I will show you guys that in just
second let me continue along with the
box see if we get any other goodies in
here um some more information get some
free app so it's kind of cool especially
that's pretty cool you get it one free
app and some other paperwork okay there
we go and accessories or cables and
whatnot and here's our wall adapter just
USB to wall I'm sure everybody has a few
of those but if you don't then here's
the cable actually I do want to show you
guys this before I take a look at the
phone this cable is a proprietary little
cable for the veer
 push me I'm a mess if I can push
all this up off the side you guys to see
um but because the veer is absolutely so
tiny okay guys I mean look it's just
ridiculously small yeah I know how about
you guys can tell on camera but uh get
one for yourself and you'll be able to
tell but anyway it actually has this
kind of a con if I can focus the camera
in a little bit here now that's a bit of
an odd magnetic charger so I believe the
way it works is you just take it and
yeah I just magnetically attaches I know
that's because it does not have any
micro USB or or as well as a
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
which in fact I believe that's what this
is this little tiny piece or I guess you
just hook it on and you plug in your
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
all right so let me you guys a quick
tour around the phone so start with we
do have a two point six inch display
with a resolution of 320 by 480
but of course it's a very small screen
so it works out to be about right so if
we want to flip it out here you'll find
I did there you'll find that of course
it does have a slide-out keyboard the
keyboard is of course very small as you
guys see my thumb covers about half of
it there but first blush it does seem to
be pretty decent but of course I'll get
into that a little bit more later lock
the phone I'll run right here is where
you connect your USB for syncing and
charging as well as if you want to hook
up a 3.5 millimeter headset jack right
here on the corner it's kind of an
interesting design is where you do the
lock and unlock so it's not on the top
like an usual but yeah when you're
holding it like that you can get it not
a big deal um here's your button to turn
on vibrate or turn it off I'm here if I
open this up it's where you put your SIM
card slot in or your SIM card into the
slot around here you'll have a lanyard
spot you can get you at your volume
rocker there's nothing on the bottom and
on the back you'll find a 5 megapixel
camera as well some HP and AT&amp;amp;T logos so
in fact I will go over the specs really
briefly for you guys here so some of the
specs includin does have an 800
megahertz processor it's a Snapdragon so
even though this is a small phone as you
expect to have some really decent
performance in fact it's got the same
processor from the t-mobile g2 which was
definitely a pretty
a new phone I'm on top of that the
course does have support for eighties
HSPA+ network which of course is where
that gets the 4g part of the name and it
does have 8 gigabytes of internal
storage and now that you cannot access
the battery or anything like that and
there's no microsd card expansion but
like I said 8 gigabytes of storage
should be just fine so guys that's about
it for my unboxing of the HP HP veer 4G
of course I'll be testing this out over
the next few days and if you're
interested in picking on with one for
yourself you can pick it up on May 15th
on AT&amp;amp;T for one or dollars on it to your
contract guys definitely stay tuned I'll
be doing some more videos on this as
well as a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
