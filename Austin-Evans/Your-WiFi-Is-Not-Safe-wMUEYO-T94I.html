basically everywhere and odds are you're
using one of these devices over Wi-Fi
pretty much every day however it just
got a lot less secure two Belgian
researchers were able to find a flaw and
the WPA to Wi-Fi protocol all this nerd
talk aside means is that a secured
network is no longer as secure as you
think so to take a closer look at this
we have our resident hacking expert West
and you've actually spent a couple days
trying to figure out exactly how all of
this stuff works so there are two types
of Wi-Fi secure it and open they've
probably connect it to an open network
it's something like a coffee shop or an
airport well it's great to have free
Wi-Fi
the downside of being open is that it
really is truly open nearly anything you
do on an open Wi-Fi network can be spied
on by other people so the idea here is
that if I decide to jump on Wi-Fi you
can intercept that and see what I'm
doing yeah my laptop is essentially now
sitting in between your phone and
whatever whatever websites you're trying
to access a so if I say go to Google
comrade now as you load up so I am on
the Google homepage no problem but on
your end and what you can actually see
here is that is showing me that you are
going to a Google service it's not going
to work for every website this is
something this is an attack that has
been known about for a while and is
pretty competitive in most websites a
lot of people have the security features
built in to combat this what I'm seeing
now after I started kind of diving into
is there are actually some pretty major
websites that are not fully protected
yet so for my name this looks totally
normal
I see HTTPS it's secure and generally
speaking if you do see HTTPS with a
little green lock on your browser you
are secure because even this will get
between me and my Wi-Fi it won't get
between me and the encryption and the
Wi-Fi you can't crack that step just yet
exactly what this is trying to do is it
is trying to target that HTTPS but most
big websites at this point have the
technology in place to basically tell my
laptop to get out of here so give me a
website let's try it let's go to spirit
comm okay it's loading it looks fine on
my end I see it's not HTTPS but I mean
it looks like a lot of standard generic
web sites and that's that's kind of
creepy okay and looking in right there I
can see though it's like
instant and what's creepy as it actually
parses the data to so I can see the type
was a check-in I see the last name and
the record locator yeah that is really
scary but to be fair that's going on
open Wi-Fi however if you're at home
yeah well if you're at home let's say
that you're checking something personal
like like if you wanted to check banking
information sure though I know some
people are fan of Amex so go to American
Express is a website Oh interesting so
now I see www M Erica Express which is
another tactic that this kind of attack
use yeah I can't just strip it off it'll
try and do other little tricks to
essentially allow you through so at this
point if you see something like this
bail like this is not right like yeah
it's one thing to not see HTTPS and you
should really look for that
anytime you're logging into anything
sensitive if you see a bunch of extra
double use that should be a big red so I
know that something's up so yeah go
ahead and press the login button that
has a little luck next to it looks such
a bad idea and yeah go ahead and check
your account feel free to easier your
correct credentials I could do that at
all all right logging in and boom I can
see that your user ID is test and
password is wes is hacking right there
seconds so you're basically able to
capture all that now that's not a real
account as you guys might be able to
imagine so just bounce me out but
normally speaking if that was my actual
account I would been logged right in
checking all my credit card information
the whole deal yeah you would have no
idea and I would not only have the
information but I would have it laid out
for me in color-coded fashion so the
concerning part about all this is the
people that have actually discovered the
wpa2 craft they have said that at a
security conference that's coming up
they're going to release the code it's
gonna be in the wild it's gonna be in
the wild so they've essentially put a
shot clock on every company to say hey
if your device supports Wi-Fi which is
everything a couple devices you you have
to update soon otherwise it's okay until
things get patched everywhere you really
should treat all Wi-Fi as if it's an
open and unsecured Network now there are
ways around this for example if you're
plugged in via ethernet then you're
going to be able to avoid all of this
however something you should always be
doing regardless of how you connect to
the internet is looking out for that
HTTPS in your browser bar that means
that whatever you're sending whether
it's bank information login info credit
cards whatever it's going to
secure at least way more secure than
otherwise my VPN is also a good idea so
it's not perfect your computer can send
some information between when you get on
Wi-Fi and when you connect to the VPN
but generally speaking encrypting web
traffic is going to get around a lot of
these issues and as long as using and
actually trustworthy VPN that is going
to protect your data you should be
pretty safe because this is so new there
actually aren't a lot of patches that
are available for you to download just
yet so Google is working on an Android
patch which will be coming soon however
that's going to be going to pixel
devices and actually may take a while
before it hits the rest of Android
phones now Microsoft did update Windows
10 already for this however even though
Windows is patched some Wi-Fi drivers
may also need to be updated you can
definitely expect other companies to
follow suit quickly with updates for
their products so you consider that
pretty much everything in the world that
connects to Wi-Fi is vulnerable to this
it's going to take a while and if you
have an order device you might just not
be able to get an update at all
thankfully this can be fixed with
software updates but for now make sure
you're using HTTPS and if you're really
worried you can consider using a VPN so
if you guys are interested in more info
on hacking actually recently did an
entire video all about it so be sure to
go check that out and I will catch you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
