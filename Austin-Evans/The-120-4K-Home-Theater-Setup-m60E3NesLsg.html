home theater setup so a few months ago
you might remember we did a video going
all over how we built this including the
massive 120 inch LG projector behind me
with a 120 inch screen we're pushing our
Provine to its absolute limit now it
definitely will work however as with any
projector the larger the display area
that you're projecting on the less light
you have to spread across it so that on
top of the fact that this is going to be
only 1080 means that it's time for an
upgrade that's where this comes in the
LG Sena beam laser 4k and of course huge
shout it to LG for sponsoring our set up
yet again so the cool things about this
is that not only is it going to give us
a full 4k resolution but also can go all
the way up to a 150 inch screen more
than enough power to handle our 120 inch
display one of the main criticisms you
guys had of our last set up had to do
with audio so right now we're using the
sj9 sound bar go get me wrong it
actually does sound pretty good
especially considering how small it is
but for a full home theater setup we
need to up the game just a little bit
what's cool about this guy is that it's
in a very unusual shape it's definitely
not going to come cheap but what you're
getting here is something that's going
to be pretty portable if you want to
actually move it around so I'm actually
curious I was able to take a look at
this guy and see yes oh there you go
so if you want to walk around with it
not only does it have the built-in
handle but it also has a power cable
built-in I think right oh yeah look at
that so the power cable just whines out
so you don't even need to worry about
anything if you want to take this on
like I don't know what do you do you go
outside to a pool party or something
so what's interesting about this guy is
that it actually is going to be in a
really unique shape and that's because
they actually completely reorient it
compared to most standard laser
projectors I say standard is that laser
projectors are all over the place but
basically what they've done is they flip
the entire thing up on its side so what
you're actually doing is you're going to
be shooting everything off of this
mirror so everything can be much more
compact and you're also going to be
getting something that is going to be
handheld somewhat I'm a little afraid
that it's going to be too tall for this
setup we may actually have to move
everything back okay so it turns out
that this projector not exactly
short-throw like the other one or not as
we expect it so it won't fill the screen
like we thought the Rings do small their
weights useful by bigger house that's
really the solution so it is day two and
we have a little bit of a better plan
than yesterday so the pose doing the
entire set up at my house instead we're
going to be doing it here at the office
where you know we have a room that's
larger than seven feet wide so unlike
with a ultra short throw projector the
sin of being actually needs some space
to be able to give you the full size so
technically we could have it a couple
feet away within the screen size would
be like this big do you actually get a
full hundred hundred and twenty or even
150 inches you need to have this thing
several feet away so with that I think
it's time to repurpose our old set which
you actually if you guys remember is
where we used to shoot all of our videos
and get ourselves a proper office home
theater setup that's you know actually
functional unlike what we did yesterday
so we just got the projector screen up
we lowered the screen itself and I think
the placement looks pretty good right
now we have this console table that
we've had from our old set up we're
gonna use it to hold all of our
components okay so the AC is not
currently working it's over 90 degrees
in the office and yet work continues so
what are we doing as far as audio goes
okay so basically we have a 5.1 setup
right now so we have this Yamaha
receiver it'll take all of our speakers
our subwoofer we got basically all clips
just to kind of match everything and we
also have this thing that will hook up
to our PC so it is a desktop DAC and
headphone amp really what's interesting
about this is that it comes with a
blu-ray player which is really weird
I've never seen something like this
before
the real answer here is that you picked
a bunch of stuff that you want for your
own setup you're gonna steal as soon as
this video is over right one of the nice
things about the center beam is that we
do have multiple options of setting it
up so what I think I'm going to do is
put it behind me here on this table and
just shoot across the couch but if you
want to get a little more of a compact
set up instead of using it with the
like this you actually just swivel the
whole thing out of the way and using the
included stand just adjust it and kind
of angle it just about the way you want
to look at it on the display one of the
things I'm excited for is this Corsair
lap board so we actually have a full
wireless mechanical keyboard with this
weird trackball mouse this is actually
really cool though so the whole thing is
gonna be padded on the bottom so it's
really meant more for actual gaming than
Inc have home theater use but the nice
thing is you do still have a full-size
keyboard so you can pretty much do
whatever you want the only thing I'm not
a huge fan of is the trackball Mouse
just cuz it's weird but I think
especially considering that I want to
have to be moving all around here it's a
little bit easier to use so this is just
the first version of this setup so right
now we're going to be using the latest
Intel Skull Canyon nook to power
everything now with Radeon graphics
inside we're going to have more than
that power to of course handle any kind
of 4k projection that we want but
importantly it also is going to be
capable of some gaming this is not
exactly going to be a dedicated gaming
setup with the full projector but it is
possible and this PC will run everything
we need and a nice small package it is
finally time to test the setup so the
projector is fully up and running you
can see it actually looks pretty decent
even though it is very bright in the
room right now so only thing left to do
is to press play and hope that
everything works so great test is going
to be watching one of our very first 4k
HDR videos right off of youtube and then
so good so I've watched this video I
don't know how many times but I've
actually never watched it at full 4k HDR
and a projector oh man no no yep this is
so great I'm so happy with this right
now dude it looks so good especially
considering its 4k so we've got a pretty
large screen here it'll go up to 150
inches but right now we've got it around
120 inches with this display but I mean
it's so sharp even when you get right up
close to it and something that's really
surprising to me is how bright it is so
I mean it is not dark in here at all
we've got the windows we've got the top
light and yet you can still see it as
super super bright this is great
so of course if you guys might check out
any of the stuff the link will be in the
description but if you excuse me I'm
gonna go watch some videos on a super
cool new setup I'm just gonna crank the
volume now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
