today I have a special video on how to
make your PC look like a Mac this has
nothing to do with iPods or iPhones or
anything like normally this is just kind
of a cool thing I'll show you how to
download program edit some settings or
basically to make your PC look like a
Mac I'm running Vista right here and as
you can see it's not perfect but it
looks decently like a Mac so anyway
let's get this one started
okay guys so how we begin this is the
first thing you might want to do is
download this wallpaper which is a
pretty standard Mac wallpaper that you
might want I will have a link for it in
the sidebar anyway so okay so the first
thing that you want to do is download
the program rocketdock okay so open up
your browser whatever it is and
basically what you will do is come up my
foot's load come up to the top and go to
rocket dot-com I will have with as with
everything I'll have links in the
description anyway then come over here
to download it's really simple you see
this latest version go ahead click it
download it run through it it's very
simple very easy download it install it
you don't have to open it up yet there's
still a few more things we need to do
but yeah okay now one of the main things
is there's skins for it
the standard version doesn't come with
the Mac skin so you probably won't go
ahead do this again this is optional if
you want to mess around with it that's
fine okay so you hit go ahead get add-on
I'm sorry I'll have links for this as
well
skins and go ahead and hit downloads and
then Mac OS X OS 10 wow that was that
was bad OS 10 anyway so you hit the OS
10 leopard skin you would download the
file tell it whatever you want um this
is a little complicated right here you
go ahead and download it then you will
need to unzip it however you want to
unzip it I've already got a link to it
right here
but Beckley what you do is you will
unzip it and then you go into your
Program Files whether it's whatever
drive it's on go on to the rocket dog
file you will take the file and you
unzip and drag it into skins that's all
you have to do once you drag it into
skins and then rocket doc will recognize
it and you'll be good to go
okay so let's go bring this back up
cancel this out okay so the next thing
that you want to do is go ahead and open
up rocket doc I've got all my links down
here so I'll go ahead and open it up and
there you go and this is with the Mac
skin
obviously you see it's not quite perfect
but this is this is a later now I've
busted this a lot when it first comes it
will come pretty better you will have to
go ahead and get this skin right down
there and I add a lot of stuff but all
you have to real simple there's lots of
options you can experiment get it going
as a lot of fun anyway so once you do
that there's only a couple things left
now you see here I've got my whole
desktop blank what you want to do if you
want make it really nice and clean is
get rid of any files or anything that
you want move them off do whatever you
want clear it up and then with your
recycle bin go ahead and just I don't
have it up right here but you
right-click it hit delete and it will go
away you can still use it it's not like
it's gone or anything and as you can see
here you can put it on your doc be sick
now it looks closed right but obviously
there's one thing this taskbar so
basically what you want to do is just
right click go down here right-click
apart portion of it that's not used by
the doc go ahead and open up properties
now this is for Vista obviously I'm not
going to go and I'm not sure exactly how
it work on XP but it it would be
probably something similar anyway so see
this auto hide the taskbar right-click
it hit apply and then go ahead and X I
this and here we go
simple as that we've got nothing on the
screen except we got a doc here we can
open up any of our programs obviously
you can add anything down there you want
you can customize rocketdock there's a
lot of really cool things anyway I hope
this guy's tutorial helped you guys I
know I'm I'm liking it a lot it's a
little it's a little difficult to use
sometimes so you might not might want to
use this all the time obviously it's
totally customizable you can obviously
see I that'll come right back up
whenever I want you can move the rock
the dock to the left to the top to the
right anywhere you want on the screen or
depending on how it works for you anyway
um really quickly here I had a little
bit of a mix-up with the giveaway for
