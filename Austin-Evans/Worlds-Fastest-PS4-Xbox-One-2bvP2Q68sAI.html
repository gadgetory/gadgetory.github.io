current consoles is that they come with
slow hard drives
Microsoft recently released a slightly
faster Xbox one elite model but we can
do better with the ps4 it's pretty
straightforward to upgrade the top
glossy piece will pop right off where
you'll find a single screw holding in
this standard 500 gigabyte hard drive
once you slide it out you just need to
undo the four screws holding the drive
in the cage and it's free if you're
upgrading the current ps4 you should
make sure your saves are backed up
before get into the fun part the SSD a
solid-state drive is the key to
supercharge your console with faster
loading times and the ps4 will support
any two and a half inch drive that's
nine point five millimeters or thinner
which is basically every SSD ever slide
it back in the drive trace crew it in
and you're ready to go now you just need
to reinstall the ps4 operating system
which you can download on Sony's site
and I'll have that linked in the
description
grab a USB flash drive and formatted as
fat32 you'll need to create a folder on
the drive called ps4 and then another
folder inside that one named update both
all in caps then drop the ps4 update
file on the drive and let it copy plug
the USB Drive into the ps4 and hold the
power button for at least 7 seconds to
get it to reboot in safe mode select the
initialize and reinstall software option
and give it a few minutes to get the SSD
ready after the normal ps4 setup you'll
have a fresh brand new ps4 install with
an SSD well this is pretty easy to do on
the ps4 it's dead simple on the Xbox
instead of replacing the hard drive the
Xbox one supports running games off of a
USB 3.0 Drive as long as over 256
gigabytes I'm using a samsung t1 which
is basically a full-speed SSD in a small
enclosure plug it in and jump into the
storage options inside settings you'll
have to format it to make it a dedicated
drive for the Xbox but after just a
minute it's ready to go you can choose
to install games either on the internal
drive or SSD along with moving games
back and forth right from the apps menu
while the ps4 method is cool it is so
much easier to just plug a drive into
the Xbox and it works on top of that
you're still able to keep not only the
internal hard drive but also your SSD to
give you extra storage so let's take a
look at the actual advantage of
upgrading your console since the ps4 is
100% SSD based now you'll see the slight
improvement in boot times but the main
advantages and games on battlefront
you'll see a small but noticeable
improvement of about 8 seconds an
open-world game like Grand Theft Auto 5
is even bigger loading in 27 seconds on
the SSD compared to 42 on the normal
hard
Drive Just Cause 3 sees the biggest
gains loading over twice as fast on the
SSD compared to the hard drive jump over
to the Xbox and just cause shows an
improvement with the SSD but it's not as
drastic at a little over 30 seconds a
less massive game like 4 to 6 is only
around 6 seconds quicker to load but
going back to a huge open world game
like fallout 4 again the SSD is over
twice as quick to load while the stock
hard drive is fine and hybrid drives can
get you a decent improvement if you
really want to go all out a full SSD
gives you the best performance if you
guys enjoyed want to see more videos

thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one
