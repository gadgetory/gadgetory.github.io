detailing my thoughts on Windows 8 so
the Microsoft build conference just
wrapped up and there's showed a lot of
really cool new stuff with Windows 8 and
overall I'm really quite impressed now
going into it there's a lot of questions
I had about Windows a you know what
about the interface how is it gonna work
this that does that but a lot of my
questions have been answered and there's
also some really cool things that they
have added so let's go ahead and go over
some of the things that really stood out
to me so the number one thing was the
interface and that was the big thing
that was worried about you know of
course you know Windows has had a fairly
similar interface ever since Windows 95
you have your taskbar have a window you
hit your Windows key you can pull up the
menu you have your desktop all the stuff
has been pretty typical it hasn't really
changed much
ever since then however with Windows 8
there's an all new interface called the
Metro UI you guys would probably be
familiar with the Metro UI first came
out on the Zune HD a few years back and
it is on all the Windows Phone 7 devices
that are available on the market right
now personally I'm a big fan of it I
like the and the kind of the fonts and
the way it kind of has transitions
everything it's a very nice looking
interface and I do like it for coming
over to Windows and you being able to be
on your computers and everything
hello my main concern with it is that
it's really made as a touchscreen so may
be able to tap it to you know to fly
between the different pages and all that
kind of stuff to swipe up your menus and
all that kind of stuff that's really
what it is made for and while they
didn't really show anything that you
know just blew my mind just made me go
oh I absolutely made for keyboard mouse
it will should work just fine for
keyboards and mouse however the thing I
really do want to well the thing it
didn't let change my mind at all about
is that Metro you interface is still
going to be mostly focused towards
tablets as well as computers with touch
screens which of course make it a little
bit more popular but I know for the time
being I'm seeing myself getting away
from the keyboard and mouse now one of
the most important things that I do want
to know stress does I have a lot of
people you know asking questions before
is that there are going to be 2uy highs
in Windows and a little confusing but
let me go ahead and try to explain so
normally there's going to be the Metro
UI which of course is meltin like I said
mostly stores you know touch screens and
that kind of stuff although you can't
navigate with a mouse and keyboard
without any major problems however
that's not the only interface if you
want you can switch over to the standard
Windows 7 style interface we used to
have you on your desktop your icons all
that kind of stuff it's going to work
very very similarly now the way they're
going to be able to
Changez you can do with a keyboard
shortcut or whatever you can change him
between these and really really quite
simple it's not like yeah can you shut
your computer off or anything both are
running at the exact same time so I
think it's gonna be you the best of both
worlds if you want to just you know
continue using Windows like you use me
you know with Windows 7 you can
certainly do that but if you have a
tablet or you want to use the Metro UI
it's not going to be a problem so big
thumbs up to Microsoft there I think
they did a good job now another thing is
what kind of you know compatibility a
lot of kind of stuff that Windows 8 is
gonna have well it will have be
compatible with pretty much any computer
that's running Windows 7 and of course
continuing on with that pretty much any
computer that ran Windows Vista either
should be compatible with Windows 8 so
it's gonna be really easy on root system
resources in fact they showed it was
running really really quite easily on a
one gigabyte netbook so you can run on
that should be able to run pretty well
on anything now one thing that also kind
of jumped out at me while I was watching
it was that they were talking about and
you're like how fast is and how speedy
and if you look at the video you'll see
that you know everything just happens
fast you know the transitions everything
is really crisp
there's no stutter there's no lag of
course it was there's you know it's not
like you know they were using you know
all the machines they had tried and
everything so it's not a perfect example
but from what we do know is actually
there is a pretty good reason why you
should run your smooth and that's
because it's pretty much a test across
the board into your GPU so you have
familiar most of your notes to your CPU
and all that kind of stuff what runs
your computer it just run off your CPU
so if you know if you have a little bit
lag or bottlenecks or whatever it's just
going to be basically totally dependent
on your CPU however all computers have
GPUs we just typically used to be used
for you know just doing on graphics and
you know like running your desktop a
little bit but for most part your gaming
and that kind of thing however the
entire UI is going to be focused on
using your GPU so just put it really
simple it's going to be running pretty
much better across the board which is
good it's good that they're tapping into
all the parts that they can on your
computer to make it run the best that it
can I know the last thing I wanted to
talk about was the apps now one thing
that's been a problem for Windows users
for a very long time then you know it's
a little bit better on Mac and Linux in
my opinion is downloading apps programs
whatever you want to call them and of
course you know not having an app strap
was never a big deal to me but the thing
is there of course lots of viruses there
are also kind of lots of
frak where so you download a program and
install this you know toolbars or
installs this or that and a lot of time
that's not really what you want and they
become very difficult to uninstall and
it's just it's just a big mess
helper well with Windows 8 you should
still be able to download and you know
just do it you know you can install
stuff by yourself of course but in
addition there also will be the Windows
app store and what the Windows app
stores all about is the very similar
experience to the Apple App Store for
the iPhone the iPad and the Mac App
Store of course as well now what's
really sets them apart is not so much
the fact you know that they're wildly
different of course they both have a
vetting process where you know you
submit apps if you're a developer submit
apps they'll go through your app and you
know assuming it goes and makes it
through and you don't have any major
problems that will be put onto the
windows App Store but one of the biggest
things but for me is it's just going to
help cut down on the crap on you just
the kind of stuff that you don't really
want now well they didn't go exactly
in-depth into the rules from what I
would have to imagine Microsoft has got
to be more lenient than app will allow
more different kinds of apps available
about you know really restricting it
like a lot of the kinds of silly things
that Apple does deny on their app stores
so what I'm really hoping for is that it
really does become you know go to place
you don't have to go you know download
these things here and there and
everything you can just download it
there you know that's gonna be secure
they've gone over it you at least gives
you a little bit security so that you
know all of sudden fine you know pop-ups
and spyware and stuff which does happen
from time to time on Windows I know many
guys it's gonna be about it for my major
things there work some other things that
jumped out at me like the Windows Live
integration and just need general
overall and you know just a look and
feel of it but that's gonna be about it
I do want to keep this video fairly
brief if you guys are interested in
checking out Windows 8 for yourself it
will go lie tonight at 8 o'clock Eastern
Time I'll have a link in the description
so if you guys want to check it out of
course as soon as I can I will get a
hands on of it and you know give you
guys my full thoughts and opinions if
you guys enjoyed this video definitely
be sure to give it a like and if you're
interested in seeing more Windows 8
videos as it comes out and as new new
things are announced definitely be sure
