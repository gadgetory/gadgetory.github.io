in the middle of working on a video on
hacking when my credit card got hacked
so I think this is a great time to talk
a little bit about cybersecurity and a
huge shout out to LastPass for
sponsoring this video great timing guys
so I've been keeping all of my
information safe and last past four
years way before they ever reached out
wanted to sponsor a video I think like a
lot of people I used to use a couple of
passwords across all of my sites whether
that would be for Twitter or for my bank
account
however with LastPass you can easily
create completely custom and random
passwords for each and every individual
site and keep them all locked up behind
a single password and LastPass vaults
so even if one site gets hacked none of
the rest of your logins are going to be
vulnerable and that's available on the
free plan step up to LastPass premium
which I've had for like four years now
and you get better two-factor
authentication options the ability to
easily share out your logins it's only
like two bucks a month best of all it
works basically across all of your
different devices whether it be phone
tablet computer whatever so the LastPass
is legitimately something that I use
every single day so if you guys want to
give it a try and help support the
channel the link to check it out will be
in the description of this video when it
comes to getting hacked through a lot of
ways that it can happen so maybe it's
something simple like you open a
phishing email attachment you're
visiting a site that you probably
shouldn't be looking at recently though
these hacks have become much much more
ambitious so take for example Equifax
this is a credit agency that recently
had 143 million people's information
leaked and this isn't like small stuff
like your phone number or address this
is like really important information
like your social security number which
makes it very very easy for identity
theft to happen growing fallout this
morning over its massive data breach the
biggest and most significant yeah
possibly putting 143 million American
every back in March a major
vulnerability was found in Equifax is
back-end and it wasn't fixed until the
end of July meaning that four months
about one third of the u.s. populations
information was wide open for the taking
this is hardly an isolated incident so
only a few weeks after the Equifax
hacked ccleaner had their own issues so
CCleaner is a very popular utility to
allow you to clean your computer however
for a short time the legitimate version
was replaced that you downloaded from
their site with a version that was
loaded with malware the scary part of
this is is that there was actually no
real way of telling that what you were
downloading was actually
now we're and not the proper program
you're going to the official site you're
downloading it installing it everything
looks completely legit and the program
even worked however in the background
was a serious virus so the popular DVD
ripping tool handbrake had a very
similar thing happen for period of four
days the legitimate download was
replaced with a version that had a Mac
specific version of malware inside of it
even worse is that hacks are no longer
confined to just software they're
hitting close to home literally with
products like Amazon echo and Google
home being brought into more and more
households these companies are getting
closer and closer to our personal lives
than ever before now this can be a good
thing so it's nice to be able to walk
into your house until Alexa to turn the
lights on maybe if you forget to lock
your door when you leave you can just do
it straight from your phone with a smart
lock and stuff like net security cameras
will give you a much better sense of
security when you can see exactly what's
going on inside your house but like all
good things in life it doesn't exactly
work all the time and like a lot of
people fear when stuff like the Amazon
echo first came out there is a way to
now hack this if you peel back the
little rubber pad on the bottom of an
Amazon echo you'll see a series of
contacts so using these if you have a
little bit of technical knowledge in
about 10 minutes you can actually turn
in Amazon echo into a listening device
the upside is as long as you don't have
a super nerd as an enemy this is not an
easy hike to pull off Emily do you need
that technical knowledge but you also
need to have actual access to the echo
in hand and to Amazon's credit they
actually have removed this vulnerability
from the most recent model the real
issue here is when there's an echo in a
public place so take for example the
Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas they have an
echo at every single room and all it
takes is for someone to hack at once and
they can listen in to the conversations
in that room pretty much forever all
right so what can you actually do about
this well the first thing to understand
is that there's no way of keeping you
and your data completely safe if you
apply for a credit card five years ago
and the creative agency gets hacked too
bad
I'm probably never going to know how my
credit card got compromised it could
have been something simple like being
skinned at an ATM or gas station or
maybe some site that I use the card on
was hacked and I just didn't know it but
there are some things you can do to help
protect yourself the easiest thing is to
just check your credit so if you live in
the US federal law guarantees that you
can get one free credit report from each
of the three major agencies per years on
the digital front it makes sense to have
some kind of antivirus and keep your
devices up to date so that it includes
those Windows updates that you've been
saying
to for the last six months you keep your
browser up-to-date your phone all these
things are constantly getting security
updates and they can really save you
when these things come up threats like
this are never going to go away biz long
as you're smart and keep an eye on
things then you should be fine so have
you actually ever gotten hacked yourself
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
