Walmart gaming laptop now you might have
seen some of the other videos going
around on some of their gaming desktops
which are of dubious value and dubious
quality but this one this one actually
might not be too bad so what makes this
special is the price when our first one
on sale only what a few weeks ago it was
$1000 but we picked this one up for $700
and checking the walmart.com website
right now it is available for only 600
bucks I mean take a look at these specs
the i-5 is solid and while the 1050
might not be all that impressive at $600
this has a lot going for it
if it actually stays $600 that is so I
get that overpowered a little bit of a
cliche for the brand but if this box
actually looks kind of cool I gotta say
it's not bad so first impressions are
pretty decent
it has brushed metal on the front and
the back panel even though it is plastic
seems very sturdy especially considering
how many vents are here so while this
boots up let's take a look at what else
is inside the box which I assume for 600
ollars not gonna be a lot so there's the
power adapter which is here a 120 watts
now with a 1050 and a quad on board this
is not the most powerful gaming laptops
but should still be able to play a lot
of games at pretty reasonable settings
at 1080p
so this Opie brand has a really bad rap
right now and at $1000 this laptop does
have some pretty major issues at 6 or
700 bucks though it's a very different
story
so take the processor for example it's a
core i5 8300 age which means it's quad
core it's 45 watt this is a proper
gaming CPU no problem the GTX 1050 on
the other hand isn't quite as powerful
so realistically even though it does
have that 144 Hertz display and I'll
talk about that in a second it's not
really going to be capable of playing a
lot of games at that very high
resolution especially that very high
frame rate but the thing is it's still
way better than pretty much anything
else you're finding at this price point
looking around the laptop wait I should
have a pretty decent selection of ports
so a pair of USB 3.0 SD card a pair of
mini display as well as HDMI we have USB
C as well as Ethernet and one more USB
2.0 a mechanical keyboard on a gaming
laptop is usually reserved for computers
which are much much more expensive now
this is not maybe the greatest keyboard
I've ever used it does have a little bit
of that tactile feel but it also isn't
quite as responsive as something like
those higher and razor switches but that
being said it's totally not bad and we
have a fairly wide range of RGB options
so this is the really obnoxious one but
if I switch over to the Opie software
I mean they've definitely got some some
interesting options now I don't
personally care too much as long as I
have a backlit keyboard I'm fine
but the keyboard situation here is
really on par with much more expensive
laptops another point for the Walmart
Opie gaming laptop of course you can't
build a laptop for way cheaper without
some sacrifices now based on those
desktops there were some actually pretty
major issues some other curious to see
what's inside this guy I will give them
this it's easy to open up the laptop all
you need to do is undo 16 Phillips
screws and we should be inside in no
time Oh warranty seal aha so maybe
there's 18 screws and I need to remove
the seal I will say having a warranty
seal on the bottom of the laptop even if
you want to say a dram or something
that's kind of ridiculous yeah that's
not okay with our warranty voided let's
see what we've got inside the laptop
that's okay so first of all we've got
our two and a half inch hard drive we've
got a fairly small 46 watt hour battery
there's our Intel wireless card
underneath this little flap we have a
single 8 gig dim of ram under the other
it is empty so you could theoretically
upgrade this pretty easily we also do
have our 128 gig nvme SSD or at least
it's an m2 I doubt it's probably still
SATA
look what's kind of impressive is we
actually have an entirely unused SSD
slot so very easily you could upgrade
this with another SSD with some more
memory you can even probably swap out
this hard drive without too much trouble
so now I do we have a pair of fans but
we have three heat pipes as well as the
heat sink on the left side on the top
another one on the top and another one
on the side now how gotten into any
gaming yet but especially with only a
GTX 1050 inside this looks to be more
than adequate so if we jump into a quick
game of fortnight there's a few things
that jump out to me
first of all 1080p medium we are getting
70 to 80 frames per second sure it's not
going to be taking advantage of that
full 144 Hertz refresh rate but it is a
lot better than a normal display I mean
even on the Walmart website they show
this is the only gaming laptop with a
144 heard screen for $9.99
even though now the price is $5.99 and
speaking of the display it is really
nice smelly is a very vibrant it D
colors especially look very accurate no
you don't know you don't know don't know
you don't know don't wanna go get him I
will go get him
no I'm good no you do not know you do
not I got to do again so one of the
issues with the only having two gigs of
RAM for that 1050 is it for example here
in black ops we're almost out of RAM I'm
curious to see how well this actually
performs so with the resolution turned
down to about 900 P we are getting a
pretty playable framerate it's actually
in the 60 to 70 range the main issue
here is that because the 1050 only does
have two gigs of RAM it does limit kind
of how high we can actually crank the
settings here watch it's it's basically
it's limiting the GPU at 66 I would not
want it to throttle at 66 III would be
okay with this thing living at 7075 all
day that's that's not enough to worry me
I would much rather have this quiet
advanced I suppose so overwatch is
actually a pretty good game for this
system so we're at 1080p high and right
now we're getting about 80 to 90 frames
per second definitely well in the range
of that 144 Hertz display hamster dude
coming in coming in hot there you go
insta dude's fun man he's really fun OPR
almost certainly losing money on every
single one of these they sell it $600
and yes you are taking a little bit of a
risk by going with a fairly brand-new
and unknown company but considering just
what you're getting for this kind of
price it's hard to go wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
