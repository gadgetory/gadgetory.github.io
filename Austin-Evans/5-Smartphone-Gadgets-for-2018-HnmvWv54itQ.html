with five smart phone gadgets you're
probably gonna want to take a look at
these are the Marshall mid ANC's and
huge shout out to Marshall for
sponsoring this video so one of the big
advantages of the Marshall mid ANC
headphones is active noise cancellation
something that's due to the construction
outside is very useful today so like I
says the active noise cancellation the
Bluetooth is going to be a big part of
these headphones but if we flip it over
we're also going to see some extra stuff
that well I'll take a look at in a
minute now if you'll noticed actually I
haven't spent a ton of time with
Marshall headphones now they look really
nice but generally speaking Marshall is
a company that's well more well known
for their sort of crazy amps and cool
guitar stuff actually I mean that's
right I'm not wrong they're right ooh
okay so the first thing we see is it
actually surprisingly nice carrying
pouch I can get it out of box yo that is
actually seriously legit okay so these
are going to be on your headphones as
opposed to over yours so it's going to
make them a little bit more small and
easy to carry around but how this look
and they feel really nice I mean they
even got this sort of little brass logo
here I mean you have a headphone jack
but of course these do have bluetooth
well these that you feel really nice so
if you're like me and you're using a
modern smartphone without a headphone
jack the idea that these have Bluetooth
built in is definitely going to be a
nice addition and a topic that is also
going to have apt X so some phones will
support this and essentially what it's
going to be is a higher bitrate and a
better sounding Bluetooth connection but
of course this will still will work with
pretty much any kind of Bluetooth device
that's really loud where's my active
noise cancellation whoa whoa
that's crazy
it's like I'm putting my fingers in my
ears like it just completely sucks out
all the sounds so these are using custom
40 millimeter drivers and they actually
sound more balanced than I thought so
yes it is a bit of a richer sound and
there's a fair bit of bass but it's
really not at the expense of sort of
sounding really scooped like a lot of
headphones especially more hip-hop based
headphones are um you know what I'm
talking about
these sound actually reasonably balanced
more so than I actually expected so if
you're looking for a pair of headphones
that only have good style surprisingly
really balanced sound as well as enough
noise cancellation to drown out the
construction behind me actually I would
give the mid ANC's a try take it step
outside and this is the perfect
opportunity to show some of my other
favorite accessories starting with rhino
shield
knee this will probably know them
because they've sponsored videos in the
past although they're not sponsoring
this one at all but they do make some of
my favourite cases and specifically
bumpers on any phone out right now so
this is the crash guard now this is what
I use on my own personal phone and I've
actually been using one of these for
almost a year and a half now but
essentially it doesn't give you full
protection so the back of the phone is
still going to be open however it does
cover up pretty much all of the edges so
if you drop it like this you really
don't have to worry about it this is the
way usually rocket however if you
install the backplate you can then use
the Rhino shield lenses and this is
where the camera opportunities really do
start to open up so if we move over to
the pixel 2 which still holds the crown
for the best smartphone camera in my
opinion what we can do is well just try
the lenses out so like a lot of these
systems there's going to be a wide
variety of lenses so right now I'm using
the wide angle that's sniper shot you'll
be able to see just how much wider this
is versus using the standard pixel
camera the only real issue is that when
you're going this wide you are going to
see a little bit of distortion but if
you don't want to go quite so wide you
can also pick up the HD version of the
lens that's going to be a lot thicker
and something going to be quite as wide
but you're going to keep all that
sharpness there are other options you
get though including the macro lens
which just unscrews I take a super super
close-up shot of my camera here wow I
didn't actually realize I had scratched
my camera that much having a case that
supports attachable lenses really is a
super nice feature that yeah I
definitely don't use these all the time
most of the time the pixel camera by
itself is going to be totally ok but it
is cool to be able to get a little bit
of a different field of view sometimes
speaking of photos and video one of my
favourite new gadgets is going to be the
DJI Osmo 2 now they've been handheld
gimbals especially for the phone for
quite a while will make
this little bit special is that the Osmo
2 is I should come down a lot in price
this guy is not only going to cost $130
so expensive but compared to the last
generation which I think was like double
that this makes a big difference if
you're not familiar with what a gimbal
does essentially it is a handheld
stabilizer so they start recording on
the phone here what you're going to see
is no matter how much I move around it's
always going to stay stable so you can
see I can move my hand and the camera
basically stays in place and what this
allows you to do is get some really cool
shots so if I say do a little 360
surround of Ken get shot of those sweet
shoes bring it straight up what you're
getting here is a super smooth image no
matter really kind of how much you shake
it obviously you shouldn't run with
something like this but if I kind of
start walking backward it looks like the
camera is basically just going to be
completely steady so this is what
footage looks like coming from the
iPhone 10 in 4k on the Osmo 2 so even
though I'm walking in Canada's segwaying
and probably about to run into a tree
you can see the footage still looks nice
and smooth and why are you running away
from me no don't no no no see look how
smooth it is so now that we've switched
over to shooting on the iPhone with the
Osmo the next step is to make sure that
all of our devices are going to be
powered so that is where something like
this comes in and of course there are
tons of different battery banks that you
can choose from but especially when
you're going to be powering lots of
stuff like a full-fledged camera so I
like your iPhone and of course the Osmo
needs to be charged as well something
that this anchor power bank is going to
be a huge help so what I like about the
power core is it with 20,000 milliamp
hours of capacity it's going to be
plenty for our foam for stuff like the
Osmo for stuff like the camera and on
top of that we are going to be getting
two full-size USB eight ports as well as
USB C and so with that let's head back
to the studio and finish up with the
final item of this video listen Lee it's
a little bit unusual but actually can be
really helpful sometimes it's an HDMI
adapter now on iphone it's going to be
really simple it's just a very small the
Lightning adapter however on Android you
actually have a lot more options so it
works pretty much exactly like you'd
expect so you've got a full mirror on
your display so if you want you can play
a game together
however some apps such as Netflix will
support a full screen output there we go
so we have the iPhone just basically
acting as a controller we're going to be
getting that full 1080p output here
basically turning this into an Apple TV
and this might seem crazy useful but it
is nice to have one of these around in
your
if say for example you want to be able
to use your phone to output video to a
TV however on the Android side of things
it's a little bit more exciting so
thanks to the magic of USB see you can
use things like this aki USBC hub now
it's cool about this is that in addition
to be able to obviously connect your
device via USB see you get a ton of
options you can charge it through this
you get full size USB ports you're
getting Ethernet you're getting HDMI
you're even getting a micro SD as well
as a full sized SD card reader now you
should keep in mind that not all USB C
devices are created equally so generally
speaking most Android phones actually do
a pretty good job of supporting most of
the stuff on here but depending on your
device something specifically stuff like
the HDMI may or may not work so if I
plug the USB hub in with a full-sized
mouse and keyboard what I'm going to get
is not only Mouse support that is going
to be native inside Android or also
going to have keyboard support we've got
a write a new tweet and be like hey guys
this is a terribly small desktop so I'm
curious what is your favorite smartphone
gadget let me know in the comments below
and as always I'll have everything I
talked about in this video including the
Marshall mid anc headphones linked in
the description anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
