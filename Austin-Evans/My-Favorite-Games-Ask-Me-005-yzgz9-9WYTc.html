out at app wyndcomm hey guys this is
Austin and today I'm here with asked me
episode 5 so if you've never seen him
for this is where I answer all kinds of
questions taken straight from you guys
whether they're from Twitter Facebook
Google+ or here on YouTube tell more
about your social life social life you
mean that thing that's outside yeah and
I stay away from the outside it's safe
here on the Internet are you going to
buy the consumer edition of the oculus
rift
abso-freakin'-lutely so I finally got my
hands on oculus rift at e3 this year and
I was actually able to play two games
with it one was just counter-strike
which was pretty good but when i really
kind of sold me and pushed me over the
edge was EVR which was a awesome looking
dogfighting stimulator I suppose
basically the way that oculus rift and
actually if you guys want to know more
about it I've done an entire video
explaining all about it so I won't go
into detail here but basically oculus
rift totally takes up your vision so
it's not like you're looking at a couple
like little screens in some kind of
glasses or anything like that full it
takes up your vision it uses head
tracking so when you kind of lean around
in the game or in real life it actually
goes into the game super super awesome
stuff and yeah I absolutely can't wait
and in fact I'm actually kind of kicking
myself for not doing the Kickstarter
just because there's so so many cool
things about oculus rift but if Li if
you guys want any more check out that
video and you find out all the cool
stuff and kind of see some of the demos
that I did with it at e3 how long have
you had a passion for Ted hmm I would
probably have to say where I was around
5 or so where I got my first Gameboy I'm
back then in fact even still today
technology seems like magic I mean the
fact that a bunch of ones and zeros can
turn into a video that you guys are
watching right now on youtube or a game
that you can play then get tons of
enjoyment out of seems like magic still
even to this day what are your favorite
PC games I just finished playing through
Metro last light which was actually a
really fun game so usually in that huge
fan of stealth kind of games however
this one I actually really nailed it in
my opinion the a I was actually seemed
kind of smart so when you actually were
able to kind of get some stealth kills
it felt like you were actually
accomplishing something the graphics are
fantastic and the game boy was actually
really good so yeah Metro was great I'm
just starting on dishonored which is
actually something that I started
picking up thanks to you guys as
recommendations on Twitter so I asked
the other night like hey I need to pick
up a new game so a bunch of people
recommended Dishonored awesome game
definitely gonna be finishing it up I'm
just pretty much starting it and I also
just picked up Lego Lord of the Rings on
Steam I've been meeting you playing this
game forever so once I finish up
Dishonored I will move on to that one
how long does it take to make one video
I'm sure you don't do it all in one cut
I wish I could do an entire video in a
single date so it depends on which
series we're talking about here asked me
is definitely the simplest thing that I
make these usually take maybe two three
hours it's really not all that bad but
when you get into stuff like the gaming
PC builds and I just actually did a
browser test the complicated videos can
take quite a while so if the browser
test it took me about a day or so to go
and get the test bench set up run all my
tests a million times and average the
results make all the Excel spreadsheets
all that kind of stuff it took me
another day to get down and kind of get
my outline written film all of my video
all my audio and start with a rough cut
and then the third day is actually when
I finished editing it getting all the
little detail stuff making sure it's all
good to go before I finally upload it so
yeah it definitely depends on the video
but some of them can definitely take a
while what do you think of Walking Dead
the game I absolutely loved it this was
my favorite game of last year so the big
thing with the Walking Dead is that it
has such fantastic story and characters
and all that kind of stuff
everything just feels so real and
fleshed out in fact that you have so
much power over what happens as awesome
there's also some new DLC in the 400
days which actually because actually it
doesn't quite you know kind of match up
to the awesomeness that was the first
game but it's still kind of a cool thing
and kind of get you set up for the next
season so you guys haven't probably The
Walking Dead absolutely go give it a
shot you will not be disappointed do you
ever see your channel going in a
different direction
maybe the gaming in game reviews who
knows I mean when I first started this
channel four years ago I was making
iPhone app reviews so basically my whole
idea is that if it's something that I
enjoy making and that you guys enjoy
watching I'll do it so I don't know have
any plans on making game reviews or
anything else different than I wanted
today right now but I don't have any
kind of master plan I mean if it's
something that you guys really want to
see it's something that I can make and I
think is pretty good then it might just
happen which FPS do you prefer halo Call
of Duty or battlefield I was a fan of
the original Call of Duty's but the last
one I really played through was world at
war halo 3 was a great game I loved that
a lot and I'm finally getting around to
playing Halo 4 a little bit late but
probably my number one pick out of those
three would be battlefield battlefield
bad company is still probably one of my
favorite games that AM Bad Company 2 and
battlefield 3 is a great game but I'm
just a big fan of having big open match
with lots of stuff to do I like having
vehicles and being able to be an
engineer is probably what I usually do
as well as having like jets and all
kinds of fun stuff to do anyway that's
about it if you have any questions you
