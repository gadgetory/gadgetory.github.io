announced three brand new iPhones and
they range from kind of expensive to
very expensive - are you serious so the
main announcement today was the iPhone
10s and yes even though it is spelled XS
it is pronounced iPhone 10s because
Apple likes confusing names although to
be fair the S model has been around
forever
what you're getting here is a phone that
is very very similar to the current
iPhone 10 now besides a new gold color
option the actual physical dimensions
and the look of the phone are almost
identical now there are some physical
differences including the most durable
glass ever on a smartphone because we've
heard that one like every time anyone
launches the phone and on top of that
there's also going to be some slightly
better water resistance it's now going
to be IP 68 rated which basically means
it can be underwater for slightly longer
actually I think specifically IP IP 68
is 2 meters instead of one year right
two meters thirty minutes not a massive
difference other minor updates include a
little bit more dynamic range with the
display and better stereo separation
with the speakers and one thing that a
lot of people brought up during the
keynote although I think they slightly
misunderstood it was the 120 Hertz touch
sensitivity now it's not going to be
like the iPad pro a 120 Hertz display
what is going to do is look for your
actual touches 120 times a second
surprising no one touch ID is nowhere to
be found instead we do have a slightly
tweaked version of face ID on the new
phone now what you're getting here is
going to be basically the same hardware
of the old face ID but it does have a
better algorithm as well as faster
secure Enclave processing to be able to
supposedly get you a little bit of a
quicker scan of your face and to be a
little bit more accurate when doing so
one of the biggest upgrades is with the
processor now I will absolutely give
credit where credit is due
Apple completely kills it when it comes
to developing their own custom
processors and the a12 Bionic is no
exception
so first of all this is going to be the
very first chip shipping on a seven
nanometer process so it is assumed
that's going to be the TSMC process
which means that not is this going to be
cutting edge it's going to give you
better performance better battery life
all that kind of fun stuff but
importantly it's going to allow them to
put a lot of really high tech stuff on a
single chip it's got six point nine
billion transistors that might not
really mean anything to you but that's a
lot especially for phone now the general
layout of the chip is very similar to
the last generation we still do
a six-course CPU design so two of those
cores are going to be high-performance
and they're going to be a little bit
faster but most importantly more
efficient and the for low-power cores
that back them up are going to be about
the same performance but consume it
around 50% less power on top of that
Apple is also introducing their new GPU
so last year was the very first time
that Apple had completely developed
their own GPU in-house and now there's
going to be a second generation version
of that which supposedly again all these
numbers are with a grain of salt going
to be about 50% faster than the previous
generation the specific part of the chip
called the neural engine was introduced
last year with the a11 Bionic and here
on the a12 it is a lot faster previously
it was able to do somewhere in the
neighborhood of around 600 billion
operations per second but now it can do
almost an order of magnitude faster at
five trillion Kimber wise the 10s does
have a slightly updated sensor so the
main wide-angle camera is quote slightly
larger as far as sensor size goes now
that is a good thing that's actually one
of the main advantages of a lot of the
Samsung Galaxy phones is that for a
while they've actually had bigger
sensors than pretty much anyone else in
the smartphone space so having a little
bit of a bigger sensor and hopefully a
better glass cover it is a good thing
now it's still going to be 12 megapixels
and the telephoto camera from the sound
of it actually hasn't been updated but
with that a12 Bionic chip on board the
processing is all going to be a lot
better and there are some legitimately
new features there one of the new
features is smart HDR now HD air has
been around on iPhones for quite a while
and what traditionally will do is take
multiple photos and then take a higher
exposure low exposure and just merge it
in to be able to get as much dynamic
range as possible but smart HDR takes a
page add the pixel twos playbook by
taking individual frames in between the
HDR shots speaking of other features
that are brand new even though they've
been on other Android phones for quite a
while we have an updated portrait mode
so right now if you take a portrait
photo and say an iPhone 10 essentially
what you see is what you get there's not
really going to be any adjustment beyond
being able to have the original photo
and then the portrait version but with
the 10s you can now adjust the level of
simulated depth of field this is almost
identical to what you were able to get
on quite a few other phones in the past
specifically the note 8 last year did a
really good implementation of being able
to really allow you to tweak how that
portrait photo looks now I will say it
completely admit that the iPhone does a
really good job of sort of cutting
people out of the background and I'm
sure the tennis is going to be better
but
kind of bothers me when they're bragging
about oh look this is revolutionary and
brand-new when phones been doing this
for years but I mean I guess it's bad
that they caught up and continuing on
the train if this should have happened a
long time ago you now do have dual sim
support on the 10s and the 10s max and
yeah I'll get to the max in a second so
the 10s is actually going to do it in a
slightly different way as opposed to
having to individual SIM cards instead
you put a standard sim card in and you
can also take advantage of an ECM which
is cool if you're on one of the very few
carriers around the world that actually
supports this now point Li enough they
actually kind of acknowledge this on
stage and if you actually want to pick
up the phone with dual SIM capability in
China each tray of just supports two
full-sized Sims so yeah actually no it's
not full-size Sims
it's the banana sense if you agree
though if it actually fit the full-size
send like the old-school what so the
main difference here with the 10s max is
just going to be that screen size so if
you want a plus sized version of the
iPhone 10 this is going to be your
option now where this is not going to be
a great option and one of my big
problems with the phone besides the fact
that it's a kind of boring update is the
price these are expensive like really
really expensive you may have caught a
little video I did the other day talking
about why I'm not a huge fan of the
galaxy note 9 a big reason why I'm not
excited about it is because I think the
value proposition is kind of sketchy but
when you take a look at the 10s and the
Senna's max and it's a bit of a mess so
to start with the iPhone 10s so again
this is replacing the standard sized
iPhone 10 it is going to be the same
price $1,000 for the 64 gig version of
the phone and 11 hundred and fifty
dollars for the 256 gig version they
don't actually sell a 128 anymore
although they haven't done that for a
couple years now if you really want to
go all out you can't pick up the 512
gigabyte version of the iPhone 10s it's
going to cost you thirteen hundred and
fifty dollars 1350 and that's not even
the max so if you step up to the iPhone
10's max I had $100 to all these prices
it starts at eleven hundred ollars and I
fully loaded iPhone 10's max is going to
cost you fourteen hundred and fifty
dollars look okay I get that more
expensive phones are becoming common but
I feel like just over a year ago the
most expensive phone you get was maybe a
thousand dollars and that's if you load
up all the storage and go completely
crazy but now we've got a mainstream
flagship that's costing you nearly a
thousand five
dollars excluding special edition phones
which are encrusted with like diamonds
or something
the iPhone 10's is even in the base
bottle is going to be the most expensive
flagship that you can buy in 2018 and
man I hope it keeps that title for a
while because the days of
thousand-dollar flagships only lasted
for so long and now we're spending
eleven twelve fourteen hundred dollars
on them okay to put this in perspective
you could buy an entire poco phone f1
for less than the price of just
upgrading your storage on the iPhone 10
s it's 300 T dollars to go from the base
to 512 that's so I'm gonna stop getting
fired up about this for one second
because there actually is one more
iPhone to talk about the iPhone 10 R
because that's a name I guess what does
they are stand for doesn't say anything
about it rain iPhone 10 really cool the
10 are actually slots in size between
the 10 s and the 10 R so it's rockin a
6.1 inch display which unfortunately has
a very low resolution of 1792 by 828 or
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
80% of a 1080p display now I think the
reason they did this is because it is
going to be that same pixel density as
the standard iPhone 8 it's going to be a
lot cheaper because they've gone from an
OLED panel to an LCD but the screen is
probably going to be fine that's just
not a very high resolution for a 6-inch
display one of the disadvantages of
using an LCD display on top of the fact
that's not going to be as sharp or have
the same kind of contrast is that it
looks like the iPhone 10 R might have a
slightly larger bezel of course it does
have the same notch it does have the
same face ID system but from the
pictures it's kind of hard to tell I
really get my hands on a 10 R to be able
to see exactly how much bigger that
bezel is it doesn't look massive to be
fair but it does look a little bit
bigger than on the 10s so in order you
can get it in white black blue coral
yellow and Project red and I've got to
say that the yellow actually kind of has
my name on it
so I appreciate that they're doing some
different colors besides a slight
downgrade in the IP rating it's going to
be IP 67 as opposed to 68 on the iPhone
10s the rest of the hardware is going to
be very similar you're going to be
getting that same Apple a12 Bionic chip
and you're going to be getting the same
main camera so you don't get the
telephoto option of the 10s and the 10s
max but you are going to be getting that
same main wide-angle camera with the
upgraded sensor
and on top of that you are going to
getting portrait mode on a single camera
so we've seen this on the pixel to an
absolutely blew away almost all portrait
modes even as a single camera last year
so it makes sense that Apple is going to
be able to include this and the 10 are
the main thing going for the 10 are is
price so as opposed to starting at $1000
like the iPhone 10 and the 10s is going
to start at 703 bucks pretty much
exactly what the iPhone 8 did before on
top of that we didn't see any updates
for any of the other iPhones most
specifically the iPhone se I would have
really liked to see an updated version
of the iPhone se it's because now these
smallest iPhone that you can buy that's
actually updated with the 2018 specs is
going to have a 5.8 inch display if you
want a smaller phone well buy something
old because Apple's not gonna hook you
up with anything else besides that so
I'm very curious what do you guys think
about the iPhone 10s 10s match and 10
are as always we'll definitely be
getting them in the office for a full
video very soon the 10s actually is
going to be coming out next week but let
me know meanwhile I'm just going to go
be an Apple sheep or whatever it is that
I'm supposed to be today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
