you how to recover a deleted file and
this could be a lot of different things
perhaps it's a word doc some pictures
video music doesn't really matter all
that does is that you can go ahead and
try to recover it using this program now
I will say one thing when it was deleted
is very important as opposed to the
likelihood of you being able to recover
it so for example if you delete in the
past few hours the past few days there's
a pretty good chance to view that you'll
be able to recover it as opposed to fit
with weeks or months ago it's still
possible but their chance is a little
bit slimmer so let's go ahead and just
give you guys a quick tutorial the first
step is to go into the link in the
description of the video and download
recover which is the program that where
you're going to be using now I do want
to mention one thing you Justin serial
say bye online and download this is for
the premium support this is not actually
for the program the program is free and
you guys can see here you can download
for free from either of these two links
so just do that you can ignore the by
online link so once you have the program
installed it will look something a
little bit like this now however there's
one difference when you first run the
program it will attempt to just do
everything for you it will run a wizard
and we'll just pick out all the files
and let you do it all manually all
automatically if that finds your file
like that congratulations you're all
done you don't have to do anything
however if that fails to find it or if
you're having a little bit of problems
you can go ahead and go into the manual
mode which is what I'm doing right here
now give you guys a little bit of a tour
of it so the first step is to find what
hard drive it was on now if you have
multiple hard drives in your computer
these go ahead and open up this
drop-down menu and select whichever one
if you're not sure you can hit all
drives or more than likely will be on
the local disk see over in my case I
know that my the deleted file is going
to be on the I Drive so what we do is we
select that and then we can come down
here and we I know that it was a video
that I deleted and I want that back so
the quick video and hit scan now will
scan through the drive depending on how
fast your computer is and how big of a
hard drive it is may take a little bit
of time just can see here there we go
we've got a lot of video that I've
deleted obviously I go through a lot of
videos so let's just say for example it
could mean it could be any of these and
one thing I do want to mention is as you
guys can see these are these little
icons so there's red yellow green if you
scroll over here it will kind of tell
you that's what the state is so if you
see like excellent that's going to be
good you want to
these green ones because these yellow
and the red ones are very likely not
going to be able to be recoverable so
let's say it's this one so this is one I
will go to go ahead and click the
checkbox hit recover and just drop it on
my desktop allow it to recover so as you
guys can see here it's pretty quick and
we are pretty much done so recover one
file in 46 seconds looks good so let's
take a look at the file it recovered as
you guys can see here this was of course
deleted but there we go there is a file
that I deleted you guys can see it looks
just fine but if we open up the
properties you guys will see is the I
totally identical it's the same size she
have pretty much everything the only
thing that may change is the file name
when it deletes files for some reason
kind of just gives it a random name
however not a big deal of course you can
just rename it and you're going to be
good to go anyway guys that's it for my
tutorial showing you how to recover a
deleted file in Windows if you found
