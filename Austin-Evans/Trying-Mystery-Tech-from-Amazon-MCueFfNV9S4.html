another mystery tech items from Amazon
this time taking a look at stop under
$100 ken if you would please okay more
headphones the professionals 75006 sound
monitors from Sony how much for these
well the first thing I see is that
copyright 1994 so I guess these are some
classics they actually oh wait the 75 oh
six is so these are fairly popular sort
of like studio monitor style headphones
the og headphone adapter so naturally
because these are headphones in 2017 got
to use my super cool dongle to actually
listen to them so they definitely lean a
little bit more on the flatter side of
things so it's not really super punchy
on like the bass like pretty much all
modern headphones are but it sounds good
however I actually don't think that this
little headphone adapter is actually
doing it justice I'm curious what they
sound like plugged into a phone with a
proper amp such as the LGV 20 it's still
not super punchy to be clear but having
like a proper amp to actually run them
really live into them up I think my real
question here though is what I get these
or where I get these status CD ones
which have been my headphones for a long
time and I think that even though
they're about the same price for stuff
like video editing for music production
if you want something with a little bit
of a flatter sound these definitely make
sense but if you want just a little bit
more punch in your music I still really
do like those statuses alright
item number 2 3d doodler create the
world's first 3d printing pen how much
is this 82 okay alright we're still 100
easy as 1-2-3 plug in and switch to high
insert your abs plastic doodle onto the
page interesting it does kind of look
like a pen so there's a couple of
buttons here where you can pick fast
versus slow looks like it extrudes out
here and I guess the idea is that you
can sort of like easily bring a little
bit of the plastic out as you need to
whoa do you see the smoke alright we're
just gonna put this over here oh well I
guess I can do it 3d huh
okay okay okay okay let's just start
with a new page so can lives and a big
green house for walls so that's the bed
and then the TV which all right so
that's Ken's TV it's this little blob of
plastic which sort of represents what he
feels in the soul how do they get this
how do they get this car I'm like
drawing like a stupid square all right
let me see if I can do like what's
something that's like not crazy
complicated that could probably pull off
so um if you want to spend $85 and make
wonderful works of art like this link in
the description all right Kent item
number three just poke the table ken did
you really just get a giant start a
fusion of Technology and personality oh
it's not a shark it's a robo Raptor
we've done some weird stuff on mystery
tech this is up there after 20 minutes
of unboxing I'll sexy see what this
thing does batteries not included
okay bad dancer now let's stop it's like
it's a fighting even more than water put
it on just like have no words can I just
laugh the whole time little buddy come
on there's another way to end things so
if you've ever wanted your own Robo
dinosaur you know this is an option
honestly at this point I've lost track
of what item we're on can just just
bring it on I don't think anything can
be as weird as a robot dinosaur what is
this I don't know I mean say it's a
money wait how much was this $80 monitor
all right so even though it's a small
screen because of 1080 the actual pixel
density isn't bad and while yes the
viewing angles aren't amazing when
you're looking at a dead-on it looks
pretty good for $80 you're getting
something that is pretty bare-bones so
for inputs you only have DVI as well as
VGA so yes if you spend another 30 40
dollars you can't get a panel with more
inputs and maybe something it's gonna be
a little bit bigger but if you just need
to get a monitor to get up and running
with stuff like gaming this is really
not a bad way to go for like 80 bucks
good job Ken digital camera every side
of the box just says digital camera how
much was this ninety-two dollars
all right 24 megapixels sensor uses SD
cards oh man what are we getting
ourselves into
well it looks pretty retro we actually
have a flip-out screen I mean it's a
little cheap feeling and we fear this
entire thing is absolutely plastic look
at the lens look at this giant lens oh
wait no it's that tiny little hands
ready and there's such a crazy lag when
actually hit the button versus when it
actually takes the picture alright we
are now recording on the $94 camera and
around here and get some vlogging it
looks like we're getting a saw like 15
frames per second not good not good but
you know what is good responsible for
today's video
23andme 23andme we'll take a look at
your DNA and find out all kinds of
things about you as humans we have 23
chromosomes which is where the 23andme
name comes from oh hi
Austin from the past year with the
23andme saliva collection kit learn what
your DNA says about you register your
kit spit and discover ok that sounds
pretty reasonable to me oh wow that's
actually a lot you have to really do it
i subtly questioned my decision to do
this on camera alright so that's it
so just need to put this in the bag mail
it off to them and in a few weeks I will
know my results there's been a couple
weeks since I sent off my sample and now
it's time to actually see my results I'm
actually a little nervous right now this
can tell you a lot about yourself my
muscle composition is common in elite
power athletes what hey yo ok I am 100%
Austin so 98% European Wow almost
entirely Northwest European if you guys
