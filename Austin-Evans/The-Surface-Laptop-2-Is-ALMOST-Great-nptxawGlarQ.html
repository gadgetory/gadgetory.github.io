service line has been growing a lot
lately with everything from a desktop
all-in-one with the surface studio all
the way down to the cheap and tiny
surface go there's a lot to like one of
my favorite devices has always been the
service laptops so Microsoft sent over
their brand new service laptop to to
take a look at I got very excited until
I took a little bit of a closer look the
overall hardware hasn't changed too much
this year which is certainly not a bad
thing it's all made out of aluminum it
does sort of give a little bit of a
Macbook vibe at least until you open up
the lid the keyboard and decklid are
lined in Alcantara now this is pretty
unique in the PC space as opposed to
seeing aluminum here it is much more of
a fabric material and it kind of gives
you a little bit of a unique look it's
typically found in things like high-end
BMWs and Porsches and Audi's but how do
you here our laptop is nice now sure it
will wear and get a little bit dirty
over time but as far as I'm concerned
that's totally worth the trade-off of a
nice soft typing experience you're also
getting a terrific display so just like
last year is a little bit of a weird
panel with a 13.5 inch size and a 20 256
by 1504 yes I got the resolution right
it's really unusual but one of the nice
things they have here is that it not
only is a touchscreen of course like a
surface should be but importantly the
screen doesn't really wobble when you
touch it I mean it was a little bit it's
much better than most other ultra books
out there the actual panel itself is
high-quality but what I really
appreciate is the aspect ratio unlike
most laptops which are sixteen by nine
this is three by two which means that
you get a lot more vertical screen real
estate which is helpful for things like
web browsing and you know productivity
everyone loves productivity in their
really expensive laptop right something
else you can do of course though is
watch video even though you do get a
little bit of a letterbox you have a
super crispy video like Jake's new can
you survive the movies over on vsauce3
you'll find that there's a lot of
crispness to watch that aspect ratio
also pays off for the keyboard and
trackpad so specifically the keyboard is
terrific it's backlit it's got a really
nice sort of feel and on top of that the
trackpad is actually fairly large most
of that is because the screen is taller
which means there's just a little bit
more space here one of the big new
features this year is not a feature at
all it's the brand-new matte black color
can I just stop for a second
and say that yes I love a good silver
laptop it's classic it's great but this
not black I mean I can feel m√°rquez's
heart just fluttering it's so so cool I
mean I didn't expect out of all people
Microsoft to make a murdered-out surface
book it is so so cool or surface laptop
leather it's all you know what is it new
this year the port's which if you take a
look
consists of a single USB a a single mini
DisplayPort a headphone jack
and the magnetic service connector you
know we don't see a USB C or oh I don't
know a Thunderbolt 3 ports
can you feel my frustration I kind of
get it last year the surface laptop -
did or the surface laptop one didn't
have a thunderbolt port or at least
didn't have a USB see but I mean you see
that this is this is a $400 surface go
guess what that port is do you see it
little round not round to the the little
circular shape of that oblong thank you
you see a little oblong port that's USB
see it supports power it supports data I
know look it supports full DisplayPort
just like this useless mini DisplayPort
here
so even the USB port apparently is USB 3
and that USB 3.1 I'll give them a little
bit of credit because there is the
service connector which can give you
some of the functionality of USB see but
I mean it's 2018 it's going to be 2019
soon this laptop is going to be around
for a while and USB see it's absolutely
the future it just it's crazy to me they
didn't just include USB see here I mean
it's on the $4 surface why can't they
put it on the $1,300 surface laptop -
one of the major upgrades for the
surface laptop to this year are in specs
so last year it was good but it only had
these seventh gen dual-core processors
this year however we have the full quad
core Core i5 and core i7 options no no
you won't be able to gain particularly
well on the surface laptop - mostly
because it doesn't have any kind of
dedicated graphics as an option and you
can't connect any external graphics but
having the quad core design does make a
big difference for things like being
able to do a little bit more video
editing and you do have all the surface
accessories including the pen as well as
the dial so this one should be a pretty
solid Photoshop machine software wise
this year it ships with Windows 10 home
out of the box which would sound totally
normal and not exciting at all until you
remember that they last year's version
of the surface laptop shipped with
Windows 10 s which thankfully has kind
of been pushed along to the wayside
you've got a very nice clean build of
Windows and of course you can install
all the actually might want there are
some nice features including windows
precision drivers for the touchpad as
well as an IR camera that does support
when is hello speaking of that camera it
is a 720p webcam it sounds pretty decent
but most importantly it actually is a
pretty high quality device unlike some
other laptops that have webcams on the
bottom of the display where this is the
angle you get all the time battery life
is solid now microsoft claims 14 and a
half hours on a charge which is
definitely a little bit ambitious but
you should easily be able to last
through
day of light use for example at work or
school something that's not going to be
taxing at all that heavily the surface
laptop - is expensive it starts at $1000
but that's only for 128 gigs of storage
if you want bump up to a 256 gig SSD
that's gonna cost you 300 more dollars
the drive is decently fast but it's
nowhere near as fast as the custom SSD
inside the MacBook Pro which is actually
a less expensive upgrade Apple charges
you $200 on the MacBook Pro whereas they
charge you $300 on the surface so you
know when you're charging more than
Apple for an upgrade you might want to
reevaluate your decisions I really want
to like the service laptop - it's got
killer hardware I love the black look I
really appreciate that it is much more
powerful now but the issue is that it
doesn't even have USB see much less
Thunderbolt 3 especially considering
this kind of price the service laptop -
is a good laptop but it is not a great
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
