to activate an iPhone 4s so I do have a
white verizon model here however the
process should be basically the same no
matter what
so the first step once you get it as a
packaging pull off all the plastic is to
go ahead and turn it on so that is done
via this button right here on the corner
called the sleepwalk button also known
as the power button just press it for a
couple of seconds until you do get the
Apple logo now activating iPhones and
iPods and iPads has been really really
simplified with the new iOS 5 operating
system that does ship on the iOS on the
iPhone 4s so basically the way it's
going to work as I will show you guys in
just one second is you just need to go
ahead and get activated and you no
longer need a computer to do it so
before you had to take your iPhone put
it into your computer run it through
iTunes and all that kind of stuff
however now you can do it all as long as
you have a Wi-Fi network nearby you can
do it all on the phone itself so while
it's booting we'll go ahead and take a
look at how that works so there we go so
first thing is we're going to go ahead
and slide here and now we need to pick
an ink language which horses would be
English for me but there are many many
other languages so click Next year we
now we can pick our country or region
United States so leave that alone now we
can enable or disable location services
and of course what that means is that
it's just going to enable GPS and a lot
kind of stuff I recommend doing that if
you ever want to use GPS or anything of
the sort one monthly that will be pretty
helpful next we need to go ahead and
connect to a Wi-Fi network so just
select out whatever Wi-Fi this you use
button do that and then you're going to
need to enter the password for your
network alright so once you have your
password and it's fully set up you can
go ahead and click Next now after this
it will take it will activate your
iPhone now this will depend actually
instead it takes up to three minutes but
you guys can saw here and it took about
three seconds so yeah so once you get
through the activation screen again like
it said it could take up to three
minutes so if it does take a little
while wouldn't be too worried about it
so now we can go ahead and setup our
iPhone so there are three options here
if you've never had an iPhone before you
need to set up as new iPhone course
you're going to get all your new you can
sign up and all that kind of stuff now
if you have another advice you can go
ahead and restore from an iTunes backup
or an iCloud
back up personally I just gotta set up
is a new iPhone but that's really up to
you if you do have some other backup of
you know another iPhone you certainly
can just bring all your apps right back
but we're going to go ahead and set it
up so I'm going to go ahead and sign in
with my Apple ID once you have signed in
you need to agree to the terms and
conditions so just hit agree
tell it to go away and then again it
will take just a moment to go ahead and
properly activate for the first time
once your account is activated now you
need to go ahead and select the do you
want to use iCloud now I highly
recommend that you do select use iCloud
iCloud is a very very nice thing that
allows you to backup all kinds of things
for your photos it allows you to sync
and all kinds of stuff and do it
wirelessly so you don't even have to use
the computer so again you can not use it
if you have some reason that you don't
want to but I definitely do recommend to
collect use iCloud next you can choose
to do iCloud backup now I'm going to do
that what it will do like I said well
it'll backup everything about your
iPhone on to iCloud so anytime you need
to restore it or you need to rebury all
your data backs just really simple so we
can click Next and I believe we are just
about done so go ahead and enable the
backup for the first time yes we do have
a couple more steps so a little bit long
here but I do want to walk you guys
through it in case you have any
questions so the next app option is do
you want to use Find My iPhone now what
this is all about is that it will allow
you to find your iPhone so for example
if you lose it in a bar which has never
happened to an iPhone 4 before of course
but if you lose your iPhone or someone
steals it or anything if you have Find
My iPhone on it you can remotely from
your computer an able Find My iPhone and
you can remotely lock it you can wipe it
you can send a message all that kind of
stuff so if someone does steal it or
someone just finds it you can give them
some information on how to get back to
you so I'll go ahead and turn that on
and we can also have Siri now Siri I
will do a more in-depth demo but Syria
is basically the kind of the voice
recognition so you can tell Siri you
know what's the square root of 3 you
know you can do all you can ask it all
kinds of great questions so I definitely
recommend using that but just turn on
everything you're good to go you can
skip this video navigating you can do
automatically send Diagnostics I would
rather not
that and do I want to register it with
Apple yes I do so we're all done so
anyway guys that's been a quick hands-on
tutorial on how to set up an iPhone 4s
