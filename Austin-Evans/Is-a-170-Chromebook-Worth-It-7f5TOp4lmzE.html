Chromebook worth it
the susi 201 is one of the cheapest
laptops you can buy but at first glance
it really doesn't look bad thanks to the
plastic build it's lightweight but it
still feels relatively sturdy there's a
little flex in the chassis but it's
still durable enough to survive life in
a bag pop open the lid and it still
really doesn't show its price the smooth
silver finish feels nice and even the
screen bezel is decently sized the
biggest difference between the SI 201
and most other Chromebooks is actually
on the inside instead of an Intel
processor we're looking at a rock chip
3288 quad-core CPU which is essentially
a tablet processor even though Chrome OS
is hardly the most demanding operating
system I expected some serious lag but
it really wasn't there it can't match
the sheer speed of a higher-end laptop
but it feels every bit as snappy as most
other Chromebooks I've tried there is an
option to go with 4 gigabytes of RAM but
2 gigs is totally usable even with quite
a few tabs open things really don't slow
down
it's fanless which helps to keep it thin
and battery life this absolute top notch
and only does it put most laptops to
shame but it's better than a lot of
tablets out there and since this is a
Chromebook it's not all that different
from a tablet as it's all about the
browser over the last few years Google
has made some serious progress in making
Chrome OS more usable but everything is
still built around the Chrome browser
there are advantages to this you can
grab a brand new Chromebook and set it
up almost immediately by logging into
your Google account it's basically the
full-featured experience too with
support for flash and a decent amount of
web apps including Spotify TweetDeck and
even desktop like apps like sunrise you
won't be able to install normal programs
or games but a huge amount of what I do
every day is inside a browser where a
Chromebook really makes sense is as a
secondary laptop it might only be a
hundred and seventy dollars but we've
got full 802 11 AC Wi-Fi for top-notch
internet speeds which is especially
important for a computer that relies on
internet connection it's small enough to
easily carry all day for taking notes
and browsing the web and while the
hardware isn't super premium it's a lot
more usable than a tablet it's rocking a
full-size keyboard and while it's
slightly mushy it's still better than
some laptops I've used at three times
the price it's the same story for the
trackpad it's on the smaller side but
it's accurate and supports multi-touch
it even has a surprisingly decent 720p
webcam it might not blow you away but
it's definitely better than a certain
other laptop with an 11.6 inch screen
the 768 P resolution is fine but it's a
TN panel with
average colors and pretty poor viewing
angles it's totally usable but this is
one of the biggest areas where the price
is noticeable the speakers are also
seriously lacking third downward facing
and really quiet you'll probably want to
do some pair of headphones if you care
at all about audio this is C 201 really
does look like a much higher end laptop
there's just no big deal breaker
performance is good enough and the
screen is totally usable when will s
make sense on a laptop like this even if
it was running Windows you wouldn't want
to be doing much more demanding work on
it anyway
going into this video I really wasn't
expecting much I've been pleasantly
surprised unless you want to spend over
twice as much it's hard to go wrong with
the C 201</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
