video going over what to expect on the
new ipod touch 5th generation now last
year's update consisted of a new color
woohoo but this year we should see an
all new ipod touch so let's take a look
as always the ipod touch is going to
continue to be based on the iphone now i
recently did a what to expect on the
iphone 5 which you guys can check out
right here the gist of it is that it's
going to get a bigger screen more
powerful processors and LTE well I
definitely don't expect to see the new
ipod touch with LTE anytime soon I do
expect you to get the same screen from
the new iphone so what this means that
it will get a 4 inch panel with a
resolution of 11 36 x 640 well that's
not going to be anything on screen like
the samsung galaxy s3 with it sponsor of
4.8 inch display but it will be taller
so basically what this means is that
it's going to have another row of icons
on the home screen no work better for
video since it will be a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio the new ipod touch should also get
an all-new design so the current ipod
touch has a very tapered design and
while it's certainly not bad it looks
like apples going to square it off a
little bit more similar to what they did
with the iphone 4 and 4s the new ipod
touch should also get more powerful
specs so the current generation model
has an apple a4 processor and 256
megabytes of ram however in the new
model I definitely expect at the very
least an apple a5 processor and a half a
gigabyte of RAM and who knows they may
even throw in apple a6 chip one question
a lot of ipod touch owners have is what
about the camera of course the current
generation only has a 0.7 megapixel
camera and that's detling i got to cut
up for 2012 my bet is that it gets the
same camera from the ipad 3 now this is
a 5 megapixel shooter this pair with the
iphone 4s optics so it's kind of mixed
between the iphone 4 and 4s cameras now
this makes sense because of course since
the ipod touch has got to be a budget
thing they can't go charge three or four
hundred hours for it they have to kind
of keep a fairly cheap camera in there
and since they're already using this for
the iphone 4 if i use it for the iphone
4s and now they're using it for the ipad
3 i think it makes sense they could put
it into the new ipod touch pricing is a
big question mark the current ipod touch
starts at two hundred dollars and i
expect that it will at least match this
price now the thing is i wouldn't be
surprised if it actually goes below two
hundred dollars as if you consider the
google nexus 7 sells for two hundred
dollars it's a full 7-inch tablet with a
quad-core processor it starts to make
the ipod touch at two hundred dollars
look a little bit funny but yeah I would
definitely expect somewhere between 175
and two hundred dollars for the launch
price as far as when you can get your
hands on the new ipod touch it could be
as little as two
so this should be an apple event on sep
tember 12th where they will be
announcing the new iphone and very well
could be announcing the new ipod touch
however there's a lot of rumors about a
lot of things that Apple is about to
refresh so they very well may do a
second event in October where they
announce the ipod touch anyway I'm
curious to know what do you guys think
about the new ipod touch last year's
update was a big disappointment to me
however this year looks like they've
checked all the right boxes so of course
we're going to get a better screen
better internals a different design and
of course a new better camera how are
done definitely curious to know what you
guys think in the comments below anyway
guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up if you're interested in all kinds of
new ipod touch videos as soon as it
comes out be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
