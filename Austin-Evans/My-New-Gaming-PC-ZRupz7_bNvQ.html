here with my new gaming PC build about
time right replace my old gaming PC I
teamed up with the guys over at new egg
TV so I went out to the studio to put it
all together it was actually nice this
is a heavy board oh wow look at that you
see the height on that thing
that was a little those two'll little -
enthusiasts what did you have to get
this I'm gonna be able to get I'll back
me up against Oh Donna quit there's no
way I'm over it
here we got here we go here we go are
you guys ready a little hard to get
right now but there we go hey I gotta
take it slow go take a slow guy take
slow
so basically the real way to do is this
there it's infected it's a pretty look
see you can warm this side she's a
little bandwidth oh we go ridges whoa is
this four-way SLI right now seeing a
bridge on a bridge hey that looks pretty
right
I think so I think is really nice oh oh
what's gonna weigh know what's gonna
make it come back it's gonna get fast
slow down yeah I think we're good this
is our human powered lazy susan everyone
want a little protection valued Anuak TV
right now if you guys want to see the
full video you can check it out on the
new egg TV channel and I'll have that
linked in the description however let's
take a closer look at the build first of
all we have the case which is the
fractal design define our for blackout
addition this version tends to the side
panel window and blacks out all the
white trim and fans giving it a very
cool stealth look I've been a fan of
fractal cases for a while in fact my
last bill was actually built in a define
r4 so this is a perfect way to replace
it also from fractal design is the
Newton 800 watt power supply not only is
it 80 plus platinum but it's also
modular to help keep things nice and
neat for the CPU we used an Intel Core
i7 4770k again the same thing I used in
my old build as I probably
don't need to tell you guys it's one of
the best overall processors you can buy
for both gaming and editing since we
built it at Newegg TV and shipped it
back to me we throw on the stock
heatsink for now however I'll be putting
on a better cooler soon EVGA also helped
out with the motherboard and graphics
cards the z87 FTW is one of the
better-looking boards out right now in
my opinion with a sweet-looking red
light finish and even nice touches like
a shield to hide the rear ports with a
pair of gtx 780 s inside caming
shouldn't be too much of a problem
either equipped with the AC X coolers
these should have plenty of power even
for 4k on the memory side we have
sixteen gigabytes of G scale tridon Ram
quad at 2400 megahertz
while it's not really necessary for
gaming it should give a nice boost for
editing there's also a sound card here
the creative soundblaster is the eggs
which slides in underneath the graphics
cards I typically use a USB DAC so I'm
definitely looking forward to seeing how
the Sound Blaster performs for the
drives Samsung provided a pair of 256
gigabyte 840 pro SSDs I used to use one
of these in my gaming build and they
really are about the best SSDs you can
buy last but definitely not least we've
got a four terabyte Western Digital
caviar black anyway I've got to give a
big shout-out to new egg and all the
companies who helped to make this build
possible I've only just gotten it set up
but definitely stay tuned for part two
of this video where I load some games up
on it and do a couple things like
install a new CPU cooler so what do you
guys think of the new bill definitely be
sure to let me know in the comments
below anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I'll catch you in the next
one and now Austin will sing us a
farewell to sing us ok don't forget to
