of the HP think beyond event in San
Francisco which just finished up let's
begin with the smallest which is going
to be the HPV one of the big things that
are tiding with this phone is the small
size was it being roughly the same size
as a credit card and lengthen width it
features a layout similar to the palm
pre with a portrait slide-out keyboard
along with largely just a smaller
display it will have an 800 megahertz
Snapdragon processor and the same manner
of RAM from the pre to now you will be
able to get this with 8 gigabytes of
storage as well as support for hspa+
network switch is definitely a plus the
fear will be available in early spring
the palm pre 3 looks very impressive
with a three point six inch 800 x 480
resolution touchscreen display in the
same form factor of the current pre it
also features a brand new Snapdragon
processor clocked at an impressive 1.4
gigahertz along with a front facing
camera for video chatting and a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera with
high-definition video support this also
will be a world phone with models that
have support for both gsm and cdma
networks the pre 2 will be on sale this
summer no doubt the biggest draw at the
event was the touchpad the first of the
HP webos tablets it looks similar to the
ipad with a 9.7 inch display with a
resolution of 1024 x 768 however it
supersedes the ipad with a dual-core 1.2
gigahertz snapdragon processor it also
has a front facing camera for video
chatting along with 16 or 32 gigabytes
of internal storage well the less looks
very nice on the larger display as I
showed it off as it integrates your
context and info from your web OS phone
straight onto the touchpad the touchpad
also has a nice gesture area which
allows for a lot of intuitive gestures
while using it unfortunately it won't be
available until summer at which point a
lot of other big tablets are already be
out that's it I still really like the
touchpad a lot so what do you guys think
definitely be sure to leave your
thoughts in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
