2018 13-inch MacBook Pro and inside
there are going to be some decent
improvements including an update to the
8th gen Intel Core processors the only
downside is that this laptop is $1,800
and that's for the base model so of
course the question is is it worth it
for context this is the Dell XPS 13 it's
going to be the late 2017 model which
means that even though the hardware is
slightly different compared to the 2018
Edition is going to have very similar
specs but surprise surprise this guy is
going to cost a whole lot less look I
get it
Macs have always been priced on the
premium side of things and this is
absolutely no exception when you
consider that this is the base model
that costs eighteen hundred dollars even
someone who's interested in a Mac is
going to think that's a lot of money
unless you're I don't know Tim Cook or
something and you have these line in
your bathroom I guess I don't know I
don't think Tim Cook does that but no
it's not all bad
this generation of MacBook Pro is
hands-down the nicest piece of laptop
hardware that you can buy today in my
opinion the build quality of this guy is
absolutely on point it's made entirely
out of aluminum and especially when you
look at the little tiny details it is
clear that Johnny I've and the boys
spent a lot of time paying a lot of
attention to detail and that's something
I appreciate no part of this is going to
be rattling or squeaky or feel sort of
unbalanced it is all a very very nice
piece of hardware the already great
display has been upgraded with true tone
Tech which just like on the iPhone and
on the iPad is going to allow the screen
to adjust its white balance to better
suit the room that you're in now
personally for me I don't find this very
useful because when I paid this much for
a laptop
I want a very colored accurate display
for things like photo and video editing
but I mean it's a nice feature it is
something new the speakers are also
terrific so as far as that 13-inch
laptop goes these are about as good as
it gets
now are they facing you which is very
important when you know you have
speakers that are not facing downward
like a lot of them but they're also very
rich they're very deep and they've got a
lot of volume I also think the Apple t2
chip inside is a fairly big deal so this
is going to be a dedicated processor
which is going to handle a lot of the
lower level things such as things like
the touch bar the webcam things like
your audio and even your SSD
which is going to speed things up and
importantly also give you some better
security in the future that teacher chip
also enables the webcam to be updated to
a full 1080p it's not exactly going to
be the best thing in the world
unlike the XPS 13 which unfortunately
has the webcam not only below the screen
but also all the way to the left side
for some bizarre reason all the
downsides of the previous generation
MacBooks are also here as well so you're
still going to be getting a very similar
keyboard now is going to be slightly
tweaked here to be a little bit quieter
and supposedly more reliable but there's
still not a lot of actual keyboard
travel and the touch bar is well still
the touch bar so it's here it's going to
give you access to things like being
able to easily adjust your volume your
brightness which is mostly what I use it
for or you could also do stuff like get
shortcuts or whatever but I mean it's
fine it's there it doesn't really do a
lot the most noticeable downside of the
last gendell are going to be the ports
there are still just for us PC ports you
know like the last two Mac books however
it's going to be a little more
complicated than just that so if you get
the standard non touch bar version of
the MacBook Pro not only is it not going
to be updated with the 8th gen
processors so the 2017 model is just
rolling over but you're also only going
to be getting 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports I
mean sure that's fine if you want to
plug in you know a power adapter and a
single dongle but that's not a lot for a
laptop that's still going to cost you
about $1,300 if you move up to the touch
bar model you're going to be getting a
pretty decent performance bump so this
is going to be a very respectable
quad-core processor in this case with
the base model we're getting the Core i5
8 259 yuan the 13-inch unless the u
series processors and basically all the
competition which we're running at 15
watts
the MacBook Pro is going to be running
at 28 watts and that might not sound
like a big deal but having double the
power budget is going to allow them to
not only get higher clock speeds out of
that core i5 but also include better
graphics what that means is that even
the base core i5 MacBook is going to be
able to outperform the core i7 version
of the XPS 13 and of course it's going
to be a big jump over the non-touch bar
MacBook the inclusion of iris graphics
on the sky in this case the 6:55 is also
going to mean that you're getting a
pretty sizable bump to the graphics
performance again it's not going to be
anywhere near as much as say something
like a dedicated GPU but considering
that you're still getting all the power
savings with just better graphics is
definitely
going to be a bad thing this is Dean the
new MacBook is also really fast now
again I have the late 2017 version of
the XPS 13 but they are both going to be
using a 256 gigabyte nvme SSD as you can
see all the XPS is fast by pretty much
any standards the 2018 MacBook is just
going to be straight up faster but again
when we come back to price that's where
the MacBook starts to look a little bit
more shaky at $800 for the base model
this is one of the most expensive
13-inch MacBook you can get and again
with the base model you're only going to
be getting eight gigs of RAM and a 256
gig SSD when you think about it from a
value perspective it gets even worse the
more you spec it out so you can easily
upgrade this guy over $3,000 and that's
not even the Mac spec for a two terabyte
SSD on this guy and yeah to put that in
context you can build a pretty solid XPS
13 with the core i7 and that same eight
gigs of ram and 256 gig SSD for over
$500 less sure they're definitely going
to be some advantages of going with the
MacBook but that's a lot of money now
the extra performance of the MacBook is
nice stuff like having a better display
and another USB C port is helpful by the
end of the day these are going to be
pretty comparable laptops this one just
happens to cost a lot more honestly what
might be a better option is going to be
this guy's bigger brother the 15-inch
MacBook Pro for only a few hundred more
dollars you're going to be getting an
upgrade to the eight series processors
which means that you're getting a
standard six core Core i7 as well as
standard 16 gigs of ram a 200 all option
on this guy and on top of all of that
you're going to be getting dedicated
graphics something that's not going to
be an option on nsq of the 13-inch
MacBook Pro the new MacBook Pro is a
good laptop you're getting solid
performance a great build but it's just
really expensive you've got to be a very
specific kind of person to want to spend
this much money on a 13-inch laptop if
that's you by all means go for it it is
a saw an option but for most people I
think it would be much better served
with something like a MacBook Air it
wasn't super old hmm if Apple could
please update some of their other Mac
books that would be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
