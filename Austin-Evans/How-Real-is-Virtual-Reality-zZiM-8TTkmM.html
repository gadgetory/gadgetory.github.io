southern california to find out how real
is vr Castrol Edge motor oil invited me
out to the set of their latest project
at disclosed military base a real driver
will be racing a real car and a
completely virtual world he's going to
be using an oculus rift headset which
will make him totally blind to the real
world so the cool thing is this is a
project it's not a commercial all this
tech the Castrol Edge is design is
actually real it's all about Castrol
Edge taking technology and driving to
the limit to get an idea of what riding
in the car is going to be like I first
got a chance to check out the tech
behind it all so here is the helmet with
the oculus rift dk2 built in so it's
good to try the helmet itself looks
straight out of Daft Punk but inside
it's all about the oculus I couldn't
drive the car with the helmet on which I
can't say with a huge letdown but I
could still try the experience seated
being able to see a virtual version of
the interior of the car while actually
being in the car was surprisingly cool
putting the tech side of this together
our Adam and Glen these guys went all
out
they built a solution to read the inputs
from the car like steering and throttle
got the RTK positioning to track the car
and even put together a monster i 750
960 X and GTX 980 rig that fits in the
backseat so when did you actually find
out that it was your good you have to
like tear the whole thing up like hey
guys actually this doesn't work like
when you finally get it working day
before yesterday
that's the right answer so we kind of go
into like a tandem battle in the mask
with another one and then I tripped
right and then all of a sudden the
ground is like there's a huge clip and
so I stopped it and in front of you the
clips falling away so I go in reverse
and I do like reverse 180 into a
right-hand turn so thing and that feels
really cool because you're like this
just like just spin around so it's the
very end of the day
and I finally get to drive inside the
car with the oculus helmet on so pretty
excited just just a little bit
Oh
so I just did the ride-along and that is
completely insane being able to like sit
in the passenger seat first of all like
I wasn't driving so like I didn't have
any control over where I was going but
then just being able to like just fly
down and spin and stuff it's it's
unbelievable how like I I don't even
know what to say right now that is one
of the coolest experiences I've ever had
Wow
this video started with a question about
how real is VR think about this for a
minute you've got an oculus rift
connected to a monster computer inside a
600 plus horsepower Roush Mustang that
is tracked with millimeter precision and
all of the data is being fed into a game
engine that's running in real time it
would have been the easiest thing ever
to just fake it to make a commercial
Binstead Castrol made the coolest
virtual reality setup I've ever
experienced if a pro driver can drift
completely blind to the real world using
VR I say the future is looking pretty
bright definitely be sure to check out
the full video on their channel to see
how this all came together</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
