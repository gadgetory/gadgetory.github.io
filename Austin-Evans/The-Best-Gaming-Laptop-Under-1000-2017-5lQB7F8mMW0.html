be the best gaming laptop that you can
buy for less than a thousand dollars
when it comes to laptops that are meant
for gaming and they are usually one of
you camp either the really cheap and
usually don't have either any dedicated
graphics or pretty bad ones or they're
incredibly expensive huge thick and
heavy but I think this actually is a
sort of nice blend of the two so this is
the Dell Inspiron 75-67
yo this is a fishing net a bad looking
laptop now if red is a little bit too
much for you you can't actually get it
in black but that stands out so open it
up and you will see that it's a little
bit of a bigger laptop to rocking a 15.6
inch 1080p display however what's
special is on the inside not only is
this rocking a cable a core i5 quad-core
processor it's also got dedicated gtx
1050 TI graphics before we get too far
into it though let's see what else we
get in the box which doesn't really seem
like much we pretty much just get a
power cable in the box well that's not a
really big deal because this has pretty
much everything we need built in so
unlike most laptops these days we
actually get full-sized USB ports
there's also HDMI there's Ethernet this
is absolutely a gaming laptop now sure
it's a little bit big and a little bit
heavy but considering what we're getting
inside it's not crazy so now that we're
up and running with the Inspiron there
are a few things that jump out to me and
the first is the screen it's not great
so it is at least 1080p but the issue is
is that not only are the colors sort of
mediocre but it is a very very narrow
sort of viewing angle so if I get in
just the right spot it looks fine but
all it takes is moving it just a little
bit farther and the entire thing washes
out it reminds me of a much cheaper
laptop and while yes this is definitely
a laptop that is made to a budget right
so they put pretty much all the money
into stuff like the CPU the GPU the SSD
which is not a crazy call what do you
think there's another 50 $100 upgrade to
get a better screen I would absolutely
take it it's fine it's usable but it's
not great hey guys often this computer
a little bit different that is not bad
so in addition to the standard two
speakers on the inspiron there's
actually a dedicated subwoofer so it's
sort of right down here below the palm
rest and it's a surprisingly loud and
rich sound for a laptop it's kind of
rare to have a sub but it really does
give you a lot more definition and a lot
more bass it's much punchy ER sound that
I'm used to the keyboard is decent so
it's a it's a little bit on the mushy
side of things but the layout is nice
you do have that full number o on the
side and it's also backlit now it might
not be winning any awards but this is
completely usable the webcam isn't too
special so it's 720p and while it does
have dual microphones the videos holy
just isn't that great fine for a quick
video call but not for much more than
that the tripod is also completely fine
so supports multi-touch the tracking is
reasonably accurate but honestly a lot
of this stuff isn't really all that
exciting what really separates the
inspiron for most other laptops in this
price category is the performance inside
the inspiron it's rocking a quad-core
intel core i5 7300 HQ nvidia gtx 1050 TI
graphics and those appeared with 8
gigabytes of memory as well as a 256
gigabyte SSD so a lot of games I wanted
to try is GTA 5 now well this might be a
slightly older title it can still be
pretty taxing as you can see here at
1080p Ultra settings we're getting
anywhere between 40 to 50 frames per
second next we have overwatch I think
this is a good example of a game that
runs really well on the Inspiron so the
Tim 50 T I might not be able to handle
4k gaming but a 1080p ultra we're
getting a really solid 70 frames per
second this is the only model of the
Inspiron that comes with pure SSD
storage in this case 2 or 56 gigabytes
so it's a SATA Drive so you shouldn't
expect any kind of crazy speeds but here
we're getting about 400 on there we and
about 330 megabytes on the right it
might not be the size missing in the
world but it's going to be a lot better
than any of the hard drive model so
there are multiple configurations of
this guy so this is the mid spec model
but you want to save a little bit of
money you can drop it down to GTX 1050
graphics and a one terabyte hard drive
or want to upgrade it you can throw some
things in like a core i7 but really I
feel like this is the sort of sweet spot
as the other models get well over $1000
and you're going to be getting a lot
more performance so with a single screw
we could take off the bottom of the
laptop there is actually a lot of room
for upgrades here so as far as memory
goes we have eight
in here right now but you can easily
bump that up to 16 or 32 gigs there's a
completely open two and a half inch
drive bay so here if you want you can
put in not only that hard drive and an
SSD whatever you want to get some
additional storage over here we have the
m2 SATA Drive so it won't really be any
faster than a normal SSD as you can see
it's a lot smaller and it does give us
that full drive bay essentially a pretty
clean layout here you can see the dual
fans with a heat pipe between the CPU
and GPU via the subwoofer is actually
surprisingly big it takes up a lot of
room and of course we have the battery
here too which looks super easy to
remove I've got to say it's been a while
since I've opened up a laptop that is
this easy to work on there is a lot to
like with the Inspiron for $150 and
makes it so a gaming or editing laptop
and while the screen can be better
there's really not a lot to complain
about so what do you guys think every be
sure to let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
