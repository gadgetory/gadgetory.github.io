hands-on offer of 10.6 alpha I'm guys
this just came out a couple hours ago
and I've spent some good amount of time
you know testing it and getting a good
feel for it so to show you guys what's
new and some stuff like that so the
first thing obviously you will notice is
that the speed dial page has been
tweaked as you can see here you can go
ahead you hit put your speed dial you
can do a lot of different things you can
go ahead and pick small two by two so
I'm just going to show you guys that
real quick you can do you know all that
like extra large and you do a lot my
favorite is wide that just kind of seems
to fit the best but you can do a lot of
different things now if you as you guys
might have guessed 10.6 isn't a huge
difference from 10.5 a couple of the
cosmetic differences for example the
Opera and analysis menu guns don't
really like that change its I mean it's
pretty simple what the what it was
before not just as men you kind of just
takes it more space into the moat by
grade but another kind of thing guys
that don't like about it is that now all
you can go ahead and put those new tabs
you want and as you can see here guys
they show up in different windows as
poor but this is not enabled by default
I guess some people can't you know when
you have a ton of windows up and kind of
be annoying but to be honest that was
one of the one of the big selling point
stuff from offer because you can go
ahead it's got really good windows 7
integration so now let's go ahead and
show you guys a little bit about the
browser so let's go ahead and open up a
page as you can see guys it loaded very
very very quickly they say that speeds
have been increased up to fifty percent
I've done some tests and roughly it's
almost on par with chrome now if you
guys remember my browser test it was
close to chrome but it wasn't it wasn't
all the way there when I was very very
close and to be honest guys watching it
I mean I got such so smooth so fast it's
really hard to tell a difference I'm so
let's go ahead and open up a couple tabs
here so you guys can see I'll open just
netherland buddies so now i have three
tabs if you guys can see another kind of
new feature well it's not exactly new
but it's improved now when you hover
over you have the
of course the thumbnails but what it is
is there is now very nice and smooth
where you can go ahead and flip between
them it's pretty cool now of course this
is an alpha release guys so you're not
going to go ahead don't expect it to be
a hundred percent I haven't gotten it to
crash yet they have been really messing
with it very long but I have noticed
it's gotten a little bit glitchy a
couple times but of course it does work
most things work just fine for example
show you guys you know a video of mine
playing and you see here it does work so
I mean guys I haven't found anything
that doesn't exactly work but I've found
some things that don't work really
really well like for example like maybe
you saw that when it closed it kind of
froze for just a second but that again
then again guys it is an alpha so you
know what you expect I'm guys now this
alpha is out for mac linux and windows
okay so everybody can get on it and they
plan on releasing when it's the main
version comes out they plan on releasing
it to everyone at the same time so guys
the different recommend check it out I'm
really impressed with the guys i mean
you know i love chrome but operas just
getting closer and closer to pulling me
away every with every release uh it's
going to be hard for me to choose anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
