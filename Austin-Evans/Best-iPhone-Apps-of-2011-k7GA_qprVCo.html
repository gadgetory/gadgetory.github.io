with my top iphone apps of 2011 this
year has been great for games of all
stripes but especially for the iPhone
iPod touch and iPad so let's go and take
a look at some of my favorites my number
5 app is Minecraft Pocket Edition
minecraft is one of my favorite PC games
I've played in quite a while and the
version for the iPhone iPod touch and
iPad is pretty decent if you don't know
what minecraft is all about I welcome
you to the Internet you must be new here
the high-res version does like several
key features from the full PC game
including the ability to craft along
with collecting blocks but this should
be fixed in an upcoming update for now
consider creative mode with a few dozen
blocks to choose from and a fun little
game to play on the go coming in at
number four is going to be Temple Run
for free this is a very simple and yet
very fun game that has you running
through an endless temple to get a high
score the game playing controls are dead
simple touch your device to collect
coins and power-ups and swipe up and
down on the screen to jump or slide for
free there's no reason not to go pick
this up my third favorite game of the
year is Grand Theft Auto 3 as I'm a huge
fan of open-world sandbox games this is
one of the rare iPhone games I can
actually sit down and play for over an
hour it's a direct port of the ps2
release from ten years ago and looks
fantastic on the iPhone iPod touch and
iPad my biggest hang-up with the game of
controls which while not awful do
detract from the gameplay at times as
it's a GTA game it's meant for a mature
audience but if that includes you then
this is a great mobile game coming in at
number 2 is the fantastic tiny wings a
casual game in the best sense of the
word
you control a bird as it gathers
momentum and launches off hills to make
it as far as you can before the Sun sets
I can't say enough about how great this
game is from the very chill music to the
wonderful art style to the very simple
yet fun gameplay 10 innings has it all
as one of my favorite go to games when I
want to burn a few minutes if you don't
already have it I highly recommend
downloading tiny wings
number one is jetpack joyride if you
follow me on Twitter you'll know just
how much I love this game I've easily
played it more than twice as much as any
other this year and it's easy to see why
you control Barry he uses a stolen
jetpack to make it as far as you can
while avoiding various obstacles and
missiles while still collecting a wide
range of power-ups and collecting coins
coins are used in the store to purchase
more power-ups new jet packs and more
and what's nice is that while there is
an option to buy coins for with real
money you can also just get them in the
game
for only one dollar in the App Store
there's no excuse not to go by Chet pay
Joyride I mean it go download it right
now
so there you have it my top iPhone apps
of 2011 of course you guys probably
won't agree with everyone on my list but
overall I definitely think that these
five games are by far what I've played
the most this year anyway guys if you
