this is Tod today I've never been so
proud of my life okay we're back to the
video over an unboxing video yeah
so these guys and you guys can check out
they both did videos on their channel
they basically completely surprised me
they showed up I walked out my front
door and this Mac Pro was sitting there
and these guys pop up out of nowhere and
you guys put on the giant collab of of
all that babe I guess yeah yeah you guys
got everybody together working toward if
team including you 15 view coming up got
the Mac Pro replaced that for me - you
guys are totally insane like other stuff
- oh yeah of course
Oh anyway but we're gonna unbox the Mac
Pro I didn't know listening I just
thought you might forget or something
all right
so let's pop this up I know what comes
in the box do you know and it wasn't
just us guys hell actually was not so
moral 15 people we have the whole
emotional thing yeah
lives on my channel and John's channel
you got to go watch that yeah I it's all
kinds of people on this thing
description description description look
at the dirt on there but everybody
pitched in and I it's a lot of people
yes they are they donkey maker let's
just say the way yeah this thing is can
I do the plastic do the plastic part no
you know I know there's a very one
professional in box hey hey you might
just ride boxing the IPL for it
you know you have very many
opportunities and what is this in the
camera and my in the shot yeah I can do
it here this is their beautiful you
what actually this is actually really
there you go you're yelling ah yeah Wow
you know what I still enjoy doing that
yeah it doesn't get old you know ever
get feel like I could do that all day
long
they had like a job somewhere some
assembly line where all I had to do was
that right there and of course you've
always got to crack it open
oh man I love the sound and that solid
bit of aluminum can you fit on your head
won't fit on my head I tried it no I
don't know a busted prize we went there
ha ha ha I pull out a Mac Pro this if it
on the head I guess we're gonna find out
I'll do the fit test
I don't care where you're from and what
you're into Pat is that much stuff in
that form factor is a feat of
engineering everybody who loves tech and
needs to appreciate this thing yeah not
like that even if you wouldn't use it
just yeah even if you're not a Mac user
it doesn't matter like if this was a PC
yeah with these specs in that form
factor will be just as impressive yeah
absolutely
yeah doesn't matter I mean it's this
whole thing is running off of one fan to
huge graphics cards processor the whole
thing one fan wonderful what could you
compare form factor wise some mini ITX
they know it Mini ITX is still a big
it's still bigger but we were freaking
out that you bought one no way no way
we're a little worried you're we were
footers talking you like haha what did
he buy next Thursday
there's Nintendo 3ds there's the 70d
yeah I got a camera right we were on the
watch we're on the lookout your Twitter
feed was of utmost importance how was it
isn't always uh well alright I guess
that's what we had a book the flight
quick immediately immediately we guys I
mean it's been what less than two weeks
really because it was Wednesday it was
what's today Saturday yeah
we all wanted to put like sort of a
Valentine's Day spin on it yeah see this
is this is bro love right here
amen this is a thumbnail right here bro
bromance hashtag haha magic it uh tweet
us all hashtag bromance
please don't what have you started so on
top of the Mac Pro you guys also got
some memories so this is actually what
is this is this is 32 gig kid 32 gig kit
so next I'll let some couple 16 so this
the stock baseline one single or the six
core oh it is explored yeah no nice so
it's basically the exact one that I had
yeah yeah who are you to stick score
yeah yeah no it's what you had hey I'm
sorry except you 50 - opposed it's the
best but you could change that that
doesn't matter that's I mean you just
actually I can use external this right
here good segue into this but this is I
actually went lame of it it's an IO face
mask so this is for basically just like
for hard drive so I used to have one of
these oh it was not one of these and oh
so this it looks probably like I'm just
really that's a pretty badass looking
thing so basically it's fireproof which
i think is you know ready didn't I need
to lift bro I I'm calling okay I'm gonna
look it up on the video this thing it's
gotta weigh at least like 20 30 pound 8
pound 28 pounds no 28 pound that weighs
28 times 40 innings wow it's pretty
heavy like me it's all fire proofing
yeah that's that's heavier than that Pro
yeah it's it's heavy
anyway that's cool up Bret Bret make
bread my bread is the man who hook this
up Thank You Bret from IO say thanks
Larry Fanning Doug and Larry greenberg
who connected the dots yeah yeah I can't
believe you guys were able to pull all
this stuff off in that yeah oh there you
go perfect
alright I'm gonna work on this are you
looking at you jr. but we both happen to
be on the same network and have the same
partner rapper I don't know what does
you that's his title that's yeah jazz
his titles needs Chas awesome yeah and
so uh I reached out to Chas and I was
like listen dude send him an email and
say there's something relating to you
know business or paperwork
I don't know final way to figure out
where he is right now because he's
obviously not at his
usual address because that address is
not there really anymore
that address is the pile of black stuff
and so here's the crazy part like he
literally FedExed this Best Buy
gives a gift card to my hotel here oh
really
yeah we just sorted this thing out right
it's all been happening so quickly so
I'm at the front desk this morning
waiting for a FedEx to come to the hotel
before we we come for you luck or we
came over here and so so anyways yes
chasm to full screen team contributed
500 bucks for Best Buy and the kind of
guys that we are it did not take us long
we spend them we went to Best Buy and we
picked up the rx100 which is actually
the camera that I use to shoot my vlogs
with the stuff you guys saw at CES law
that was shot on the rs.100 this is an
awesome camera you can fight you guys
both shut all of your video with rs.100
right you guys we have a couple of them
over there yeah I don't know where mine
is
uh hanging out together yeah well hey we
can do a family base as a family court
here we go oh there we go perfect oh
that was a likes 100 i won on the front
there you go
three arts one on our stones these are
awesome little cameras we get USB this
is this is the most fun part of
unboxings cables wrist strap wrist strap
don't use these if you use Restrepo come
on you're right up there with people who
use iPads - no that's bad news my phone
another camera it's a risk the hope what
if your your hand your hands do this no
I go it like look oh he's held on tight
hi Ellen but you don't know an element
it doesn't matter if you can't hold on
to a key but you have to retract that a
wrist strap is as bad as using an iPad
from no wait I don't know I think
they're pretty much both right up there
with things you should never ever do
learn how to hold devices no you use
your wrist strap I'm not I'm not going
with my condoning video no if you think
you need a wrist strap risk if you think
you need your wrist out yeah I know with
the wrist strap go with the screen
protector go with the OtterBox do what
you need to do I have seen too many
smash phones
you know after your boy how many friends
of mine are using a smash phone right
now many people in America are using a
smash phone right now let's put an end
to it let's put a stop to it wrist
straps on everything I'm just no don't
this is not no but I'm on your expensive
rx100
maybe so there we go so you guys
definitely go check out the videos that
they've got just like showing the behind
the scenes if I've actually haven't even
seen it yet you're editing it but uh
just these guys are crazy everybody
everybody who pitched in and did that
all this cuz like I wasn't wanting to
accept anything but when you guys show
up on my front door the Mac Pro and I'm
not gonna say yeah get out of my house
we were without we were genuinely
worried you know what we were about to
encounter but all the things I could
potentially go wrong in any kind of
excursion like this you know I worked it
all it all was perfect yeah and then not
only that but once you guys got here
then we all went out and you know went
and grabbed dinner and hung out all
night so it was it like two o'clock
right now in the morning cuz we've been
hanging out with all addicts we've been
hanging out the last 12 hours yeah early
