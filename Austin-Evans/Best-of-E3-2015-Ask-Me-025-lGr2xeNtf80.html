his mind to it
best thing you've seen at e3 hey Austin
it's guys so this is the last day of e3
that we're shooting this at have you
seen anything on the ship honestly I
came really to get some footage of the
Xbox elite controller for one of my
upcoming videos and new way to hang out
with this guy so what have you seen
that's cool so we just played unravel
and as you walk you can unravel and so
you have to pick up more yarn you can
like throw and like just around like
that was kind of cool I didn't agree
with the Xbox one elite controller yeah
it feels good right
like I like the grip I like some of the
additional buttons and be able to swap
out the thumb sticks I'm not that
hardcore on Xbox like I appreciate like
the grip especially felt feels kind of
nice but like I'm not gonna use the rear
triggers for probably anything ever like
acted a couple triggers are enough for
me I'm not really we can keep up with
that they've backwards compatibility is
the ex possible that was really what
kind of jumped out at me because you
know there's stuff like PlayStation now
on the PlayStation side which is fine
but it's not really great and you have
to pay for the games again whereas with
this you'll be able to take an Xbox 360
game throwing your xbox you're good to
go I think that's gonna be a really big
thing especially coming into the holiday
season people are upgrading for those
360s can you drove the old discs at
least on some games
would you rather only be able to upload
upside down videos or reverse videos I
would say reverse right ok but how are
you supposed to like the voices reverse
- is it yeah could you scrub reverse and
watch it normal the audio doesn't work
for that like if it's upside down you
just like put your phone upside down or
like your laptop or your screen here I'm
a can just like your leg but at least
it's somewhat you can just do that it's
at least someone useful I don't think
you can watch a video reverse it's like
Agata going upside no upset alright what
are your expectations for the upcoming
Fury lineup Titan killer or flop or flop
no I should I think it looks really cool
I think AMD has kind of been
on the backfoot most of last year and I
think the fury looks awesome mean first
of all it's got the new HBM memory in
theory it looks awesome why should have
to see how it actually performs but it
looks like a really cool thing and
that's something that you know we always
say in video like you know raising the
barn raising the bar it's kinda nice to
see AMD yeah on the other foot like hey
guys we have cool stuff too I think for
the bigger picture it's good for gaming
fast because it's not like yeah Nvidia
might have something in their back
pocket they're gonna be like BAM like
they're gonna have an answer to it but
at the same time as long as a mdq
stepping it up absolutely that's them
that's the best possible thing out of
them say one gadget you could not live
without
I think smartphone is kind of the
obvious answer I don't know like well
then again we did video a cameras really
important yeah but then the computers
really important you up the computer you
can edit the video what came first
checking out the egg it's actually the
chicken pretty sure is but anyway well
to be fair if I only had my smartphone I
could probably you've got my channel on
this I gonna take video I can edit it it
would take me a long time but I feel
like if I only had this device I can
still do basically everything I need
what do you think like maybe a laptop I
mean I use a laptop yeah heavily most
throughout the day my favorite tech is
just because I have fun making videos
obviously my camera yeah that's like an
impossible question yeah because the
cameras really hard cuz like if you say
that the camera is the only thing you
can use we can edit it with yeah usually
like email your your memory cards to
youtube please edit what is the most
difficult part of brainstorming slash
picking video ideas I don't have a big
problem with that to be honest like back
in the days where I cranked out like
four or five videos a week it was a
little bit tricky but nowadays I've got
like a client pile of video I want to
work on but I just don't have the time I
don't actually pick out what ideas you
work on no I think like I feel like you
said the ideas are there it's just like
I think sometimes I overshoot what I can
do so it's pushing it to the limit so I
think that's good
I don't think ideas are the problem I
think it's like having the resources to
do them and that's what makes it
interesting is trying to pick things
that are fun like you can't keep doing
the same thing over and over again
and especially because we work with
products too often right like we're not
the only two people doing a video on
like a new iPhone a new galaxy or
whatever so you know being able to
differentiate making sure that it stays
fun like after a while I was like oh
look it's another phone yeah but you
know making sure that's kind of fun and
interesting I think it's kind of one of
the big things in plus you guys have a
lot of options and channels to watch on
YouTube
and I feel like we need to make sure
that we make something that's different
from everyone else and that's really
interesting so I think it's kind of a
two-way street as far as making sure
that we're still interested making sure
the audience is still interesting yeah
ultimately you put out something that
you are happy with absolutely you know a
big thanks to John for being in the
video I'm sure you guys are all
