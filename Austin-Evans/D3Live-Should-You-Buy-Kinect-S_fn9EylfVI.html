episode of d3 live so you have to excuse
me as a new set up here not quite fully
adjusted so video is not quite up to
quality it hopefully will be next week
so anyway today we're going to be
talking about the Microsoft Kinect sort
of just now to come out recently and I
think it's a good time go ahead and talk
about it because there are a lot of
people who have questions and I'll be
we're really trying to consider whether
or not it's worth spending the money I'm
so to recap the Kinect is a an add-on
for the xbox 360 that basically uses
motion sensing microphones and several
cameras I should go ahead and track you
so unlike the wii or the PlayStation
Move where you know you have a handheld
control of kind of detects motion the
Microsoft Kinect actually go ahead and
you know films you can actually mix you
actually detects your body in real space
which theoretically should be a lot more
accurate so instead of you know just
moving your hands you can move your
entire body I'm we definitely see some
of the advantages of this and some of
the games such as dance central now
there are also some disadvantages of the
kinect now the main one is the price now
where you can go ahead with the way and
you know if you buy a way it
automatically comes with a remote the
PlayStation Move is only about a hundred
dollars with the bundle however connect
does cost you one hundred fifty dollars
however on the other hand it's 11
connect you know it's not like you have
to buy a bunch of controllers so what a
lot of people kind of complain about the
price I think it's about right
personally I mean obviously you know if
it goes down a little bit that'd be nice
but stores how much $150 I think that's
okay considering that you know you want
to buy any more control or anything like
that you plug into Xbox you're good to
go so some of the really cool things
about connecting a lot of it has to do
with the potential in my opinion now
right now obviously it's just now
launched so there aren't a ton of games
however the one that I really you know
think that it's probably the best one is
going to be dance central so this one is
actually very similar to lay you know a
rock band or a guitar hero except with
dancing so you know you actually go
ahead you have different dance moves
which obviously you know a lot of people
you know absolutely fail at it in your
local
stupid but it really gives you a great
opportunity to show up how well connect
work so actually really doesn't do a
fantastic job of tracking your body so
as you actually know if you pull all the
moves I'll actually you know can tell if
you're actually doing it or you know
you're not so I think that's really one
of the games it shows off how well
connect can actually work and I'd really
love to see once connect you know is you
know gets a little bit flushed out maybe
get some updates Matt I really like to
see the kinds of games that connect will
feature because that's really going to
be the main point in my opinion with the
Kinect you know if we don't say a lot of
really good game so you know we don't
sleep big budget games like you know
Gears of War call of duty or halo or
some of the big franchises if we can see
those come over to the Kinect and
actually give real you know real connect
controls as opposed to you know using
the xbox 360 controller I think that
will work really well now as far as how
they would do that must be on me but of
course that's seen as the developer job
so I'm sure they come up with something
so overall you know there's a lot of
good things and bad things about the
kinect you know one of the major things
a lot of people don't realize is that it
takes up a lot of space so if you're a
cramped area if you're in a small
bedroom or maybe you know you don't have
a whole lot of room and your living room
or whatever your xbox is you might not
even be able to use the Kinect so really
the connector is really just likes as
much room as possible really didn't get
you know make 8-foot 10-foot of open
space it really does help so one thing I
do want to mention about the Kinect that
you know some people are finding out
they buy it they can't use it is that
you really do need quite a bit of space
otherwise it really won't be able to
pick up on you really that well however
still I do like to connect I think
there's a lot of potential there if
you're considering buying one if you
don't have an xbox to probably the best
way to go would be to go ahead and buy
one of the bundles cig my either the
four gigabyte or the 250 gigabyte xbox
360's you go ahead and get in a bundle
which definitely does help the price a
little bit however if you already do
have an xbox 360 I really can't
recommend it right now I think that it
would probably be better to go ahead and
white for some games come out because
obviously that's costs 250 dollars and
that's a lot of money considering that
there really aren't a great amount of
game
there are some kind of need someone's
but most of them kind of tend to be part
of games and really in my opinion most
of them are not worth a fifty-dollar
asking price so um if you don't have an
xbox I'm not that would be a pretty good
time and go ahead and buy a new xbox
with a kinect bundle hey what first you
already have an xbox and you know you're
not really so totally sold on you know a
couple of the games and it'd probably be
better to wait four more games and maybe
even a price cut okay so for the second
segment v3 live we will be taking live
questions so as always every episode of
d3 life is filmed in front blog TV we've
got a lot of people in here two days
what did you take some questions to kind
of discuss connect a bit do I expect
much stuff to do better with kinect than
the Nintendo did with waiting um you
know it's kind of a complicated question
I think right now the Wii is not doing
so well and so I think immediately at it
you know I think heck's going to do
pretty well um but over the long run as
far as you know I think the way was just
so successful for so long just as far as
the units go like how many they sold how
many people had them I think yeah I
don't think it's going to come close to
the way however I do think there's a lot
of potential behind connect especially
there's been a lot of young people
talking about it Microsoft's done a
really good job getting you know
everyone knows what connect is or at
least quite a few people do so what I
have to see I don't really think it'll
you know outsell the way you know as far
as overall yeah you know several years
but i think it's got a lot of potential
what is better we connect with
playstation move um yeah that's that's
kind of a difficult question um I think
the weed has a lot going forward as far
as it's the only one with the actual
packing so you know you actually buy wii
and you're going to go ahead and get the
remote so i think that guys can go a
long ways for you know getting people
into and everything um any other wii
remote though it works pretty well you
know it's it's it's pretty decent the
PlayStation Move is ok i just am NOT a
huge fan of needing a camera and the
controllers when it's really not all
that much more accurate than the wii so
lily I would probably pick connect on
that I will just go ahead and just say
this right now I'm more of a hardcore
gamer I I'm really big fans you know
like mouse and keyboard or you know a
gamepad like you know
xbox playstation so that's really the
way I like to gain however I can
definitely see a lot of potential in
connect I think that there's a lot of
different gangs there really some unique
and kind of interesting things just the
way that you know on the iphone the ipod
touch it opened up so many new different
games as far as the touchscreen the
accelerometer well i think that same
kind of thing can come over to the Xbox
with the Kinect with all kinds of really
unique titles do i think the Kinect is
going to do better than Apple uh I don't
think so I i think the necks gonna be
pretty well but I mean apples they're
ridiculous it makes so much money it's
not even funny this connect going to be
in different colors or only flat
actually I believe it's only black right
now um and I I don't think they were
really ever put it in in different
colors I mean they might but I don't
think there's a whole lot of point as
far as just something that means sitting
there but hey who knows do you think
calibration will be hard as I see a good
question like I kind of touched on
earlier one of the big cons against
connect was the you know the calibration
how much space you need I think the
calibration is also a little bit
annoying because I should have to know
learn who you are and all that kind of
stuff I'm hiller from what I've seen it
might just opt is done a good job of you
know programming it where you know it's
not going to be some long ordeal you
know it gets you into the game fairly
quickly do I think it will revolutionize
the way and get intended to alter the
wii too because of it oh my that's a
good question um i don't know i think
that really to be honest I think
Nintendo is really pretty far along with
the wii too i would play fake to see
going probably next year um so i don't
know if there's actually time for them
to really change it based on you know
connect is just now coming out but you
know Nintendo is really really good and
they obviously have known about
connector for quite a while so I
wouldn't actually be surprised if we do
see some sort of you know connect
accessory or maybe even may be connected
to the wii for the next week too i think
that there is a lot of potential for
microsoft rather Nintendo to go ahead
and expand out and take a look at some
of the things that the competitors are
doing what do you think the kinect will
have an influence on Apple to create a
unique product um you know Apple is kind
of
kind of hard to watch you know Apple
will go ahead and take a look at some
technologies and sometimes I go yeah we
want that no problem and all of a sudden
you'll see it a couple years later so
yeah for example capacitive touchscreens
they were one of the first really
adopted you know a lot a lot of the
different things apple took and
everybody else took accurate but on
other things like for example flash
leaves even looking like USB 3 apples
come up and you know holding back or
like well we will take a look i'm indy
also 3d screens so i don't know i don't
know if whatever going to say something
like that I think that the iphone ipod
touch in the ipad definitely do have the
potential with cameras and all that kind
of stuff to to do a sort of connect
style I'm not so sure exactly how you
know how full-featured it will be will
connect have video chat for live parties
yes connect does have the video chat
believe it more solute windows live
messenger you know it works pretty well
obviously you know you've got cameras
there you might as well use it but you
know it's it's kind of a secondary
feature considering the obviously you
know everyone most likely is going to
have a webcam or a laptop or even an
iphone or ipod touch to use you know a
webcam with so i think it's going to be
kind of a nice extra feature but it's
not going to be you know something to
sell a device at all do I think there
will be problems with kinect absolutely
i mean you know when their technology
first comes out there's always going to
be problems with it ah like I said so
there's a lot I think it's going to be
one of the big things is the space
there's not a whole lot of space that
you get you know that you actually have
to move around with kinect i think
that's gonna be a big problem for a lot
of people you know i mean for example a
lot of rooms a lot of stuff you just
won't be able to use it which that's
that's kind of a big deal on the throw
of course we're going to be a lot of
problems with the first thing of
technology you know there might be you
know you might break you might not work
right but lily I wouldn't be too worried
I mean they're obviously going to keep
updating everything so really I really
wouldn't worry too much bad there might
be a few minor problems here and there
but connect overall is a very solid
piece of hardware so anyway guys that's
it for this week's episode of d3 live so
