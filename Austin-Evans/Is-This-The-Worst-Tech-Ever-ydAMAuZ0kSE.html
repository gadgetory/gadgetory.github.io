lot of bad tech over the years but this
might just be some of the worst kicking
things off is the Microsoft Kin this was
a weird one it all started when
Microsoft bought the makers of the site
everybody needs a sidekick they've been
invested over a billion dollars into
developing the Ken line which didn't
exactly do well the entire project did
so poorly that it was cancelled within
two months but why was it so bad my
friend Ralphie and I decided to find out
nice this is the Microsoft Ken first of
all that screen is tiny we compare it to
a modern smartphone that uh that's tiny
but of course we have the fiscal keep do
you have a physical keyboard and iPhone
I actually don't this is a run Android
so on the back Windows Phone oh that is
a thing right there
I mean there's no support for normal
apps on that right side Android so no
there are no apps at all period here as
was essentially a feature phone the Ken
was nearly as expensive as a smart phone
and with competition like the iPhone and
the original Samsung Galaxy it was no
surprise that it flopped so badly
worst of all less than a year after
launch the Ken site shut down making it
even less useful by removing the social
features ending one of the biggest
failures in modern tech another phone
that was a pretty spectacular flop was
the Amazon fire phone launched in 2014
after years of rumors the Amazon was
working on a phone the fire came out to
quite a bit of height this is still in
the rack so basically all four of the
cameras around the edges are all about
being able to track your face hey man
you got the octopus on you men run so
the crazy thing about the fire phone was
it started at a $650 Howard by the time
they were discontinuing it it was a $160
and that included a free year of Amazon
Prime which was worth 100 bucks I think
one of the big problems with the Amazon
fire phone was it it ran fire OS that is
a version of Android but if you look
through here it looks almost nothing
like well traditional Android surprise
surprise the fire phone didn't sell well
it atleast stayed on sale for a year but
it was an ATT exclusive at first and
Amazon had to write off at least a
hundred and seventy billion dollars on
the project next up we've got the
blackberry playbook
this was an interesting one launched in
2011 a year after the first iPad it
actually had a lot of features that were
an improvement real multitasking and
respectable Hardware helped the PlayBook
to actually be fairly decent but
starting at $500 it was absolutely not a
finished product to the launch
you're boxing right now is a product
that is over five years old oh we see
that trickshot D yeah this actually is a
nice piece of art where you have dual
front-facing speakers it's kind of got a
nice sort of finish on the back I
remember actually when this first came
out I was at CES I actually did a video
on the playbook and I was pretty excited
this thing looked really cool I think it
was so hard to compete with the iPad and
I know they spend a lot of my developing
this especially the software I don't
think BlackBerry ever really fully
recovered after a series of price drops
and software updates the PlayBook ended
up selling decently but it still was
canceled and Blackberry wrote off nearly
half a billion dollars just to clear the
inventory that was sitting on store
shelves
anyway what's on your shirt oh it's
pretty mention that that's the brand new
Austin eken shirt available for a
limited time on teespring get it now
before it disappears they might run away

like yeah you might wanna call you might
want to give the shirt a raspberry for
real oh if you guys wanna check out this
shirt link will be in the description
and something else you guys you can
check out is a video I did over on
