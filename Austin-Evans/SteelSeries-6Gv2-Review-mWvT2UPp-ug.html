here with a review of the steelseries
6gv2 mechanical keyboard this is one of
the most popular gaming keyboards out
right now with tons of feedback thanks
to the Cherry MX black key switches so
let's take a closer look to see if it's
right for your gaming PC doing a quick
little unboxing you'll see the 6gv2
doesn't have a lot to say for itself
until you get into the box pop the top
and you'll see the accessories pack
along with the keyboard itself first up
you'll find an included USB to ps2
adapter which is helpful in decreasing
the time between when you press a key
when something actually happens there's
also a bit of paperwork showing off some
other products the owner's manual which
come on it's a keyboard you should be
able to work it out
lastly you get a SteelSeries sticker to
toss on something if you'd like the main
attraction is of course the keyboard
itself which thanks to the small bezels
actually is a bit smaller than most
gaming keyboards another little detail I
like is the matte texture which feels
nice to touch and doesn't attract
fingerprints which should help to keep
it clean instead of a left Windows key
you'll see the SteelSeries key which is
there to keep you from accidentally
leaving your game along with the larger
Enter key which means that you have a
shrink and right Shift key and the
backspace has been moved down neither of
these changes took too long for me to
get used to though something else to
keep in mind is that the 6gv2 is a bit
tall and has no height adjustment the
position of the keyboard feels right to
me but of course it might not be perfect
for you once you start using it you'll
find the cherry black switches give a
very different feel compared to a normal
membrane based keyboard
they aren't clicky and in fact the press
is registered about halfway down as you
type which can speed you up quite a bit
once you get used to them I'll shut up
for a second so you can hear the fairly
quiet noise these make they do take more
pressure than usual to press however
which means your fingers might get a bit
tired at first but they're great for
gaming about the only thing that's
missing is a backlight but considering
the price I really can't complain it's
also built like a tank the entire
keyboard is really well built and feel
like it will last three years of use
altogether the 6gv2 is a great
mechanical keyboard for gaming as well
as typing that's actually pretty
reasonably priced and I'll of course add
a link to check it out in the
description if you're interested in more
feel free to check out my last video
going over my game console collection

video a thumbs up and subscribe if you
