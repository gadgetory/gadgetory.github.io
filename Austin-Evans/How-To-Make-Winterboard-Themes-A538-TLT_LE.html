today I'm here with a video I think will
help a lot of you guys out I want to
give you guys a quick tutorial on how to
make winterboard themes I'm gonna give
you guys the basics and kind of going to
show you how you can piece together
parts of other themes but the same
basics will apply if you would like to
make your own themes although obviously
it's going to be a little bit more
complicated but the basics are all still
going to be there anyway let's go ahead
get this one started
okay so the first step is that you're
going to need to download some software
that will allow you to ssh basically
what s s aging is in a nutshell is that
you allows you to transfer files from
your iPod or iPhone to your computer you
know there are more purposes and all
kinds of stuff but for this for the
purpose of this tutorial that's all you
need to know so basically you will need
to download one of two programs there
are others but these are the ones I
recommend ok so if you're using a
Windows computer you should download
winscp I will have links to both of
these programs in the sidebar when SCP
is a really a pretty solid program just
allows you to ssh no frills whatever
it's perfect and if you're using a Mac
you will need to use cyberduck I've used
it obvious both of these they both very
simple so you know they both work in
general i will be showing you guys when
SCP but if you have a Mac and you're
using cyberduck it should be pretty
similar so go ahead install those and
then we'll go ahead to the next step ok
so I'm going to go ahead and skip ahead
to just using the program you do not
know how to SSH it's not i'm not going
to give you guys the full tutorial it's
very simple once you learn how to hook
it up everything it's no big deal but if
you have if you have problems with it
you know go ahead find some other
tutorial and i go ahead and skip this
next part why ok and you will need to
have your ipod or iphone hooked up on
everything and logged in ok so when you
log in you will be in the root file ok
so you see library and media on the
right ignore the left that's just your
files this is what you're looking at on
your remote device which in this case is
your iphone or ipod so basically you see
library media you'll also see this one
double-click it to go back now you'll be
in this file and you'll see all these
now will note that SS agent can kind of
get a little intimidating for people but
really yeah i mean you know you are in
the main files but you're not i mean
unless you start grass stuff and
deleting it you should be ok ok so go
down almost the end and hit stache the
stache folder right here and go into
that you see bunch more going to themes
ok so go into / so basically you back
out when you first open it you back out
to the
AAR file then you go into the stash file
and then you go into themes and once
you're here you're pretty much breathe
easy you're pretty much there now you
will see all of your winterboard things
all of them are going to be in this file
now basically what you do is you can go
through and get whatever you want so
let's say well purpose is this i'm not
going to go ahead and do it i'll show
you guys how to do it because it does
take a little bit so basically let's say
I want glass Clark so you click it and
then you drag it over or you can drag it
onto your desktop or whatever I've
already done it because it does take a
little while so I've grabbed two themes
glass Clark and Alou mine so let's go
ahead and go to the next step show you
guys how to edit once you do have the
themes on your computer okay so now once
you're at wherever it is that you put
the two theme folders in my case it's on
the desktop but whatever is most
convenient to you next you're going to
want to go ahead and add these themes
now once you editing them it's pretty
simple it does get pretty complicated
and I don't have the time to go through
each and every what each and every
little icon and everything what are the
what all means um you know it really is
going to come down to a lot of trial and
error I mean you know download I mean it
really says it's kind of fun you know
just download lots of different themes
and you know go look and see the
customizations they made and scroll
through the files and see what the names
are and all that kind of stuff but i'm
going to show you guys some simple
things so let's say we can go ahead and
make our own theme it's going to be
really simple so let's go ahead and just
make a new folder I can be named
whatever you want so just going to new
and folder and obviously if you have a
Mac you should not do this to going
let's name it test does not matter just
name it whatever you want that is going
to be the name of the theme ok so now
assuming obviously I have glass Clark
and ayla mean you know you can use
whatever you want you can make your own
but i'm just going to just kind of show
you the basics ok so let's go ahead and
open up classical art ok so you can see
that there are a few there are a few
things there's like bundles folders
icons and there are a couple of others
but unfortunately i've already gotten
into this but you will see sometimes
depending on the theme like a thing that
says doc or
background and different things like
that but you know main thing that last
card is about is icons so let's go ahead
and open up the icons folder in the
icons folder you will see all of the
icons and you can see there 2500 icons
and classical art so you know what let's
say you know what I like glass cloud
icons but you know I don't like them all
I like this one for example so what we
do is let's go ahead and open up test
folder okay now we will need to create
folders inside this but long it's just
pretty simple so to make an icon to have
a custom icon and your test which is
your new theme right click it go ahead
and just make a new folder i will say
that you're definitely be making a lots
of folders and stuff okay now you need
to do it specifically uppercase I then
see ons that's icons so whatever icons
you put in here will be the icons that
will show up so let's say we like the
one password so let's pick it up and
drag it into icons now we open it up you
see that this icon is going to be in the
theme now obviously if you want you can
copy the entire glass cloud over you can
mix and match you can make your own
icons it really doesn't matter one thing
though is that if you do want to
customize one thing that you definitely
notice is be wary of the size so if we
open this up it's going to be 59 x 62
now you can edit the sizes a little bit
but you have to be careful when you get
into sometimes if you change the size of
something it can kind of mess stuff up
so you know do a little experimentation
and kind of you know be mine what you
doing so Allah mean obviously you can
see here has a lot more okay you can see
wallpaper and everything like that but
basically a wallpaper is going to be
your basically what it is behind the
behind all of your icons on your
springboard so you know I like this one
so let's go ahead go to the test and as
you can see here if you pay attention to
the hierarchy you see that in the very
first thing in the illumine you see all
the stuff so if you see wallpaper here
you can drag it over 12 paper on your
other it's just kind of a general sort
of thing so we like this wallpaper so
we're going to move it over to our new
one
a doc this is going to be the dock at
the bottom sometimes you might want to
have a transparent dog sometimes you
might not in this case we like this dog
so we're gonna go ahead and drag it over
here okay there's lots more I won't even
try to get the bundles and everything
like that but basically this is kind of
the basics you can mix and match for
this I recommend just if you don't know
what you're doing it first just makes
match icons and like wallpapers and I go
ahead grab status bars and docks and
that sort of thing you can go into the
more in-depth like the bundles and
everything a later date or you can do it
right now if you want but you know it
takes a while you might understand
exactly how everything goes so no just
experiment around but for this we're
just going to use this so now let's go
ahead and go to the next step okay so
now we're assuming that we're done for
right now with the theme so now let's go
ahead and put it on the device okay so
it's very simple go ahead and open up
one that's EP or cyberduck and do the
exact same thing we did before back out
of route down open up the stash and open
up themes okay now go ahead and you can
drag and drop but I haven't have it just
right here on my desktop so go ahead
grab test drag it in here now you got to
be sure that you don't accidentally you
know put it inside one of these so let's
go ahead just drop it right here and so
we're gonna copy it go ahead copy let's
go ahead and give it just a moment and
there we go so if we scroll down here a
little bit we should say test okay so
now if you want an open up and look at
it you see that your icon your doc and
your wallpaper they're obviously
anything else to put it okay so let's go
ahead and take a look at what it looks
like on the device okay so once you've
sh the earthy your brand new same onto
your device and you have selected it
through either winterboard owb app and
respring and you're all done then you
will have the same see here this is not
that nice of a theme i mean it's it's as
do still have all everything else i had
on it but you know it's basically pretty
solid i mean you can see that obviously
the background is there and the doc is
there and if i would have picked more
icons obviously you would see the icons
what changed but yeah that's pretty much
how to change and do everything in a
nutshell you know there's lots and lots
more but just to get yourself started
that's does this is a pretty easy way
you can customize themes and another way
you can do it and I didn't quite show in
the video was you can customize
pre-existing themes so what I showed was
like taking bits and pieces from tues
eames this place glass Clark Alou mean
but if you wanted to you could take
class Clark or whatever theme and just
like add pieces to it so you already
have a base thing with all the UI
elements and just add more like add
icons or do whatever you want really
it's all about customization that's what
when you're bored is all about so you
know just go have fun with it i I don't
know i might do some more tutorials on
some more in-depth stuff but once you
get this really just experiment just
look at each find different themes and
look at the different files and say oh I
think I that does this change them make
your own custom I mean just just go for
it's a lot of fun anyway guys so that's
it just a video tutorial want to show
you guys how to make custom winterboard
themes so yeah thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
