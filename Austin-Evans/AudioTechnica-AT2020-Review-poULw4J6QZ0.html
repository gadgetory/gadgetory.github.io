of the audio technica at2020 USB
condenser microphone so I've been using
this for a couple of weeks now I've got
to say I'm very impressed pretty much
across the board soon as you see here
nothing on the front and if I swill it
around and show you guys there's nothing
on the back as well so you know if
you're looking for some of the other
features such as gain and all that kind
of stuff you're gonna be a little bit
disappointed with this microphone
however if you're doing it for
voiceovers and that sort of thing
not going to be a huge deal you know you
can just add that kind of stuff on the
computer with that in much hassle now if
we flip it over on the bottom you will
see that it does connect via USB I know
the USB cable it includes you show you
guys it's really really quite long which
is very very well appreciated you know
of course with the microphone like this
you want to keep it away from you know
perhaps your noisy computer which is
making a lot of noise that it could pick
up so you know it's got a really nice
long capable where if you want you could
be walk across the room and still being
able to record no problem now let's talk
some about the specifics of the
microphones so as far as the audio
quality goes I'll have a sample in just
a little bit after the major part of the
review is over very very impressive
now of course do keep in mind if you're
accustomed to more expensive microphones
then this is probably not going to match
up however at the price point I had no
problems whatsoever oh it's good at you
know filtering out all the kinds of
background noise although again do keep
in mind you know if you have for example
noise your computer or you know like a
TV here running or anything like that
that's anywhere near you will it will
pick it up although it will be fainter
than most other microphones so do
definitely do keep that in mind however
very very solid as far as the audio
quality goes I don't really have any
complaints whatsoever bill quality exact
saying this is very very sturdy and of
course as it's a condenser microphone
you want to avoid dropping it or you
know allowing to get damaged however as
long as you can you know keep take care
of it I don't think you have any issues
as far to see you know the build quality
goes seems to be built very sturdily now
something that do want to go ahead and
draw attention to is this stand so I'll
show you guys right here it does come
equipped with us or not equipped I
suppose it comes with a stand when you
purchase it this is a very unique stand
so this light is swivel the microphone
around 360 degrees so that's nice
and you also do have a little a
little wheel here or what if you want to
call that dial allows you to adjust the
you know the microphone up and down to
get it perfectly situated I mean also
this microphone does or the stand rather
does fold up so if you want to get a
little bit more compact you can just
fold the likes in and then all will fit
really quite nicely into the pairing
pouch that Audio Technica does provide
okay so I am now recording using these
audio technica at2020 so this is about 6
inches or so away from the microphone of
course it does sound pretty good as you
get farther away but you know if you're
doing a podcast or voiceover this is
probably a bit going to be about what
the audio quality is going to sound like
I'm in a fairly quiet room pretty much
the only other thing that's you know
making any noise is my laptop fan which
is admittedly kind of loud but hopefully
you guys should be able to hear that too
much so guys this is the audio test of
the audio technica at2020 anyway guys
that's it for my review of the audio
technica at2020 overall like I said I've
been very impressed with this microphone
it sounds good it works well well it
does like some of the features of some
of his other competitors for what I use
it for which of course is voice overs I
mean dreads were really quite well so if
that's the major thing you do voiceovers
perhaps podcast is that sort of thing
you will have no real issues with this
microphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
