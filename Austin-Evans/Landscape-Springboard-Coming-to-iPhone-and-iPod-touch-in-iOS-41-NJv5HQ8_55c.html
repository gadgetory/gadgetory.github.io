on a possible new feature coming in iOS
4.1 so of course iOS four point oh has
been out for a little while we have seen
two betas of iOS 4.1 now these betas
really have it consisted of anything
rather than you know just updates in
minor little bug fixes it really hasn't
been a major update however Apple has
said that they will be incorporating a
fairly large update in 4.1 so it will
probably consist of something pretty
decent now a lot of us myself included
didn't really think anything of this you
know maybe just figure my me game center
which has been a date a bit or something
else however thanks to some tips and
screenshots of God it actually might be
a landscape springboard option for the
iphone and ipod touch thanks to these
tips and spring cups I've gotten from
Johnny boy blogs there are quite a few
pretty interesting things I'd like to
show you guys so let's go ahead and
start with the landscape notifications
so if you take a look at the
notifications they're actually in all
sorts of different angles which is
pretty odd as generally you know they
just stayed pretty much the same and
this was easily repeatable as you showed
me in a video it is that you know I have
to do is just turn his iphone and it
would pop up in a different area so
that's definitely pretty interesting i
have to say in addition the keyboard
also was doing something pretty similar
as you can go ahead and be typing in
portrait and the keys would show up in
landscape so i will mention that this is
not entirely unprecedented you know
we've seen some sort of glitches
especially like the keyboard and
previous versions of iOS however for all
of these to just suddenly appear in iOS
4.1 which by all councils pretty much
like a simple update is pretty
interesting in addition I also have a
tip from hey Jordan and let me know
about it there is actually a landscape
springboard folder inside iOS 4.1 for
the iphone and ipod touch so inside this
folder there's not a whole lot basically
there's just a few copies of the dock
both the old and the new dock as well as
two copies of the ipad dock which is
kind of interesting why would that would
be in the iphone ipod touch personally i
think that that is probably just a
placeholder though they're just getting
it ready they're actually will be you
know a standard looking iphone and I
touch dog available ad so guys if you
put all this together i think there
actually is a pretty decent likelihood
that we will see Lance rotating
springboard option coming in iOS 4.1 for
iphone ipod touch now of course guys
know this is confirmed but i did want to
see after all this stuff i've got i did
want to go ahead and share it with you
guys and see what your opinion was so
what do you think do you think this is
pretty you know do you think this could
be happened you think is actually going
to come what do you think maybe it's
just a lot of you know top maybe just
over just a few random glitches definite
let me know in the comments I'm pretty
interested to know anyway guys thanks
