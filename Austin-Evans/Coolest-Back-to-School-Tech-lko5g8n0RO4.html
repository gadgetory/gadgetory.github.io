with some of the coolest tech back to
school i've got to give a big shout out
to the google store for sponsoring this
video there's the best place to get all
the googly stuff you might want
including everything featured in this
video to start with we have the asou
scrum book flip now what makes this guy
kind of interesting is the name so if
you flip it upside down you get yourself
flip mode not sure if that's actually
the name I'm gonna go with it something
that makes this even more interesting is
this is what the very few Chromebooks
that can actually run Android apps so
once you update to the dev channel you
will see that the Play Store has been
added so push this to its absolute
limits we have candy crush do people
really play candy crush is this actually
a thing um oh no I meant yet oh look at
that sure it's not gonna go blow your
brand-new add it on a laptop away
however is totally enough for basic
tasks such as web browsing which is
exactly what a Chromebook does best if
you want something a little bit more
premium the aja Chromebook 14 is a good
choice so first of all this is entirely
made of metal and for a computer the
cost less than three hundred dollars
that's not too bad it's actually fairly
thin and light for a 14 inch laptop and
you can bring the hinge all the way out
it's not really necessary but it's cool
we're also getting a more powerful
laptop so inside we have a quad-core
Intel Celeron processor paired with four
gigabytes of RAM considering how
lightweight chrome OS is this is more
than enough it also has a really nice 14
inch display not only is it 1080p which
honestly is pretty much perfect for a
laptop like this but it's also matte and
that could come in seriously handy when
you're using it outside around windows
so there's a lot of glare around it
makes this much more usable pretty much
anywhere you are since it doesn't use a
ton of power and need a fan to keep it
cool the battery life it's actually
really solid so it's rated for up to 12
hours which honestly should be plenty to
get you through a full day of use and
that's really one of the major
advantages of using a Chromebook you
know I do they have good battery life
but they also can do pretty much
anything you need to do while you're in
school and on top of that they're fairly
affordable that always helps next up we
have the Nexus 6p this is a really
underrated phone while there are tons
and tons of options out there there are
a lot of advantages to using a nexus not
only do you have stock Android which is
awesome by itself but you're also always
on the cutting edge of updates so no
matter what kind of tasty Android treat
they cook up you're going to get it
first with the 6p it's also just a
really nice phone to use what is a
little bit on the bigger side there are
a lot of nice little touches like the
buttons being slightly offset on the
right side
you can easily reach them with you thumb
there's a fingerprint sensor around back
so it's easy to hit there's just a lot
of nice little touches here it's rocking
a 5.7 inch 1440p OLED display the screen
is awesome there's really nothing to
complain about and on top of that you
have dual front-facing speakers it's
also rocking a 12 megapixel camera and
it's actually not too bad since it's a
bigger phone it's easy to be productive
on you can take notes and do all the
important things in life like check
snapchat email Pokemon go snapchat
Twitter YouTube snapchat all the basics
you can also pick up a live case for
your Nexus now I should really like
these first of all they're completely
customizable so you can print whatever
you want on here I used a Google map
however if you'd like you can print your
own photos patterns whatever you want
there's an extra button on the back of
the case which is programmable so you
can do a few different things with it
such as opening an app or you can do
something basic like turn on the
flashlight
another cool accessory for the Nexus is
Google cardboard now that's actually
worked with a lot of different phones
but this is by far the cheapest way to
get into virtual reality it's crazy is
just how immersive Google cardboard is
when you consider this is literally a
couple pieces of plastic and some
cardboard along with a smartphone
cardboard also works if you want to
watch videos by yourself which is super
helpful if you're in a dorm and you want
to catch up on some latest youtube
uploads something else you might want to
consider picking up is a chromecast so
this little guy will turn pretty much
any HDMI display into a smart TV
the way it works is Google cast as long
as you're on the same Wi-Fi as the
chromecast most apps on iOS and Android
will let you cast video to your TV it's
dead simple there's no remote as you
control everything from your phone
laptop or tablet because this is so
small not only will it fit an even a
tight dorm setup but it's easy enough to
throw in a bag or even a pocket and take
with you pretty much anywhere if you
guys are interested in anything I talked
about in the video definitely be sure to
check out the links in the description
the Google store is awesome enough to
support the channel so go show them some
love
David guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
