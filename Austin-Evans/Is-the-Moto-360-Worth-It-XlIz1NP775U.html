the Moto 360 sports an awesome round
display but is it worth your $250 the
biggest thing that sets the 360 apart
from other smartwatches is the round
display after years of rectangular
screens the Moto 360 almost looks fake
it's got a very thin bezel and then
silver it really does look like the kind
of watch everyone imagined we will be
wearing in the year 2014 there is a
small window on the bottom which houses
the light sensor and display connectors
which does break the circular illusion a
bit but it's not something I really ever
noticed in normal use with a one and a
half inch 320 by two 90 resolution
display it's respectably sharp and holds
up nicely even in direct sunlight
something I can't say about a lot of
other smartphones as a guy who doesn't
usually wear watches the 360 feels just
about right on my average-sized wrist
it's not particularly thick or heavy and
the round case helps to make sure it
stays comfortable if you have small
wrists it might be a bit too big and if
you have big wrists it might even be a
little bit too small but for most people
I think it's a good compromise you've
got two choices right now a black moto
360 with black leather band or the
silver 360 with a grey band like I have
there will be a few more options later
this year including metal bands but I
like the leather personally one big
question about the 360 is battery life
I've been using it everyday for over a
week and it's never quit on me before
the end of the day it's usually around
30% by the time I drop it on the charger
at night however a big reason why is
because the screen doesn't stay on all
the time instead it wakes up when you
raise your wrist which is a decent
compromise
although the gesture isn't quite as
accurate as I would like if you want to
always be able to see the time there's
the ambient screen mode which keeps your
watch face on almost always this hurts
your battery life quite a bit though so
I kept it off one really nice touch is
the charger it's magnetic and Wireless
so all you need to do is drop the watch
on to the dock and it lights up softly
with the time on the flipside since the
Moto 360 basically has to be charged
every night it can be a bit of an
annoyance when traveling to have to not
only take a microUSB cable and charger
but also the dock for your watch the
Moto 360 is ip67 certified which means
that while I can get a little wet it's
really not meant to do this
still works though there's also a heart
rate sensor built into the back
like most smartwatches I've tried it's
not particularly accurate needing firm
contact with your wrist and even then it
fails quite a bit for me I've had better
luck flipping the watch over but it
could definitely be a better experience
on the other hand the pedometer does a
good job of tracking your steps
throughout the day it's not a huge
feature but being able to track your
fitness is a nice addition as an Android
wear device the Moto 360 works with
basically any phone running Android 4.3
or higher I paired it with the new Moto
X but most newer phones will work with
it just fine if you haven't tried
Android wear yet it's a very nicely put
together OS everything is big and easy
to control you can read things like
email write on your watch and quickly
archive or open on your phone with a
couple taps you also get Google now
cards from your phone such as weather
flight info and calendar notifications
there's also a pretty decent voice
recognition ok Google set a timer for
three minutes you do have to keep the
Moto 360 tethered to your Android phone
with Bluetooth but the range is more
than long enough for me I couldn't get
the 360 to drop connection anywhere in
my apartment one thing that is really
bizarre are the internals it's powered
by an ohm app 3 processor from the
four-year-old Droid X which doesn't do
performance any favors it runs
reasonably smooth for the most part but
some animations could be a bit choppy
and battery life would likely be quite a
bit better with a more modern SOC
another auto mission is any kind of
speaker when you get a notification the
360 vibrates softly on your wrist which
is great but it would be nice to have
the option to have some audio for $250
the big question is is the Moto 360
worth it for me the biggest advantage
was how much less often I have to check
my phone being able to triage
notifications right from my wrist is a
huge plus and the looks are also a big
part of the appeal everyone I've shown
the 360 to is love the look and being
able to have all of my Google now cards
at a glance is surprisingly useful even
though I've never really worn watches
the 360 has me convinced Motorola really
has something special here so what do
you guys think would you ever pick up a
moto 360 definitely be sure to let me
