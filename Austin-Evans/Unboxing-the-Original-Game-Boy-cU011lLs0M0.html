here with a really fun one this is an
original 1989 Nintendo Gameboy not a
smartphone oh no this is the old-school
the original portable handheld if you
hadn't noticed I am a giant fan of Game
Boys and nothing gets me more excited
then what's been something that's been
literally sitting in the box for 27
years first of all this box is an
incredible condition so we've got
official gameboy compact video game
system in case you were looking for the
unofficial Gameboy the Gameboy system
features a complete library of exclusive
Nintendo game packs we've got Super
Mario Land baseball and tennis and
recall ever playing baseball or tennis
on the Gameboy that sounds exciting
popular accessories a hip touch because
you know you want a fanny pack for your
Gameboy nothing says 1989 like keeping
your Gameboy and a fanny pack all right
we've got some styrofoam which again
looks really nice for something that's
been sitting in the box for over 20
years hey this is no joke though like
unbelievably well preserved we have a
custom 8-bit CMOS CPU in 2 X 64 kilobits
static RAM cutting edge right there
comes with a link cable there weren't
actually a ton of Game Boy games that
took advantage of this and of course for
me Pokemon was the big one and there it
is
so unlike the fancy new systems of today
which come with this cool new invention
called rechargeable batteries the
original Gameboy was rocking for
doublea's up front we have what is the
most important part of the Gameboy the
kind of terrible screen so this was
before you had a backlit screen on
Nintendo handhelds so first of all
you're completely reliant on like trying
to find that one little bit of light
from the window to be able to actually
see what you were doing and on top of
that it's entirely green something you
definitely don't get on with modern
gaming on smartphones are these just
incredible controls like the actual
feedback you get from them I mean sure
they're a little bit rubbery they're a
little bit springy but like just that
feel mmm can't beat it
whose coolest part of this cutting-edge
1989 technology is it it has something
that even some of the latest hottest
most expensive new gadgets don't have a
headphone jack we also have Tetris
itself Wow oh I feel like I'm like a spa
top know what kind of game is this
this is called the original office right
so okay 10 out of 10 would not forget
going back now that's time for something
a little bit more my speed
Pokemon
it's crazy no matter how many times I
play with the original Gameboy there's
something special about this and of
course I know a lot of it's the
nostalgia talking but the idea of being
able to have a portable system that was
yours
right like when I was a kid I didn't
have my own game system I had to share
it right but this was my thing so it for
product information service repair
please call 1-800 to 55 3700 hi
thank you for calling Nintendo let's
connect you to a specialist quickly yeah
that's it yeah I can't get on Netflix it
it's just Wi-Fi is not working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
