a video on the new Google project ara
are you ready for a modular smartphone
today in Mountain View Google gave us
our first close look at project ara the
general idea is to bring all the great
customizations that a PC has to smart
phones if you were to imagine a
smartphone for the next 5 billion people
what would it look like it would be
inexpensive would be easy to use some of
the things ro will allow you to do is
completely change the parts on the phone
to suit you let's say I'm going on a
trip I could plug in a small camera and
a big battery once I get home I can then
put my bigger camera back in or even a
different screen the way it works is
you'll buy an endo essentially the
skeleton of the phone it comes in three
sizes small medium and large and allows
you to slide in all the parts you want
to create your phone the way it works is
that you have this interface standard
and C capacitive means it's just touch
there's no locking mechanism gotcha um
and you have the data and power that
goes new back so it's like kind of like
how a wireless phone would charge sure
talked about a what they call the gray
phone which is you know essentially a
$50 device is probably to be a little
bit more after will see yeah like
they're they're probably gonna make a
little bit of money off of this but it
was essentially the Bill of Materials is
$50 and it's essentially just just the
bare Mitch's on bare right that's enough
to find a Wi-Fi hotspot to run the RF
configurator able to upgrade the device
and figure that device functioning
and one of the things they were talking
about is they don't want this to last a
year two years they want this last five
six years I'm smoking you can completely
change out every single part on the
phone a couple times yeah well the life
cycle not really have to worry about it
I think that's really cool to actually
be able to just say okay you know what
bigger battery done right and here's the
thing about the battery is that it's all
hot swap battle the phone is on look at
your android screen and yes you can't
take this play off or the processor out
but the battery you can suite right you
would turn off yeah while it's running
you can actually remove your battery put
in a new battery or remove the camera
and put in a Wi-Fi unit or a fingerprint
sensor as anything else while running so
what do you guys think of project ara
let me know in the comments below also
huge thanks to Brad from Engadget and
norm flew tested for sitting down and
talking with me a little bit you guys
