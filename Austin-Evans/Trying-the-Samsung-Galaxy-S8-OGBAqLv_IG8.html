in New York City for the launch of the
Samsung Galaxy s8 the first thing that
jumps out to me is the display so since
I already had a curved edge on the s6 as
well V at 7 but here with the s8 they
really pared down the top and bottom of
the bezel on the bottom instead of
having standard physical keys with a
fingerprint sensor instead you know I'll
have Android soft keys and that's not
exactly anything new most Android phones
have already been doing this for quite a
while what is kind of interesting is
that the home button actually has some
tactic feedback so when you press it you
actually feel the phone vibrate a little
bit like force touch up top everything
has been crammed into the tiny bezel so
now I do have an upgraded front-facing
camera but you also have all the sensors
up here including the new iris scanner
now this was originally launched with
the galaxy note 7 and we all know how
well that went but it is a nice
additional feature to be able to use not
only iris scanning but as well as facial
recognition to be able to unlock your
phone it's not going to be a secure
something like a password or fingerprint
but it is an option with those smaller
bezels though comes a very weirdly
shaped screen so the resolution is 29 65
1440 and what that means is the screen
is very very tall much more so than a
traditional smartphone so in most apps
it's not a big deal
for example when you're watching a
YouTube video all you'll see is just a
few black bars on the left and right but
I think some apps are still going to
need to be updated to support this sort
of weird screen resolution and we've
seen the same issue with the LG G 6 but
when you're holding in the hand it does
give you extra screen real estate the
screens are the big difference between
the s8 and the s8 plus so the standard
model has a five-point aged display
where the plus bumps that up to 6.2 now
these are huge displays but because they
have such small bezels the phones
themselves are actually not that bad so
for example while the s8 is a little bit
bigger than something like an iPhone 7
the plus is almost the exact same size
as the iPhone 7 plus a little bit taller
not quite so wide considering that
you're getting a much larger display it
actually looks pretty good the screens
themselves look great and you have some
cool features like HDR support but the
real star of the show here is absolutely
how big of a screen they were able to
fit in such a small phone take a look
around the rest of the galaxy s 8 and
you'll see it kind of looks a lot like
the s7 some of the big changes is that
the fingerprint sensor has been moved to
the back of the phone now this is not
exactly a bad idea I especially like
poems like the pixel which put it right
in the middle
but because the s8 puts it right beside
the camera it's a little bit awkward to
get to now
a big deal but expect a lot of
fingerprints on your camera vision Yelp
cameras the Galaxy s8 has the exact same
one from the f7 now it's not a huge
disappointment as the s7 had one of
these best cameras when it came out last
year but that was last year and this
year there were phones like the iPhone
and pixel which absolutely compete with
it to be very Samsung does have some
interesting things going on with
software this year so for example is
constantly taking multiple shots and
sort of merging them to create a better
shot like the pixel does but the fact
remains that this is not going to be a
huge camera upgrade and we just got
kicked out because we were telling faz
when the event was over but no big deal
because there's more to talk about with
the Galaxy s8 one of the big
announcements was Bixby now this is a
virtual assistant very similar to
something like Siri or Cortana or
especially Google assistant what it will
do is the standard voice stuff for
searching that's a list of cards for all
the different activities you have
throughout the day what's a little more
interesting is it has a dedicated Bigsby
button which will pull up all of that
stuff but you can also use the camera to
scan things of course like the infamous
hugely popular Amazon fire phone you can
use this to scan products and buy them
in real time because you know that
worked out really well last time also
I'm kind of salty that they kick this
out something a little bit more
interesting as decks now this is similar
to the Windows Phone continuum feature
and that if you drop the Galaxy s8 on a
dock and connect mouse keyboard and
monitor it turns into a computer sort of
this essentially is running Android apps
and a window desktop so you can think of
it as sort of a weird hybrid I guess I
mean sure it's going to be nice to say
edit a PowerPoint on a display with a
mouse and keyboard versus on your phone
but I'm curious to see how many apps are
actually really going to take advantage
of a bigger screen or even going to be
useful they're powering the galaxy s 8
is either a Snapdragon 835 or Samsung
Exynos octa-core processor what's
interesting about these is they're both
based on the brand new 10 nanometer
process and Samsung love talking about
this on stage essentially what it means
is that the chips are going to be
smaller and either provide more
performance which they do by like 10 to
20 percent but more importantly they're
going to help save battery and that's
important after the disaster that was
the note 7 with its exploding batteries
since link definitely was a little bit
conservative this year so the s7 has a
3000 milliamp hour battery and the plus
has 3500 now that's about what you would
find on the s7 but the difference is the
new phones have much larger displays so
yes that processor should be
power-efficient those displays are
definite going to suck up a lot of Jews
so we'll see how battery life actually
stacks up thankfully we have a lot of
good features in the galaxy s7 so
there's still water resistance with ip68
certification so if you want to go
swimming with your Galaxy s8 you can it
also still has both a USB C as well as a
headphone jack
which is awesome because you know why
wouldn't you not have that on a
smartphone in 2017 the Galaxy s8 will be
available for pre-order starting
tomorrow and it'll be on sale on April
21st in the US so I'm curious what do
you guys think about the Galaxy s8 for
me I think would be nice if it had a
better camera and some less gimmicky
features but that design really does go
a long way don't be sure to let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
