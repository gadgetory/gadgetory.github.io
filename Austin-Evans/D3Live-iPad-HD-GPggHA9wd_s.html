episode of d3 live so today would be
talking about some of the rooms we've
been hearing about the ipad HD now this
is going to be something entirely
different from what we're expecting to
see in the ipad 3 and definitely lines
up with a lot of the talk and rumors and
all that kinda stuff what we've been
hearing so here's the way it goes
supposedly here in september-october
some point somewhere towards the end of
the year we are going to be seeing a new
variant of the iPad so of course the
ieee standard ipad 2 it's not going to
be replacing it's going to be in
addition so of course like a different
versions of the macbook the macbook air
macbook pro cetera et cetera you're
going to be different versions of the
ipad so what this ipad HD is going to be
all about is more of a professional ipad
so of course the current ipad 2 it's
great there's a lot to like about it but
it's definitely aimed at consumers as
opposed to professionals and of course
with a touchscreen with a lot of power
all that kind stuff there's some really
cool things you can do with it including
video editing photo editing audio on the
list goes on and on on but there's a lot
of really cool things you can do with it
and that's what really the ipad HD is
aiming for so what the major thing about
the ipad HD is you probably could guess
from the name is that it's going to have
a new high-definition screen with
roughly the double rebel solution at the
ipad 2 Sofia 2048 x 1536 display which
is going to be super super high
resolution on you and just a 9.7 inch
tablet or whatever it's the exact size
of it I would imagine it's going to be
about the same size it's going to be a
very very high resolution display now
some of the other things let me surprise
it's going to be thicker the ipad 2 is
super super thin so this is going to be
more of a professionally oriented
tablets not going to be so much for
consumers who you want super through it
and all that kind of stuff let me
surprise with a little bit bulkier
perhaps a little bit more durable i
don't think it's going to be ugly it's
going to be something really hideous
looking or anything like that but
another thing that they're going to try
to bulk it up and make it a little bit
more towards the professionals also as
far as the internal specs go would be
surprised if it does ship with probably
32 and 64 gigabytes of capacity 16
gigabytes FML i think that's a little me
a little bit low in considering it's
going to be more of a high-end device
and also when we surprised if it gets a
little bit faster of us cpu now it may
still have the Apple a5 but it wouldn't
be surprised me concerning it's going to
be more of a professionally oriented
tablet that will probably have something
more
like 1.2 1.5 or something like that I'm
not getting away from that inward of the
software i do expect it will still run
iOS 4.3 so I don't really see foresee
any major changes I think everything
will work pretty much the same as it
does on the ipad 2 however one of the
biggest things is that some of the apps
that should be coming over now the ipad
2 currently has sort of really nice apps
including iMovie and GarageBand and you
can do a lot of work on those however I
think that they're going to bump it up a
notch by perhaps bringing some more
professional oriented applications over
such as Final Cut Pro 10 final cut if
you've ever seen it on the mac it
definitely looks like you could bring
those the ipad 2 with minimal fuss i'm
also perhaps something like aperture
yeah there's quite a few of the Apple
products you more oriented towards
professionals that they could bring over
to the ipad 2 and really make the ipad
the ipad h2 more of a big thing for
professionals anyway for the second time
you've d3 live over taking live
questions from everyone in the chat as
always every episode of d3 life is
filmed in front of a live audience we've
got quite a few people in the room right
now so let's just take a couple of
questions a flash support in it
definitely not I think that you know the
current suite of Apple devices are
definitely capable flesh but apple and
adobe they're just never going to see
eye to eye in my opinion so no I don't
think we will ever see flash on an Apple
device at least not anytime soon
whatsoever will there be fully
functional versions of Adobe products
like a photoshop or after effects I know
that kind of comes around to the flash I
think Apple at Adobe still aren't seeing
eye-to-eye helper with this ipad HD I
think that's definitely something that
they're looking for I think that if they
were able to get something like your
photoshop or after effects or indeed any
of the major Adobe product I think that
would be a big boon to the ipad HD I
think that's really what they're aiming
for they want to get people who are
looking for like a laptop like some
really high end laptop when you know
core i7 all that kind of stuff to do you
know design working that kind of stuff
they want to try to get sell you instead
hey look this is an iPad it's got a
touchscreen really high resolution all
that kind of stuff which there's
definitely a lot to be said about being
able to touch your projects and you know
trim and all that kind of stuff with
your fingers as opposed to using a mouse
keyboard or even watch a trackpad
faster cpu yeah like I was saying
earlier I wouldn't be surprised if they
bump it up they may just leave it the 85
certainly isn't that bad but since these
are going to be some really professional
applications like Final Cut everything
and that aren't sure how a 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor is going to handle
that so I wouldn't be surprised as I do
bumped up to 1.2 1.5 or who knows but
yeah I wouldn't be surprised they do
that I will still run iOS Mac OS or some
beefed up version of iOS personally I
think it's just gonna be iOS I mean they
could make some changes but I think what
a lot of the ipad HD is going to be
about is just the absolute it runs I
don't think it's gonna be so much about
you know overhauling it or making this
brand new experience because it's not i
think it's just going to be the ipad
with you know hopefully more power in
your better screen that kind of stuff
and have the apps the professionals want
so in my opinion i think is going to be
the exact same as iOS i don't think it's
going to be any kind of crazy things
indeed i think oh one of the coming back
to the rumors about it we saw like oh
unless they likely in the blaster we saw
like there was an iBooks update actually
had graphics for a screen like the ipad
HD so i think a lot of these things kind
of come together and that's why I think
the ipad HD makes a lot of sense what
will the camera resolution and pricing
be well as far as the camera resolution
actually I'm actually not helps ensure
people coming cameras come with cameras
rather because this is not going to be a
consumer-oriented device it's not going
to be like you know just like the mac
pro most people are never going to want
to buy one of those but I don't want to
see if they actually have to put cameras
on there if they do I'm sure they'll
probably be pretty much the standard
things from the ipad 2 I don't really
see them stepping that they're on as far
as the pricing goes I would not be
surprised this is going to be much much
more stupid than the ipad to us of
course in the ipad 2 starts to about
five hundred dollars and if Apple really
is going with this ipad HD they're
really aiming for that really expensive
market where you people paying you know
1,500 2,000 dollars for some laptop
maybe me like a macbook pro let me
spread they put this somewhere around a
thousand dollars or so anyway guys
