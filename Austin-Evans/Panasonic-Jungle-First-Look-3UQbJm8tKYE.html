first look at the Panasonic jungle so
the jungle looks to be Panasonic's entry
into the handheld gaming console market
now of course do you I'm going to go
ahead my gaming console that's handheld
today you're probably either going to
buy a PSP or a DS and perhaps an iPhone
or an iPod Touch but mostly those two
however panasonic is coming into the
market in a very big way with an advice
called jungle I met this jumbo is
actually going to be very different from
what you might find in one of its
competitors in that it is really going
to be focused on more like MMORPGs and
more hardcore online games now to help
with this has a lot of really unique and
interesting features so the first is a
full QWERTY keyboard so this is going to
be you know obviously that's gonna have
all of your things it's going to have
directional buttons as well as a
touchpad so you're going to go ahead and
be able to fully control you know very
well unlike you know a lot of other
devices I in addition to that he will
have a full folding screen with a very
high resolution screen so I'm safe some
people kind of pygmy at almost a 720p
screen which i think would be kind of
ridiculous and a device is small some
other features alright we'll have a few
other buttons as you know sort of more
standard console buttons I'm sure like
shoulder buttons things like that
although we don't have an exact full
picture or anything at that of the final
design now what's really going to be
unique about the jump and it's like I
was saying earlier it's really going to
be focused on the online aspect now this
is something there obviously you can
play online games on the PSP or the DS
however there's not a real focus there
so you know if you're going to want to
play something like World of Warcraft or
whatever you're gonna want to play it
and obviously play it on your computer
however with the jumble it looks like
it's really going to be targeting that
market so allowing me to play your
favorite games such as World of Warcraft
on a mobile device pretty much anywhere
and this would definitely be helped if
it did have 3G which is a variant
possibility so guy said guys we don't
have a whole information on the jungler
right now I will have you go ahead and
take a look in the description there
will be a page they do have a small page
not really saying a whole lot about it
however I would definitely look for more
Meishan coming in the coming weeks days
months have wherever it's gonna come so
guys absolutely let me know in the
comment section below what do you think
are you does this looks like something
you'd be interested in personally I'm
all for more video game handheld
consoles I think that the you know
there's more room for than just Sony and
Nintendo I think that there's definitely
room especially for something like this
but we'll be targeting an entirely
different audience so again guys
definitely be sure to leave your
thoughts and opinions in the comments
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
