inside tech today we have quite a few
things to go through we have a new phone
from Motorola which looks just a little
bit like a fun we've seen in the past we
have the zune HD can now play gameboy
games which is awesome and we also have
a locked-down release dating from
project natal xbox 360 we're going to go
over all this and more anyway let's get
this one started
okay let's begin with motorola's newest
phone the flip out as be honest I'm not
so sure about this one now it's a pretty
unique form factor I'm sitting on one
phone before but we'll get to that in a
second it's a pretty neat form factor
whereas it's a square thanks then it
flips out to reveal a pretty large
keyboard behind it now if you guys know
we've already seen this form factor in
the nokia twist or otherwise known as a
7705 but this one looks like then take
it up a notch whereas that one was
closer to a feature phone this is closer
to you know a full smartphone so the
specs are is this we're going to be
running android 2.1 with motoblur it's
going to have a 2.8 inch display of
course a full keyboard with the 700
megahertz processor and 256 megabytes of
RAM now guys I'm not so sure about this
one the square form factor just kind of
a little bit odd to me and especially
because it's a pretty much looks like an
exact clone of the Nokia but would you
have to wait and see what looks like now
it gets good special if you like game
Microsoft is just announced that project
natal xbox 360 the full motion control
where you can actually you know instead
of using a control against you like you
know touched up and everything well that
is going to be coming out October this
year now the exec gates not out yet
they're going they said that they will
announce that at e3 this year but
personally I'm excited they will be
coming out this year and I think natal
is pretty promising i like the lot so
this is pretty good news now some good
news if you own a zune HD our gameboy
emulator has been ported over called
visual boy zoom which is just a port
from the normal visual boy advance on
guys this is really early saves aren't
really working right now a lot of stuff
isn't 100-percent up to spec especially
the fact that it does not play Game Boy
Advance games right now that's going to
take a whole lot more work to get it all
set up but you can download it right now
the description so you might want go to
check it out if you have the zune HD if
you follow tablets you might want take a
look at this new list entries is the msi
slatebook and it's for window 7 slate
there's not a whole lot special about it
it is a 10-inch atom tablet running
windows set um you know I'm not feeling
too excited about this to be honest if
we have Marta Singh this an HP Slate and
it looks like that might have gotten
cancelled so i'm not really sure about
the future of windows seven tablets I've
said this a million times before I'll
say it again windows seven is still
primarily made for using your keyboard
in your mouth porsche it there you can
know you can use touch somewhat they've
improved a son but I don't know guys I
used to think that when did something
will be awesome for a tablet but I don't
know the more I think about it ah see
all these with their game canceled I
don't know and that's it this episode
