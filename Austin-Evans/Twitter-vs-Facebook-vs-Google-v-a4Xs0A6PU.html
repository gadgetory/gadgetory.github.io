is Austin and I'm Amy and she's stealing
my intro cuz that's what she's been
doing all day anyway today we're here at
VidCon
and we decided since we're here we might
as well film some videos and one of your
specialties is social media so we were
going to talk a little bit about Twitter
versus Facebook versus Google+
I feel like Twitter you're more likely
to see a variety of information because
it's not an algorithm at work for you
there's a discover tab where it's kind
of tailoring information where you will
definitely see some different things in
it that's being coordinated for you but
Twitter is 100 percent chronological so
you can subscribe to things there and
you're going to get a very quick
synopsis of what you're going to get if
you click somewhere or just to find out
more information so what do you do
Google Plus because Google+ is a lot
more like Facebook than it is Twitter so
do you think Google+ is worth you know
investing your time okay you guys you
know what Facebook I think anymore we
can go to Google+ what wait what do you
think I would say that Google+ is like
Facebook first when you look at it
because it's the the the newsfeed it all
seems very similar but in all actuality
it actually is a lot more like Twitter
because it really tries to get all the
content front of you if you think about
it if somebody comments on your stuff as
soon as something's commented it moves
right back up because they're constantly
trying to put this stuff in your face
because it's the most paid attention to
at that point I feel like Google+ right
now is really heavily oriented towards
people who are like big into Android
people are big into you know Google
YouTube whatever because it's it works
so well because they've got everything
like you use Android you can see like +1
but everywhere you're gonna be it's just
it's just really focused on you know
trying to get you over there and that's
like when I use Android I'm sorry when I
use Google+ like you're saying you got
to use them differently I actually on
Google+ I post a lot of stuff about
Google stuff and Android stuff because I
know that that's what people care about
and you're right everyone has a Google+
pretty much but the difference is not
everyone uses right Plus right so it's
like do you want to go you got all these
friends on Facebook do you really want
to go and move them over to Google+ your
hard to get people to move there's so
many problems there's so many problems
with Facebook there's people every
single time they change in their turn
the boy
the ultimate change would be leaving and
no one wants do that because no one know
Gala's they know it there are lots of
people on Google+ and you know what
there are a lot to go places on Google+
I mean ya know you can't say there's no
one on Google+ yeah it's just a matter
of what is your priority if your
priority is connecting with people you
already know you have to go to where
they already are exactly that's it I
mean I feel like everyone's on Facebook
a good amount of people on Twitter and a
decent amount of people on Google+ but
there are very specific types of very
specific yeah it's I don't personally
for me though Twitter all the way I love
Twitter I use Facebook Google+ um but
just for me I love that Twitter is it's
super direct and plus one thing that I
think that a lot of people kind of
discredit because I remember remember
when Twitter was first coming out people
will complain like 140 characters that's
not enough but you need like 200 but
that's one of the beauties of Twitter
because you've got to keep it short you
can't do these long rambling things you
keep it short absolutely the point it's
I love that the the fact of the matter
is you shouldn't be over a hundred forty
characters on any social network nobody
reads so like I said with the videos
with anything post a picture everything
on Facebook should be a picture there's
a caption for a reason you can put any
text you want there nobody's reading it
if they see a picture that grabs their
eye and this is this is sort of a
Marting marketing perspective that I'm
speaking from but even for an average
user if you really want somebody to
respond to what you're saying it should
be a picture it's really gonna grab
attention on the feed and people don't
read more than the first couple of
sentences if you write your life story
on yes you're probably not being
followed I'm using Google+ more though
I've got Sam actually a Google+ for me
is approaching Twitter I have mad
respect for Google+ I so much so I want
to use it more often
first I mean if you want Google to like
you use its products right if you wanted
to push credit you know people to your
YouTube channel or whatever that is if
you want a Google product to do well
then use their Google social network um
this laughter but but also the thing is
because they are super users you really
have to give them the time of day you
can't just be promoting your it's
different like we're saying earlier the
audience is just very different so you
can't just like say oh this Facebook
Twitter like especially like a lot of
people like have like automatic sharing
and stuff like I'll just I have a
Google+ and it does everything from
Facebook but it's just it's just
different you can't treat everything the
same way but overall what is your so
what is your number one
still Twitter my number one social
network aside from YouTube of course
because it is it counts it bounced it
totally counts YouTube is an incredibly
social network I mean the most loyal of
anyone but Twitter is where I go to
spill my life all the time no matter
what it is so if you guys are just maybe
on Facebook or maybe you're not even
Milly into anything I think Twitter is
definitely something you should give a
shot it's not the same thing and I think
a lot of people are totally fine having
a Facebook and a Twitter or Facebook and
Google Plus or Twitter and yeah yeah
they're all different they all have
their different things but basically the
gist of this entire video is join
MySpace today next big thing if you're
not on myspace you're totally gonna be
like left in 2000 where yeah basically
this interpret just ignore it just go
join MySpace
it's it's cool it's hip it's a it it's
the other thing the thing exactly anyway
if you guys want to follow us on social
media because we totally didn't plan
this or anything like it's not plug but

want to follow Amy we actually have
never done a video before well no we did
