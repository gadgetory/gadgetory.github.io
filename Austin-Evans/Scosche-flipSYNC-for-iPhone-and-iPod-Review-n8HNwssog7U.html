of the scosche flip sink for the iphone
and ipod touch now this is a really cool
little product that was given out for
free to review at CES as it is a fully
in just this little tiny package it's a
fully functioning charge and sync cable
for your iphone or your ipod touch now
it's a mate where you go ahead and put
it on your perhaps your key change
something like that is you have a little
hole here you know you can attach it to
whatever you like let me just show you
how it works so by just pulling apart
this you will actually see that we have
a fully functioning 30-pin dock
connector go ahead and plug it into like
I said your iphone or your ipod and if
we go ahead and pull it out on this end
we have a USB in where you can go ahead
and plug it into the computer so this is
pretty much the product right here it's
very small it's very very simple however
is the simplest thing i can say is that
it works of course let me go and just
give you guys a little demo here plug it
into my ipod touch and 30-pin dock
connector is just you know what you
expect from any dock connector although
i'm having a little trouble singer there
we go so you know you plug it in and
then with this end you go ahead and plug
it into your the USB port on your
computer now i do want to mention
something this USB is not you know the
standard USB port that you would expect
you know it's a little bit thicker and
it won't fit necessarily in all
computers and i do want to say this now
i haven't had this problem personally I
it fits into all USB ports on all my
computers no issue however some people
have said that it doesn't quite fit
properly so it is something I do and let
you guys know about to keep in mind
another thing is is that the court is
kind of small now i do want to do i mean
keeping in mind how tiny this is there's
not a whole lot of you know it's it's
not really a big surprise however this
is about the length of the court you
know you have to have it into your
computer you have to have into your ipod
or iphone so you know it's going to
depend on whether you happy you know
like a laptop that has really nicely
convenient USB ports me perhaps if you
have a desktop that you know that you
know the USB ports halfway up Jesse
you're gonna have your ipod iphone
dangling down but overall it really
shouldn't be an issue you should be able
to find a decent USB port that well you
know will work with it so anyway guys
that's about it for my review you know
this is a very simple product and I like
it quite a bit in fact I've actually
been using it a few days ever since I
got back from CES I couldn't find my
standard charging cable so
I've been using this solely for my eye
for sinking everything with my ipod
touch it's work just fine you know
issues of speed or anything like that
I'm sorry guys if you were interested in
going ahead and purchasing one of these
for yourself you can either about 15
sometimes you can find him as low as $13
by shopping around but overall they're
not too expensive and I really have
found that it's pretty useful to have
something this small you can just toss
in a pocket or whatever and at any time
you can go ahead and pull out your iPod
or your iPhone and sync it with you know
and charge it and have no issues at all
so if you're interested again I do
recommend it it's pretty cool it's not
perfect you know you'll have to learn
that there's a specific way to you can't
just pull out the you know just pull it
apart you have to actually pull this
part out and then kind of pulled the USB
out and the same way you have to put it
back in the same way so I mean it's not
a perfect solution but I think it's a
really cool little product little
accessory that where you can have your
cable anywhere you go in addition to
that I do want to mention this is for
the gist specifically for the ipod and
the iphone you can go ahead and buy a
version that has instead of the 30-pin
dock connector at the end both a mini
and micro USB so if you have another
phone or something like that that's you
know not depending are not knife on an
ipod that uses micro or mini USB to
charge and sync then you can go ahead
and pick up that as a version which i'm
sure works very very similarly anyway
guys thanks for watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
