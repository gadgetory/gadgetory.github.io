using the front-facing camera on the
iPhone 4s so as far as I know this
camera is identical to the camera on the
iPod Touch 4th generation the iPad 2 as
well as the iPhone 4 or speaking of the
front-facing camera but yet so I figured
I can give it a shot and see what you
guys think about the quality so as you
might have guessed I am inside right now
no obviously it's going to be a lot
quieter if you guys want to hear what
the audio quality is like outside you
certainly can check out my 1080p video
test where I tested the back facing
camera but yes let's go ahead and get a
slow shut mr. dog do you have anything
to say you want to want to test out this
front-facing camera or do we enjoyed
that woke you up from your nap yeah it's
what I thought uh so yeah it's gonna be
about it guys
of course I'm kind of covered about all
it's only VGA so it's not gonna be
particularly amazing what's really made
for is you know just using it for video
calls FaceTime that kind of stuff and
what I just realized my hair's on that
stuff I've done like 10 videos today
leave me alone
guys so that is going to be it for my
front-facing camera test of the iPhone
4s</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
