here with an unboxing of the new iPad 4
with new more powerful internals and the
Lightning port it looks good on paper so
we hit that like button and let's take a
look first things first we've got the
classic Apple packaging which contains a
blank 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only iPad 4 the
protective plastic wrap has made quick
work of so with a quick pop of the lid
we're in business in true unboxing
fashion we're going to set the iPad
aside for one minute while we take a
look at the accessories first off we
have a bit of paperwork which contains a
Quick Start Guide the safety info and
the most important thing of all the
Apple stickers
don't deny it these are the whole reason
you're watching this video you'll also
find the new 12 watt USB charger which
looks just like the old one but will now
charge your iPad faster which is
definitely appreciated also included is
a lightning cable which you can use to
charge in sync and replaces the outgoing
30 pin connector with that out of the
way we have the brand new iPad 4 ready
to go from the front that looks nearly
identical to the previous iPad with the
same nine point seven inch Retina
display in fairly large bezel however
the front facing camera has now been
upgraded to a FaceTime HD camera capable
of 720p video around back you'll see
things are practically identical with a
smooth aluminum casing and a 5 megapixel
iSight camera capable of 1080p video on
the right is your volume rocker and
silent / rotation law and up top is the
new sleep/wake button microphone and
headphone jack down bottom is your
brand-new Lightning port along with a
single speaker from before physically
the iPad 4 is very similar to the iPad 2
&amp;amp; 3 but the biggest improvement has been
internal which I can't wait to check out
