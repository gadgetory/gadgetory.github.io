with the video going over what I'm going
to be taking with me to CES so if you
guys didn't know i will be going to CES
this year i did go last year but it was
kind of I kind of moved it up this year
I plan on doing a little bit better got
some better gear and all that kind of
stuff so figure while I was packing it
all up making sure everything would fit
I would go ahead make a video for you
guys so the first thing isn't the bag
this is a cot catcha cotta I have no
idea has set up it's a count of 22 bag I
was actually talking to Larry Greenberg
on Twitter the other day he recommended
this I picked it up and have been very
very pleased with it it's a really
well-built bag get lots of neat little
features tons of room all that kind of
stuff so let's go ahead and just open it
up and show you guys it's a really neat
little design because you can wear it as
a backpack which is what I'll probably
be doing but you can also do it like as
a sling and you also have these two
quick release snaps where you can get at
your camera you can put on either side
it's pretty versatile bag i like it like
so couldn't open this up here and the
first thing is going to be my camera so
the camera i'm going to be using this
year is the same as I did last year it
is a nikon d 3100 in fact let me take
the lens hood and put it back on profile
here oh yeah this is going to be my
nikon d 3100 think am I used last year
but i am going to be primarily using the
50 millimeter lens 50 millimeter 1.8
I've also got another lens but I imagine
a lot you'd be using this for the most
part I also do have a battery grip on
here so as you guys can see right here I
have a pair of batteries inside when I'm
on the show floor like six seven eight
hours a day filming video and everything
I mean it's not a huge deal to swap
batteries out but it's nice to just have
them both on the battery I mean both in
the camera so I can film and film and I
have to worry about it as far as memory
card I do have primarily a transcend 16
gig card and I do have another eight gig
card in my bag so that's the camera will
meet this there's a little pouch so if
it's raining or whatever I can cover my
bag up but not a big deal oh just snaps
closed
and stand around to this side where I
have a couple of other things here so
yeah I apologize in advance guys this is
a little bit of a boring video but
thinking something you guys might be
interested so right here is my
microphones is going to be the zoom h1
so what i will do is actually I can it's
a it's not in the carrying pouch so we
got to take the wind screen off but I
guess when I get on the plane everything
I'll do that but kinds of a pair of it
accessories here so if I want I can
screw on this little handle so for
example if I wanted to interview
somebody it could kind of hold it like
that without holding the mic it's kind
of funny but i'll be giving that but for
the most part i will be taking this
which is just a little tripod screw so I
mean just screw on here and basically
that allows me to do is mount it to my
camera and it's all crooked everything
but trying to do some video net but
that's kind of why it's going to be
looking like so I'll be able to have
some good audio along the good video
while in there so kind of toss this all
off to the side and keep going I mean
here we have another lens this is the
the kit lens is just a 18 to 55 it's not
particularly great but i did use it at
the show last year and it's nice for a
couple things it's 18 to 55 a pretty
nice zoom range but has vibration
reduction and because pretty much all my
videos you'll be shot handheld I don't
want to be all shaky and stuff so I'll
probably using a mix between this in the
50 millimeter so there's that anyway
that's enough with this side if I I'm go
ahead and open up the back hook lozol on
hope you guys can see all this right I'm
tell me this with my iphones at all it's
hard to say but in the back I have my
macbook air 11-inch uh you guys have
seen I've done a review on this I
absolutely love my macbook it's a
fantastic one no not quad it is the best
laptop I've ever had fantastic design
pretty much you can't say enough about
it I love it and it fits nicely into
this back pouch so while I'm there I can
keep it with me for example 5 you know
near Wi-Fi or I also have my iphone i'm
saying i mentioned i'm feeling with the
iphone right now but if I need to like
upload videos or whatever
see if I can like use a hot spot or if
not I can just edit and see I can do
with this so I've got everything with me
so I need to film something I can up top
here you got a couple things I mohammadi
will show you guys this but how's it i
can do so up top here we've got a bunch
of stuff i just taking it one by one
we've got thai cables just the power
adapter for the macbook oh we could have
power and the cables and that kind of
stuff got a sum head buds these are just
what i'm going to do is i can plug it in
while i'm at the show for example when i
hook up my zoom h1 just make sure you
get the audio levels right monitor at
that kind of thing 30pin 30-pin dock
connector for charging iphone I've got
battery charger for my camera so I get
home from my back and get back to the
hotel room I can charge my batteries up
it all set up the extension cable for
the macbook if i should get far away
from the power outlets we've got a pen
cares the little USB adapter for the
iphone got a little business cards my
ipod just because it's tiny and there's
no reason to take it and this little
pouch if you guys can see here I'm again
I'm sorry the video quality is kind of
bad but the this bag has so many
departments other rights to see here we
have a micro SD card adapter always good
to have extra those random will the USB
another for good USD I keep these around
just because I don't know I've got some
batteries again extra battery for my
zoom h1 things like last like three or
four months on battery but whatever and
we also have this little emergency
little kit where if I need to I can
charge or sync my iphone pretty little
thing actually got this at CES last year
so that's about it for there and have a
couple more apartments Oh jobs the bag
was massive I'm going to open this up
this is just like random like there's a
cloth and just like random little bits
of stuff body caps that kind of stuff
and over here is more of my important
stuff so I've got a gig SD card always
I'm always super paranoid about like an
SD card breaking
or running out of memory or something
and last thing I do is be over there
with tons of stuff to film and like have
some bad equipment and messed me up
here's a little USB so it just plugs
into my macbook since the 11 inch
doesn't have an SD card slot on either
side this allow me to just via USB to
plug in an SD or microSD so I can handle
the everything from the my camera as
well as the zoom h1 because I'd bring
this back over here zoom h1 takes micro
SD cards so I need to kind of sync the
audio and yeah very exciting very
interesting stuff also do have the body
cat for my camera if I wanted to swap
lenses or take them off whatever reason
and nether micro SD card adapter because
i had laying around anyway guys I think
that's about it she's probably more
stuff in the bag but I've forgotten but
anyway guys I want to go ahead and ask
you a question of course i'll be in
vegas and for CES in a week we can have
don't know exactly when it starts but
i'll be the pretty soon so I want to
know guys what kind of footage and you
know coverage do you guys want to see me
do last year mostly focused on the
phones i did a little bit on the tablets
and that kind of stuff but of course he
yet has so much stuff it's now you funny
mean there's tons of TVs everywhere
there's like i said phones tablets
gaming stuff all cut stuff so i'm really
curious to know what you guys want to
see while i'm there what kind of you
know videos whatever you want to see me
mate because i plan on while on their
filming about as many videos as I
possibly can yeah that's definitely sure
to leave me some comments and stuff let
me know what you think and of course if
you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up for this and as always guys I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
