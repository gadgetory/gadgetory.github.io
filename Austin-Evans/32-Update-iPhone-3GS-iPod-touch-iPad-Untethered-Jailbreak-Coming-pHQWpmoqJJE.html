and today I'm here with some updates now
a fewer jailbreaker with your eyes your
iPhone or iPod Touch you'll definitely
want to pay attention because we've got
some news that should be really really
good as well as some pretty good news on
a possible ikg oh great so we've got two
things both of them need a remote
connection but both of them could end up
being really cool jailbreaks so all of
you guys through everything we know
everything to expect talking and stuff
anyway let's get this one started
okay guys so let's begin with what I
touched on on my previous video which is
a exploit and mobile safari in both the
iPhone and iPod touch
basically they used it as an SMS bug but
now we're learning a little bit more
about it and it turns out that actually
is just a hole in Safari in general and
they just chose to go after the SMS but
absolutely could be used as a jailbreak
for both the iPhone and iPod Touch this
is really good news I'm not too sure how
useful it's going to be and do you now
of course if you're interested in
learning more about this check out the
annotation on the screen I will have
what you can check out my previous video
where I go over all the pros and cons
and everything we know but you have to
do it in short looks like as long as you
don't actually update your iPod or
iPhone because three point one point for
firmware will definitely be coming out
from Apple you know within I would say a
week maybe two weeks in they're gonna
they're not gonna wait around for this
so new firmware we're going is going to
be coming out do not update on it if you
are a Jill if you plan on jailbreaking
because there could be an extremely
simple jailbreak just go to a website
and it'll do the whole thing for you so
guys I just want to let you know just be
careful about dating as always because
this could be a really promising
jailbreak coming soon okay
so the next thing doesn't going to be
covering is a very promising new
jailbreak from jeolla-do whoo jihad is
he
basically one of the main jailbreak
verse that's work
he's one most main jailbreakers he
originally unlocked the iphone he came
out with black rain and black snow
recently which for three point one point
two well it looks like he's done it
again
I would have a link to watch his video
but basically he shows where he is an
untethered jailbreak on a
third-generation iPod touch that's
really cool because of course if you had
a late model of second generation third
generation or third generation iPod
Touch as well as a iPhone 3GS with the
new bootrom you could not jailbreak or
you rather it was you know you had to
deal with a lot of stuff with between
3.1.3 and unlocking and all kinds of
stuff it was a mess well it looks like
he's go ahead and has a full untethered
jailbreak and apparently it's going to
be very simple all he says this is going
to be basically just like Black Rain so
we're definitely looking forward to that
so again no updates are because either
these updates
I mean jailbreaks could definitely help
you out but lastly and this is probably
the most important things is that jihad
says that his untethered jailbreak it
also looks like it may be able to work
on the iPad now I had a video a little
while back again check out the link for
the iPad you already talking about that
so now that looks like we have a pretty
good idea that jihad to jailbreak work
we don't know for sure yet but it's
likely that's going to use the same sort
of part sort of thing so that's
definitely really really good news
anyway guys basically just hang tight
don't update don't do anything on your
iPhone or iPod Touches or your iPads
here for too long but we have a lot of
really cool jailbreaks coming there me
easy simple and hopefully really help
everybody out anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
