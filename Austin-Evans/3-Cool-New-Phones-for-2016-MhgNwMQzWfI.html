Mobile World Congress this year is the
Samsung Galaxy s7 at first glance it
looks very similar to the last model but
there are a few major improvements this
time around we've got two very different
models the standard galaxy has seven
with a 5.1 inch screen and the s7 edge
that comes with a bigger 5.5 inch curved
display both are sporting a slight taper
around back like the note 5 and paired
with the aluminum and glass build it's
undoubtedly one of the most premium
looking phones out there samsung also
brought back a couple highly requested
features including a micro SD card slot
and the return of waterproofing this is
a big one the galaxy s7 can be submerged
in a meter and a half of water for 30
minutes and thankfully there aren't any
annoying flaps over the port's inside
it's no slouch with the brand new
Snapdragon 820 4 gigabytes of RAM and
much bigger batteries which should help
deliver the longevity the last channel
act it's also rocking a new 12 megapixel
camera it gives up a bit of detail for a
wider lens and bigger pixels which
should help massively in low-light one
of the biggest surprises at nwc is the
LG g5 it's rocking a new aluminum build
that feels a lot nicer than the g4 it's
surprisingly light and with a smaller
5.3 inch screen if it's really nicely in
the hand the design is a massive
improvement and only does it look great
but this might be one of the most
comfortable phones I've ever used
instead of rear buttons we've got a
fingerprint sensor that doubles as the
power button while the display might not
be AMOLED it still looks fantastic with
a 1440p resolution and it gets seriously
bright paired with Android 6.0 and LG's
skin still a bit too far from stock
Android for my taste but it's totally
usable look around back and you'll find
something a little different to cameras
it as a normal 16 megapixel sensor is
paired with a wide-angle camera to give
you two totally different looks for
photos this is a really cool idea that
gives you what's almost as good as
optical zoom without a giant camera on
the back probably the coolest feature is
the removable battery the bottom of the
phone pops off if you need to swap
batteries but you can also add what LG
calls friends these are modules that can
add new features like this Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen headphone amp which promises
hugely improved audio performance
there's also the LG Kamp laws which not
only includes a larger battery but extra
controls and a grip for the camera this
is a really cool idea to expand your
phone without bolting giant accessories
on something I absolutely wasn't
expecting is the HP elite x3 while
Windows Phone has been flatlining lately
clearly no one told HP in
through basically everything at the
elite this is a giant six-inch phone
that's packed with tech like the
Snapdragon 820 from the g4 and s7 and a
monster 40 150 milliamp hour battery it
might not be the nicest looking phone
out there but it has a trick up its
sleeve continuum plug it into the USB C
dock and the elite transforms into a
Windows 10 PC a couple monitor mouse and
keyboard and you're ready to go
unfortunately since its on based you
won't have full Windows 10 to use normal
apps but you still get a browser and
optimized versions of some things like
word this is an early prototype so
performance with a bit sketchy and it's
missing a couple features like a retina
scanner that should be on the final
version but the idea of having one
device that can be both your phone and
computer has a ton of potential so which
was your favorite phone that was
announced at MWC let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
