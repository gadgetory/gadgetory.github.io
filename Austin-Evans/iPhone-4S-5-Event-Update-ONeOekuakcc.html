reminding you all about the iPhone event
tomorrow as well as a couple of updates
about the event so if you guys haven't
heard already there will be an Apple
iPhone event tomorrow now I'm sure you
guys have seen plenty of rumour videos
and heard all that it's not gonna bore
you guys and waste your time with what I
expect but we will see something to do
with the iPhone tomorrow whether it's
the 4s whether it's the 5 whether it's
something we have no idea about there's
also a pretty good chance we may see an
iPod or two maybe a Mac who knows but we
will be seeing it all and it will be
just beginning tomorrow morning so if
you are guys are over on the Pacific
time zone it will be starting at 10
o'clock or if you guys are over on the
East Coast we wanna clock all the rest
of the times I will have in the
description of the video on top of that
I will be covering the event live now
unfold unlike some previous events I'm
not going to be doing any live stream of
it but I will be tweeting it as it
happens so you guys can go ahead and
follow me if you want it is going to be
Duncan 3 through 3 or 3 on Twitter I
usually tweet about all these events
anyway but of course this is a little
bit special since we've been waiting
forever for a new iPhone beyond that
guys I did want to mention one thing I
didn't really think it was worth making
a video about but I figured I'd just
throw it in here since those wanted to
make this update anyway and that is
about the sprint iPhone 5 now if you
guys followed the rumors in the past day
or two you'll probably know that there's
been a lot of talk about oh no there's
no gonna be 5 there's gonna be a 4s just
gonna slightly redesigned however it
doesn't look like that's really the case
well according to a Wall Street Journal
there is going to be an iPhone 5 on
Sprint and Sprint apparently had to pay
a lot of money or do some massive deal
but regardless I do expect that we will
see both the 4s and the 5 tomorrow and
that at least one of them most likely if
I will be available on Sprint which is
good news I'm probably going to be
picking up these iPhone 5 on sprite so
now this guy's again be sure to follow
me on Twitter if you're interested
duncan through 3 303 and I think I've
rambled for long enough so guys just be
sure to stay tuned to the channel I will
course be posting all the updates about
the iPhones and iOS 5 or whatever else
they announce tomorrow so anyway that's
about it I will catch you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
