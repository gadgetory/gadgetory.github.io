overview of all four big ranchers from
five news today so the first which is we
finally have a solid release date of
course it was scheduled to release
earlier this month however they had to
postpone and I guess for some technical
reasons but that's not a big deal
because it looks like we do finally have
a solid release date which is going to
be wednesday November 24 so it's just a
little bit less than two weeks from now
and I'm really looking forward to that
really cuz worried that we're actually
we're not going to see gran turismo 5
until next year but no worries we will
be seeing it here in just a couple of
weeks on the second big news is that
they actually release the full list of
tracks as well as cars and well of
course if you've ever played a Gran
Turismo game I hope you have I'm you'll
know that Gran Turismo is always packed
with content and this one is not going
to be any kind of neo departure from
that so basically there is going to be
1031 cars which is a bit ridiculous but
I think that's just fantastic there's
also going to be 71 tracks and of course
a lot of your favorites from previous
renters no games such as Nurburgring etc
etc are all going to be included in Gran
Turismo 5 so if you want the full list
of both cars and tracks go ahead I will
have a link in the description obviously
I'm not going to go ahead and name off a
thousand cars in the video but yeah you
should be definitely very impressed by
the list of cars and tracks they have a
lot of the really great cars that you
would expect to see so anyway guys I'd
really like to know i'm really
interested what do you think are you
guys looking forward for Gran Turismo 5
so guys definitely let me know in the
comments what you guys are thinking
about Gran Turismo 5 what you you know
if you like what you dislike you know
having to wait in five years for but
whatever so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
