everyone wants a giant tower below their
desk that's where the firm young comes
in with a smaller chassis that still
packs a punch at the heart of the build
is an Intel Core i3 4160 with a pair of
Haswell cores running at 3.6 gigahertz
you've got plenty of power for gaming
and with hyper-threading this works like
a quad-core chip it's also power
efficient which is a big help in working
with a smaller PC alongside the core i3
is an EVGA gtx 750ti as the most
powerful graphics card you can get that
doesn't need external PCI power the
750ti is a solid choice for 1080p gaming
with 2 gigabytes of memory it's also a
smaller card which definitely makes
installing it into our case a lot easier
for the motherboard the fermion is using
an MSI b85 I this is a mini ITX board
that still has all the features we need
like USB 3.0 SATA 3 and nicely laid out
connections making it easy to work with
on the memory side of things we have a
gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix sport
clocked at 1600 megahertz this is a
single dam which leaves room to expand
to 16 gigabytes later on and it's low
profile again making it easy to install
see a trend here with a small and
efficient build like this the crucial px
100 is perfect for storage it's a 250
gigabyte SSD that isn't too much more
expensive than a normal hard drive while
delivering a huge boost in performance
since we're working with an ITX build
we've got a 300 watt silverstone sfx
power supply 300 watts is more than
enough to power the fermion and this is
small enough to easily fit inside our
case while delivering a solid 80 plus
bronze rating the final piece of the
build is the silverstone rvz o1 also
known as the Ravens II this is capable
of packing all of our hardware into a 14
liter case that isn't that much bigger
than a console it's a bit tricky to work
in
however Silverstone provide decent
instructions on putting things together
having a cool-looking gaming PC is nice
but how does the fermion perform load up
grand theft auto 5 and things are
playable on normal settings at 1080p at
49 point 6 frames per second
move over to shadow of Mordor and we can
notch the graphics up the high settings
and we're getting over 44 FPS with Metro
last light Redux we're also able to run
things on high at 1080p at a solid 57
frames per second even under full gaming
load the Fermi on is pretty easy on
power compared to most gaming PC builds
and even the Xbox one and ps4 with
plenty of power for 1080p gaming inside
a compact ITX chassis the fermion is a
solid PC for gaming or even has a steam
box as always I'll have all the links
you need in the description of this
video anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
