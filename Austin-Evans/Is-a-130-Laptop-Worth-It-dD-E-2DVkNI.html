of budget computers but this this is
something a little bit different at $130
is this dell inspiron worth it's at $130
Nili this one of the cheapest brand new
Windows laptops you can find but
impressively it's made by a real company
not some random thing I've never heard
of that's straight off of Amazon no it
makes this kind of interesting is that
not only is it going to be powered by an
AMD processor something a little bit
different for these ultra sort of budget
systems but on top of that it does come
with a full year of office 365 which by
itself is like $100 now when it comes to
spending one hundred and thirty dollars
for a brand-new laptop you should expect
a lot of accessories so of course we do
have the laptop itself here as well as
the power adapter which is really nice
and tiny at $130 this is incredibly
cheap but what we're looking at at least
at first glance is something that
doesn't look all that different from a
lot of the 170 to $200 Windows laptops
out there and one of the big reasons
behind that at least one of the main
differences is that this is going to be
running an AMD processor which is
interesting because Intel basically
gives away the processors at this price
point actually doesn't feel that bad to
be totally honest I mean sure it's going
to be made out of plastic and port wise
there's well two USB ports and a micro
SD card slot with an HDMI so not exactly
full-featured but I mean it doesn't feel
like they cut a lot of corners here look
at that there's also going to be dual
front firing speakers now that they're
going to be particularly large but it
beats having them on the bottom I feel
there's gonna be a catch though there's
gonna be a reason why this was a hundred
and thirty dollars brand new one of the
main competitors for something like the
Inspiron 11 is going to be this the HP
stream now this overall design has been
around for quite a few years it's been
slightly tweaked here and there but this
is going to be different in a few major
ways but the most obvious is going to be
the processor as opposed to being
powered by an Intel Celeron processor
this guy instead is rocking an AMD a 692
20e unlike the seller on this guy is
going to be based on Andy's last
generation APU cores so that means is
that you're going to be getting two
Steamroller cores that start at 1.6
gigahertz I think can boost up to 2.4
gigahertz sometimes and a little bit
more emphasis on the sometimes in a
second but what that means is that you
are going to be getting fairly low
performance as opposed to a much more
expensive computer but in this sort of
sub 200 category it's actually going to
be up
pretty decent step up it does feel like
there's slightly too much performance
for the famous design to handle
sometimes so we're doing intensive tasks
such as Windows Update a lot of times
the bottom and especially the keyboard
will get very warm to the touch that's
not going to be scalding hot or anything
but it does mean that you're going to be
losing some performance thanks to
throttling put it side-by-side with
other similarly priced laptops with
Celeron solutions and you'll see this
actually is going to perform pretty well
now the only real knock against it is
that it only does use single channel
memory but again that's very similar
this sort of price point and thankfully
we do have a full 4 gigabytes of ddr4
onboard one of the biggest issues when
you pick up a super cheap laptop like
this is going to be with the storage
both of these options are all I'm going
to give you 32 gigabytes of emmc flash
that's going to be fine as far as speed
but storage wise it gives you almost
nothing left out of the box but anytime
you actually have to do a major windows
update like I had to do when I first set
this laptop you actually have to use
external storage to get it to work
I had to plug in a USB Drive to even get
this thing fully up to date on Windows
if you pick up a laptop like this it is
basically a necessity to pick up at
least a 64 or 128 gig microSD card and
let it live inside your SD card slots
trust me when I say even though it's
going to add a little bit to the price
is going to make this so much more
usable with radiant graphics onboard
this actually isn't going to be too bad
at least in theory so of course we have
to try everyone's favorite game
fortnight Oh actually you know we don't
just trust me you don't want to play for
a night in this of course when it comes
to spending $130 on a laptop you're
going to have to find some compromises
and one of the biggest ones with the
Inspiron has to do with Wi-Fi now 2018
pretty much everything has an AC
solution typically those are going to be
good for between 100 to 300 megabits per
second down and up
this guy is using the nearly 10 year old
in standard which is going to give you
about 40 megabits up and down and almost
worse than that it's going to be prone
to a lot more interference because it's
going to be 2.4 gigahertz only for a
cheap laptop it's acceptable it's
something that I can live with but it's
not exactly going to be the best
solution in the world something that
doesn't suck surprisingly is the display
now a paper is just a basic 11.6 inch
1366 by 768 panel however in practice
doesn't look bad at all sure it's going
to be a TN display so you're not going
to be getting great color or contrast or
especially viewing angles but it is
going to be a lot better than pretty
much anything in this price point and
oppressively it's actually going to look
better than some laptops that cost
double the price it's not great but it's
definitely usable and a lot better than
I was expecting
okay so these speakers aren't exactly
great even though they are facing
towards you they're definitely on the
quieter side but I mean there's a
headphone jack the only real issue I
have with the way that the keyboard is
laid out is going to be the size of
course this is going to be an 11 inch
laptop and you expect things to be a
little bit cramped but what I didn't
expect is that the actual keyboard
itself is going to be smaller than a
standard layout mind you it's not going
to be a huge difference but it's enough
to slightly trip me up it's something
you can get used to but it feels like
they had plenty of space on the side to
expand the keyboard all the way out as
opposed to using it on these bezels
thankfully it does have a Windows
precision touchpad mind you it's going
to be a little bit on the small side but
it really is not bad at all so you're
going to be getting all of the windows
10 gestures it's got a nice surface
accurate tracking honestly so much Pro
expensive laptops could learn a thing or
two from this it is nice to see at least
decent and Platonist system that's going
to be so cheap I thing really feels
super plasti or cheap it's all going to
be very very usable there's also some
interesting touches with the design so
even small things like having a little
bit of a curve here below the trackpad
to make it easy to just get your finger
in here and open it up and you're also
going to be getting something that's
going to be a little bit smaller than
the competition all right so this is a
test of the Inspiron Elevens webcam
surprisingly it actually runs at a full
720p and at least based on first glance
it doesn't look bad what's really going
to make it break this laptop is the
price so at $130 which is what I was
able to pick it up for it is an
incredibly good deal now unfortunately
of course with all the sales and stuff
you might actually end up finding it for
a little bit more right now taking a
look around other retailers has given me
something like 170 to 190 dollars but
even at a substituent at all price it is
hard to argue with this Inspiron the
Wi-Fi might not be amazing but the rest
of the computer actually is really
really not bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
