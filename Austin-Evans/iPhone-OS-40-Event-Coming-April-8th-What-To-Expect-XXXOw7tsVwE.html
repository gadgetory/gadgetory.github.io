today I'm here with actually some pretty
surprising news pretty impressive I
might add
Apple has just announced that they were
going to have an event for iPhone OS 4.0
and it's not going to be as usually not
two weeks from month whatever it's going
to be in just a couple days or more
specifically the 8th which is Thursday
pretty impressive admit that Apple has
been able to go ahead and have the iPad
release and all this kind of stuff and
then have this immediately afterward
especially with nobody finding out about
it
but yeah guys I'm going to go ahead and
tell you all what we know about it what
we expect and yeah pretty cool stuff
anyway hey guys so I'm the first thing
is obviously the obvious thing which is
that April 8th which is this Thursday
Apple is going to have an event about
iPhone OS 4.0 which is the next major
jump in the iPhone software now this is
not really uncommon every year they do
this but what is uncommon is to have the
iPad come out you know just like three
or four days ago so it's going to be
really interesting to see how the iPad
and iPhone OS how they interact because
of course the iPad runs a larger version
of the iPhone OS so to see how it works
it's going to be pretty impressive
now one thing about the iPad and iPhone
because Mowgli's call them both is there
it's the same thing at this point one
really interesting thing to think that
is that there are a lot of things that
we're expecting to find in iPhone OS 4.0
and seeing as the iPad runs it I
wouldn't be surprised if both of the
platforms get a lot of really cool
things such as multitasking etc so and
of course nobody knows what's coming for
sure but I will give you guys a few of
my predictions number one on the top my
list absolutely no question is
multitasking everything all
kinds of other phones have it it's not
that big a deal anymore I mean it's
really just crazy how Apple still
doesn't do it I wouldn't be surprised
they still don't have multi tasking but
it's definitely the number one thing I'm
looking for on my list
the second thing is more customization
now it could be as simple as you know
just letting you use your own background
like an iPad
obviously lets you set your own
background image well I would definitely
that would be the bare minimum I would
expect out of I phone os 4.0 what I
would expect hope to expect it may be
like widgets maybe more like a home
screen rather than all you see is just
you know apps and stuff maybe you can
customize it just like my log for
Android phones customize it with making
like a Twitter widget or whatever your
mail whatever you really want and of
course you know one thing with all these
is that Apple always comes up with new
innovative and cool stuff so I
absolutely would expect that they had
some cool stuff but anyway guys that's
about it not a whole lot to report other
than it is coming on Thursday and as
always I will definitely have a video
it's covering everything new as well as
probably all the kinds of cool stuff I
mean who knows they might even see do
that a little bit and I might show you
guys first hand anyway guys be sure to
subscribe if you're interested and
otherwise just hang around and we'll see
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
