now as you guys can see here the
interface is definitely probably the
most basic of all three apps but that's
not necessarily a bad thing so as you
see here up top we do have a link to go
ahead and get more ebooks which I'll
show you guys in a second as well as an
information tab however the meat
potatoes of
all these apps is only going to be the
reading experience and just jump in to
Pride and Prejudice here you see here
the loading times were pretty snappy and
once it's loaded up I'll go ahead and
show you guys the interface so as you
can see here it defaults to full screen
view or you can go ahead and just review
the whole thing now if I go ahead and
just rotate into landscape you'll see
that it's really not going to be able to
do that and that is a minor downside as
of course the other applications do
support landscape viewing however
personally not the hugest deal for me
but it could be for you so as you can
see here the formatting is not the best
in the Google Books application it's not
awful as you can see here it's
definitely very readable you can go
ahead and simply just scroll through it
does have that nice kind of page turn so
you can kind of like iBooks is kind of a
little bit of AI can you although it's
not exactly very useful but the thing is
that the formatting just doesn't seem to
be quite right on this book as well as
several other books and you see here
everything's kind of little cramped
together and it's just not set laid out
the best so I actually don't go ahead
and show you to pull up the menu just
tap on the screen and pulls that
everything out and then you have a few
options so we can go ahead and hit the
information we can see here when it was
purchased all that kind of good stuff
and we also go ahead and and search for
search for things so come on go ahead
and search for Jane there we go you can
see that and we can scroll through here
and jump to whatever particular part we
want so that's a nice little feature
works pretty nicely I know here's the
major thing all the settings so in the
settings you can do quite a few things
and go ahead and switch from day to
night time so you can mostly just a high
contrast or not we also go ahead and
change the typeface so if you want for
example Helvetica or whatever you can
absolutely change it however you like
you can change the text size as well as
a line height I'm going to actually show
you the line height because that's
probably one of the most important
things then you have flowing texture you
want scanned pages and you also can have
the 3d page turns so I'm going to show
you guys it takes just a second this is
the
I like freedom it looks a little bit
better with the bigger lines height but
still it's just not quite up to the par
of say the iBooks sort of Kindles so as
far as the reading experience is not by
any means awful you can go ahead I see
here and just hold on whatever we like
and you can see here it's gonna zoom in
so that's definitely a nice thing if we
have an issue of you know reading or
whatever but overall it's just not quite
as full featured so I should go ahead
and jump right out here let's go ahead
and go into the e-book store now as with
the Kindle app you don't actually have
the e-book store it's not built into the
actions I have to go ahead and load up
Safari we're not a huge deal so once you
go ahead and load it up you'll find this
just a pretty basic thing go ahead and
browse categories take a look at some of
the you know the featured books so let
go ahead and just take a look here she
picks up pick something random here as
you see here the interface is not too
bad we can go ahead and go back to
categories or home we read a little bit
of information about it we can see the
description reviews I'm go ahead and get
a sample which is something that all
three books they do allow you to go
ahead get samples we can go ahead and
purchase it so order that's about it
there's not a whole lot to you know to
take a look at in the e-book store it's
pretty basic so guys Wow
I don't really I think that this is a
pretty nice thing really there's just
not that much here for you if you're
really into books the library is pretty
decent but not amazing the app is okay
but the in not amazing and while you
can't go ahead and view your purchased
ebooks on both the iPhone the iPod Touch
and the iPad as well as Android phones I
believe in that I'm sure about that but
I will have an annotation on the screen
as well as on your PC and Mac via the
web so it's got a decent amount of
variety of how you can you know view the
books but still I think that the other
two do it a little bit better so really
I have to recommend a pass against the
Google eBookstore
