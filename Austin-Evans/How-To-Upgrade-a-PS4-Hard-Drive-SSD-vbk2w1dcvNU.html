here with a tutorial showing you how to
replace the hard drive or SSD in your
PlayStation 4 the standard ps4 comes
with well under 500 gigabytes of
capacity which is definitely going to be
eaten up very quickly with games and
saves etc so it definitely makes sense
if you are going to do an upgrade to do
it now as opposed to waiting later once
you have all of your saved data on the
console
speaking of save data if you do have
anything on there that you do want to
keep be sure to back it up via a USB
Drive before begin this tutorial
otherwise you will lose your data and
you'll have to start from scratch before
we get started though you'll need a
couple things like your replacement hard
drive Phillips screwdriver and a USB
Drive of at least 1 gigabyte you can put
basically any two-and-a-half inch laptop
hard drive in the ps4 as long as it's no
thicker than nine and a half millimeters
and it's not going to be any smaller
than 160 gigabytes so that includes any
kind of standard laptop hard drive as
well as an SSD so it's up to you if you
want to go for more performance or you
want more capacity I went with a one
terabyte Western Digital hard drive
which won't be any faster but it will
give me double the space for games right
out of the box before we install the
drive you need to come to your computer
and download the latest firmware update
from the Sony website and I'll have that
linked in the description then grab your
USB Drive and I would recommend
formatting it to make sure it's
completely clean once you're done hop
into the drive and create a folder named
ps4 in all caps
then go into it and create one more
folder titled update again in all caps
now grab the firmware you downloaded
from the Sony site and drop it into the
update folder on your USB Drive once
that's prepared it's time to crack open
the ps4 grab the top glossy part and
give it a good pull with both hands it's
stiff but it should come loose without
too much trouble and that's totally what
 never mind you should be able to
see the hard drive cage now along with
one very cool looking PlayStation theme
screw holding it in place
grab your screwdriver and undo that
single screw and the old hard drive
should be able to be pulled out with
just a little force before we put in the
new drive you'll have to undo the four
screws holding the current drive into
the cage which should only take a minute
once you pull the drive out you're
halfway there now grab your new hard
drive and slide it into the cage making
sure the label is facing up and the
connectors are free and clear on the
right side take the same screws you
this used and secured it back into place
then slide the drive back into the ps4
and replace the PlayStation screw to
keep everything tight and pop the front
base ship back on now you've got the
hard part out of the way that's what she
said jokes aside we're actually not
quite done even though the hard drive is
installed it's completely blank so we
need to take that USB drive we made
earlier and use it to install the
operating system plug the controller end
via USB and hold the power button until
the ps4 beeps and boots into safe mode
now press the PlayStation button and
then go down to the initialized ps4 and
reinstall system software option make
sure the USB Drive is plugged in and
then click OK it will take a little
while to prepare your new hard drive and
then you should see it reboot and bring
you to the software update screen again
give it a few minutes to get everything
taken care of and after one more restart
it should be all done just follow the
standard prompts for setup and you're up
and running now if you go to storage
management you should see your new drive
showing up congratulations you have a
new Drive installed in your ps4 now if
you had any problems or questions feel
free to leave those in the comments
below and definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel to keep up with
the rest of my playstation 4 coverage
anyway I will catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
