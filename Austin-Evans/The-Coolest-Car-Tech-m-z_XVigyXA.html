taking a look at some of the coolest car
tech sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T the first thing I
get to check out is the new Audi TT
on top of being one seriously
good-looking car it's rocking some cool
tech the gauges are actually a 12 inch
display that's customizable you can use
it to get info on the car check weather
along with having your navigation right
up front it's powered by an NVIDIA Tegra
processor and the animations keep up a
consistent 60 frames per second which is
helpful the last thing I want are my
cage is lagging it's all controlled on
the steering wheel or the mm I touch on
the console which is a lot quicker to
navigate through the system if you're
looking for something a little cheaper
than a brand new car there's the ZTE
mobely this is a tiny Wi-Fi hotspot
that's powered by your car it houses a
sim for the LTE connection and it
installs right into the OBD port and
basically any car made after 1996 once
installed you've got a Wi-Fi connection
that uses your mobile data while it
might not quite count as car tech AT&amp;amp;T
had a gear VR setup that showed a series
of increasingly dangerous things to do
behind the wheel like texting crashing
your car and virtual reality is
definitely an experienced car Tech is
awesome but the best part is actually
driving it we get to borrow a brand new
Volvo xc90 for the road trip to CTIA
this year and this thing is straight
tech on wheels it has cameras all around
which can give you a bird's eye view of
your surroundings which is seriously
cool having a giant touchscreen in the
dash is nice to serve as a big
navigation screen but you can also
customize things like the ride in
steering and fine tune the awesome sound
system like the Audi the gauges are
completely digital which can display
most menus in the navigation but one of
my favorite features was the holographic
heads-up display that shows things like
the speed limit and directions just for
the driver the trickiest part is
actually driving though pilot assist
will help to steer the car to keep it in
the lane and can even handle
accelerating and braking on the highway
on the long drive to Las Vegas this was
awesome it might not be a driverless car
but it's not far off which is crazy
I love tanks so to see cool stuff like
this really just gets the nerd and me
excited hopefully you guys enjoyed this
short little video taking a look at some
of the car tech up CTIA I feel like this
won't be the last video like this I do
