here reporting live from CES 2012 with
the motorola droid razr maxx so I've got
Jeff here for Motorola who's gonna give
us a little tour great hey thanks a lot
this is the droid razr maxx by motorola
and we just very recently announced it
and what's great about this phone we've
taken the original droid razr which
already had really great battery life
industry-leading for an LTE smartphone
and now we've done is added in even a
bigger better battery to make it so that
it's the longest lasting 4g smartphone
out there it's the battery life is over
twice as long as the leading competitor
so it provides all the battery power
that you need for that power user out
there somebody who is streaming video
somebody a business user somebody's
updating their social networks all the
time gives you all that power to talk
text surf do whatever you want all day
long so what like as I mentioned this is
a 3300 milliamp hour battery finding you
all that power and yet it's still
impossibly thin only at eight point nine
nine millimeter so very sleek slender
phone and you're able to watch movies
for fifteen hours you could navigate
from here in Vegas all the way to LA and
back all on one charge even listen to
music for two and a half days straight
so it's got a lot of power for you and
of course it's got all the speed and
software that you'd find on on the
original droid razr so things apps that
people consumers have been told us that
they really like things like Smart
Actions Smart Actions is on here as a
way to automate your tasks and extend
your battery life even further which is
taking extreme to unimaginable levels on
droid razr maxx or scott apps like moto
cast which you access through your
through your gallery or through your
files or through your pictures to
remotely stream your pictures music
files videos all that from your pc to
your phone and then of course it's also
what web top enabled too so it's got all
those great features from the original
droid razr now on this phone with an
even greater battery life would you mind
getting us a little demo of that droid
razr compared to the droid razr maxx
just kind of the thin that's sure sure
here i'm going to kind of put them down
here on the back you can see the
difference here is pretty slight between
the two legs i mentioned this is 7.1
millimeters this is 8.99 so there's a
little trade-off but we know that
there's some consumers out there that
hey they want that that super thin sleek
design and then others that still want a
sleek design but are willing to make a
little bit of a trade-off for that extra
battery life so pretty pretty darn close
between the two of them so as far as the
differences between the two so it's just
the bit of the battery is going to be
almost twice as big it's also going to
be a little bit thicker so no
differences between screens processors
or anything like that nothing like that
colors a little bit different see this
is more of a black and this is more of a
titanium color but but all the internal
hardware and all the software is the
same and any word on price release date
yeah so that's a great great point so it
is a good release in the coming weeks at
299 and it's going to be Ice Cream
Sandwich upgraded with in second quarter
of 2012 well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
