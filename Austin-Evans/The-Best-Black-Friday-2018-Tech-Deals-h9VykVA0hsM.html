the Black Friday deal preview for 2018
maybe you guys are all familiar with
Black Friday
it's that holiday every year where
people fight over very mildly discounted
electronics but instead of having to go
out and brave the cold brave the crowds
brave the fights instead you can be lazy
and shop from the comfort of your own
home with some of the deals that are
already live right now doesn't that
sound like a wonderful proposition
starting with consoles we have the Xbox
one X and $400 now we've done an entire
video on this but the gist of it is is
that you're getting a full 4k experience
on a lot of games and it is straight up
the most powerful console experience you
can get specifically even over the ps4
pro now four dollars is a pretty solid
price considering that's normally 500
bucks and unlike some of the other deals
which are available only on Black Friday
or our actual Thanksgiving itself you
can pick up the Xbox one X for $400
starting right now as a link in the
description next up for the base
consoles we have a $200 deal on
knowledge a ps4 but also the Xbox one so
specifically with that Xbox one you do
get minecraft bundled whereas with the
ps4 you give the new spider-man game but
regardless 200 ollars is a great pick up
especially if you don't really care
about playing at 4k and of course links
to all the stuff will be in the
description
did you get that point yet when linking
everything in the description literally
everything
now something I wasn't able to find this
year or any good ps4 pro deals so it
weirdly it actually feels like it's out
of stock in a lot of places but the best
thing I could do is a Best Buy you can't
pick up a Red Dead Redemption bundle
with the ps4 Pro for 400 bucks but this
doesn't really seem like a good time
honestly if you're going to pick up a
console this year get either a base
piece for Xbox or pick up that one extra
400 bucks for accessories we have the
ps4 controller available on Amazon for
$39 the Xbox one controllers available
for 47 bucks and you can pick up psvr
with the full set up as well as a couple
games for $200 on Amazon right now if
you want to get in on the switch action
you can pick up the switch for $300 and
that includes a free copy of Mario Kart
8 at Best Buy Walmart and Target but all
these are going live on Thanksgiving or
Black Friday itself so you'll have to be
a little bit patient
oh hi Josh do you have something to add
I do you can go there to Best Buy
Walmart me I'm gonna be at Kohl's of
course three hundred and thirty dollars
you get the switch you get a carrying
case or a turtle beach headset
ninety dollars of cold care for $330
that's a good deal
I think it's a better view is that worth
being in the cold at Kohl's at 6:00 p.m.
on Thanksgiving
moving over to computers if you're
eyeing up that brand-new surface pro six
you can pick up the core i5 version with
the bundle type cover which does not
come with it normally for $799 right now
at the Microsoft Store that's especially
a good deal considering that it's a full
what 270 dollars off the normal price
speaking of the service my favorite
service product announced this year is
actually the service go which is also on
sale this guy's a lot cheaper so we're
only going to say $50 but for 400 bucks
you can pick it up on Amazon right now
and importantly it's the 128 gig version
unlike the lower end version which is
much slower 128 is definitely the way to
go and for 450 not bad now if you're all
about that Chrome OS life and I'm not
sure that there are a ton of people who
are but if you are you can't pick up the
Google pixel book for a full $300 off on
the Google store that does bring it down
from a thousand to 700 bucks but the
catch here is that you do need to wait
until at least Black Friday or actually
I think it goes live on the 22nd but it
picks a book even though it's a little
bit weird even though it's a little
expensive it's 700 ollars is a really
solid laptop if you're ok with the
limitations of Chrome OS get into the
gaming laptops and we have a few
different options so well the best ones
I've seen is an Acer Aspire 7 available
over at Newegg this does have a full 17
inch screen it's got the new core i7 as
well as the GTX 1060 and that's going to
only run you 980 dollars if that's too
expensive for you you can pick up the
Acer nitro 5-4 $520 at Best Buy now that
is going to get you a full Core i5
processor 8 gigs of RAM as well as a gtx
1050 the only real downside in addition
to that this is one of the deals that
goes live on Thanksgiving is that you do
only have a one terabyte hard drive so
you probably gonna want to budget a
little bit of money to upgrade this guy
with an SSD but a proper gaming laptop
that you can play some real games with
for five hundred twenty dollars is
definitely a solid Black Friday deal
deal raptor what's the next deal oh
really is it a samsung g5 500 gigabyte
version for only $100 that's really
impressive yeah I know I'm excited about
it too
so the Samsung g5 is something that we
use on a daily basis to edit all of our
videos so very fast SSDs that are based
on USB type-c
it's okay I got you yeah 400 olives
great deal and of course you can get the
larger capacities but uh deal Raptor he
likes that 500k great right continue
along the deal train we have a Samsung
32-inch free Singh monitor and this is a
full 4k display for only three hundred
and fifty dollars right now we're going
to turn off deal Raptor for saying
because you got a lot more deals for you
starting with the Apple home pod this is
available for a hundred dollars off at
Best Buy for Black Friday which does
bring it down to two hundred T dollars
still expensive but it is a very good
sounding speaker don't wait downside
really is that you are limited with Siri
but if you've been looking to pick one
up and now it seems like the time
speaking of assistance the Google store
has a bundle with not only did Google
home Mini but also a chromecast
available for $45 now usually the GU
whole mini itself cost fifty dollars so
essentially you're getting a discount
and a free chromecast
the only downside here is that you do
have to wait until the 22nd before the
deal is live over at the Google store
but if you've been looking to upgrade
your TV set up and get a little bit of
Google home action now is the time it
sound like a great infomercial
salesperson yeah at the time for deal
deal deal
as far as cameras go there's some pretty
good deals on these Sony side with the a
sound mark too available for only $1000
now Nelly does that include the kit lens
but this is a proper full-frame camera
so you can get some pretty solid video
especially some great stills for only a
grant rover Raptors not a big fan of the
iPad but what Oviraptor is a big fan of
are the deals and one of the best ones
I've actually seen on this entire list
is the Galaxy S 9 available unlocked for
only five hundred and twenty dollars you
can also get a discount on the galaxy
note 9 at eight hundred bucks but five
hundred twenty dollars for the basic
Galaxy S nine yeah I agree it's a good
deal the Google store has a solid deal
on the pixel three in the pixel three XL
so right now you can get the pixel three
for only $650 you can get the pixel
three XL for seven or dollars which is a
full $200 off of its normal price now
the downside here is that you do need to
wait into the 22nd like a lot of these
other deals but if you've been waiting
to pick up some of my favorite phones of
the year they're now available I'm much
much more reasonable prices this is a
little bit of a weird one but the iPad
Mini 4 is available for only $250 at
Best Buy on Black Friday now I know that
this is an iPad that has not seen a lot
of love lately but if you do want a
small and unique form factor and I know
a lot of people like them for like
reading and video and stuff then this is
pretty much the best deal I've ever seen
on an iPad
it's now Black Friday without some TV
deals and when I say TV deals I mean
that there are literally hundreds and
hundreds of TV deals available this week
so some of my favorites include a 50
inch Toshiba 4k fire TV for $300 on
Amazon as well as an LG 65 inch 4k TV
for only $600 at Best Buy if you want to
go even bigger there's a Vizio 70 inch
TV available at Best Buy for only $750
like all the rest of the TVs it's a full
4k it sports HDR it's a smart TV what
you're getting here is one of the
biggest TVs that you can get for less
than $1000 and it is a lot less than
$1000 so not my friends are all the
Black Friday deals but deal Raptor and I
could find as always links to all these
will be in the description of the video
just keep in mind that some of the deals
are going to expire some of the prices
are going to change and specifically
some of the deals will only be active on
Black Friday itself so make sure to go
check back I'll do my best to keep that
description up-to-date is there anything
else you want to add do laughter that's
a lot of enthusiasm I really I mean I
can't really add anything to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
