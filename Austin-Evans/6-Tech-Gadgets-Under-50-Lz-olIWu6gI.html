with the next best tech under 50 the
reason I use quotation marks is I have
no idea what about to take a look at
because we're a good buddy mr. Savitch
kenny has got the hook-up so what is our
first product this is really fun I sayd
a Kindle Fire I've done a video on this
I've done multiple videos on the Kindle
Fire
nobody fear this actually is a newer
version the last time I took a look at
this was probably the end of 2015 so for
$50 you were getting a full fledged
tablet here and the newer version does
have better specs so this one supports
dual band Wi-Fi quad core processor
hundred cameras and the only real issue
I had before was that the screen was not
very good but we'll see how it is
although I like how it comes in a little
cardboard bag that's kind of cool so the
fire seven is running a version of
Android but it has been heavily modified
by Amazon so when you actually take a
look at it you're not going to find
anything like the Google Play Store
instead you're pretty much forced to use
all Amazon apps including your app store
music and of course Kendall so the
speakers are not going to be anything
amazing but the screen is actually
better than I remember
so it is a 7-inch 1024 by 600 panel but
as far as the actual viewing angles and
color and stuff a lot better than you
would expect from $50.00 so we try the
camera here boom that's a 450 dollars I
have to hand it to Kang the fire seven
is not too bad but what is up next
alright we've got the cost
Porter Pro classics so I've heard of
cost headphones I've tried a couple but
I actually do not know anything about
these it looked kind of retro though
these really cost a few dollars okay
alright they look I mean I'm going to be
totally honest these look like toys
they're so tiny they're so plasticky I
mean but I will say I do feel like I've
heard there are some really good coughs
headphones they're cheap so I'm assuming
that's what these are to be fair they're
very sort of 80 styled so maybe they're
just like I mean that's a classic on the
box so you know what these are way
way way better than I was expecting the
porter pros my cost I would never look
twice at these but the more I play with
them not only sounds good but you kind
of dig the sort of retro AE styling
mecco dot how much is the echo dot Oh
again exactly fifty dollars yes okay
cool
so inside we have the echo dot itself
which I'll actually I realize just how
small the sky is ken is their secret
Amazon sponsorship that I don't know
about the two of the first three
products were available on Amazon is it
almost like there are links below to
purchase all these products on Amazon
com so the echo dot is a smaller version
of the full-sized Amazon echo especially
what you're getting here is something
that not only can play music and whatnot
more importantly has Alexa built-in so
that you can do things like ask it
questions control lights all that kind
of stuff just with your voice
Alexa Austin likes on okay a the only
issue with the echo dot is it because it
is so small the speaker just isn't great
so sure for normal use like being able
to use voice commands that's totally
fine but listening to music you're
probably going to want to take advantage
of the headphone jack on the back Alexa
stop the echo dot is a lot less
expensive than the full-size echo and if
all you're needing to do is a little bit
of voice command say try on some lights
in your house it is not too bad but I'm
curious what do we have next
another Mouse okay Oh a mouse and
keyboard okay okay hold on okay so how
much were these exactly fifty again the
get excited suspicious at this point
alright so let's start with the Corsair
n65 Pro now if we remember right when
our $30 video we took a look at a
slightly lower end Corsair Mouse this
this is all the RGB apparently so first
of all I do have to say I kind of dig
the whole stormtrooper vibe with the
white and black and first glance oh yeah
that feels good before we give them out
to try we also have the oxy RGB
mechanical keyboard I feel like I'm
sensing a trend here with everything
being car GP so the tests are super cool
new RGB accessories we have
you know play an actual game with them
immediately I like the way this mouse
feels it's nice and precise I'm not sure
what the exact dpi settings are off the
top of my head but it feels pretty good
well you can save a little bit of money
if you don't want the RGB the keyboard
itself does not feel bad I really do
feel like the difference between this
and the actual cherry switches is pretty
hard to tell in normal gaming if you
want to upgrade from a lower end Mouse
and especially a normal membrane
keyboard this is lecture a really good
way of doing it on a budget but I think
we have one last item to take a look at
since was it packaging a Lumia 435 why
is it this weird packaging do this like
fall off a truck or something so take a
look at a few Windows Phones but I don't
think I've ever seen the Lumia 435 the
first thing they jumped up to me this is
tiny I will say I don't hate the design
even though it's definitely small and a
little bit chunky I kind of like the
sort of matte white finish with the
black front but I'm not encouraged that
this is going to be worth the $50 the
bigger problem is that this is running
Windows Phone now it's not necessarily a
huge deal-breaker
I mean Windows Phone is still
technically supported but it is
definitely not going to be as easy to
have apps support as say something like
iOS or Android you know what even though
the audio quality isn't particularly
great that speaker actually gets really
loud it's rocking a four inch display
with a resolution of 480 by 800 now that
sounds like a spec stria 2010 you would
be correct but at least the panel itself
is actually not too bad it gets fairly
bright and viewing angles are acceptable
for 50 bucks
this phone is really really small but it
actually does work pretty well that's
something that I've always really valued
about Windows Phone is that even on
fairly low specs it does run very
smoothly the Lumia 435 has a very very
impressive 2 megapixel rear facing
camera and I mean it's not the worst
thing I've ever seen I think it actually
might be better than the fire 7 I really
want to like this phone especially
considering the budget price I don't
mind the design it does feel unique and
different but for 50 dollars I still
feel like they're going to be better
options out there sorry Ken
six some curious out of all this tech
