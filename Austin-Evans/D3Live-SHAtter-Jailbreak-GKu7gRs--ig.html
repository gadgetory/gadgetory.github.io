episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking jailbreaking there's
actually two big topics that were going
to talk about first of all let's go and
talk about what the probably most of you
guys are interested in which is the next
big jewelry so in case you didn't know
pod2g a member of the crime dev team
we're actually able to find a big
bootrom exploit and pretty much all
devices including the ipad the iphone
depth iphone 4 as well as all versions
of the ipod touch including the ipod
touch 4th generation so basically what a
boot on exploit i'm just kind of do it
really simply that a boot on my exploit
is actually hardware-based so basically
it doesn't matter how many times I Apple
will go ahead and update the firmware
you updating the firmware wall kind of
make a little bit more difficult but
when there's a hardware jail route and
where does it mean the bootrom obviously
but when it's in the hardware the only
way to totally remove it is to actually
create a new version so for example like
last year they they changed it with ipod
touch 2nd generation so for example like
the a gigabyte ipod touch 2nd generation
that was different because they actually
changed the harbor of the device so
basically guys just kind of sum it up
this means that there is going to be is
great news for jailbreaking whereas
instead of having to wait months or
something in between jailbreaks and
waiting for the define new exploit they
already have the bootrom it's all set up
so basically all they have to do is just
tweak their jailbreaks so it's going to
be pretty simple so the tentative name
for the next jailbreak it's going to be
called shatter and shadow will of course
be able to jailbreak like I said pretty
much anything with an apple an apple
logo on a touchscreen maybe not maybe I
can nano but pretty much everything else
so this is not going to be a jailbreak
me style jailbreak so you know it's
going to be a little bit more difficult
than you know just going to joburg me
calm and you know flipping a slider it's
gonna be a little more complicated than
that but in general it's going to be
pretty much like pretty much every Joe
break we've ever used so example redsnow
if you've ever use snowbreeze actually
not snowbreeze but it is red snow for
the most part pwnage tool or a lot of
different jailbreak program so it will
probably be all the the new jailbreaks
as far as shannon we'll all have to do
with those so you will have to plug it
into your computer run a very simple
program but really not going to be that
big a deal um so as far as when she
is going to be L not really sure it
could be out here I'm probably guessing
the next few weeks although it is very
possible the jailbreak team actually
might want to wait a little bit actually
wait till 4.2 comes out in November now
honestly guys I have no idea I don't
know nobody really knows it a lot of it
does depend on how fast the work goes
because even though they had the initial
exploit you do have to understand that
there's a lot of other technical stuff
they actually have to build it up figure
everything out port city overall it kind
of stuff so guys just an update the
shedder jailbreak will be coming and of
course I'll do a tutorial on it but it
will be in just a little while and it's
not gonna be anything i jailbreak me so
the second jailbreaking story they
actually didn't want to talk about the
fact that city actually had bought rock
i'm so in case you don't know what rock
is which i'm sure amongst you do but
rock is like the the alternative
dissidia well you know obviously city is
where you can load all your kinds of
jailbroke programs well rock is kind of
like an alternative rock did kind of
focus more on the paint program so you
know a lot of emulators the custom
themes that kind of stuff that was paid
generally tend to be more in rock than
cydia lot of the time the apps were
shared between the two platforms but
anyway rock was the biggest platform of
Farah City I mean instead of cydia well
pretty I think it's kind of crazy but I
see actually bought rock so fairly soon
they're going to go ahead and bring all
of the rock applications so if you
bought something wrong everything will
be transferred over to cydia i'm pretty
much city is bought raucous rock is
going to be shut down there going to be
improving cydia most likely going to pay
taking a little bit of the design of
rock may be incorporating a few things
into cydia but pretty much city is
bought rock and rock is going to be
going away and city is just gonna be
approved now to me who've been obviously
i've been jailbroken and everything i've
been coming this for a long time i think
this is actually way bigger than you
know just you know that we're just going
to have an improved cydia to the point
where of jailbreaking programs are
actually or jailbreak stores actually
buying each other out and what you guys
some of you guys don't understand is it
cydia and rock like for example rock
which has been out for about a year and
a half has made over three million
dollars in sales so this is a big deal i
mean it's not just like you know a
couple guy
the basement doing this I mean this is a
serious deal so I think this really
actually legitimizes jailbreaking as far
as you know when these companies are
actually buying each other out and you
know actually incorporating stuff I mean
that stitch kind of blows my mind I mean
you know you look jailbreaking has
really really simple roots as far as
just you know usually just a few people
find an exploit get set up and now it's
turning into a multi-million dollar a
year industry and personally I love that
because it just gives people more
options and I mean all that money it's
not like it's just going away I mean
it's going into more better applications
all kind of stuff so I really am pretty
happy and I think it's really cool idea
that actually huge over extorted by each
other out that that really just kind of
says something to me about jailbreaking
okay so in the second segment of d3 dive
I'll be taking live questions so I'm on
a blog TV right now got a lot of people
in room so go ahead just answer some
questions just kind of hang out of it
okay so some of the questions what can
the new ipod touch improve on um you
know that's actually a kind of a
difficult question um I would like it if
some of the hardware stuff was fixed a
little bit if you guys saw my
interactive for ipod touch 4th
generation interactive review i had a
few little problems with it i didn't
like the past like white button the 30
pin connector was what didn't really
work that well so there are a few minor
hardware things i'd love to do um i'd
also like to see them add maybe some
more ram on definitely I would like a
better rear facing camera especially if
ahead of flash I'm not to say that the
ipod touch camera is bad or anything but
it's just really not that great as far
as you know picture quality is so so in
the video quality all the video quality
is not too bad but i just like to see
them just make some gradual improvements
but on the whole of it it's very very
solid and I don't really have a whole
lot problems with it at all well the new
ipod touch have more than 7.7 megapixels
uh yeah that's that kind of comes back
to the same thing i hope so what what
Apple's saying was it and I have so much
to do with price as far as they wanted
to get thinnest I suppose I got a kind
of agree with that although I will
mention though that a lot of time people
kind of kind of get too into the
megapixels you know just
the same way where you know it back in
like like five six seven years ago if I
was wanting in the highest clocks be on
their computer but nowadays you know you
can find like a dual core quad core
cetera et cetera when you have more
cores so that clock speed doesn't matter
so much well I think it's kind of
getting the same way with cameras I mean
most of the time your computer screen
does not i mean you know your computer
screen is not 10 megapixels so the
cameras got to be condensed down so
really the megapixels to in my opinion
anyway don't matter so much is the
actual image quality a good example this
is actually the camera i'm filming on
right now actually those shoot 10
megapixels still pictures but you know
what that is 10 megapixel well you know
in theory you know it sounds hey Tim 8
bits that sounds good but the kitchen
polity is not that great so well
obviously megapixels are important and I
definitely would like to see more than
point 7 I mean this is not like you know
15 years ago where that would be okay um
but yeah I just I just think that the
image quality is more important than the
megapixels like I said about trying to
sitting when I have it I have an iPhone
or an iPod Touch like it is now um well
it depends I like the ipod touch mainly
for the reason that I'm cheap that I
really want to have to spend all kinds
of money on iphone every month so i
should i do have another video kind of
talking about what my setup is as far as
that it's kinda late but uh basically i
like the ipod touch as far as what it's
like now I'd like to see also GPS on
it's one thing i forgot earlier but
basically i really do like the ipod
touch right now and is it just makes its
to me personally just because it's so
much cheaper as far as and i have to do
a plan it's really simple to get here
some other cell phone and have a not
carry an ipod touch with you every day
which is exactly what i do what is my
favorite app that's a good question i
have a lot of apps i've actually what
that's what i started my channel as i
was reviewing applications I don't do it
so much anymore but still my favorite
applications definitely have to be gone
as well as gal con labs probably my
favorite one of my favorite games ever
for the iphone ipod touch I like real
racing that's a really fun game eboy
fixed pics one of the most innovative
unique games I've ever seen on anything
um so there are a lot of really good
apps iphone ipod touch I'll take an air
gap one of them is worth buying the ipod
touch 4th generation you have a 2g or 3g
uh yes and possibly if you has a 2g yeah
i definitely would think so i myself
have a 2g I'm upgrade to the 4g i
definitely not this point at all or so
many improvements as far as speed
cameras screen you name it means pretty
much improved in the same generation now
if you just bought a third-generation a
lot of stuff still does apply and that
if you have 3rd generation but this
leçons down to isn't going to be a big
deal for you to afford the 4th
generation you know so if you know you
can afford it without too much
difficulty then yeah I'd say definitely
go ahead of course you do get a lot of
the things such the cameras the better
screen eccentric cetera but of course
you just probably likely bought your
third generation in the past few months
or so so it's not a necessity and you
know you're not gonna be missing a snot
like apples going to just quit
supporting your device very soon so if
you can afford it that same definitely
go over the 40 but if you can't you're
not missing out on a ton there's a lot
of improvements but you know it's not
the biggest deal in the world do i think
android can be iOS i think um that's a
kind of a difficult question that's why
i think i think android I like how open
it is not to talked about this in
previous video so i won't go too in
depth into it but I like how open
android is and because the openness it's
very very quickly you know updates no I
don't know how much that has to do with
being open as far as just Google pouring
millions millions dollars into
developing it but i think i want had a
little bit more to do with it but i do
like how android is being able to be
customized due to that openness so you
know maybe like iOS for example iowa's
kind of keeps out flash we're android
that's just fine some different things
like that just because androids open and
you allows you to do stuff including
carriers to make your own custom skins
now a lot of the skins are pretty much
any skin today is kind of like negative
on android my opinion it kind of you
know just slow the dance stuff but if a
company really wanted to go ahead and do
a full-featured android skin and not
even just skin but i mean like a new
build of android almost it I mean
there's just so much possible so I mean
if somebody really wanted to take
time in really revamp Android I think it
really could beat iOS four currently
though I do kind of fry us for just
because it's very very smooth and to get
all the openness and all the
jailbreaking stuff you just go ahead and
chill break your iPhone so firm that
like iphone but Android is absolutely
fantastic and you know if if Android
judge makes a few key improvements I
think it would pass the iOS platform um
wow this chose runs the best what did I
think the lib which is better the iphone
of the palm pixi I'm definitely the eye
from the palm pixi it's just a totally
different league than me the pixies much
smaller and everything like that what do
I think about the new camera and ipod
touch again I've done videos on it as
far as the review so you can go and
check that out generally pretty positive
i think there's room for improvement i
think is pretty good anyway guys that's
it for this episode of days real i
apologize it's a little bit hectic but
definitely if you enjoyed feel free to
subscribe i do i go live of course you
