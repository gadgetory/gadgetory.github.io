here with ask me where I go over all
kinds of questions straight from you
guys so let's jump right on in should I
buy a ps4 or gaming PC for $100 more
that's a tough one so on one hand you
have the PlayStation 4 which is
essentially a $400 mid-range gaming PC
and a tiny little case and on the other
hand you could just be able to buy
yourself a normal gaming PC which is
going to be bigger it's going to be more
expensive to get the same level of
graphics but you're also going to be
able to do more on it such as play games
on Steam actually use it as a normal PC
do modding all that kind of stuff so it
kind of boils down to exactly how you
want to gain do you want something
that's going to be simpler it's going to
be cheaper and you can just stick
underneath through TV and forget about
or do you want a full-on gaming PC which
is going to allow you to customize to
play around with it and to use it as an
actual full gaming computer so it really
kind of comes down to how you want to
use it well social networking die
considering you asked this question on
Facebook probably no time soon what are
your favorite games for next gen I've
only got the ps4 right now and in fact I
actually just did a video talking about
some of the games on there but probably
some of my favorites absolutely have to
be resogun
which I know it doesn't seem like
anything all that special but it is
actually one of the most fun you know
twin-stick shooters that played in a
long time
battlefield 4 is really good when it
works which it doesn't always although
they've got some patches coming for that
soon and surprisingly Need for Speed
rivals is actually a really fun racing
game
not quite my normal style I've kind of
preferred like the forces and the Gran
Turismo in the world but Need for Speed
is a pretty fun game as well and of
course lots of cool Xbox one games will
be coming out and I'll be taking a look
at those here in the next couple days
how do you always get hey guys this is
Austin to sound exactly the same in
every video I've said a lot of times
over the last four and a half years so
it's just pretty much in the beginning
of every video and most of the times I
have to do you know that same take
couple times because I mess something up
so yeah it's pretty much just then I
just say it so often that anytime I can
just say hey guys this is Austin is
there any point in getting both next-gen
consoles do you have to get both yeah
but there are definitely reasons why you
might want to so first of all there are
exclusives so if you want to play Halo
for example you pretty much have to get
an Xbox and if you want to play
Uncharted you're pretty much gonna have
to buy a Playstation 4 same thing goes
for your friends so do a lot of your
friends have an Xbox - a lot of them
have a place
well it might make sense for you to go
ahead and pick up whichever one or both
of those consoles so you can play with
them so they're definitely reasons that
you might want to get both consoles
although probably not going to be a
necessity especially once they kind of
start coming down in price though it
might make sense with the 770 and 780
price drop the 780 Ti out now and nifty
things like g-sync and shadow play what
do you think
Nvidia definitely has some good stuff
coming so I'm probably most excited for
g-sync
as this allows the monitor to actually
change the refresh rate depending on how
many frames per second you're getting in
a game so instead of having to use
something like vsync or just dealing
with tearing and just weirdness instead
it makes everything look much smoother
much more natural I'm excited to see
that obviously some of their graphics
cards especially some of the price cuts
are definitely nice although I think AMD
is definitely pushing them hard on that
side the AMD r9 290 is a ridiculously
powerful graphics card it's you know
fairly loud fairly hot but as far as
pure performance goes it's really going
to be hard to beat and I am also
interested on the AMD side to check out
mantle I've actually been able to talk
to quite a few people from AMD as well
as some various yet different game
developers and I'm really interested to
see how mantle kind of plays out so lots
of good stuff actually on both the red
and green side of the fence
would you buy a Windows tablet I
actually already have its the assist
transformer book t100 and I will be
doing a video on this before too much
longer but it's not quite so much a
standard kind of iPad or Android tablet
it's more of like a standard Windows PC
kind of crammed into a tablet form
factor and it also does come with a
keyboard dock which is pretty cool
I like it's not the greatest thing in
the world but for certain people it
could be absolutely fantastic and of
course like I said I should be doing a
video on this before too much longer
what are your views on the new curved
display smartphones are they worth the
high price right now not so much I mean
there's the LG G flex as well as the
Samsung Galaxy round and it's kind of
cool to see these companies
experimenting and trying new things I'm
always for that but I really think that
either of these phones have nailed it
now what is kind of interesting to me is
something that Samsung showed off
earlier this year and that using a
basically from the front it looks like a
pretty much normal smartphone but
actually has the display kind of taper
around the edge so you can maybe see
some notifications or whatever's going
on with on the phone just from the side
as opposed to having to light up the
entire screen so stuff like that I think
could be very interesting but the
current
kind of smartphones really don't do it
for me well you ever start vlogging and
at how many subscribers did you consider
yourself successful I've thought about
vlogging but I don't really think it
would be all that interesting now as far
as how many subscribers I got when I
consider myself successful probably
about a hundred or so when I first got
started I started having just a few
people watching my videos it was awesome
but one thing about me is I've always
tried to kind of set the bar higher so a
while back it was if I could get a
thousand views on every video that would
be the greatest thing ever
and then it was 2,000 and it was 5,000 I
mean even now today when I'm getting 30
40 50 thousand views pretty consistently
I've always got to step it up if the
video doesn't get 60,000 I will be upset
or 80,000 or 100,000 whatever it is
there's always got to be a higher goal
to hit otherwise I just kind of feel
like I'm stagnant and not going anywhere
that's not something that I can deal
with it also I don't at probably when I
hit a hundred subscribers that would be
when I kind of consider myself to be
popular anyway there's gonna be about it
for this one if you guys have any
questions that you want me to answer
next time on ask me if you're free to
drop me a line over on Twitter Facebook
or Google+ and of course those links
will be in the description of this video
anyway guys I will catch you next time
what is love baby don't hurt me don't
hurt me no more ya ever picked up a girl
for being a big youtuber wait you can do
that I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
