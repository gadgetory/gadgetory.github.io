might look like a large box inside is
one of the most powerful and smallest
gaming computers that you can buy inside
this guy is the wonderfully named ZOTAC
Magnus ek7 1080 which stands for a
really powerful very small computer I
think so if you guys are familiar with
ZOTAC you know that they've been making
small bare-bones pcs for quite a while
now and this is sort of the next
evolution of that as instead of having
something that's meant for like an
office like kind of a a low-end computer
this is a proper gaming box video with
the bare-bones is that while this does
have important components like obviously
the case and power supply as well as a
processor and graphics card there's no
memory there's no SSD and there's no OS
the idea here is that you can pretty
much supply whatever you want with this
guy but inside you're giving a core i7
7700 HQ processor as well as a full GTX
1080
correct this guy open and we get a giant
thank you for your purchase oh we also
get the kind of giant power adapter so
you know hopefully don't have a problem
with an enormous 330 watt power brick
that's sitting outside your computer
it's actually probably bout the same
size is it but I mean I guess with GT X
1080 inside you can't be too picky we
also have our antennas for the built-in
Wi-Fi as well as the power cord and
inside here we have the actual system
itself so it's not that big I'd say it's
about the size of like a tall shoebox
maybe that is a very dense little
computer again keep in mind this has a
GTX 1080 inside so the top is pretty
much nothing but ventilation which makes
sense considering the hardware inside
but up front we get not only an SD card
reader but also a full size USB 3 port a
USB type-c port as well as headphone and
microphone jacks around back it's fairly
basic we have 4 more USB 3.0 ports where
we actually install the antennas for our
Wi-Fi a pair of ethernet jacks which is
kind of interesting and then you get
your three display ports DVI and HDMI
from the video card one of the nice
parts about buying a bare-bones system
is that it comes pretty much ready to
work on so on bottom here we can install
not only a SATA SSD but also an M to
drive or an intel octane drive at the
same time which you also have a pair of
ddr4 sodam slots for your ram so now we
have the Z box all set up all it took
was installing 16
of ddr4 memory as well as a 512 gigabyte
SSD throwing a copy of Windows on here
and we are good to go so first off we
have GTA 5 even though it's a little bit
of an older game it still can be
surprisingly taxing and here running a
2560 by 1080 we're getting a pretty
decent frame rates between 70 to 90 now
this is an ultra wide monitor that does
have g-sync
so that 80 to 90 frames per second looks
great but in theory we could run it all
the way up to 166 frames per second we
want to bring the graphics settings down
a little bit that being said on this
giant ultra wide this looks really good
especially considering how tiny the PC
is it's crazy that this game can run an
Xbox 360 and yet it'll also look just
this awesome on a proper PC with a nice
monitor moving along we have Deus Ex
mankind dividing now well this might not
be the most popular game in the world it
still looks really nice especially when
you give it some good hardware to work
with and here at 2560 by 1080 with
pretty much everything cranked up we're
pretty much hitting 70 to 80 frames per
second I was about to say that a next
game is pub G but while I'm in the
loading screen I'm realizing that even
this stupid open area here is running
out like a hundred frames per second
this is gonna be good
where skydiving got a 105 frames per
second with G sync enabled so it
shouldn't be surprised that a GTX 1080
system is able to run pub G smoothly but
what is nice is just how easily it's
able to run it while still being quiet
so there is a little bit of coil whine I
noticed when you're actually really
taxing the CPU but the graphics seem to
be running pretty cool to put the size
of this in context this is the previous
version the zotac en 1070 as you can see
is much much smaller however not only
did it have a less powerful gtx 1070
inside but it also didn't run anywhere
near the same clock speeds of this 1080i
should probably not cover the exhaust
the question though is is the z box
worth it well before we answer that I'm
gonna give a huge shout out to Dollar
Shave Club for sponsoring this video
maybe they can also sponsor this guys uh
next shave so odds are if you were a
well-groomed person in the world you've
probably bought razors at the store you
realize that it is a terrible experience
all the way around based on having to
ask someone who'll get the key they have
no idea what they're actually talking
about and they're really expensive does
shave club fixes all that in a box that
shows up right at your doorstep right
you can try their shower and shave trial
which includes not only their executive
razor handle but you're also getting
four blades as well as a trial of three
of their most popular products see even
Dollar Shave Club sensors it no D
monetization here so if you arrayed up
your shaving game head over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Austin that's
dollarshaveclub.com slash Austin and
huge shout out to tell a shave club for
helping to support the channel at
fifteen hundred dollars for the bare
bone kit or eighteen hundred dollars if
you don't want to deal with it and just
get it with memory SSD as well as
Windows pre-installed this guy
definitely doesn't come cheap however
when you consider just how expensive it
is to build yourself a PC today
especially with high-end components like
this that price isn't too crazy and of
course getting something that's this
small that you don't have to build
yourself is a huge plus it's not for
everyone but ZOTAC has built the most
powerful small form factor game PC I've
ever tried some curious what do you guys
think about these ZOTAC ZBOX let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
