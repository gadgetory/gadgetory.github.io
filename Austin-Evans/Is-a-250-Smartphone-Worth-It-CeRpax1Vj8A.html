usually get all the attention but can
you get a decent phone for $250 take a
look at the new Moto G and you're
getting a lot more than the price tag
might suggest with a five-inch screen
and curved back the Moto G feels good in
the hand
especially with the new textured rear
cover it's also ipx7 water-resistant you
won't want to go swimming with it but
it's totally fine getting wet just make
sure the removable back is properly
sealed this is where you'll find your
sim and micro SD card slots you can also
customize the phone in moto maker
allowing you to pick the color back
cover and accent at no extra cost move
over to the isuzu zenfone 2 and we've
got a much bigger 5.5 inch display it's
about the same size as an iPhone 6 plus
but it is a fair bit thicker you'll find
capacitive back home and multitasking
buttons along with the volume rocker on
back this works nicely but having the
power button on top is awkward and the
button itself is small and usually takes
a couple tries to actually press pry off
the back and you'll find a micro SD and
dual SIM card slots which is a cool
extra feature with the Alcatel OneTouch
Idol 3 the first thing you'll notice is
just how thin and light it is it has the
same sized 5.5 inch screen but it comes
in over 3 millimeters thinner than the
zenfone and it's even lighter than the
Moto G it might not seem like a big deal
but with large phones like this and
makes a difference you won't find a
removable back but you do have a tray
for a sim and microSD card usually
budget phones don't have the greatest
screens but you won't find much to
complain about here the Moto G has a
5-inch 720p display that's good viewing
angles are reasonable and colors are
decent the zenfone steps things up with
a 5.5 inch 1080p screen and as Susan
cludes an app to fine tune the colors
although the screen doesn't get as
bright as I'd like the clear winner
though is the idol 3 on paper looks
similar with a 5.5 inch 1080p screen but
it's a terrific looking display with
great colors solid viewing angles and it
gets much brighter than the others this
would be great on a phone at twice the
price when it comes to audio they each
handle things a different way
the dual front-facing speakers of the
idle three easily take this one it's
right up there with the very best like
the HTC one as far as specs go the Moto
G is a little outgunned here the zenfone
has a powerful Intel Atom processor and
the aisle 3 has a whopping 8 cores
take a look at geek bench and the
zenfone takes a big lead thanks to that
Atom CPU and when you look at graphics
it's not even close with the il3 and
Moto G falling far behind an actual user
isn't as huge a gap even with relatively
weak specs the Moto G feels snappy
thanks to the 720p screen and basically
stop build of Android you'll find a few
additions like active notifications to
check what's up at a quick glance but
otherwise this is about as close to a
nexus as you can get the idol 3 also
works well in normal use it has a
slightly more skinned version of Android
lollipop but basically all the
customizations are either cosmetic or
easily uninstalled bloatware with the
zenfone performance definitely isn't an
issue but the software is there's an
enormous amount of junk that ships on
the phone and as Susan's done a fairly
major overhaul of Android
nothing is necessarily terrible but
there are lots of small annoying changes
that really add up even with the big
differences in power the group does very
well for battery life with the idle
taking the wind but all three come in
around the 7 hour mark one other area
worth mentioning is the single stream
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi on the Moto G this
isn't a huge problem for most people but
my apartment has notoriously poor Wi-Fi
reception making the dual band Wi-Fi on
the Isle 3 and zenfone far more reliable
get into cameras and on paper all three
are closely matched with 13 megapixel
sensors the zenfone isn't half bad but
it can't keep up in this comparison many
of the shots I took looked a bit washed
out with inaccurate white balance there
was also a bit of noise sometimes even
in great light but there is a lot of
detail and with the option of manually
controlling the camera you can get a
nice shot the idol 3 can also deliver
solid results it tended to underexpose a
bit but the color is much more realistic
to my eye even though it has 13
megapixels it doesn't quite have the
same level of detail as the other two
it's not bad but if you zoom in you'll
see a bit of softness in the image
motorola hasn't exactly had a great
track record with cameras lately but the
Moto G has been a pleasant surprise
there's a ton of detail and colors are
very natural things like dynamic range
are the best here and the HDR mode is
really impressive it brings a lot of
life to images without going overboard
my biggest problem has to do with the
overly simple camera app that snaps your
shot when you tap the screen or uses an
imprecise control wheel to set exposure
it took me a few tries before getting
several shots which was frustrating all
three cameras shoot 1080p video but here
there's really no contest
both the idol and zenfone deliver
passable results but the Moto G gives
much sharper video and renders colors
better than the others as the cheapest
phone here the zenfone delivers the
highest performance but makes some odd
hardware choices and goes overboard on
the bloatware but Moto G delivers a
great camera solid battery life and
excellent software experience but the
superior screen and speakers along with
the nicer hardware and better
performance at the aisle three give it
the slight edge in this one the big
takeaway is that you can get a really
solid phone for $250 you're getting 80%
of the flagship experience for a third
of the price hard to argue with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
