to be talking about some of the
frequently asked questions as far as Joe
rigging is concerned so of course I did
do a video about six or so months ago
talking about some of the you know the
frequently asked questions I bloody
decided to do today is revamp the video
talk about some new things some of the
things have changed all that kind of
good stuff so the first thing and of
course do keep mine this is mostly
targeted then you know the jailbreak
newbie someone who's never done before
just kind of a little curious about what
it's all about whoever if you've ever
jailbroken before it's probably not
going to be particularly useful for you
out of course feel free to stick around
anyway so the first question is what is
a tethered compared to an untethered
jailbreak and now I get this one a lot
there are a lot of different types of
jail breaks and ganna kinda gets people
confused I'm basically and unto the
jailbreak is what you want that's that's
the best type of jailbreak what it means
is once you've jailbroken you're free
that you turn your device on and off do
whatever you want as many times you want
it's not really going to affect anything
and what a TED jailbreak is is what that
means is when you go to shut your ipod
iphone ipad when you go to shut totally
off not just in your lock screen but
when you to shut totally off and you
need to reboot it so for example if
you're getting on an airplane you know
you need to shut your phone off when
you're you know and in flight or
whatever like that need to show it
totally off well when you go to turn
back on it will not properly boot until
you plug it into your computer and rerun
the jailbreak program it's certainly an
annoyance and it's a fairly big one at
that which is why typically i prefer to
always used unto the jailbreaks unless
there's some major problem or whatever
so that basically the the difference is
i mean the gym work will be bad about
the saying you know there won't be major
issues but if you need to restart your
phone or anything like that you will
need to plug it into your computer and
reset it rerun the jailbreak so just so
that the phone will boots so just kind
of a try to clear that up for you
another thing is what are some of the
cons of jailbreaking this is again a
very very common question because
obviously you know you are hacking your
phone or your iPod or your iPad or
whatever it is but you are hacking it in
there are some downsides involved the
first of which indefinitely the biggest
is as far as updating goes so of course
you know typically if you're not Joe
broken this new iOS firmware come out
you plug your iPod or iPhone or whatever
entry computer update no big deal
however when you do this with
jailbreaking it is
definitely not encouraged whatsoever as
let's say I'm on four point two point
one right now and you know 4.3 comes out
tomorrow or whatever and so it's like
okay well I don't want to go update well
if i plug my device into my computer
update the firmware then it i will
basically lose my jailbreak and which is
definitely not something you want to do
so what i always recommend is don't
update your ipods your iphones or
anything don't update unless you know
there is a jailbreak on the firmware
that you're about to update to this is
very simple usually it only takes a
couple of days sometimes it can take
weeks or months but typically you know
it's then a few days it'll be all set so
what you do is just wait hold up don't
update and then you know when let's say
the new red snow or whatever the
jailbreak comes out that will work
preferably untethered of course then
you'll be able to update and then read
jailbreak after that as far as when you
read jailbreak you will lose all of your
cydia apps that's pretty much just have
the way it works but there are several
things in city that allow you to back
them up such as apt backup which is
definitely recommend you guys take a
look at and as far as some of the pros
of jailbreaking go this is this is my
favorite part because there are quite a
few so the number one thing is full
freedom over your device now this is
something I've been talking about for
years I really think I mean your apples
slowly getting a little bit better if
you take a look at the app store there
are a lot of apps they're not included
or not allowed so you look at by
customization tweaks Moz themes none of
that stuff is going to be allowed and
well should the app stores great and you
do of course have full access to extra
which is a so kind of an odd thing when
you jailbreak is not like you can no
longer buy any apps or go on the app
store it's not true at all all does add
cydia but the app store is just not
really not going to be you know equipped
to allow you to you know give you a new
/ alternate advice or whatever you want
to do so well that's where city comes in
which is the basically the jailbreaking
app store now with city you can download
kinds of tweaks themes mods mean there's
all kinds of cool stuff you can do and
let customize your device to suit your
particular needs ok so for the second
segment III live i'll be taking live
questions from everyone in the chat as
always every episode d3 live is filmed
in front of a live audience on blog TV
we have quite a few people in the room
right now so let's take some of their
questions and answer some more I
frequently asked questions about
jailbreaking so is jailbreaking illegal
that's a fantastic question now
previously a couple
back it was in kind of a gray area was
that explicitly legal it was not
explicitly illegal in the United States
now do keep in mind this is all about
the United States laws of course very
all around the world but recently there
was a new restriction or rather an
implementation whatever you want fault
but there's a new law added that
basically made jailbreaking and a phone
or you know i can android phone whatever
but it specifically of course an iphone
made it one hundred percent legal now
this is great obviously it was never
like i said was never really illegal
apple never tried to sue anyone or
anything like that but in the united
states it is one hundreds of legal to
jailbreak your phone so that's that's
definitely good news the jailbreaking
cause any health risks uh no it doesn't
of course as far as your device goes
which i'm assuming that's what you meant
um you know there's always a chance and
i do want to try to say this even know
if it's a one in three million chin
there's always a chance that it could
harm your device however there are a lot
of things no matter you know if you in
the middle of jailbreaking you unplug
the cable and you know talk sure i voted
against the room or whatever mean you
know as long as you follow the tutorials
that i put as well as quite a few other
people around the internet put out you
should really never had any issues and
if you do have issues that are quite a
few different things you can do to save
your phone or whatever so i've been
jailbroken I've jailbroken dozens and
dozens of times over the years and I've
never had a device break and I've used
some pretty crazy stuff and you know
down some stuff it and you really never
should do so really I would not worry
about breaking your device could you
should you be concerned about phone
hijacking or other unwanted things on
your jailbroken device that's actually
than another great question something
that a lot of people have talked about
is the security aspect now when you
break down the you know the wall and
allow all kinds of different things to
run on your phone what that can do of
course it's allow viruses or malicious
things that can steal your data we're on
the possibilities there and i will say
that yes the possibility is there when
you jailbreak your device on you it's
not like you go from being mostly secure
to slightly less secure however on the
other hand generally the jailbreak
community is is pretty tight-knit i mean
it's not it's not like we're filled with
spammers and people who are out to steal
your data typically everything is you
know people keep a pretty good eye on it
we've never really had any major issues
with people you know stealing your
information whatever typical it actually
happens with your naive and jailbroken
and about in the beginning I'm actually
that kind of comes around to a pretty
good point for example the latest four
point three point three release that
just came out and was basically about
fixing the size of the location so of
course Apple is tracking your location
all that kind of stuff what's saving it
well within a couple of hours there's
already a cydia tweak that basically
eliminated that which is great so well
yes there is a possibility typically
jailbreaking actually does more to
increase your security than decrease it
what is breaking your iDevice mean what
that is breaking of course it's kind of
a bad term but breaking your device
means that's dead you know if you what
full of reason your iPod your iPhone
your iPad it's dead there's nothing you
can do there's no tricks I mean that's
the point where it's totally dead now
people kind of over use the term
breaking of it if something goes wrong
in the middle of it and it's not doing
anything they call it break which is not
the case in my opinion a breakthrough
device just means you'll go throw it
away it's totally useless whereas you
know there can be problems where you
know the screen might stop working or
whatever like that which you can reset
it you can do different things to get to
work so yeah typically what breaking
means that's totally busted but I would
say the vast majority of people who
think they're having a brick device do
not there there's a way to fix it what's
the worst thing that can happen when
jailbreaking well coming back to that is
being bricked you know a few you know
there are a lot of different things but
basically like you know if you unplugged
it while you were jailbreaking or you
know your you know your computer crashed
or something something like that
happened your device can technically be
destroyed on that destroyed but break
but again very very very my new chance
of that and I would say there's almost
the same amount of chance if you know
you I would say there's a much much
larger chance of you dropping your phone
or anything like that then having any
harm happen to it via jailbreaking
what's the difference between an unlock
and a jailbreak now I'm not going to get
too far into unlocking that is a totally
separate thing but a jailbreak is
basically allowing you to install cydia
which allows you of course in turn to
install all kinds of tweaks ma's seems
all that kind of stuff so did you have
city on your device and it's running
that is technically a jailbroken device
well not technically but nine option of
the time when you had city on your
device it's considered jailbreaking I
know as far as an unlock
an unlock takes it one step further so
if you have an iPhone and let's say
you're and you in the US and you're on
AT&amp;amp;T and for some reason you decide you
want to switch over to t mobile well of
course you can't do that normally but if
you have the proper baseband all that
stuff and again I don't want to really
get into to specific into the unlocking
all kind of stuff but if you wanted to
change it over to t-mobile or something
you absolutely could do that via
unlocking so guys that's about it for my
jailbreaking frequently asked questions
hopefully this answers some of your
questions about jailbreaking someone
can't clear up some of the confusion and
whatnot of course if you do have any
