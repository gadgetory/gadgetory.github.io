of the Game Boy Color so the Game Boy
Color was the first real successor to
the original Nintendo Game Boy that was
came out all the way back in 1989 now of
course there were a couple of game boys
in between for example there was the
Gameboy pocket like right here but it
was pretty much the exact same as the
original Gameboy
of course it was much much smaller
besides that played the same game same
graphics all that kind of stuff
another also was another game was the
Gameboy light on this was actually a
much rarer pan only and it was again
very similar to the Gameboy pocket
except the fact that it did have a
backlit screen took double-a batteries
however once the gameboy color came out
it was the like I said the first real
successor to the Gameboy on it featured
a twice as fast processor twice as much
RAM it had a full color screen so it had
a lot going for it so it's going to show
you guys all about it so to start with
let's go and just take a look around the
console so that it did come in quite a
few different colors I actually have a
green and a blue one here but actually
as you can see in the logo those were
some of the five colors came in like a
red color a purple this green a yellow
blue and also came in quite a few other
colors but for just today I just go
ahead and show you my green one I
believe it was Kiwi but don't quote me
on that but definitely a very very
vibrant color um so from the screen
actually I'll go ahead and just pull up
the Gameboy pocket just as a comparison
the screen was actually a little bit
smaller than on the Gameboy pocket I'm
not so sure how well you guys could see
that but it was a decent bit smaller
however they both had the same
resolution and of course the game would
color whereas this one was just you know
black and white this way actually was
capable of I believe about 50,000 colors
or so although again don't quote me on
exactly what that it was but it was
definitely a very nice looking screen
especially compared to the Gameboy
pocket um of course it does have the
standard a B your d-pad and you're
starting slight buttons from the
original game boys um very very nicely
done Porsche gnome just what you expect
from a Game Boy you do have one speaker
and actually just while I'm just showing
you guys you can see here it had a
really nice kind of texture that should
delight picks it up really nicely here
um that was something that Nintendo
actually I wish that would be something
that they would continue to do was that
this plastic I mean this
boy here I've had it for 12 years or so
and I mean there's no scratches on it so
that was something they really did right
with the Game Boy Color I mean you just
couldn't scratch them really I mean of
course the screen a little bit but you
know for something this old that was
pretty impressive the way they use that
plastic I'm so flipping around on the
bottom you do have a an AC adapter where
you go ahead and just plug it into the
wall so that was nice you know it had
pretty good battery life obviously if
you can just plug it in it's not a big
deal I'm over here we do have a
headphone jack so flipping around on
this side there's not a hole I can see
it does kind of keep the same sort of
bulge from the Gameboy die augen just
pull it in here so you guys can see I
mean this kind of keep the same general
shape but instead of having this kind of
these little grooves that are cut out
specifically for the batteries and the
gameboy color had a little bit more
rounded which actually did feel really
nice in the hand you know it really
count did lock in
so it was bellows that was a pretty cool
feature of course you do have your
volume button and you do have your
Gameboy link cable as well as a little
port for lanyard or / accessories so up
on the front I mean you have the game
cartridge I'll get back to that just in
a second but one thing that was pretty
unique about the Game Boy Color was the
fact that it actually did have an
infrared so basically the way it worked
and very few games took advantage of
this but basically each Gameboy had one
and this was only in the Game Boy Color
they didn't have it in any previous
versions as well they did not keep it in
the Game Boy Advance
basically what you could do is you take
the infrared ports roughly about like
that just keep them a couple inches
apart and then for certain games like I
said there were very few I believe we're
about less than 20 or so but basically
go ahead and send high scores and do
different things like that just totally
wirelessly which back then was pretty
cool and of course you did still have
the Gameboy link cable so you can do
that too which was what most of the
games used I'm so coming around here
that's pretty much all you do have is
on/off switch and of course the Game Boy
Color since it was a how-to did have a
color screen like the kind of contrast
dial from previous game boys I'm so
flipping it over here you have your game
cartridge slot and of course one really
unique thing especially back then the
fact the gameboy color actually took
original Game Boy games so that was
really cool
I mean this was one of the very first
consoles to actually feature backwards
compatibility so that was really cool
because you know a lot of times when a
new console came out back then is like
well you have to buy on the games for it
but not most of the people who bought a
game what color had the original Gameboy
game so you go ahead just swap them
right in they work so as you can see
here you have some labels and everything
like that and of course the gameboy
color does take two double-a batteries
as you can see here the screen
definitely did look pretty nice on the
gameboy color so it wasn't I mean
obviously compared to no the iPhones and
PS PS of today is nothing really all
that impressive but again this was back
in the days where you know everything
was black and white you know so it was a
definitely a really nice set to finally
get some color on a gameboy now as far
as the graphics were they're actually
fairly improved from the Gameboy pocket
and the Gameboy the 1989 Gameboy um now
it's kind of hard to say exactly how
good they were
um I kind of tend to think that they
were somewhat comparable to the NES the
original Nintendo um maybe not quite on
that level but they were still a pretty
decent of course I mean this back then I
mean this was on a tiny little handheld
so that was definitely a really cool
feature
um yeah should go ahead and play some
pretty nice-looking games most of them
didn't kind of tend to be RPG that was
really what the gameboy color was really
good at such as the Pokemon series as
well as quite a few more however there
are all kinds of really cool games for
the Game Boy Color so that's about it
for my review of the Game Boy Color so
guys the Game Boy Color was my very
first Gameboy my very first handheld
console um and I really really got a ton
of you said it was such a great console
back then I mean I was it was so awesome
that should be able to play with your
friends and of course this was back when
Pokemon was huge so that was the main
draw you know you know you go grab your
link cable go trade your Pokemon you go
fight each other which was just enormous
back in the late 90s but regardless of
all that there's still such so many
great games for the Game Boy Color and
yes of course there is I mean if you're
wanting to just play the games you know
you might be better served with a Game
Boy Advance or maybe even a Game Boy
dance SP which of course do play all the
original Game Boy games was the Game Boy
Color games but guys you know if you
grew up with it like me or you know this
is just kind of the way yet play I mean
you know it's just kind of
same way where you know you've got like
Sega Genesis games etc etc like maybe
the Xbox 360 but you know what why would
you want to play that when you guys go
ahead and play it on the real deal on it
anyways though guys if you're interested
in get picking up a gameboy color
there's not a whole lot to look out for
obviously a handheld console of any type
you have to watch out for the obvious
kind of wear and tear and as always all
with all game boys make sure that when
you turn on the screen it will actually
go ahead and boot up you won't see any
kind of scan lines broken or anything
like that
um so that's pretty much it and about
the last thing I guess I would say would
be um take a look right here at the
cartridge shot if there's a lot of wear
that kind of just kind of tends to tell
you how much it was worn but generally
as long as you can go ahead pop a game
in to the gameboy color that you're
thinking about and as long as it works
pretty much you're set to go because a
game boys were built really really
robustly there really wasn't a whole lot
that did go wrong on to my guys we're
interested in picking one up they're
really pretty these days I definitely
recommend you do it game would call was
a fantastic console anyway guys thanks
