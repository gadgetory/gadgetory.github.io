with a kind of special episode we're
doing today on both of our channels here
right now I have Duncan 33 303 with me
AKA austin evans how are you doing today
doing great doing great ray to film this
for the second time oh yeah we had a
little bit of interruption the first
time we filmed this video something
about aliens coming and stuff like that
but what are we here to do at would only
be we're gonna be talking about the next
generation iphone which is supposedly
rumored to possibly come out in the next
week month something now it now it is
scheduled to be announced on the fourth
October we did hear that yesterday with
the let's talk iphone thing the
invitation that was sent to the loop it
was the loop the only place i got it
sent tonight i have no idea i don't i'm
sure they sent it to everybody who you
know all the major places who are going
but we'll see I honestly can't wait for
October for it there's been there's been
a little bit of hype like built up upon
this new device that's coming out this
year I really think that the major thing
will be once LTE is settled down with
AT&amp;amp;T and everything and I you know
there's a lot of rumors going around
that there's going to be two devices
there's gonna be the 4s and the iphone 5
the 4s being the lower end iphone and
the iphone 5 being like for the hardcore
fans that actually on it in everything
bigger screen the a5 processor the
teardrop design like you said now let's
speculate a little bit on that what what
is the difference between the iphone 4s
and the iphone 5 other than the price
range all right well so what will the
way the rumors go is that there's going
to be an iphone 4s the basically
basically is as an iphone 4 now there
may be a couple of tweaked designs i
heard something maybe a possibly like
they might redo the intent a little bit
but for the most part of the major
changes would be it would have a new aim
a pixel camera which of course you know
the camera on the iphone 4s not that bad
but they would improve that and they
would put the Apple Apple a5 chip from
the ipad 2 now that's what the 4s is all
about what we heard it's gonna be very
very similar kind of like a 3g to 3gs
iphone 4 to the 4s now on the other hand
we
her about the iphone 5 or you know the
big daddy what are you gonna call it but
the major update and what this one's all
about is it brings the same Cameron
brings the same Apple a5 dual-core
processor but it also adds a bigger
display of 3.7 or maybe even 4 inches
and also a kind of teardrop design or
you know tapered with me probably made
of aluminum kind of like a iphone
version of the macbook air so that's
mostly what we've heard and there's been
plenty of talk back and forth about
there's gonna be an iphone 4s I mean
iphone 5 there's gonna be both it should
be this it's gonna be that see that's
what we're here to talk about I guess
now now judging from what you just told
me that that doesn't seem like a big
selling point for Apple I mean they put
make the screen a little bit bigger they
change the design but do you think
really it people are gonna go for that
do you think just because it's the same
that would mean it would have the same
specs as the 4s except with a bigger
screen in just a redesign do you really
think people care that much about like a
tiny bit of change in the screen and a
different design does it really that
matter that much I remember hearing
things about people calling it the
iphone pro that was a while ago so i got
an alarm going enough more distractions
at least we're not gonna like us not any
film that we're not gonna stop i mean do
you really think that that's going to be
something that people will actually want
compared like compared to a macbook pro
to a regular macbook which is now
discontinued because of the errors and
stuff but do you think that apple can
actually sell that well i think it's
going to come down to price a lot of the
rumors about the 4s is that it's going
to be a lot cheaper now of course the
iphones have always been like two
hundred dollars on contract but of
course you're on a contract and you know
there's a subsidy everything and the
phone real price of the phone is used to
someone in the six seven hundred dollar
price range or so now of course i expect
if the iphone 5 is real it's gonna be
coming everything that it'll be you know
about the same price maybe a little bit
cheaper more expensive but roughly about
the same price now what what the really
big thing about the 4s if it's real and
if it was a really serious about it is
going after the lower priced market so
of course the iphone is done
tremendously well against android and
everything else with just the single
very expensive phone you know all things
considered with an iphone 4s if they
could get it much cheaper so something
in the range of you know three
350-400 dollars off contract which
forced me out about half the price and
of course if it was on contract to
cabeza you know fifty dollars or perhaps
even free on contract I think it will go
a long way not to really take sales away
from the iphone 5 I mean I still think
that if you have the money to upgrade to
iphone 5 you're going to want the best
you're on the screen and the better
designer thing but I think I think what
the 4s is really about is going after
the lower end market and where android
is really just I mean there's just
nothing apple just doesn't have anything
there so if the 4s Israel and that's
what it's all about I think that's
really they would have to aim it that
lower price point to get you know that
the different kind of market so you
think with the forest they're going for
a more marketing standpoint of it being
unlocked for everyone you think they're
gonna be selling it as an unlocked phone
or still on AT&amp;amp;T as a subsidized
contract thing I think it'd be a mixture
I think they would have well there's of
course there's a unlocked version of the
iphone four you can buy right now not
many will really buy it I think they
would just they would probably do both
you know they would private on several
carriers them even happen you on sprint
and verizon agent Jamie they yeah I
don't I don't see a reason why they
couldn't do that and still have a pretty
nice emphasis on hey you know what you
can sign it to your contract to get this
thing for 50 bucks or free or one
hundred dollars or whatever they end up
deciding or if you want to pay three
four hundred dollars whatever you get it
forget the contract and you'll put it on
different carriers especially if it has
the chipset where you can actually go
gsm cdma so you can you know hot between
whatever carriers you want I think it
could be really attractive options so
yeah I think they would just you know do
whatever lay know just kind of market
however they wanted with everything sure
well I am still sticking on my side and
if you saw the new post today on 9to5
mac they had opposed today showing some
sort of internal files from AT&amp;amp;T or was
it what was it something from their
marketplace or something from apple's
market place showing that there's gonna
be three different iphone models and
three no two new my I iphone models and
three new ipod touch models but they
said something that it was leaning more
towards being a 4s than two different
iphone models like the 4s only yeah you
know I will tell you this
all's done such a good job with the
rumors and this and that that I honestly
well I think everyone will pretty much
be surprised whatever they do because
there are a lot of people who definitely
think there's the iphone 5 there's a lot
of people definitely think it's the 4s a
lot of people who definitely they're
both I don't think one person knows well
I think very very few people know
absolutely for sure what Apple's going
to do um personally I'm leaning on the
side of the iphone 5 just iphone 5 but
to be lost if it's just for a sore if
it's both I really would be surprised on
its I really don't know but I I'm
leaning towards the five I have that
just whack yeah i can say that so I
guess we're gonna have to wait until
October fourth until we actually know
what's going on because like you said
Apple likes to keep their secrecy not
too many people know about what the next
device is going to be how many there's
going to be things like that all we've
really seen is rumors there's no actual
like solid evidence that any of this is
going to come out we've seen parts
things like that those are interesting
and all of that and they give us kind of
like a tease towards what's coming out
next but um I just really don't know I
don't know what to say if there's gonna
be one or two devices at this point
absolutely yeah i mean at like a calico
say it's just so hard they've done such
a good job of like confusing us and
there's so much like evidence like
there's evidence of everything like it's
not i mean i don't think anyone can mean
if i decide hey i'm gonna decide the 4s
i can show you 50 things of evidence
like yeah there's this part there's a
sleek there's this case is this that
that it's on all these sides so i mean i
don't know i think that we have three
features that are going to be for sure
like at least three new pieces of three
pieces of hardware that are going to be
for sure which is the a5 processor the
one gig of ram and the 8 megapixel
camera on the back I think that's what
we can know for sure I don't think we're
gonna be able to know if there's going
to be a redesign or not if there's gonna
be two phones or one phone once again
there goes my alarm but we will find out
on October fourth and that's only in a
few days so I really just can't wait for
that so everyone watching how did you
