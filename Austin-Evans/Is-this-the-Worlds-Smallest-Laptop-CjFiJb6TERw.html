world's smallest laptops so GPD just
finished up their IndieGoGo campaign and
they said that one of their very first
prototypes so let's take a look
I feel freckle Josh's ghost guiding my
hand as I unbox this package oh wow this
thing is wrapped up so this does not
look like a normal laptop box this is
the laptop are you serious or no like
that's that's it this is the entire
laptop oh wow it's actually aluminum in
fact it actually looks like a tiny
MacBook whoa when I heard the words
world's smallest laptop I assumed
something very small on plastic it
honestly seems like someone ran a
macbook through a shrink ray and that is
not a bad thing or I get too far into it
what else do we have in here we have a
USB c2c cable as well as a power brick
which I assume will use USB see I love
this hinge that feels so smooth so cool
is that while there are versions of this
that run Linux this guy is preloaded
with Windows 10 essentially what you're
getting here is a full Windows laptop
that will literally fit in the palm of
your hand now it is a touch thicker than
you might expect but because of that
they're actually able to fit a pretty
sizable battery inside something else is
cool about this is that while it is a 7
inch display it's full IPS and it is
1920 by 1200 and in person
this looks pretty nice I don't really
have a whole lot to complain about here
the keyboards are right I think the
thing that trips me out is not so much
the small size but the layout so if you
get weird things like having the
spacebar split into two different keys
you've got a lot of your punctuation
kind of squashed together and what's
really good to me is that the backspace
button has two keys above it and I
constantly want to go up and hit the
Delete key but keep in mind this is a
very very tiny laptop you're probably
not going to want to say write a paper
on it but for a quick little bit of web
browsing or something a little more
basic I think you can get away with it
so you know it doesn't have a tripod you
do have a little nub it's not the most
accurate thing in the world but it's
really not that bad obviously you have
the touch screen as well you want to get
something that's a little bit more
precise
clickers also decent so the problem is
is just a single speaker that's kind of
on the bottom so it doesn't really sound
great a little bit tinny but I don't
know I feel like I'm willing to forgive
a lot for laptops there's this tiny like
I keep freaking out just that's so cool
speaking of having a tiny laptop there
actually are a fair few ports
surprisingly so not only is there USB C
for charging as well as data but there's
also an HDMI port headphone as well as a
full size USB 3 inside the pockets are
actually pretty decent specs so it has a
quad core Intel Atom processor a full
eight gigabytes of memory as well as a
128 gigabyte SSD specialized that really
aren't bad it's what you would expect to
find a lot of budget laptops that are
obviously much larger than this now
because it is so small it does have a
cooling fan but even when it's running a
full blast it's not that loud this guy
is also walking a 7 thousand milliamp
hour battery that is not bad so
especially with specs like this in such
a small screen they claim around 12
hours of battery life and that sounds
about right now what really jumps out to
me though I keep coming back to this is
just how nice the hardware is yes it's a
little bit on the chunky side but when
you consider just what all is crammed
inside it's really a pretty decent
trade-off it's interesting at how few
compromises there are here so yeah the
screen is small and it kind of looks
like they just pulled it right off of a
tablet but that's fine it's a solid unit
and the same thing goes for running
Windows sure this might not be the
optimal Windows doing experience but
what that high-res screen and a little
bit of scaling it's actually kind of
usable like normal web browsing that
kind of stuff is totally fine honestly I
feel like the keyboard is going to be
the toughest part to get used to I think
if you're really into a smaller computer
that I think you can get used to it but
feel like all of my muscle memory just
is not there I'm constantly hitting the
wrong key I'm to kind of like squish my
hands together it's fine it's usable but
it's not really ideal at all well you
can't give this guy with Linux the idea
that it can come with full Windows 10
out of the box is really cool and with
that Atom processor and small screen yes
you're going to be slightly limited and
say doing things like video editing on
this guy but for the most part if it
runs on Windows you should be able to do
it on the pocket so the single USBC
cable not only can we get 4k 30 out but
we can also do 1080 60 although that's
not 1080
this totally works dude this is I I
guess it's like there's no reason why
this shouldn't work right but it's such
a tiny laptop my initial instinct is of
course it can't do that of course it
can't do that but it can time for some
minecraft the most amazing the game of
all time well if you're a seven inch
laptop anyway you know it's kind of cool
about the setup is that not only are we
getting a full display but with USBC
we're also charging the pocket at the
same time so essentially with one cable
kind of like a MacBook you can do
everything
fermer is not great though so maybe
playing minecraft on the external 4k
display not the best idea
oh yeah so toilet label now this is
actually playing at 1200 P right now
Minos might be degrees minecraft
computer in the world but for something
this small I think it really does make a
big difference that it actually has a
nice display I keep coming back to that
like I expect this to be small and cheap
and not very good but its quality oh I
hate this oh no the barrel okay so you
the mouse number one rule of advice
juice a mouse that was really really bad
so yeah this guy can play csgo frame
rates a little bit lower than I would
like but you should not buy this as a
gaming computer the GPD pocket is a
weird little gadget it's not for
everyone but I've got to say I actually
kind of like it so what do you guys
think about this tiny tiny little laptop
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
