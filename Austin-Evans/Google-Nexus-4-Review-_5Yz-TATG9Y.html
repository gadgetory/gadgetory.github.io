with the review of the Google Nexus 4
and Android 4.2 with high-end internals
and impressive design and the latest
tasty Android treat let's take a look a
first glance the Nexus 4 looks similar
to the Galaxy Nexus with a single
unbroken piece of glass up front without
any branding or physical buttons it's a
very clean look that reminds me of the
iPhone and it works flip the phone over
you'll see an all glass back with a very
cool looking pattern of dots that appear
and disappear depending on the lighting
that said again just like the older
iPhones you're dealing with two sheets
of glass front and back which are easily
breakable
it feels great in the hand but picking
up a case or at least a bumper probably
wouldn't be a bad idea in 9.1
millimeters it's reasonably thin but it
does feel bulkier in the hand compared
to something like a galaxy s3 thankfully
all the buttons and ports are in the
proper positions with the power button
on the top right edge volume rocker and
your Micro SIM slot on the left side
your headphone jack up top and a
microUSB port on bottom around back is
the 8 megapixel camera and the LED flash
and on the top right you'll find the 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera the screen
is a 4.7 inch display with resolution of
1280 by 768 this is slightly wider than
a typical 720p phone which does give you
a bit more width to the keyboard for
example but it really doesn't make a
huge difference as with the Galaxy Nexus
instead of physical buttons the Nexus 4
sports on screen Android keys which will
rotate with the phone in landscape mode
and disappear altogether when watching
video for example the screen itself is
an IPS panel and it's among the best
smartphone screens out there with good
viewing angles and very impressive
saturation and contrast the Nexus 4 is
running Android 4.2 jellybean which
brings several improvements from
previous versions the first thing you'll
notice is just how quick and responsive
the phone is no matter how fast you try
to go through the interface it keeps up
and easily matches the best from iOS and
Windows Phone you'll also find an
improved gesture keyboard that works
similarly to swipe allowing you to trace
out the letters you want to type and let
autocorrect figure out what you mean
there's also a new quick settings menu
in the notifications that allows you to
toggle Wi-Fi brightness and more to
quick glance the lockscreen has also
been totally redesigned you can select
to the right to get quick access to the
camera and you can also add widgets such
as texting calendar and email and
third-party ads will be able to use this
as well another somewhat useful feature
is daydream which works like a
screensaver that displays the time
photos or news from Google Currents when
the phone is docked Google now
seen some major improvements it can now
check Gmail to see if you have anything
being shipped to you reservations at a
hotel or for a plane and much more it
also remains as fast as ever what's the
weather going to be like in Los Angeles
tomorrow tomorrow's forecast for Los
Angeles is 70 degrees and mostly sunny
when is the Super Bowl the NFL Super
Bowl is on Sunday February 3rd 2013
the camera app has also been totally
redesigned instead of digging through
menus you can just tap and then change
whatever setting you're looking for it's
quick and makes every other camera app
out there look outdated the eight
megapixel stills themselves are good
colors are accurate and it's quite easy
to get a very nice contrast to image as
you guys can see here the 1080p video on
the nexus 4 isn't half bad
now probably my biggest complaint is the
lack of autofocus as you guys can see
here I was just up close on the Android
and I give it a minute yeah there we go
it will focus but there's no way to tap
on the screen to autofocus if I touch
instead of when take a picture which is
fine but there's no real way to manually
autofocus which is kind of a big deal
once you've shot pictures there's a very
impressive built-in editor you can add
Instagram like filters which are decent
but you can also go more in depth with
contrast saturation and even adjusting
the curves there's also a new
photosphere mode that allows you to take
several pictures from a single area and
then it stitches them together to give
you a result like Google Street View the
final product is a full 360-degree
panorama that you can swipe through and
share on Google+ which looks really
impressive although it is a bit low
resolution powering the Nexus 4 is a
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz paired with 2
gigabytes of RAM and Adreno 320 graphics
this delivers some outstanding scores
right on par with other high-end phones
like the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and HTC
Droid DNA and is easily enough to handle
graphically intense games at a
reasonable frame rate the phone does
tend to get warm when enter long periods
of stress but a normal use it isn't an
issue one minor downside is the lack of
expandable storage with only a gigabyte
and 16 by varieties to choose from
you're going to be limited on space and
having a micro SD card slot would have
helped quite a bit
speaking of minor Hardware issues the
speaker on the back isn't particularly
loud and the sound is a bit washed out
by far the biggest problem with the
Nexus 4 is the lack of LTE if you live
in an area with LTE this isn't
problem but if you have it available it
really is much faster battery life is
reasonable with continuous light web
browsing you'll see a bit over five
hours of use it's on the lower end of
most smartphones but it should be enough
to get most people through a full day of
use the Google Nexus 4 is easily one of
the best smartphones period Android 4.2
is extremely smooth and brings some very
nice improvements the build quality and
design are top-notch and it's packing
some of the most powerful specs in any
phone yet the lack of LTE is an issue
but it only $300 off contract the Nexus
4 is a spectacular phone if you're
interested in more videos on the Nexus 4
