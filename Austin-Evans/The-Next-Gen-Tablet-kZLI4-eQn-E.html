here at the video on one of the most
interesting products I've seen in quite
a while this is the Lenovo yoga book
first of all I've got to give a big
shout out to Lenovo for sponsoring this
video
tablets have been boring for quite a
while however this promises to spice
things up a bit so the first thing that
jumps out to me is this is seriously fen
I think part of that is due to this
crazy hinge that is such a cool touch on
top of that it's actually easy to have
to do with pretty much one finger and I
might be wrong here but it looks like it
has a camera on the keyboard so I guess
my thought is is that when you want to
take a rear-facing shot yeah the camera
is on the keyboard that is actually kind
of cool it's all metal it's all glass
it's got this nice soft touch finish on
the keyboard and I can't get over how
cool this hinge is just watching it
that's such a cool design you can bend
it all the way back lay it flat close it
up
this feels like a really high-end device
and honestly for five hundred dollars
this is a lot more than what you should
expect to get this is really nice so
before we go to in depth on this guy see
what else comes in the box because this
has a couple of interesting accessories
honestly it's more than just what it
looks like oh wait this is paper so one
of the cool things about the yoga is
that you set the pages down on the
keyboard if using some touch magic will
actually allow you to write on real
paper and digitize it I'm getting a
little excited it's rare to find a new
gadget that actually has like some legit
like actually cool features I mean look
at that this is like some straight out
of the matrix like I feel like this is
what when I was younger I figured in
2016 I will be using one of these guys
whoa so there's no actual physical click
on it at all and you can see that when
the actual yoga is on it lights up but
that feels really interesting there's
like a little bit of like tactile
feedback it's something you get used to
reasonably quickly after a couple hours
I found myself close to my normal typing
speed the lack of physical buttons is
understandable due to just how thin the
yoga book is and you've got quite a few
options to customize including the touch
points which learn and readjust based on
your typing this all works together with
the real pin which you can use with the
normal stylus tip as a drawing tool or
swap with an ink cart to draw with any
paper over the keyboard and it'll
translate into a digital drawing this is
really cool stuff for taking notes or
sketching and one of my personal
favorite features is any pen turn this
on in settings
touchscreen will respond to nearly
anything conductive which is seriously
entertaining I could play with this all
day that screen also happens to be a
great display anyway it's a 10.1 inch
1920 by 1200 panel that has solid color
and brightness inside it's rocking an
Intel Atom x5 processor four gigs of RAM
and 64 gigs of storage with microSD
expansion but interestingly there are
two models there's the standard Android
Edition that I have here but Lenovo also
has a yoga book that runs Windows 10 the
Android version has been heavily
customized with features like a
navigation bar a multi window support
and it generally works pretty well
you'll occasionally run into an app that
gets confused this hardware is so cool
that I honestly can't wait to get my
hands on the Windows version to see what
it can really do the yoga book is
totally unique right now it works well
as a laptop while not compromising on
being a good tablet if you're looking
for a portable device for getting work
done it's definitely worth a look so
what do you guys think about the yoga
book let me know in the comments below
and big shout out to Lenovo for making
this video possible if you want to know
more go check out some of the other
videos on the yoga book and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
