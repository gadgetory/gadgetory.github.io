been arrested that badly by construction
before and Steve we're here with mystery
tech under $40 this is gonna be fun
time for kids cellphone pros and cons
okay hold on what year is this from this
is from 2018 this is from 2018 this
looks like a like a 1997 thing some
people spend too much time on their
phones they talk text and play games all
day long with a few breaks these people
have what's known as cell phone
addiction I bet you're watching this
video on a cell phone right now aren't
you
Jimmy I will not post photos of videos
of other people without asking them
first
I will ask my parents before it download
a new app I mean what practical and
legit advice for well I'm sure our
eight-year-olds okay
connect a desk the desk that connects to
you hold on hold on hold on 54 74/54
that's not $40 to be fair before
shipping and handling was $44 so I'll
give you a tentative pass there I get my
shoulders in here and then it over like
oh yeah yeah there we go there we go
that's that's much more like it I feel
ready to use a laptop already so let's
say I want to use my laptop here
hands-free of course I'm just gonna open
it up actually it's only really big
enough for an 11 inch MacBook this
doesn't seem like the dumbest thing I've
ever used
what's that what is this a trackball
mouse wait nope
so it comes to the USB receiver so I
plug it into my macbook here what hold
on hold on this is a game changer so
I've got if you can see here the
trackball so basically the trackball as
well as an inside little click it feels
like the world's cheapest HTC vive
controller look at that
this is really dumb I don't know what
I'm doing with my life at all right now
wait headphones wait
especially looks okay so these are these
Samson SR 850 professional studio
reference headphones and at what less
than 40 bucks I hope exactly 40 okay
it's very plasticky but they feel like
they should cost a lot more than 40
bucks okay okay
immediately why here $40 in headphones
my instinct is that they're going to be
garbage town but these actually sound
pretty good especially for open design
headphones actually have a surprising
amount of bass 32 dollars what a
relative bargain all right you know what
32 bucks dude I mean this is a
no-brainer if you're looking for a
decent pair of headphones especially if
you're on a budget these are look let's
look juvenile II surprising and I know
that it might be hard taking advice from
a guy with a MacBook attached to his
back but trust me when I say but 32
bucks you're not gonna get much better
than this to actually take this off no
order there are more things oh wait
digital microscope oh hey we've got a
signal wow that is a ton of detail huh
now we've got the flux capacitor it was
actually pretty cool I mean it's kind of
useless and I don't know why and one
actually really needs this but whatever
the cool thing that was this app actual
allow you to take photos and video so
you want to like snap a cool shot inside
of your DeLorean it actually does kind
of work I first was like ah this is
gonna be weird and like crappy but no it
totally works and you can get really
really close like I'm just gonna
literally just put it like right on top
of this you can see like the individual
pockets of rust you also cannot hold it
steady at all all right for 40 bucks
I tell a little bit of a novelty it's a
little bit weird this especially if you
do anything with like super detailed
things like models or whatever this
actually is kind of cool way of being
able to take pic pictures video sort of
whatever the case is with something
that's going to be really really small
what is this spero mini oh I've actually
played with spheres before we did the
the cars thing rotate the white dot
until the blue light on your robot is
playing at you all right touch and drag
to move
whoa okay that's faster no this way
yeah there we go yeah face drive yeah I
like to do face Drive how do you do this
okay hold it near your face use your
facial expressions to drive okay oh it
does it wait wait Mitchell Mitchell okay
yeah I guess this is the thing I don't
know I mean I'm sure some people are
gonna think of this is really fun I
think was enough practice you could
probably get better at it oh no no
didn't you we already did this with the
robot the robot dinosaure I don't pet me
I react to your touch let's go for a
walk
what okay no no don't do that don't do
that
Rikki's go forward okay hold on hold on
wait all right Oh chippies mean this is
like angry chippy ruff
yeah terrible card dog solutely
hopefully you guys enjoyed this
wonderful look at toys that you totally
were expecting to find when you clicked
on this video if you want to find links
to any of this stuff that actually is
pretty good in this video including
those headphones the link will be in the
description hey guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one chippie will not catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
