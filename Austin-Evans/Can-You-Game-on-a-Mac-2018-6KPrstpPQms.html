we've done a lot of videos exploring
whether or not you can game on a Mac
spoiler alert usually the answer is yes
but not all that well however its 2018
and some things have recently changed
you know the last time we did this video
we were trying it on a $200 MacBook and
as you imagine for something that is so
old the results weren't all that
impressive but today we have a 2016 15
inch MacBook Pro in front of us as well
as a whole host of toys that are fresh
and ready to go
it sounds like I'm describing a pizza
I'm describing gaming computers because
hi now the simplest way to game on a Mac
is going to be to use a streaming
service such as NVIDIA GeForce now now
this is actually something that was able
to work all the way down onto the $200
laptop and personally as far as I'm
concerned it's one of the better ways of
gaming here as long as you have a decent
internet connection the way in streaming
service like GeForce now works is that
instead of running it on your computer
which could be a problem if you're
running a Mac and therefore it can't
play a lot of games is that in stay
that's going to be streaming it from the
cloud now the main thing to keep in mind
here is that you do need to have a good
internet connection so especially when
you're playing like high intensity games
such as Fortnight for example having a
good internet connection is going to be
hugely vital all right we are in the
game so there's a couple things that you
are going to notice with a setup like
this first of all there's going to be
latency there's always going to be some
latency so for this it's it's hard to
tell just based on what looking at it
I'd say maybe it's like a quarter of a
second or so it doesn't seem to be too
bad but something else that's going to
be noticeable is the reduction in image
quality because you're essentially just
looking at a video feed as opposed to
play in the game natively depending on
your connection you will see some
artifacts although to be honest this
looks pretty close to a native set up
right now as long as you have a good
internet connection I really feel like
GeForce now is worth a shot now the only
thing you should keep in mind is that
while it is free it's going to be in
beta right now and so unless you've
actually signed up in the past there's
going to be a wait list so it might be a
little while before you can actually get
your hands on the service but for free
especially if you want to be able to
play games on the go on something like a
Mac it really actually does make a lot
of sense also was a sight note GeForce
now is available on PC as well so you
guys want more information on how it
works and especially on the PC side of
things I did do a full video at CES this
you guys could go checkout continued on
the streaming train we have one cast so
if you guys are familiar with Xbox one
streaming on a Windows PC it's really
straightforward so basically as long as
you have your Xbox and your Windows
computer on the same network you can
stream games from your Xbox to your PC
and generally speaking when you're over
a very short distance say you know a
local Network latency is not going to be
too bad
and with one cast that brings that same
functionality to the Mac I actually
haven't tried this yet so let's give it
a try the app is pretty straightforward
you just need to install the drivers for
your Xbox one controller which you're
going to need and then once you login to
your Xbox account we hit connect it
should get us on to our Xbox yeah there
we go so if I'm trying to scroll through
here it seems to be just like I'm
playing on normal Xbox alright we're in
the game the first thing I'll say is
that video quality is kind of so-so
looks like there's more compression than
there wasn't GeForce now yeah it does
seem like there's a little bit more lag
than there was with GeForce now the
image quality is definitely not as nice
now to be fair you should always expect
some latency but considering that
instead of running on a server who knows
how many miles away I'm running on an
Xbox it's only a few feet away that's a
little bit annoying yeah I mean it's a
$20 program which is definitely not
going to be cheap luckily there is going
to be a free trial so you can give it a
try and if it sucks then you can bail on
it but I've got to say I'm actually kind
of disappointed I think I think we can
do better now as with any computer
whether it be PC or Mac the GPU matters
when it comes to gaming now hiring Mac's
such as the iMac as well as the MacBook
Pro 15 inch that I have here I actually
do have somewhat decent GPUs inside
however when it comes to lower end stuff
such as the 13-inch MacBook Pro the
12-inch MacBook as well as the MacBook
Air they're all going to have integrated
graphics and are going to have a lot
more trouble gaming at least right out
of the box now external Thunderbolt
enclosures are nothing new but they've
gotten a lot better and they've gotten a
lot more well supported you can see
something like an rx 580 can fit in a
nice small package but on top of that
this also will work on Windows all you
need is a Thunderbolt 3 port and it
should be good to go just keep in mind
that you should connect your display to
the actual graphics card as opposed to
your computer it'll definitely help
alleviate any kind of bottlenecks in the
actual Thunderbolt 3 interface but once
you get up it should be a
seamless setup so to start out with
we're going to be using the MacBook Pro
15 inch with its standard graphics card
and we're going to be using a little
game called rocket League so using my
xbox one controller I'm curious to see
what kind of performance tramatic get
here I was able to actually crank the
graphics pretty much all the way up and
it actually is not going to be too bad
so as some of you guys are probably
aware steam is supported on the Mac and
if you buy a game on Steam for Windows
you are going to be able to play it on
the Mac provided that there is another
version this is actually not bad at all
we're getting 68 frames per second or so
here 67 Wow this is totally playable
next up let's try to see what we can do
with the actual gaming box connected so
like I was saying earlier the set up is
going to be really straightforward
we've got Thunderbolt 3 into the box and
then we've got the Box going DisplayPort
into the monitor this is pretty nice and
smooth although I've got to say the
frame rate actually is not going to be a
huge difference so as opposed to being
in the mid 60's instead we're somewhere
in the 80s oh there we go alright I will
say one thing even though this is not
making a massive difference rocket
league is surprisingly playable on Mac I
honestly really can't see any major
differences and especially with a nice
high refresh rate monitor the
performance is really not going to be
too bad so to put this whole setup to
the test a little bit more we have Deus
Ex mankind divided now this is a game
that is well known to be very taxing but
it's also an interesting title because
it does support metal essentially the
Mac OS version of something like DirectX
12 or volcán so for some context we're
running this right now at 1080p very
high settings on the natural GPU as you
can see performance isn't exactly great
we're getting summer in the neighborhood
of well exactly 14 frames per second so
move over to the gigabyte gaming box
with the RX 580 inside and we can see
something that's a lot more cinematic
with a whopping 24 actually 25 frames
per second now keep in mind this is
obviously not going to be an ideal
scenario we would really want to
probably turn the graphics thing it's
down a little bit but this does show
that we're getting someone the
neighborhood have about double the
performance by plugging in an external
GPU next up we have dirt rally this is a
game that has some slight issues on Mac
most notably when you have dual monitors
so I had to bust out the keyboard and
close the MacBook display so we're only
running on one monitor but here running
can a DP on Ultra settings on the
MacBooks GPU we're getting somewhere in
the neighborhood of 35 to 40 frames per
second definitely playable it's not
going to be the smoothest experience in
the world if we plug into gaming box
what we're seeing is there is going to
be a little bit of a performance
difference but it's actually not going
to be that big so for certain scenes
when you've got the full car in view
it's going to be only a few frames per
second higher now right now we're a
little bit more in the 40s although even
here look it's dipping to like 38 39
it's a little unusual I'm not sure if
dirt needs an update to fully support it
or something's going on here but a
little bit better not by a lot though
moving right along we have fortnight for
what feels like the 18th time in this
video so this is running on the MacBook
and right now we're actually running it
pretty decent settings this is going to
be 1080p on high and at least in the sky
here it's not too bad everyone starts
jumping out and it starts tanking and
wow that's okay I spoke too soon okay
nothing like a whole lot of four frames
per second ah there we go
that's better so it seems like we are
hovering around the 30 or 40 frames per
second mark but man that's dead earning
is not good but I actually do want to
get a good sense of what the MacBook can
do on the same settings is what we're
going to be able to run with the RX 580
whoo that's uh oh yeah that's stuttering
so with our rx 580 what we're seeing
here is immediately a much higher
framerate we're getting somewhere in
neighborhood of 40 to 50 but weirdly
we're still seeing that same stuttering
issue I'm not really sure what that is I
mean it doesn't feel like it's going to
be a network thing it's not like a
latency sort of issue because I mean I
even get it sometimes I'm just sort of
scrolling around here it's interesting
generally speaking for tonight is a very
well optimized game on everything from
Windows PCs to iOS but here a Mac it
seems like it's got some issues well
okay so now that we've actually spawned
everything seems to be smoothed out a
little bit
it's a weird issue because it doesn't
seem to be related to sort of the power
I mean right now this is totally
playable again a solid 50 frames per
second 1080p high I don't have any
complaints oh but there go we start
stuttering oh then that's brutal so as
you guys can see gaming on the Mac has
evolved the idea that you can use an
external GPU really does make a big
difference especially to lower end Mac's
however the software support is def
not fully there yet some curious what do
you guys think about gaming on a Mac is
it something you would ever try or is it
something that's best left to trained
professionals
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
