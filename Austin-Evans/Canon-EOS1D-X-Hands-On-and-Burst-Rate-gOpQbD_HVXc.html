from CES 2012 with the canon eos-1d x so
you wouldn't take it away ok thanks very
much we're here demonstrating the eos-1d
x which is our top-of-the-line EOS
professional digital SLR this is a 18.1
megapixel full-frame camera that has
capability of shooting at speeds up to
12 frames per second for raw files and
up to 14 frames per second for JPEGs it
also has ISO settings all the way from
50 up to two hundred and four thousand
eight hundred so unprecedented range of
sensitivity also our best camera yet in
terms of noise the lowest noise that
we've offered so far it uses dual diging
five plus processors that helps us you
really get a lot more performance it
also has many many other features that
include dual card slots for compact
flash also a built-in ethernet port on
the side of the camera that has a full
wired LAN capability that is one gigabit
ethernet 1000 base t so a very very high
performance camera for still photography
and also for video we've upgraded the
video on this cameras extensively
compared to previous eos models by
offering not only 1080p and 720p but
also two different codecs that one of
them is all intra frame that is a little
bit easier on the computer in terms of
post-processing and we also have the ipb
method which is basically the long gap
type compressed way to get more storage
on the card so you know you can use the
right method that you like there's very
little if any more a off of this camera
and video which is much better than it
was before you can shoot clips up to 29
minutes and 59 seconds which is better
than it was before there's also embedded
timecode so if you need to be able to
synchronize multiple cameras ability to
do that up to a 10 cameras can shoot
simultaneously with the same time vote
so a very very full feature camera
we're both the still and video it's
going to have a list price of sixty
eight hundred dollars and it'll be
available in the market by the end of
March this year all right now I can't
let you go without getting this
first-rate can give you a little sample
my pleasure here we go awesome thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
