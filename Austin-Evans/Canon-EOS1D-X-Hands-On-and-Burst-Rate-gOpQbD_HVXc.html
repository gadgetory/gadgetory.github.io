from CES 2012 with the canon eos-1d x so
go ahead and take it away okay thanks
very much we're here demonstrating the
EOS 1d X which is our top-of-the-line
AOS professional digital SLR this is a
18 point 1 megapixel full-frame camera
that has capability of shooting at
speeds up to 12 frames per second for
RAW files and up to 14 frames per second
for JPEGs
it also has ISO settings all the way
from 50 up to 200 and 4,800 so
unprecedented range of sensitivity also
our best camera yet in terms of noise
the lowest noise that we've offered so
far it uses dual diging five-plus
processors that helps us really get a
lot more performance it also has many
many other features that include dual
card slots for compact flash also a
built-in Ethernet port on the side of
the camera that has a full wired LAN
capability that is 1 Gigabit Ethernet
1000 bays T so a very very high
performance camera for still photography
and also for video we've upgraded the
video on this cameras extensively
compared to previous eos models by
offering not only 1080p and 720p but
also 2 different codecs that one of them
is all intra frame that is a little bit
easier on the computer in terms of
post-processing and we also have the IP
B method which is basically the long cop
type compressed way to get more storage
on the card so you know you can use the
right method that you like there's very
little if any more a off of this camera
and video which is much better than it
was before you can shoot clips up to 29
minutes and 59 seconds which is better
than it was before
there's also embedded timecode so if you
need to be able to synchronize multiple
cameras ability to do that up to a 10
cameras can shoot simultaneously with
the same time vote so a very very full
feature camera
we're both the still and video it's
going to have a list price of sixty
eight hundred dollars and it'll be
available in the market by the end of
March this year all right now I can't
let you go without getting this first
rate can give me a little sample my
pleasure here we go awesome thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
