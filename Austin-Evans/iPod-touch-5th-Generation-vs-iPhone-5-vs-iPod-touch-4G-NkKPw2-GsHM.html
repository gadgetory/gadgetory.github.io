here with a comparison between the iPod
Touch 5th generation iPhone 5 and iPod
Touch 4G to start with let's take a look
at the design the iPod Touch 5th
generation steps away from the others
with the option of colors I'm a fan here
as it definitely beats the polish back
from the last gen which you can scratch
just by looking at it it's not perfect
however the camera is slightly raised
from the body which doesn't look too
great and the iPod Touch loop is well
kind of silly you can press a small
button and it raises up to allow you to
attach a lanyard but in all honesty I
think it's a bit unnecessary the iPod
Touch 5th gen gets the same 4 inch
Retina display from the iPhone 5 which
is not only bigger but also higher
quality than the last gen the weight is
also ridiculous with the new iPod touch
it feels like Apple secretly filled it
with helium or something all three have
very different specs I want to know how
they stack up Iran Geekbench which
measures the general performance of each
device and as you can see here it's
pretty one-sided the iPod Touch 4G
clocked in a score of 388 where the iPod
touch 5g got 627 points and the iPhone 5
rings in a very respectable 1642 numbers
aren't everything though is in real use
the iPod Touch 5th gen and iPhone 5 are
very close where the iPod Touch 4G is
starting to show its age iOS 6 runs on
all three and in general is identical
there are some differences however one
big feature of iOS is Siri so if we try
on the iPhone 5 how are you doing today
I feel good I'm glad to hear it now
let's go and try on the iPod Touch 5th
generation hey Siri how's your day going
alright and let's go and try on the iPod
Touch 4th generation yeah overall the
iPod Touch 5th generation has a lot of
the right stuff it's basically the
iPhone 5 without the phone and for a lot
of people that makes a great compromise
the iPod Touch 4th Gen is still a solid
device but it's quickly getting out of
date so it's not a bad idea to spend the
extra money to get the latest and
greatest if you want a chance of winning
a brand new iPod Touch fitch and be sure

you enjoyed it and I will catch you next
