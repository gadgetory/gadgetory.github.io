browser it combines big big speed with a
sleek modern interface and support for a
growing variety of add-ons a won the
previous browser test and with the
improvements version forward brought to
the table is more of a powerhouse than
ever where it used to be neck and neck
with Safari now chrome has a new rival
opera 10.5 in the SunSpider javascript
test opera 10.5 narrowly beat out chrome
for with safari only a bit behind in the
mozilla drumeo suit chrome for ends up
being behind both Safari and opera
although again all three browsers were
very close using Celtic canes JavaScript
test now crombie tell safari and opera
by a considerable margin 242 to 212 and
207 in google's v8 benchmark again
chrome wins by a considerable margin
over opera 10.5 and safari for watching
an impressive score of over 2,000
continuing on to the acid three test
which is less of a test of outright
speed it is a three-way tie between
chrome safari and opera all with the
perfect score of 100 the Peacekeeper
benchmark which is a great overall
browser test gave a decisive wind to
opera 10.5 however with chrome barely
edging out Safari the second place as
you can see chrome is no longer the
undisputed fastest browser it's
certainly no slouch either a major part
of any browser is how long it takes to
load in that case it's safe to say that
chrome has no problems from a cold start
which is how long it takes the browser
to load from when the computer turns on
chrome takes less than two seconds which
is excellent faster than any of the
other browsers the same goes for a warm
start or when the browser has been open
since the computer has been running in
that case it opens in roughly one second
flat which is nearly instant in
something that really is impressive
unfortunately there's a downside to all
of this beat and its memory usage chrome
for gobbles up RAM needing eight times
as much as Firefox with a single tab
running it doesn't get much better when
you know open up eight tabs needing
still three times more than firefox well
this isn't a problem if you have a
modern computer with several gigabytes
of RAM if you're running an older
computer chrome a slow you down chrome
is really excellent and it's been my
main browser for a year now it features
a great interface that includes the Omni
bar which allows you to search enter
URLs as well as auto completes website
names even to ones you've never been to
before it supports extensions which were
just as they do in Firefox and allow you
to download everything from themes to
Twitter clients to tweaks for the
browser web pages render extremely fast
and low times are very snappy of course
it isn't perfect while it's certainly
very fast it does appear that opera 10.5
now has the edge it is tied into Google
services for a couple of features such
as bookmark syncing as well and while
I'm personally a fan of the interface
some people prefer something a bit more
substantial it's still a fantastic
browser but there's now something even
better so a second-place finish it is
now feel free to go back to the main
video via the annotation on your screen
to see how the rest of the browsers did
