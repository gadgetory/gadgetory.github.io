with a review of the new HTC One m8
Google Play edition is this the
smartphone for you last year's HTC One
was an incredibly impressive device in
the MA cranks it up to 11
at first glance it looks almost
identical especially in the silver that
the Google Play edition comes in unlike
the vast majority of Android phones
HTC opted to go with an almost entirely
aluminum body for the one and it looks
and feels fantastic one change between
the new one and the old one is the sides
so there's now actually metal that wraps
all the way around the edge of the phone
as opposed to having a plastic band that
wraps around it some people aren't a big
fan of this as it does mean it can be a
bit more slippery in the hand especially
with the brushed metal finish although I
think it's an improvement one thing I
would change is the button placement as
the power button is still up top meaning
it's a bit awkward to reach when you're
holding the phone in one hand in fact
the one m8 is actually a little bit more
unwieldy all around as it is both wider
as well as taller than last year it's
got a nice weight which while it feels
like it could take a decent drop makes
it a bit awkward when trying to manage
and normal use in exchange for the bulk
you have a 5 inch screen and the
fantastic boom sound speakers which have
been improved on the new m8 but
generally did
there's really just no comparison
instead of putting a single speaker on
the background the side you have two
very nice sounding speakers that are
pointing directly at you making the
listening experience so much better like
seriously can everyone just steal this
please there are also some nice touches
including a micro SD card slot which
allows you to expand the 32 gigs of
storage without to an additional 128
gigs there's also the integrated IR
blaster behind the power button that
lets even the Google Play edition of the
phone control a TV or stereo after a
quick setup it might be a small thing
but I appreciate the micro USB and
headphone jack being on the bottom now
which makes things a lot less cluttered
when I use the m8 in the car the screen
is slightly bigger than last year while
keeping the same 1080p resolution but
that's absolutely not a complaint this
is one of the best displays on any phone
period color is rich and more
importantly accurate viewing angles are
fantastic and it's noticeably more
responsive than most devices it's hard
to explain
but it feels like there's less delay
between tapping or swiping and something
actually happening than before on the m8
take a look around back and you might
notice something a little different as
there are now two rear-facing cameras
the dual camera allows you to do a few
things such as snap a picture and then
refocus it later on inside the HTC
camera app it definitely varies
depending on the subject as I found
portraits to be the only time where it
really looks nice oftentimes it would
look very fake with patches of the image
not blurred correctly if there wasn't a
very clear subject unfortunately it
doesn't get much better so this camera
wasn't amazing last year and it's
actually slightly worse this year as
they removed the optical image
stabilization while the original one was
awesome in low-light now it's really not
any better than what you would be able
to get out of a galaxy s5 or iPhone 5s
there's a lot of softening going on that
kills most of the noise in the expensive
detail again that really delivering
better results than the competition get
some decent light and things improve but
having only 4 megapixels to work with
makes the files only really decent for
sharing on the web side by side with the
iPhone or galaxy s5 there's not much
contest don't get me wrong it's
definitely usable and you can get some
cool shots out of the dual camera but
considering how great the rest of the
phone is the fact that the camera it's
only just decent is kind of
disappointing as a Google Play edition
device you're looking at a next
that's basically what you would find on
a nexus with a benefit of guaranteed
quick updates to new versions of Android
as the released there are a few changes
though such as the addition of some of
the gestures from the normal ma that
allow you to double tap or swipe on the
screen to unlock the phone they work
reasonably well however I found it
activating in my pocket quite a few
times so I ended up disabling it I won't
go too in depth on the benchmarks but
the One m8 does very well across the
board matching the similarly SPECT
Galaxy s5 and showing a nice improvement
over the last generation Galaxy s4 and
One m7 on the graphic side as well
battery life is excellent thanks to the
power sipping Snapdragon 801 inside I
was able to get through some pretty long
days with over 6 hours of screen on time
without the m8 giving up on me well the
name might be a mouthful the HTC One m8
Google Play edition is a fantastic phone
it brings a killer build together with a
great screen awesome speakers rock-solid
battery and delicious stock KitKat the
camera is a disappointment however
considering just how good the rest of
the phone is I have no problem
recommending it to you guys and in fact
I'll probably be using it as my main
phone for quite a while so what do you
guys think is the Google Play edition
and mate worth it let me know in the
comments below anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
