here with a video on the next-generation
Nintendo DS well we'll just be calling
it the ds2 although I'm sure they'll
have a better name for than that of
course the DX came out quite a few years
ago and although they've freshed it with
a ton they brush refreshed it with the
DS Lite the DSi and now the DSi XL is
still all of them are fundamentally the
same sort of system they all have the
same specs might play the same games but
well a lot of the rumors are now saying
that we might be to having one as soon
as the end of this year so I'm going to
go ahead and go over everything we know
and everything we expect out of the ds2
anyway let's get this one started
okay guys so the first thing we've
always a go at is the touch screens and
yes I think there's going to be two
touch screens as opposed to the single
one on the original DS now of course
when the original DS came out he was a
really big deal okay he went from a Game
Boy Advance with just a single obviously
non-touchscreen
- also you have two screens one of which
was a touch screen that was a really
cool thing where you had the stylus and
you know you could do all kinds of stuff
so they had the microphone as well so it
was a lot of really cool things and
obviously if the D s have been
tremendously successful so expected they
will bring over a lot of the features I
think that they will still have two
screens I'm not sure one of both will be
touch screens at least the bottom one
will definitely stay at the touch screen
who wouldn't be spreads the top one is
also a touch screen
I think the screens will get larger I
think instead of the 4 by 3 ratio
they're going to be more like widescreen
not only sure how big they're going to
be probably about the same size make it
just a little bit larger than the
standard DS or rather the standard DSi
one really cool thing I expect though is
that the next D s is going to have much
better graphics we've heard a lot about
the NVIDIA Tegra chip which is just it
seems like it's going to be going
everything from you know netbooks to
cell phones - I mean game systems and
everything and it sounds like it's also
going to be going into the next ds2 so
the NVIDIA Tegra chip actually has a lot
of power and it can actually run
high-definition video and some pretty
graphically intense games so I think
you'd be a perfect fit for the next DS
some other things are that I expect that
the DES is going to stay mostly the same
it's not it's going to I believe it's
going to keep the same folding design
two screens although of course they will
probably be a little bit larger probably
two speakers still a microphone and of
course at least one maybe two touch
screens what I actually think they might
get rid of though is the stylus if once
they change because right now the D s
has a resistive touch screen which is
you know the kind of squishing one that
you know has been around for a long time
well now that things are going to change
from resistive two capacitive capacitive
is a little bit different it's kind of
like on an iPhone or a lot of modern
cell phones and it's actually as solid
it's you know you touch it it doesn't I
mean it feels like you're basically
touching absoulte piece of glass and it
works with your finger I think working
with your finger I think I don't be
really cool for the DS I know a lot of
the games use the stylus and everything
but I think it's going to add a whole
new level of interactive this when you
guys should have your finger and you can
draw stuff I think it'll make it a
little bit more fun another thing is
that we believe it's going to have an
accelerometer just like again from the
iPhone and iPod Touch so you can
actually take your D s and tilt it as
you play as well as you know touching
the touchscreen and you know they can do
a lot of really creative things with it
so that's most of the things I know of
there's a few other things such as maybe
like you know actually going more
towards digital downloads like the PSP
go and somewhat the DSi I wouldn't doubt
that they have at least expand the DSi
the online store or you can actually
download a lot of games kind of similar
to iPhone apps you know for quite a bit
cheaper than normal
maybe like five ten dollars and you know
actually be able to play it but no more
of kind of like a short game not not
like a full long you know really long
games you know you would buy actually at
the store I don't think they're going to
be getting rid of the cartridge format
they might change it up I wouldn't be
surprised if the cartridges get smaller
maybe or they you know they change up a
little bit but I think that it's still
going to be mostly the same I wouldn't
be surprised if it has D s if you can go
ahead and plug in your old D s cards
into the second the D s to see you guys
that is my roundup of just about
everything we've heard it sounds like a
lot of game developers you know they're
kind of being quiet about it but they're
pretty much saying that they're already
working on games for it and the games
will probably be ready towards the end
of the year so if that's the case and of
course it does sound like it is they're
more probably looking for a sort of like
a fall winter release date probably just
in time for the holiday season and but
we also will probably have an unveiling
and they'll actually Nintendo will show
it off for us sometime maybe in the
summer maybe during a June at the e3
conference who knows
so of course guys there's not these are
rumors we don't have anything concrete
yet but it sounds like the next es is
actually well on its way and it could be
here you know within just a few short
months anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
