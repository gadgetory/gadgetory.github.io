episode of d3 live today I'm going to be
talking about the future of operating
systems now of course for the past 15 20
years we pretty much use the same kind
of basic operating system for example
you have a desktop you have a row of
applications you know you use your mouse
your keyboard to navigate and it's been
basically the same I mean if you took a
person who is using Windows 95 you put
them on a computer with windows 7 also
they be able to figure it out pretty
well same goes for example if you were
using OS 7 and now you go up to you know
Snow Leopard it's going to be a lot
different sure but you're going to be
able to get the general idea of it but
now I in my opinion I think we're going
through a major change in the industry
so with the event of touchscreens with
phones and tablets and whatnot I think
that a lot of the people who were you
know using a laptop using a desktop can
very well in the next few years start
moving over to tablets and of course
everyone pretty much has a smartphone
which kept course can do a lot of the
stuff that you used to be able to do on
a computer so you know there's a big
thing about operating systems it's
really going to be shaking up everything
so if you take a look at the desktop and
laptop our operating systems you'll see
there are a lot of major things so for
example with Windows 8 Windows 8 has a
rude rheumatic redesign that is very
very similar to what you might find on
something like a windows phone 7 but of
course it's going to be for a standard
desktop laptop or of course a tablet now
what this means is that especially for
like tablets and devices with a
touchscreen it's gonna work really nice
as you can be able to pan and swipe and
do all the kind of you know gestures and
whatnot that you would expect to do but
for on the desktop and the laptop you
still have a very similar interface
where you can still just click and go
through the keyboard now as far as how
that's going to work and how perfect
it's going to be we're definitely gonna
have to wait see but you can definitely
tell that Microsoft has their eye on the
future they're definitely looking
towards the touchscreens being the you
know the future of technology same goes
for if you take a look at OS 10 lion a
lot of the things that they've added or
pretty much straight from iOS and
especially on the iPad I'm you know
there's a lot of course with the mac app
store which is a little bit more of an
abstract thing but of course there's the
mac app store you have all kinds of
different features that you know are
very very similar looking to you know on
iOS mean for example a lot of it they're
trying to implement having a touch
add so you know you have your
multi-touch gestures all that kind of
stuff hey then you look outside where HP
is trying to get webos on computers now
how that will work I know what it'll do
all that kind of stuff who knows but we
should be seeing webos on computers as
well which of course is typically band
just a touch screen only operating
system so there's a lot of changes going
on right now and I'm really excited
about it ok so for the second segment d3
live I'll be taking live questions from
everyone in the chat so echoed we have a
ton of people in the room right now and
of course as always every episode of d3
live is filmed in front of a live
audience so let's go ahead just take a
few questions what is my favorite OS
let's not hard to say I mean I on the
desktop I use windows uh it's not so
much the windows is way better than OS
10 or way better than one external thing
let's just because I've used it forever
all the programs i rely on a daily basis
wrong windows and it's just it's just
simple it's just I know it nothing
against OS 10 i love it was Tim like i
said i love linux too but it's just a
lot of the stuff is i'm on windows and
there's no major reason for me to switch
so that's my favorite OS on the desktop
as far as mobile goes that's kind of
harder um I love iOS obviously iOS has
been fantastic but I'm really really
starting to love webos webos is such an
elegant operating system especially with
the new hardware like the veer and the
pre 3 and the touchpad all these new
hardware all this new hardware I'm
really looking forward to that so yeah
hopefully that answered your question if
I doesn't know what do I think of OS is
going more and more mobile and touch
friendly uh well I could kind of touched
on earlier i think that there's good and
bad i think that you know I still love
it keyboard and mouse the thing that's
still one of the best control methods
around but touchscreens are definitely
the future at least at least in part
alongside keyboard and mouse if not just
getting rid of the keyboard and mouse or
getting rid of the mouse uh as long as
they do keep like a an idea like Windows
8 don't abandon what already works i
mean yeah i know that you know touch
screens and stuff and for tablets yeah
sure touchscreen only is going to work
just fine but for laptops desktops and
that kind of thing you do not really
need to get rid of what's work just fine
for the past few years so as long as
they keep an eye on tablets everything
but without you know
hurting the core audience I've got no
problem with it do I think I OS will
have a fourth device well they
technically do they have the apple TV is
the ipod touch the iPhone iPad and Apple
TV but yeah I do think that over time
the Apple will expand their lineup I
mean you know the first start with
iphone add the ipod touch and recently
they added like a year so they had an
ipad so it's really good OS and
personally i wouldn't be surprised if we
had some kind of like a macbook air or
like an ipad with a keyboard or
something I'm I could definitely see
them expanding it out because iOS is
really good and I think there's a lot
more opportunities out there for you
know touchscreen os's and iOS not kind
of stuff so yeah I think eventually
maybe there might be a couple years but
definitely think that we will be seeing
some more devices like that uh Samsung's
request for saying Apple's new devices
silly uh yeah I don't honestly think
that they're gonna get an okay on that I
mean they might but I think most of that
is if you guys are not familiar Samsung
and Apple kind of getting into a legal
battle about you know you copy me this
that this techno it's all the kind of
same stuff but uh yeah samsung I said
that hey we want to see your ipad 3 and
the iphone 5 and all these kind of
devices which i don't think it's going
to happen the first place but uh i think
it's mostly just they're just going at
back and forth just trying to get stuff
done I mean it's just it's just politics
um well well let's get enough users for
developers to hop on board that's an
excellent question one of the biggest
things that one of my biggest problems
about webos is the fact that there are
not that many great apps so for example
there's no official skype app just yet I
mean there's a lot of like major apps
like that you might want to find like
Netflix or something on iphone android
etc etc this is not on webos but as they
start selling more phones all that kind
of stuff hopefully developers will start
taking notice and getting some good apps
on webos in general so those guys that's
it for this week's episode III lied if
