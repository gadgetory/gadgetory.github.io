of evolution how does the new 6s compare
with the 1st gen I phone the first thing
you'll notice is just how little things
have changed it's clear Apple settled on
a basic design back in 2007 and have
focused on tweaks cents which makes the
first gen surprisingly familiar the
newer iPhone is bigger and thinner but
they both share the same curve
it's like someone flattened an original
iPhone to make the 6s something that
isn't as impressive is the 3.5 inch 320
by 480 display it's still totally usable
but side-by-side with the newer iPhone
it's clear just how far smartphone
screens have come there are a few weird
quirks like a headphone jack that's
recessed enough to make some headphones
not fit but compared to other phones of
its time it's held up remarkably well
what I really want to know is can you
even use an original iPhone these days
the first thing is to get it on a
network with the help of a nano-sim
adapter the iPhone jumps right onto AT&amp;amp;T
it's limited to edge but you can still
text like any other phone and the
smaller size of the iPhone actually
makes it nice for phone calls data is
slow over 2g but if you're patient it
does work and you can connect it to
Wi-Fi as well one big advantage of the
success are the apps the first iPhone
was only updated to iPhone OS 3.1.3
which means the vast majority of apps in
the store aren't supported this includes
basically everything from the last few
years there are a few old-school apps
and games that will run but you'll be
forced to use the browser for the most
part most default apps work like Google
Maps but you'll have to use the web
player for YouTube which is a little
sketchy sometimes apps aside the biggest
difference between the 6s and the
original iPhone is speed certain parts
of the original iPhone actually aren't
bad scrolling through a web page in
Safari is actually pretty smooth and
pinch-to-zoom works just fine when it
comes to actually loading a site though
there's a massive difference the success
is just night and day faster than the
2007 era iPhone while iOS at its core is
very similar to the iPhone OS days there
are tons of features missing like
multitasking notifications are also
straight out of the Stone Age and simple
things like changing the background
hadn't been added yet with a whopping 2
megapixel camera the iPhone won't set
any records for the best smartphone
camera but it is usable there's no
manual control so what you get is what
you get but with decent light you can
get an okay shot a lot of the shots look
like they've just got a really
questionable Instagram filter on and
compared to the success it's
well there's not much to compare there
might not be video but I've got to say
working with such a limited camera is
actually kind of fun looking at how far
things have come in the last eight years
the success is undoubtedly a better
phone what's impressive is just how well
the first iPhone holds up design is on
point and it can do basically everything
a modern smartphone can just much more
slowly if you're interested in something
slightly more up to date my buddy Jon
from TLD did a comparison between the
iPhone 6 and 6s you guys can check out
in the card right up here anyway what do
you guys think about the original iPhone
and the iPhone 6s definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
