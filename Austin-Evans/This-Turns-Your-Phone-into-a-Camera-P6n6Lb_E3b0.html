with something that's just a little bit
different this is a Hasselblad camera
attachment for the Moto Z now the camera
on this guy is absolutely no joke
however with the true zoom you're
actually adding an entirely different
camera system to the back of the phone
so this is the true zoom now it actually
kind of feels by itself like a camera
however you can take it to a Moto Z and
there you go simple as that so the true
zoom itself actually feels a lot like a
proper camera so you've got a dedicated
shutter button it's got a nice sort of
hefty feel in the hand with a little bit
of a grip also inside it looks like we
actually have a carrying case the cool
thing about moto mods is that they're
super easily detached and re attached so
what you want though you don't want to
have this extra bulky thing you slide
into this little carrying case
well the truism definitely does add some
bulk to the phone it's not crazy so
let's select my pocket it actually fits
no problem it might be a little bit
thicker than what I want to carry around
every day however when you're done with
it it's easy enough to just take it
right off and it's no big deal to go
along with the true zoom there's also
the brand new moto Z play so the Moto Z
play is a more mid-range version of the
Moto Z so inside you're rocking a
snapdragon 625 instead of the 820 and
you're also getting a 1080p screen
versus 1440p however as far as the build
goes this is pretty much identical there
is one small upgrade with the Moto Z
play though and that is the rien of a
headphone jack and i mighta had seemed
like a big deal
however both of its bigger brothers are
completely lacking any kind of headphone
jack you're forced to use us PC
oh oh that looks like a thing right
there so the first thing I noticed is
that the zoom is fast so it is a 25 to
210 millimeter lens now mind you you do
definitely lose a lot of light so it's
something like F 6.5 when you actually
zoom in so it's more for like outdoor
situations but if you need that zoom
this is not something to be able to get
on a normal smartphone so we have the
full auto mode if we expand it out we
can also pick black and white we could
also go for the raw mode it's also clear
there's not a huge sensor inside here so
honestly it's probably a little bit
bigger than most smartphone sensors but
definitely nowhere near anything like a
proper point-and-shoot speaking of if I
have one is probably the best
point-and-shoot out there right now the
Sony rx100 mark for now side by side
well
moto Z is definitely a little bit longer
the thickness actually isn't too bad
whoa that was quite the flash Wow so
this also has a xenon flash I'm curious
to see how much of a difference that
makes to battery life when it comes to
actual image quality the true zoom is
good but not amazing a lot of that is
due to the small sensor in lens the laws
of physics limit what you can do in such
a thin package while having that extra
zoom range is really helpful when you
have saw lighting it does hurt low-light
performance there's a nice advantage and
just using the built-in camera on the
Moto Z play get some more light and it
fares better but it still trails behind
the note 7 which is the best smartphone
camera out right now once you use the
zoom though you can get shot you would
just miss with a normal smartphone the
ability to compress the background
really isn't possible with the normal
wide-angle lens color and sharpness are
more in line with a regular
point-and-shoot versus a DSLR but the
raw and black and white modes can help
pull more out of the camera just don't
expect anything crazy the true zoom name
is no joke that really is the main
advantage you'll be able to get your
hands on it on September 15th for $250
it might be a bit on the pricey side but
considering what you get it's actually
not a bad package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
