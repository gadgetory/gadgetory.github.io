here the tutorial on how to fix a home
button on an iPhone iPod Touch iPad it
might be taking too long to do something
randomly working or just totally dead
but with this tutorial you should at
least be able to get your device usable
again the first step is the simplest
just reboot your device since most
devices rarely rebooted sometimes as can
get a bit screwy after a while so all
you need to do is hold the power button
down until they slide to unlock screen
shows up just slide it and once the
pinwheel goes away hold the power button
again for a second and let your device
boot back up unlock it and give the home
button a shot if that didn't work there
are other things you can try the next
step would be to calibrate the home
button while its rear sometimes your
home button can get out of sync with iOS
and can be slow to respond to fix open
up a default app like weather with it
still open hold the power button just
like you're restarting it as soon as the
slide to unlock shows up press and hold
the home button keep holding it until
slide to unlock goes away and you see
the app closed now give your home button
a shot and see how responsive it is if
your home button still isn't working
then the hardware button itself is
likely broken don't give up yet though
there are a couple of things you can do
the easy way is to enable a software
home button to do this go into settings
scroll down to general and then down to
accessibility these are made for people
with disabilities however if your home
button is working you can enable
assistive touch a small button will
appear which you can push to any corner
of the screen give it a tap and you'll
see some options including home tap that
anytime you need to use your home button
and you've got yourself a working device
again the difficult option is to replace
the home button assembly depending on
what tools you have it's not altogether
expensive but it requires you to take
your entire device apart to get at the
home button which isn't easy at all if
you want to give this a shot I fix it
has some excellent tutorials for any
device you have and I'll have a link in
the description hopefully you guys found
