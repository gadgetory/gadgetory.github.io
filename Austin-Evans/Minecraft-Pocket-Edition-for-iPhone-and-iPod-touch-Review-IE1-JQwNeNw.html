Minecraft Pocket Edition for the iPhone
and iPod Touch this came out last night
and I spent a good amount of time
playing around with it and I've got to
say I'm actually really impressed I did
previously try this game on the Xperia
Play and well it's nice to have the
physical controls dorsum definitely some
issues as far as the lag was concerned
now running it on an iPhone 4s I had
absolutely no issues like that
whatsoever of course is still going to
be based on the touch screen controls
but yeah let's going to give you guys a
quick demo before I begin though I do
want to mention one thing especially if
you have an older device I definitely
recommend to go ahead and open up the
settings there's a couple things we have
fancy graphics which on the iPhone 4s
are turned on but you also have to have
the option to turn that off as well as
turn on lower graphics quality so you
have an older device that should help
you kind of minimize the lag and like I
said on the iPhone 4s I had absolutely
no lag whatsoever it runs very nice very
smooth so here's the game itself now
it's kind of a mixture between the
standard kind of you know course desktop
version it does have some of the
features so go ahead and open it up but
it's more of a creative mode so you
don't actually have to you know deal
with mobs or you don't really have to
worry about dying or anything like that
and you have infinite of the brick so
it's good for building but it's not
going to be the Quitely full experience
so you guys can see here in the menu we
can just pick out any brick we want so
let's just pick out that and then using
the controls is Corsa this touchscreen
as you would expect and then we just tap
and place whatever we want or if you
want I get rid of it we just hold it and
I'll show sure how well you guys can see
but it's just hold down and it will you
know go ahead and destroy it so no
control um not bad like I said it's it's
better than I expected for a touchscreen
it does work pretty well with innocency
with my right there at the right side
you just kind of look up and down and
then we do have a d-pad here as well as
a jump and it will automatically jump so
I walk down here it'll jump right up so
let's give you guys a little demo of
what I built so built this just kind of
mess around trying this out um it it's a
little bit weird it doesn't work quite
perfectly sometimes but overall like
like I said for touchscreen controls
this is not bad at all so let's go ahead
and just open this back up and build
something so we can go ahead and pick
out
some glass and also pick out some
torches so just get a little bit of
everything and make kind of grief up my
world here so we can just start placing
bricks placing bricks is very simple
with the touchscreen very responsive it
actually works really quite nicely and
of course we don't like it just hold
down on it and kind of delete and it
works pretty well like like I said I
keep saying this but it really surprised
me how well they were able to implement
this you guys can see here it does run
very pretty submit very pretty smoothly
yeah it runs nice and smoothly and of
course you can do all the kind of fun
minecraft bitchy like go ahead show you
guys kind of built a secret entrance
into my little base here you do have
most of the items but not everything for
example you have ladders you have
torches but you are missing some things
like I said for example crafting and
that kind of thing but go ahead and
climb back up here you guys will see
we're inside that stone structure that I
made earlier and you can guess kinda
mess around with that you see the
torches the lighting and all that kind
of stuff
the guys is gonna be about it for my
review of Minecraft Pocket Edition and I
kind of got the iPhone tilted didn't I
overall if you're a fan of Minecraft
actually do recommend this it's a lot of
fun it is going to run you about 6 bucks
on the App Store currently which is a
bit pricey but this is not a bad
experience whatsoever it actually is a
lot of fun I'm typically not a big fan
of these types of games where you know
you had need a d-pad and that kind of
stuff but I'm definitely gonna make an
exception for this I can see myself
spending a lot of time building some
stuff on Minecraft definitely does work
pretty well anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
