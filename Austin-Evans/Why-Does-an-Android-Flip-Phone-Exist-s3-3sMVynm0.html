that runs Android and my only question
as always is why does it exist so this
is a target clearance special I was
walking around the corner I saw this for
a whopping 50 dollars it's hard to say
no the first thing I noticed is that
this looks enormous so actually do we
have a flip phone around here so for
some context this is the size of a
normal flip phone you open it up you
hold it up to your face very normal
looking however when you look at it
compared to this it's twice as big Hey
we are activated all right
let's enjoy the wonders of our ZTE
semble tea okay okay so actually you do
have a keyboard on the display yeah this
is gonna be this is very bizarre I don't
think I've ever typed like this before I
feel like the way to actually do this is
to hold it in one hand and just do a
single hand for typing this actually
doesn't feel like the worst thing I've
ever done okay it's actually it's it's
up there so we are set up with our
Android flip phone and at first glance
you're actually getting the full Android
experience we have the Play Store we
have google chrome Gmail even YouTube
one thing this does have is actual hard
buttons for your Android keys for
example have my back button
I have home I even have multitasking um
once you get going it's not like the
slowest thing I've ever tried there is a
decent quad-core processor inside it's
just a slightly under Gunawan experience
so the first thing to do when you're
putting a flip phone to the test is
trying to make a phone call Jimmy yeah
how do I sound
what are you bad
it does like greenie okay so um maybe
calls not the strong suit of the phone
however let's try texting hi Jimmy so
the best parts is when you have the
keyboard up it literally takes up the
entire screen
I cannot even see the message he just
sent me it also does have a secondary
display which only actually turns on
sometimes so you can see your battery
life and time so with a blisteringly
sharp three and a half inch 320 by 480
display I really expect this is going to
reset my expectations for what to expect
with a high end device let's just start
by playing this 4k HDR video that seems
reasonable men if some you know this is
one way of watching videos it's a really
crispy
I think 360p is really the sweet spot
that everyone should watch all of our
videos on as long as you crank the
brightness all the way up you can see
most of the colors at least six or seven
of them I think it might be time to take
this thing outside and really put it
through its paces really kind of full
explore the outer capabilities of this
performance monster so there's no way
around it a flip phone is never going to
be as comfortable to use as a standard
smartphone when it comes actually
scrolling on the screen you can have to
hold it in this sort of a weird way but
if you can look past that it actually
does work pretty well as an Android
phone
take Chrome for example once you get
into a webpage you'll find that it's
pretty much the same as any other budget
Android phone so loading the page is
fine scrolling is no problem really the
only way that you actually notice that
this is a flip phone is when you have to
hold it by the screen especially because
it has not only LTE as well as Wi-Fi the
experience really isn't that bad as long
as you're fine I'm looking like this all
the time now you're definitely not going
to want to play a ton of games on this
thing but you can't play some simple
titles such as 2048 know what the main
issues here is that a lot of games are
going to run into issues because the
screen resolution is very low and the
fact that obviously the internals aren't
going to be incredibly powerful but for
simple
that actually does kind of work I will
say that there are some things about
flip phones I did kind of miss number
one of course is that flip it just
sounds so nice to be able to close it up
you can toss it in your pocket set it
down it's not really something you have
to worry about getting like something
like a screen scratched or whatever now
there are other advantages you do have
that removable battery you're gonna get
the headphone jack the micro SD card
slot there are things that are actually
kind of nice however the size of this
once you close it up it's not that bad
but I mean even when you compare it to
something like an iPhone 10 it is really
chunky you can carry it around but
definitely not as small as the
old-school flip phones even though it
might look like a flip phone we are
dealing with a legitimate Android
smartphone here and so of course one of
the most important tests is the camera
so the first thing I noticed is that
what the camera around back here is
super easy to cover but I line it up
here ah I mean that's actually not
terrible it's not exactly a super-crispy
picture but it works supposedly this is
720p video um it actually looks okay I
guess if I walk around here a little bit
get a nice close-up can looking really
professional here I mean you know it
exists hopefully that's not too bad whoa
okay well this is an unexpected benefit
because the phone is so big and I should
looks like I've got a selfie stick oh
all right so if I press the center
button not my finest selfie but it's
actually reasonably wide especially
considering just how far away you can
get the phone I'm actually mildly
impressed for 50 dollars this is not the
worst camera I've ever tried I remind
you it's not the best by any stretch but
it works I know it made a lot of fun of
this phone throughout this video but
I've got to say that it is a kind of
cool throwback and especially if you're
someone who's coming from a current flip
phone it might not be the worst upgrade
in the world most of us though probably
time to you know stick with the normal
smartphone and not this monstrosity but
I'm curious what do you guys think about
this smartphone flip phone whatever it's
called hope you go in the comments below
and I will catch you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
