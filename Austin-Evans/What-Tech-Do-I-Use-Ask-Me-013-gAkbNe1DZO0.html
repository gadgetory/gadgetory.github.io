here with the new ask me where I go for
all kinds of questions straight from you
guys are you primarily a PC gamer or do
you play consoles more than PC as you
guys probably guessed I tend to lean a
little bit more toward the PC gaming
side of things however I do play games
pretty much regardless of where they are
so I've been playing a lot of threes on
my phone lately which is a surprisingly
fun game titanfall is actually something
I've been using on the Xbox one a lot
lately
and there's a lot of kind of like
console specific games like Halo and GTA
5 and those kind of things so yeah I
generally do prefer playing on PC if I
can how it's not like ooh consoles I
took the minutes you know their games
right now it doesn't matter would you
rather fight one horse-sized duck or one
hundred duck-sized horses so the way I
look at it
ducks are way meaner than horses so you
get like a big like 8 9 10 foot tall
duck that might be a little bit of a
tricky thing I mean I'm not saying I
couldn't take it because just for the
record I could totally take it but I
think it'd be a little easier with just
a bunch of little horses just kind of
like now nobody deal they're just nice
little ponies or something but the duck
um I guess I'll take it right don't
don't forget that part I can take it but
I probably prefer to go with the horses
what is your daily driver for a phone
right now and why is that your phone
right now I've actually been using the
iPhone 5s for a while so I picked it up
I really wasn't planning on doing a
whole lot with it I mean I got the
iPhone 5 reviewed it and pretty much
immediately sold it and I was planning
on doing the same thing with the 5s but
it's actually a really good package so I
think iOS 7 does a lot to improve I
think that the a7 processor is really
really really awesome but most
importantly I love the camera so yes
there are technically phones with better
megapixel careless and this and that
however the overall package for taking
pictures on a phone I feel like the
iPhone is still on top so the image
quality is fantastic so I love going on
Instagram just going out on adventures
than taking a lot of pictures I've
gotten a lot of killer shots in the 5s
but they also the interface as far as
getting the pictures is super smooth
super responsive I almost never miss any
good shots and there's a lot of great
photo sharing apps such as Instagram as
well as being able to edit your photos
so overall what's definitely not perfect
which battery life is better and the
screen is just absurdly small but
actually really still like the iPhone 5
this what do you do for a living I feel
like I've answered this question quite a
few times but my full-time job is I
should've been YouTube for the last few
years now so I know I haven't posted a
lot of videos in the last couple weeks
and I do apologize for that however I've
been working on some big projects that
are going to be coming live in the next
few weeks I know I generally don't like
teasing stuff but here's just a little
clip on what I've been working on you
guys get this I'm gonna be really good I
like me okay honestly there's no way of
idiots thoughts on the NVIDIA Titan Z
it's definitely a cool card how it's for
a very very specific person so generally
speaking $3,000 is a lot for a card
especially when you can get more
performance from a pair of Titan blacks
which is going to cost you quite a bit
less if you don't need the full compute
performance you can get a lot more bang
for your buck if you go for something
like a pair of 780 TI's so it's a cool
card but it's worth like I said a very
very specific person if you're just
going to be gaming on it it's really not
gonna make any sense
should I get a pebble right now or
should I wait for upcoming smartwatches
like the Motorola 360 I was actually
just making the exact same decision the
other day so I spent a little time with
the Samsung Galaxy gear last year well
it definitely wasn't a perfect
SmartWatch it was enough to kind of give
me an idea of what a SmartWatch could
actually do and how it could be useful
so I definitely like the pebble
especially the pebble steel however now
that I've seen the Moto 360 and some of
these Google Android powered
smartwatches I think I'm going to wait
they look really really cool I can't
wait to get my hands on them your take
on crypto currencies are they the future
of electronic transactions and can they
be used as investments crypto currencies
like Bitcoin litecoin and dogecoin
definitely have a place in my opinion
although whether that's a good
investments kind of a little up to you
however the good thing is you actually
don't have to spend any of your own
money buying these as you can mine them
so I actually had a litecoin PC setup
before the fire and I plan on definitely
doing another one before too much longer
but they're just if it is you actually
mine your own currency and then spend it
that way so might not be able to make up
pile of money like you used to but
steadily a very interesting concept I
definitely like to do a video on it
before too much longer when are you
going to switch to a 4k set
so there are a lot of pros and cons to
moving to 4k so as far as the pros go
actually having four times as much
resolution is awesome obviously there's
going to be a lot more detail in the
shots just higher quality crisper just
better looking even when you take that
4k footage and watch it in HD however on
the downsides it's going to be expensive
right so I'm gonna have to get a 4k
camera so there definitely some options
like the Panasonic gh4 so the Sony a
x100 but there's also other gear to
consider like a 4k monitor it's going to
take extra time to edit extra time to
upload and I think the biggest issue
with 4k right now is simply that a lot
of you guys don't have a 4k screen so
it's kind of a lot of extra work for
something that not a lot of people are
going to see so actually if you guys
have any thoughts on like whether you'd
like me to go to 4k now or wait if you
guys are already set up with 4k let me
know in the comments below I mean I
could definitely switch over sooner than
later but if it's something that you
guys really don't notice or don't really
care about I'll probably stick with HD
for a while longer if you guys have any
other questions feel free to hit me up
on Twitter Facebook or Google+ I'm also
over on Instagram as well that is
Instagram calm slash Austin not Duncan
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
