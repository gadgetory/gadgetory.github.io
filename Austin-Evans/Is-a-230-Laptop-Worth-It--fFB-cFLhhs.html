decent laptop for under $250 on one hand
you could get the Asus Chromebook c300 a
13-inch laptop running Google's Chrome
OS on the other you've got the new HP
stream 13 a full-blown Windows 8.1
laptop that also comes in at 230 dollars
crack open the Chromebook and you'll
find the laptop itself along with a
compact power adapter unwrap the c300
and you'll see a brushed plastic finish
that looks a bit like actual metal and
absolutely gets coated and fingerprints
the design itself is basic but nice
enough it measures in at less than an
inch thick and just over three pounds
move over to the stream and you'll see
it comes with a bigger two piece power
adapter along with a link to redeem a
Windows Store gift card that isn't quite
live yet there's also a year
subscription to office 365 which usually
costs $100 a very nice addition on a
$230 laptop unwrap the stream itself and
it is very very blue right now you have
the choice between blue and pink which
gives a serious contrast with the
all-black look of the chrome bulk the
stream is a bit thinner however it's
also noticeably heavier which probably
has more to do with the build quality
than anything else
open up the lid on the Chromebook and
you'll find a 13.3 inch display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 the resolution
is basically what you expect at this
price point but the colors are poor and
the viewing angles are just bad look at
the screen at anything besides straight
on and everything washes out quickly and
on top of that there's some stress
behind the panel on my unit causing very
noticeable warping on the screen while
the size and resolution are the same the
display in the stream is a notch above
the screen assembly feels much more
robust and the viewing angles are better
- not amazing but a big improvement when
you first boot up a Chromebook it's very
straightforward you jump on Wi-Fi and
log into your Google account if you
already used Chrome it will grab your
sync information including bookmarks
apps etc on the stream it's typical
Windows with a fairly short setup but
you'll have to spend a while downloading
updates you'll also find some blow we're
including McAfee and some HP software
all which can be cleared up easily
enough with ccleaner with only 17
gigabytes of free space out of the box
every little bit helps where the
Chromebook has a full sized SD card slot
the stream opts for microSD instead
which allows you to add an extra 32
gigabytes for less than $20 which is
basically a necessity the keyboard on
the Chromebook is pretty solid there's a
subtle bulging of the spacebar which
gives you a comfortable position to type
on and since it's running Chrome OS the
layout is slightly tweaked including a
search key instead of capsule on the
strain keyboard is decent but it's a bit
mushy er than on the Chromebook and
sports an extra row of keys on the right
side which can be an annoyance since the
home button is right beside backspace
the trackpad is unfortunately just
disappointing it's not particularly
accurate and it doesn't always pick up a
tap on the first try not only is the
trackpad on the Chromebook bigger but
it's also much nicer to use it tracks
nicely and supports multi-touch gestures
much better than on the stream including
swiping with two fingers to go back or
to scroll interestingly both laptops are
almost identical inside the Chromebook
sports a dual-core intel pentium in
28-30 clocked at up to 2.4 gigahertz 2
gigabytes of RAM a 32 gigabyte SSD and a
tow 2.11 AC Wi-Fi the stream slightly
improves on this with a processor that
can run up to 2.6 gigahertz but drops
down to wireless-n for Wi-Fi the
low-power Pentium allows both laptops to
be fanless which combined with SSDs
makes them completely silent
performance-wise the Chromebook seems to
handle the modest specs fairly well
playing HD flash video is no problem and
with up to 6 or 7 tabs
everything stays nice and smooth move
over to the stream and it holds up
reasonably well however it's clear that
running full Windows 8.1 is a bit more
demanding in return you're getting a
more fully featured operating system
basically any Windows application will
work on the stream which is a huge plus
while you really won't be using this as
a hardcore gaming PC the stream can
handle lighter games like League of
Legends on low settings on the other
hand Chrome OS is much simpler if you've
never used a Chromebook before it's
essentially a lightweight operating
system that's entirely built around the
Chrome browser for normal web surfing
this works great and a lot of apps I use
on the desktop are available including
Spotify TweetDeck and pocket casts you
can also download apps from the Chrome
Web Store the work offline like sunrise
calendar and even some Android apps like
duolingo and vine are now available
flash games will work but eating games
designed for chrome like Bastion don't
always run that smoothly unfortunately
if you want to be running full Windows
apps on the Chromebook you're out of
luck although on the flip side that also
means that you don't really have to
worry about viruses or bloatware battery
life is definitely a highlight for both
laptops
with such low powered processors you'll
easily get a full day abuse out of them
and then some if you really think about
it it's kind of crazy that you can get a
decent laptop for about the same price
as a 7-inch tablet while the build
quality definitely leaves something to
be desired the dual core Pentium and two
gigabytes of RAM works well on the
Chromebook and the better keyboard and
especially trackpad make a big
difference in everyday use the screen
gives you a much more usable screen more
durable build and most importantly full
windows performance isn't amazing but
being able to run Windows apps is a huge
plus so would you pick up the streamer
Chromebook definitely be sure to let me
know in the comments below anyway I've
got to give a big shout out to play vs.
for making this video possible play vs.
is a cool new app that's all about
playing games while supporting your
favorite sports team there's a whole
list to choose from which are
surprisingly fun you've got everything
from kicking field goals to an endless
runner my favorite part is that they're
nice and simple perfect for playing when
you've got a couple minutes free best of
all you earn points by playing against
your friends which you can use to redeem
actual prizes like game consoles event
