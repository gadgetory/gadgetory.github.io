unveiled the first shipping Chrome OS
notebooks the Acer Chromebook and the
samsung series 5 let's begin with the
series 5 which features a 12.1 inch
display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
a new dual core intel atom cpu which is
a crate boost over the cr-48 eight and a
half hours of battery life the HD webcam
along with a pair of USB ports and a
memory card slot in addition to the nice
improvement in CPU the series 5 also has
a full-size keyboard and a revamp
full-size try pack which is great
unfortunately all this comes at a hefty
price of 429 dollars for a Wi-Fi only
model or four hundred ninety nine
dollars for a 3g model next we have the
acer chromebook it shares many key specs
with the series 5 but with a smaller
11.6 inch display six hours of battery
life and an hdmi port instead of minis
vga a great feature that both netbooks
will have is a built-in jailbreaking
mode that will allow you to install
anything you like on your computer
including another operating system if
you ever get tired of Chrome OS the
design certainly is quite a bit more
plain than the Samsung however it makes
up for that in a very important area
price the Acer Chromebook comes in at a
more reasonable 349 dollars for Wi-Fi
and will have 3g as an option although
the price is yet to be announced for
that overall I like what I see as a
cr-48 owner there's a lot to like about
Chrome OS but several of the key
problems namely speed and the trackpad
have been remedied with these new
Chromebooks my biggest problem is price
as I think that they still may be a bit
too expensive for many people so what do
you think be sure to leave your thoughts
