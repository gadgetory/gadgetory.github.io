short
so guys Grooveshark is actually a
website and generally I don't like to
review websites but I'm gonna make a
special occasion in the case of
Grooveshark just because it is so good
so guys Grooveshark is basically very
similar to Pandora only with less
emphasis on the radio segment and more
emphasis on letting you listen to
whatever music whenever however it's
really really great I'm listening to it
all the time it's fantastic um so guys
like I just said you can pretty much
listen to any music on Grooveshark you
can listen to it whenever you want
and you listen to it as many times you
can you know basically it's like you
just downloaded every song in iTunes and
it's basically all backed up on the web
really it is that good I'm so sweaty to
show you what I mean
so it's quite and search for music and
I'm going to search ronald jenkees who
I've been listening to a lot lately so
let's go ahead and type this in and
search it so here we go guys so as you
can see there are a lot of results and
of course he is not exactly a you know a
super popular person you know so it
really in general pretty much any music
you're looking for you should be able to
find on Grooveshark I mean within it's
not a totally unlimited but really I
haven't found any problems with you know
finding most any music you want listened
to so that is the white Grooveshark
works is that you can search for
whatever music you want and add to
playlists or you can do you can save the
playlists and do all kinds of stuff so
let me just show you how that works
let's go and pick a couple of these
let's go ahead and pick this one let's
pick this one this one and this one so
this is now are now playing so we can go
ahead and listen to these as freely as
we want and go ahead and listen to them
and just we want to just listen to one
over and over again I'm having the whole
playlist loop you can do a lot of things
and you can also save the playlist so as
long as you create an account which is
free you can go ahead and create a
playlist so you could save it listen to
it over and over again as you guys can
see I have a couple of playlists over
here that I'm pretty much always
listening to so it really works well in
addition there is of course a radio
section but guys personally on
really a huge fan of this I think that
you know if you're wanting to listen to
just lots of new music Pandora will
probably work better but if you know
what you wanted to listen to and like
basically like I said it's like you just
have you know full access to the entire
iTunes library it's really really great
so guys there actually are some other
things too with grooveshark it is free
to use as much as you want and I am a
free user I don't I haven't paid you can
do the VIP which gets rid of ads gives
you a few special features and also lets
you get an application so there actually
are mobile applications for different
products such as the iPhone although I
will know that for the iPhone if you do
that get the VIP while you can listen to
groove sharp on the go and I'm sure that
would be great you do need to be
jailbroken because Apple does not like
you know I guess a competitor to iTunes
I don't know but you know that's just
something you might want consider
personally I don't have VIP I'm just
fine with the parade but you guys you
might want to check it out anyway guys
that's it for my review of Grooveshark
it is very very simple but it's a
fantastic website and I'm really really
enjoying it so guys I definitely
recommend hit the link in the
description check out Grooveshark I'm
you know just search for a song you know
just start listening to a little bit of
music trust me guys you'll be hooked
it's a fantastic website anyway guys
