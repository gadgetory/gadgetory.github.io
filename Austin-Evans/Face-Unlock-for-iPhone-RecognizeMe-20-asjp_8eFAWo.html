here is the demo of recognize me now
what this is the city of tweet for any
device with a front-facing camera and
what it allows you to do is use facial
recognition to unlock your phone or your
iPod or your iPad
now this isn't not exactly new how old
what is is the 2.0 update now this
brought a lot faster recognition all
that kind of good stuff so let's go
ahead just give you guys a little demo
so all you need to do is unlock your
device just like you normally do but
when you slide to unlock you also have
your pin option but if you want you can
click recognize me and forget nice and
close to the front-facing camera it
should recognize my face so just a
second here and there we go
and I actually typically it's faster
than that however I'm not quite the
perfect position it's a lot better if
you can actually hold it like right you
know we're head up to your face as
opposed to having to kind of kneel down
to it Shay's can see it does work now
there are some options that you should
take a look at so you need to open up
the recognize me app and you'll see a
few different things here and the most
important is to open up with a face
trainer now you can do this once and it
should be alright but the more times you
run this the better and you just can see
here it's already stretched my face so I
move around yeah it does it pretty well
but one of the major thing with doing
the face trainer is it allows you to do
it in different lighting and stuff so
you guys know like how faces your facial
recognition stuff goes of course you
look at my face now if I turn off the
light to my side you know it's gonna
look very different there's gonna be a
lot of shadows so well the best way to
do it is to Train it in several places
so you know three or four times maybe
one in sunlight one the darkness that
kind of stuff but once you're ready to
do it and it's not quite perfect since
I've got a camera in my white bail just
see what we can do here
there we go hit train it's gonna capture
my face a few different times here and
it's gonna create biometrics which
sounds very exciting but basically
that's doing is it's taking those
pictures of my face it's cropping them
down and it's kind of adding it to the
database which I can actually show you
guys in one second here once it's done
so we can click back and go into the
training set so you guys can see here
I've done quite a few times but we just
open this one up there goes - those are
six pictures that took you know with my
mouth a little bit different eyes this
that and when it does it kind of brings
them all together so when you are ready
to do the facial recognition it's able
to better recognize your face in lots of
different areas now there are also a
couple of things here so for example
settings if it's not recognizing your
face enough you can kind of adjust it
I'd really just leave it at the default
of 70% it works pretty well and you also
do have auto start so as soon as you
slide to unlock instead of you know
having to pull your PIN number up it'll
just automatically come up hill over
that's a little buggy right now I kind
of actually crash my springboard a
couple times so to be honest I would
just leave that off until they get it
fixed of course sometimes facial
recognition can be pretty easy to fool
so let's go ahead give this a shot I of
course inhabit just a print it out
picture of myself from one of my videos
so let's see if it falls for this so
we'll unlock it slide down lock and hit
recognized me and instead hold the
picture of me up and see if it's gonna
take it it's scanning the face so it
recognizes it it should be me but it's
not really working so let's take it down
if I get here and it should recognize me
there we go so overall it's a pretty
cool little tweak now personally I think
that you can just put your PIN in faster
but it's something that's kind of cool
if you don't want to bother trying to
remember a pin or just want show off for
your friends or whatever it's a pretty
cool little Cydia tweak and it will run
you about three bucks in the city of
store anyway guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
