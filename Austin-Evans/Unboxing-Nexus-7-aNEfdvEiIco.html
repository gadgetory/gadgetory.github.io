with an unboxing of the google nexus 7
as the first google-branded tablet
coming in at only two hundred dollars
this looks good on paper but let's take
a look pop the cover off and you'll get
the always fun box ception action
unfortunately as you guys may have seen
the box is a bit hard to open but
luckily I had my unboxing machete on
hand to make quick work of it inside
you'll see the nexus 7 wrapped up but
we're going to set it aside for a second
to see what else we get in the box below
the tablet is a smaller box which
contains the power adapter micro USB
cable for charging and syncing along
with a quick start guide and warranty
info with that out of the way let's take
a look at the star of the show the Nexus
7 the design is very clean and straight
forward without any physical buttons up
front at the top is the only camera on
the Nexus a 1.2 megapixel shooter and
the light sensor on the top right is the
sleep/wake button along with the volume
rocker on bottom you'll see the microUSB
port along with the headphone jack and
on the left side or for small contacts
for accessories all together the Nexus 7
is a very impressive piece of hardware
and you also get a $25 credit toward
apps music movies and more in the Play
Store when you activate it fire it up
and you'll see the 7-inch screen with a
resolution of 1280 x 800 running android
4.1 jelly bean immediately you can
notice just how smooth android is on the
Nexus 7 anyway guys that's about it from
my unboxing of the google nexus 7 if you
