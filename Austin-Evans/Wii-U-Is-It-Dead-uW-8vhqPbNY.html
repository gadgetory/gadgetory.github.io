at the nintendo bus at e3 with one
question is the Wii U dead Nintendo
showed off quite a few new games here so
probably one of the biggest ones is
going to be Super Smash Brothers
so this is going to be coming to both
the 3ds as well as the Wii U next year
and this is definitely one of the most
popular franchises that Nintendo has
right now Mario Kart 8 will also be
hitting the Wii U soon now this will
actually really surprised me at the
actual graphics so it actually doesn't
look too far off from something like the
PlayStation 4 the Xbox one which of
course are much more powerful systems
Super Mario World is another game
hitting the Wii U this is kind of a mix
between the standard kind of 2d
side-scrolling Mario action as well as a
little bit of 3d this will also look
really really nice where it gets a
little bit more tricky is the fact that
that really weren't a whole lot of third
party games for the Wii U so probably
the biggest one is going to be watchdogs
from Ubisoft now that is going to be
hitting madly the next gen consoles but
also the current gen so 360 ps3 and also
the Wii U Ubisoft is still working on
Wii U games however they have said that
they are not going to be making any kind
of exclusive games until it actually
starts selling better the real question
is what does Nintendo have to do now so
with pretty poor sales with the Wii U
it's very clear that a lot of people
don't even really understand that the
Wii U is an actually new console as
opposed to some kind of tablet add-on to
the current Wii with the Wii U being
significantly down on power compared to
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
stephane going to be difficult to see a
lot of third-party games such as
battlefield 4 and Call of Duty ghosts to
being just directly ported over however
of course Nintendo will always have
their great first started first party
support with games like Mario Pokemon
Super Smash Brothers that kind of stuff
so steadily going to be interesting to
see but from what I'm seeing here it
definitely does look like it's time from
intended to do something whether it's a
price cut or just something to kind of
get some buzz going back around the Wii
U now that we know just about everything
about the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one I'm
curious to know what do you guys think
about the Wii U now is it still an
awesome console or does Nintendo have
some work to do to actually make it
stack up with the best of the best
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below if you guys are
interested in more feel free to check
out my hands-on of the new PlayStation 4
and if you enjoyed definitely be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up and be sure

this anyway guys I will catch you next
