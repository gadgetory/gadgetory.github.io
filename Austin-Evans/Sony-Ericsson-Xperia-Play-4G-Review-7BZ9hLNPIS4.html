the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play 4G
smartphone now this phone also known as
the playstation phone was late to
rumoured well before it came out and
this is going to be the AT&amp;amp;T 4G version
that came out about a week or two ago
let's go ahead and start you guys that
with a quick tour around the phone up
front you'll find a 4-inch 8 480 by 854
pixel display and the display is really
nice it's got great viewing angles I'm
not actually guys can probably tell
pretty well on the camera out there but
it's got great viewing angles and its
really nice clear crisp vibrant all that
kind of stuff for gaming as I should
really impressed I also like the 4-inch
size I think it's a good size for a
smartphone or doesn't have to be
enormous in your pocket but of course
you still have plenty of real estate for
all your games and that kind of thing up
front here you guys will find the
front-facing VGA camera front-facing
camera it's not really anything
particularly amazing and on the bottom
here you guys will find that it does
have before Android buttons back home
menu and search over here on the back
you'll find the 3.5 milimeter headset
jack along with a USB and a whole lot
over here and if I flip the phone over
this way you guys to be able to the LNR
buttons for gaming they're not really
that great I will say they're not a
little action in the motion on them is
not quite that great but it's nice to
have those buttons of course for all
kinds of gaming over here you will find
the volume rocker which is kind of a
weird spot when you look at from this
angle but you know when you're doing the
volume from the side of the phone makes
plenty of sense up front here you guys
will find the sleep/wake button and
around on the back here you will find
the five megapixel rear facing camera
with LED flash and of course that's all
fine and good but the whole point is a
playstation phone is to have playstation
controls as soon as you guys can see
here it has some pretty nice controls so
if you guys have ever seen a PSP go it's
kind of similarly laid out you have of
course your d-pad your standard
PlayStation buttons now these are two
virtual joysticks now get into you know
how the game performances and everything
in just a little bit but yeah it's a
pretty nice setup and of course you to
have your select start and your mini
buttons as far as the software in the
phone goes it runs Android 2.3
Gingerbread with a custom sony ericsson
layout so for example you can see here
that you can scroll through your tweets
your facebook mansions all that kind of
stuff
get to the phone I mean kind of course
also just swipe through and let's say we
want to I don't know change the
wallpaper but a pic a new wallpaper here
so that's looks nice so we can just pick
this out and of course just like any
Android phone it has all the
customization and everything that you
would expect now over here there are
some new applications that do come with
it and one of the big ones is the
PlayStation or rather the Xperia Play
games so on this you can find that there
are several games that come with it
so for example there's the sims you'll
be able to play Madden 11 asphalt 6 so
definitely some decent games that come
with it you can also pick up quite a few
so if I scroll over here you guys are
fine you pick up minecraft minecraft is
a great game on this I've done a
previous video on some of the gaming so
if you guys are interested in that you
can check it out but overall the gaming
it's the library is not too bad of
course a lot of these Android games are
available for many other platforms just
optimized for the physical controls um
however one problem I had was it the
amount of games just isn't that great I
mean there are definitely some games and
you know they're not bad but a lot of
the games on Android Market are still
you know touch based and while they
works fine it kind of seems like a
little bit of a waste but not a huge
deal another important app is the
PlayStation pocket 1 now what this is
all about is giving you PlayStation 1
games you can almost think of it as the
PlayStation 1 emulator I know by default
it does come crash bandicoot however you
can download a couple of other games
when I say a couple I mean a couple this
is all you get is what 5 games in here
now these games are pretty reasonably
priced so you mean sound like you have
to pay a ton of money to play them but
overall there's definitely just not that
much content that's a little bit of a
problem for me out if you get a get up
you know phone it's all about gaming you
really expect to have lots and lots of
games available however that's not
really the case you know you know 6
dollars for the ps1 game is not that bad
it's just not really what I was
expecting now powering this is a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor now it is
only single core which is a little bit
out of place in this world of dual-core
processors however it's not all that bad
in general UI things so you want to
scroll out here we can swipe and scroll
and whoever we want and it really is no
lag in the UI so some of the features
that you do have or of course you have
some pre-built apps so for example the
Kindle app and to be honest
4-inch display I can actually probably
do some reading it's not all that bad
some of the other apps of course you
have your camera your context all I kind
of you know standard boring kind of
stuff
there's nothing really to jumps out of
course you have Gmail and you know
pretty much the entire normal suite of
applications that you do find on Android
phones and of course you do have access
to the Android Market so if you're
interested in more applications which
I'm sure you will be you can certainly
go ahead and download all you like from
here one great feature is the soft
keyboard now it's a little bit weird for
me at least to have a you know phone
that has slide-out something that's not
a keyboard
I found myself trying to open the
keyboard up a couple of times but on the
side of it the software keyboard is
great so you do a lot of typing and
whatnot so just go to up smack all this
out here and go ahead and open up a
website for you guys and give you a
little demo of how it works it is only a
single core processor like I said so
it's not going to be blazing fast or
anything but it's certainly not half bad
now there is one problem I did notice
and you guys will see it right down
there this is annoying to me I don't
know it's just like I know it's nice to
be able to zoom in stuff but this has
multi-touch I can do that without the
zoom slider so I think it's a little bit
silly to have nine huge deal or anything
but it is a little bit of an annoyance
now another really nice feature is the
camera app now the camera app is pretty
standard so you can see me hello uh-huh
but of course there's some new options
or not rather new but there's some
pretty decent options so we switch over
to the back facing camera as be able to
see I can now rotate and everything no
problem there are quite a few options so
for example you can put it in macro mode
the exposure scene modes picture size is
quite a bit that you can do with it I
also turn on location white balance and
all that kind of stuff as well as flash
now over all the pictures are decent now
they're not going to be anything
spectacular but it does have a decent
macro mode like I said and it's not half
bad front-facing camera is a
front-facing cameras nothing going to be
that particularly amazing as far as
video goes it does only shoot 480p and
it's okay I mean it's nothing
spectacular but it's nothing you know
going to be horrible I mean if you need
a quick shot you can certainly do that
as far as call quality goes does not
have bad of course this is an AT&amp;amp;T phone
and that's really going to depend on how
services in your air
yeah but my testing I found that it
really picks up signal just as well as
any other ATT phone that I've ever
reviewed no real problems there and of
course it does have the HSPA+ network
aka AT&amp;amp;T 4G data speeds do not have that
now I do live in a pretty poor area of
AT&amp;amp;T service so I really never able to
get that good of speeds but of course
it's all going to depend on how the
speeds are in your area so if you if you
have good ATT service you can't expect
somewhere in the neighborhood for my
testing of around one to two kilobits
rather megabits per second down pelvics
that would be bad
anyway guys it's gonna be about it for
my review of the Xperia Play 4G overall
I'm a little torn on this one on the one
hand for $50 it's a long contract it's a
really solid phone and of course you do
have all the PlayStation functionality
and there should be some more content
coming soon we haven't really seen it
yet but there should be a lot of cool
stuff on the way soon on the other hand
though there are some problems that I
have with full-width wholeheartedly
recommending it first of which it's
pretty fat um it's kind of hard to get a
good idea but I mean it's it's a kind of
a fat phone and while I can understand I
mean you know the sliding mechanism is
really really nice you don't have to
really worry about it too much at all
but um it does add some pretty nice bolt
to it and I know it's it's it's not too
bad by most standards but considering
it's 2011 there are a lot of much
thinner phones on the market um speaking
of it being 2011 a single core processor
is I mean it's not laggy or slow but
consider this the PlayStation Vita will
be coming out in the next few months
it's going to have a quad core processor
this is only got single core so it's
kind of already a little bit outdated as
far as the games go um which is a bit of
a worry for me I don't think it's a
deal-breaker but it is something to keep
in mind so overall if you do really do a
lot of gaming you really like having
something like the touch pad it is a
nice feature it definitely is but if
you're just looking for a normal phone
if you're a you're not into gaming I
don't really recommend this this is
really for someone who's into gaming and
wants to get a fairly cheap phone on
AT&amp;amp;T and again it's gonna be about it
for my review if you enjoyed definitely
be sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
