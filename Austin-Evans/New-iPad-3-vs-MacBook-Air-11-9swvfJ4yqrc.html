here with a comparison between the iPad
3 in the MacBook Air at first glance
this looks like an odd comparison as not
only is the MacBook Air over twice the
price but it also runs OS 10 Lion
whereas the new iPad is on iOS 5.1 you
trade the backlit physical keyboard of
the air for a virtual on-screen keyboard
on the iPad and a pair of USB ports
along with Thunderbolt for a 30 pin
connector on the other hand you swap an
11.6 inch to 1366 by 768 display for the
iPads nine point seven inch Retina
display with a resolution of 2048 by
1536 pixel density is great on the
MacBook Air but the iPad is nothing
short of spectacular in comparison you
also gain a multi-touch display along
with a very different form factor the
MacBook Air is just like a normal laptop
a bite much thinner you have the screen
up top and the keyboard and trackpad on
bottom
in comparison the iPad is all screen
with navigation done by touch and with
the virtual keyboard only appearing when
you need it
the MacBook is better for typing in fact
that it props itself up as nice but the
iPad is better for holding in the hand
and the touch screen is very natural to
use I recently spent a week traveling
with only the iPad in the MacBook Air
and I want to start off by saying that I
do a lot of work with video if you
hadn't guessed and all of it was done on
the MacBook the iPad does have a fairly
competent video editor in iMovie but it
just doesn't match up to full editors on
OS 10 not to mention having full file
system access is basically a necessity
for me to get work done on the other
hand whenever I could I found myself
using the iPad being able to watch full
1080p video on a nine point seven inch
screen is fantastic and even though I
miss using Chrome and having flash
support Safari on the iPad really is
good the official Twitter app for iPad
is great and mailed on app isn't half
bad either although I still prefer
sparrow I also do a lot of reading and
as far as I'm concerned nothing can even
touch the iPad as an e-book reader with
the Retina display this is the first
tablet I've used that makes text as
crisp as it would on an actual book
overall I've come away from this little
experiment with a few main thoughts for
as capable as it is if you're someone
who relies on working with video photos
music or writing the MacBook Air is a
spectacular little machine the 11 inch
air is only slightly larger overall than
the iPad and packs enough power to get
real work done on the other hand the
iPad is extremely capable and is a very
different way of doing things in
comparison i OS hides things like the
filesystem
and restrict you to using apps for
everything but because of this it's very
simple to use with very few headaches
it also has excellent battery life at
around 9 hours compared to the roughly
four and a half hours of the air and
having the option to use 4G LTE is
fantastic for around half the price the
iPad is the better choice for most
people but for me it just can't replace
the MacBook if you enjoyed this video be
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
