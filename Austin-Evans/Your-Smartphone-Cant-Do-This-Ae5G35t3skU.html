brand-new Lenovo fab 2 pro in all its
read bubble wrap glory
so when Lenovo reached out and want a
sponsor video on their brand new fab 2
Pro they sold me with one word tango and
no not my amazing dance skills this is
the first google tango enabled phone and
it's full of confetti we more color on
on the table okay so let's get one to
ten how much do I need to move the
confetti off the table right now really
all right
confetti stays executive decision from
Ken so this is the Lenovo fab 2 Pro this
is a very tall box so project tango is
something that Google has been working
on for a little while now and this is
the first phone that's actually shipping
with it enabled and what this
essentially allows you to do is get a
much more realistic augmented reality
experience which might not sound
exciting until you see what this thing
can actually do that is um
that's a large foam so this guy is
rocking a six point four inch qHD
display when you consider that this
screen is essentially your portal into
the augmented world as a goofy as that
sounds having a larger display actually
does make sense so to put in perspective
just how big the fab 2 Pro is I have a
Google pixel and as you can see this is
a big phone so might not be the best
choice for your skinny jeans but it's
packing some serious power
so the fab 2 is rocking a custom
Snapdragon 650 2 processor that's
specifically made for google tango with
that six point four inch 1440p display
as well as four gigabytes of memory 64
gigs of storage and it's running the
latest build of Android marshmallow what
I'm really curious about are the cameras
so on the top there's a fairly standard
looking smartphone camera with a couple
sensors below that however there is an
absolutely enormous camera in the middle
and I'm really curious what that
actually does I'm sure it uses some kind
of fusion of all these sensors and
cameras to build the AR experience but
that is probably the biggest smartphone
camera I've ever seen well it's
definitely on the beefier side the fab 2
Pro is a nice piece of hardware so it's
all
actual metal you get that nice big
display and there's some nice little
touches like they're exposed screws on
the bottom it's on the bigger side
however when you consider just how much
tech is packed in here it's sort of a
different style of smartphone discover
tango an introduction to the tango
experience walk to explore allow for a
clear space around you drink okay so I
guess it's using those sensors to
actually kind of build a depth map
around where the room is up hello
there's a little just a plant growing
underneath the table so once you get
into the interface you can use this like
any other Android phone however what's
cool or a lot of the specific tango apps
that are made for this so the first app
is actually something is pretty
practical this is way fair measure so
the idea is say you're gonna go buy some
furniture you can actually put the
furniture in your space and see how it
looks that is actually really cool you
can see the exact dimensions around it
so say that is going to buy this chair I
would know that maybe I have some
furniture around it or to the side of it
and I know that's actually going to fit
so a little bit more room to work with
we can try some of the other demos such
as hollow so I now see Ken but I can add
a hologram so let's do the hollow Fun
Pack I want The Wrestler dude oh this is
something that most phones can't do just
because well it's easy enough to add a
little bit of an AR element to a game
such as Pokemon go to be able to
actually get full tracking so you can
walk around in full 3d space you can get
close you can step away and it doesn't
lose track of where he is right so he's
standing on that exact spot no matter
where I stand all right this guy's it's
got the moves what's cool about this is
that while it seems like a really simple
sort of thing it's surprisingly good
right so it's almost tricking my brain
at the point where I look at this on
screen I'm like oh the guys standing
there that move the phone and he's
obviously not there like it's a simple
thing but enough to really kind of trick
you it's it's it's better than it should
be honestly next we have Domino world so
this is another case where the tracking
is solid on this table like the shadows
are here I can get nice and close
there goes oh all my hard work got good
do you see that I like reach my hand out
to catch the Domino it's weird at how
good it is it tricking you into thinking
it's real like it was just an instinct I
wanted to reach out and catch the Domino
because I saw it was about to fall on
the floor for
essentially replaces your reality right
you're entirely in that world it's all
digital
whereas AR allows you to actually walk
around in the real world and add digital
elements to it it sounds like it's a
weird distinction but it is a huge
difference so is this for everybody no
but when you consider that this is
something that you can actually go by
today it is a really cool piece of tech
and the cool thing is you're really not
losing anything you're getting a
rock-solid Android smartphone to begin
with and all the extra tango features
are just icing on the cake especially
when you give it another six months to a
year from some of these apps and games
to get even better this is going to be a
killer package if you guys want to know
more about the phatu pro the links will
be in the description I'm curious what
do you think about this in google tango
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
