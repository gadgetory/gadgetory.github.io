here at CES with a little bit of a sneak
peek and what LG has cooking up melon
where they awesome enough to sponsor
this video or importantly they gave me a
badge to get in a whole day early so I
can explore before everyone else gets
here so if you look behind me you might
notice the star of the show this is the
LG signature OLED TV are the R stands
for rollable as these are well
completely flexible OLED so there are a
couple of components to the TV first of
all is the stand which does come with it
but above that that is the actual main
base so you can see as the TV rolls out
it's all sort of coiled up inside and
there's a really cool mechanism that
actually sort of pulls the TV up and
keeps it straight and you might think oh
look at that rollable TV you're going to
notice some sort of picture quality
issues or anything which is like what
the wallpaper TV it looks exactly like
the other OLED
with the added benefit of being able to
disappear when you don't want to watch
TV so you might wonder why exactly do
you want a TV that can roll up well if
you imagine that if you put it in say a
window you could roll it all the way
down and have essentially just a nice
piece of furniture when you're ready to
watch TV hit a single button and the TV
springs to life rolls to life animates
to life I'm out of synonyms and
adjectives so in addition to full view
which is the TV extended you also can
use what's known as line view now this
gives you about 75% of TV rolled up so
it's much smaller but in that case you
can put up things like the gallery
listen to music or you can just
completely hide the TV and the speaker
does still function now as you might
expect we don't exactly have a price on
this guy although it won't come cheap
but it actually will be coming out this
year now if that's not crazy enough for
you I think this definitely will be this
is an 88 inch 8k OLED yes you heard me
right it's an 88 inch 8k Ã¶land
I want one every year see as thorough as
hunt of TVs and usually they get better
and better this is hands-down the
best-looking panel I've ever seen like
full stop so of course oh let's already
have great picture quality when you
combine that with a full 8k resolution I
mean it is ridiculous you cannot see
pixels unless you're like really
uncomfortably close
this is legitimately my dream TV great
it's massive this is the biggest Ola
they've ever made even watching this
video you can watch it in 4k all you
want you cannot see just how sharp just
how crisp this TV is now it is very
early days for a que there's really not
a lot of a cait content out there so
YouTube is actually one of the few
platforms that does already support 8k
so you will be able to watch a ke videos
straight on the TV but on top of that it
does support HDMI 2.1 actually no I've
never really thought about it
we've never uploaded a video in 8k but
theoretically we could upload it and
watch them all on our 8k ll ed right LG
now that's not enough 8k for you there's
also a brand new nano cell 8k TV and the
main difference here if that's not
enough 8k for you there's also the 8k
nanus LTV this trades OLED for LCD and
you have to go down to a mere 75 inches
as if that was not already enormous
enough but the main thing here is did
you still get all those key upgrades
with going to 8k moving into a slightly
darker environment we have the LG Sena
beam hu 85 L now this is their latest
ultra short throw projector and a full
120 inches this looks nice now we're at
a pretty bright show floor usually you
want to watch projector in a little bit
of a darker environment but this is
surprisingly bright and of course it is
a full 4k projector and importantly it
is a dual laser projector as well when I
say ultra short throw I mean II you get
a full 120 inch display from only seven
inches away what's cool about this is
the unit itself is actually still fairly
compact and though it's not quite as
portable as the last center beam that we
took a look at but if you're doing a
proper home theater setup with full 4k
plenty of brightness this is a really
good way of going when it comes to audio
there's a couple of really cool things
here and most notably there's the SL 9
sound bar so in one hand you guys
actually wall mount it and have it
completely flat or if you wait for it to
actually come up you also could do it in
a standard orientation like you would
normally put on a table what's cool
about this is it does take advantage of
Dolby Atmos as well it's really cool to
be able to have a single sound bar which
can serve multiple functions depending
on how you want to use it in case you're
curious it sadly does not come with a
full motorized to halt fast
is that how you do an audio demo
continuing down the audio side we have a
series of X boom speakers now first of
all we have these smaller guys so these
are the X boom go there you go so on the
X boom go side the PK 7 the 5 and the 3
are all available on sale right now on
top of that we also do have the AI side
of things so these both take advantage
of Google assistance there's actually
something we've already taken a look at
in the past but this is the one that has
the full smart display with Google
assistant hey guys Zhou stood the LG
Graham was one of my favorite laptops of
2017 the idea that you have the displays
doesn't make Google assistant a lot more
useful and on top of that it sounds
pretty solid as well it sounds pretty
solid as well I like when my voice
cracks in the video oh there's also a
pair of brand new LG Grahams this year
so now is the 14 calm and a201
form-factor
boot is also now a 17 inch gram concern
that you have a full 17 inch display
with a 2560 by 1600 resolution the fact
that this laptop weighs less than three
pounds is incredibly impressive now if
we walk a little bit over to this side
we have the Graham two-in-one so it's
cool about this is that of course you
can use it in the standard laptop mode
or you can flip it around and take
advantage of it being a full 2m1 if you
want to know more about the Graham we're
actually going to be doing a lot more on
this very soon so stay tuned and with
that I think we're about to get kicked
out like literally everything's turning
off around us so that my friends is a
sneak peek at what LG has at CES this
year if you're interested in anything
that I talked about how I have links to
as much of it as I can in the
description and stay tuned we might just
get a couple things in the office for
some videos it's legitimately time to
leave they're shutting everything down
around us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
