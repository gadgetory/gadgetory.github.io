the very best tech of CES 2018 one of
the first things that jumped out to me
is the in win win bot case and normally
PC cases not all that exciting but here
CES things get a little bit more
interesting one look at this and you're
gonna get some death star vibes so it is
a clear case that is going to actually
be able to haul some pretty serious
components but what really makes it cool
is the fact that it is going to be
completely motorized so not only can you
open and close the case like pac-man
the entire thing will spin around like a
robot now at $3,500 the best doesn't
necessarily mean the most practical
we're gonna say it's actually a lot
cooler than i-5 something else cool is
the pigeon declined to be interviewed
continuing on the gaming train we have
the Razer project Melinda now this is
one of my favorite things from the show
this year so much so that we actually
already did an entire video about it but
the idea is is that this takes the razor
phone and turns it into a laptop so you
plug it in via USB see it functions that
the trackpad as the speakers and the
guts of the phone are enough to run the
entire laptop so if you guys want more
about that dentally be sure to go check
out our full video on Razer project
Linda
speaking of razer they were also showing
off their set up support for philips hue
so you guys probably know that Razer is
all about RGB literally everything and
they're taking that up a notch by
letting you add your hue lights to their
synapse software the way this works is
that inside there's synapse software you
can control your hue lights alongside
all of your accessories so say you want
to get a super cool rave going you can
hit a key and an entire wave will come
all the way around your room it's kind
of ridiculous but I mean actually that's
pretty cool
so you know something I think everyone
will think is cool is Sony's 8k TV now
8k has slowly been showing up at CES
even though you can't really buy them in
stores just yet however Sony up the game
with not only a full HD are compatible
TV big goes up to 10,000 nits how bright
is 10,000 nits
it's really bright you heard it here
first it's really bright
almost as bright as the light that's in
my face right now just put this in
context most standard TVs that even our
HD are compatible might top out at
around 500 nits whereas this guy can go
all the way up to 10,000 now what's cool
about this is that especially for some
games like Gran Turismo for example
which have been designed with some
proper HDR support in mind you're gonna
have incredibly bright specific sources
so say that you see the headlights of a
car or a bright sunset that can be way
way brighter than the rest of the scene
can be actually a really impressive bit
of contrast of course that's to say
nothing about the idea that it is an 85
inch 8k TV which looks ridiculous but
it's actually the HDR stuff that really
sort of blew me away it looks so so good
Samsung we're also showing off the wall
now this is a new type of display
technology called micro LED the idea
here is that it actually is going to be
modular to a degree so while they were
showing off a 146 inch version you could
at least in theory build pretty much as
big of a TV as you wanted assuming you
have a lot of money LG was also showing
off a pair of new displays so they have
not only a 4k option but they also have
a 5k ultra wide so we've been using
their ultra fine 5k displays to edit on
for a little while and they're really
nice however what they're adding with
these new displays is HDR at least kind
of they're using HDR 600 which is
brighter than standard displays however
because neither windows nor Mac actually
support HDR yet it's still kind of a
little bit in the middle right now
what's cool is the 4k option supports
Thunderbolt 3 as well as daisy chaining
so off of a single Thunderbolt 3 port
you can actually run two of these 4k
displays so what I think a lot of people
are going to be interested in is the new
5k ultra wide so with a resolution of 50
120 by 2160 this is basically like a
super wide 4k display and especially for
gaming if you have some crazy
over-the-top system it's gonna look nice
moving to the audio side of things we
have the new Sennheiser HD 820
headphones now the HD 800 are regarded
as some of the best sounding headphones
pretty much anywhere in a 20s add a
glass back to the headphones this might
sound weird
however the 800s they leak like crazy so
if you're in the same room you can hear
exactly what someone's listening to
whereas with the 8 20s like glass
helps to give it a little bit more of a
closed sound while still sounding
absolutely incredible seriously even
though these things are gonna be
probably well over $2,000 there's some
of the best sounding headphones I've
ever tried moving to laptops
there's the 2018 LG Graham so you guys
will probably know that I love the
original Graham I've done a couple
videos on it is one of my favorite
laptops of last year but for 2018 not
only are they going to be bumping it up
to quad-core processors but it has an
almost ridiculously large 72 watt hour
battery there are also some nice
additions including the option of adding
a Thunderbolt 3 port instead of USBC
which is especially nice for those LG
displays you also now get dual SD slots
so you can't open this guy up and not
only add some more memory but also
another SSD this is definitely a laptop
I want to check out as soon as it comes
out in the next few months something I
found surprisingly cool at this year's
show is the casio Morel 2.5 D printer so
you guys are probably familiar with 3d
printers that will print full 3d objects
especially when you get up higher in the
budget so you can do some really cool
stuff with that however with the mop
roll you're actually printing textures
so with our demo they printed a mesh
material but in about five minutes you
can do all kinds of different textiles
you can do fake leather you can even do
things like stone of course this is
going to be more on the manufacturing
sides and say you want to build a cup
row type really quickly it's cool and a
$50,000 it will not come cheap but it is
really cool to be able to print stuff
that looks and feel surprisingly real in
just a few minutes Ken are we done is
this it for CES can we go home now
I don't have a voice anymore I've been
looking at tech all week hopefully you
guys enjoyed our best of CES if you
missed any of the videos check them out
over here or over here I don't know no
no not there there's no videos up there
