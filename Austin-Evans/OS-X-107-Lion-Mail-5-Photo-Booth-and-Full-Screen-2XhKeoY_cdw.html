another one of the new features in a
lion you guys just click this little go
to full screen icon in the top right and
you'll now be brought into full screen
mode and now you guys can see all the
new features in the lion so you guys can
see here first off there's our new full
screen mode which actually looks really
cool it's kind of like an actual photo
booth now you guys can actually see if
you go ahead and click on FEC's there's
actually new effects as well so you guys
can see here there's actually some you
know really cool effect so for example
do you guys look at something like the
lovestruck or this dizzy effect you guys
can see here there's actually a you know
face recognition so we can actually
follow your face long with the effects
which is really cool and you can also
you know scroll with two fingers to the
right for the next screen of effects so
guys that's about it for the new photo
booth application altogether there's
nine new effects according to apple and
there's actually voice rat face
recognition excuse me so you know for
lovestruck and dizzy so guys the next
new application i want to show you guys
is the new mail application in lyon
there's a brand new modification that
you guys can see on screen right now and
it looks very similar to the mail
application on the iPad which you guys
can probably see if you've seen the ipad
application before awesome basically
this is how the application works
there's two panels here the first one is
basically just your emails and you can
sort through them and so for example
here's a message Austin just sent me so
you so we can demo you guys a new
application so you can click on it and
you guys can actually see the content of
the application or excuse me the email
right there you can click on another one
and you guys can see basically the same
thing right here on the right and I can
go back to the email you guys can see
here this is basically how the
attachments look so the pictures here I
can I think double click it and it will
now open up in preview what you guys see
right there alright so we're back in the
mail application and you guys come here
there's actually a redone user interface
on the top bar as well i'll switch be
the icons here there's first get mail
there's a reply reply to all recipients
of the selected message there's forward
there's create a new email create a new
note
which I'll show you guys in just a
second and then they're show related
messages along with flag you can also
sort by inbox sent and by notes here and
look at drafts and then finally you can
show the old view options like basically
how the email application was previously
before lion so guys the final feature in
the mail application is the fact that
you can actually edit browse and make
notes and sick things with your iOS
devices so basically if you go ahead and
