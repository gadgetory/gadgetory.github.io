hands-on demo of the brand-new
photobooth and mail applications in Mac
OS 10 point 7 line for Austin's channel
so guys the first application I want to
show you guys is the new photobooth
application there's a pretty much new
photobooth application for line and this
is actually new when you go into full
screen so basically if you guys want to
go into full screen and this is actually
another one of the new features in Lion
you guys just click this little go to
full screen icon in the top right and
you'll now be brought into full screen
mode and now you guys can see all the
new features in the Lion so you guys can
see here first off there's our new full
screen mode which actually looks really
cool it's kind of like an actual
photobooth now you guys can actually see
if you go ahead and click on feck so
there's actually new effects as well so
you guys can see here there's actually
some you know really cool effects so for
example do you guys look at something
like the lovestruck or this dizzy effect
you guys can see here there's actually a
you know face recognition so we can
actually follow your face along with the
effects which is really cool and you can
also you know scroll with two fingers to
the right for the next screen of effects
so guys that's about it for the new
photobooth application altogether
there's nine new effects according to
Apple and there's actually if boy stur a
face recognition excuse me so you know
for a love-struck and dizzy so guys the
next in that location I want to show you
guys is the new male application in Lion
there's a brand new modification that
you guys can see on screen right now and
it looks very similar to the male
application on the iPad which you guys
can probably see if you've seen the iPad
application before obviously this is how
the application works there's two panels
here the first one is basically just
your emails and you can sort through
them and so for example here's a message
Austin just sent me so you so we can
demo you guys a new application so you
can click on it and you guys can
actually see the content of the
application or excuse me the email right
there you can click on another one and
you guys can see basically the same
thing right here on the right and I can
go back to the email you guys can see
here this is basically how the
attachments look so the pictures here I
can I think double click it and it'll
now open up in preview what you guys see
right there alright so we're back in the
mail application and you guys can see
here there's actually a redone user
interface on the top bar as well
supposedly the icons here there's first
get mail there's a reply reply to all
recipients of the selected message
there's forward
there's create a new email create a new
note which I'll show you guys
a second and then their show related
messages along with flag you can also
sort by inbox sent and buy notes here
and look at drafts and then finally you
can show the old view options like
basically how the email application was
previously before Lian so guys the final
feature in the mail application is the
fact that you can actually edit browse
and make notes and sick things with your
iOS devices so basically if you go ahead
and click this like new Notes button
right there you can actually create a
new note change the fonts attach
pictures and your note will now be saved
on the left hand side so guys that's
about it for the hands-on demo of Mac OS
