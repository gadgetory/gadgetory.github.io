Batman to our preparation Peter Parker
will never change
yes keeping kids off the really
important
I go through hours and hours of the
river stream oh come on
there are junkies to explain but
somebody's gonna do it
which games are you most excited to hear
about v3 and will you be there I will
definitely be at e3 this year so expect
videos on whatever it is that they
announce as far as games I want to get
my hands on I definitely want to try
Super Smash Brothers that's gonna be
awesome
hopefully destiny will be playable at
the show this year same thing goes for
Mirror's Edge really excited about that
one and I really really hope that they
announce fallout 4 like come on guys
just just just announce it like I don't
have to be able to play it just say hey
look fallout 4 it's gonna be a thing and
I'll be happy
have you met some of your fans in the
street how do you feel when that happens
it is awesome so usually it's at things
like CES for VidCon and I get to meet
you guys however everyone's tomorrow
I'll meet someone in like Best Buy or
something I think probably the weirdest
one was when I was getting on a plane
once and someone's like hey I love your
channel and everyone behind me because
you're walking into a plane is like 20
people lined up behind you and everyone
started looking me I was like would you
recommend 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM for
picture editing programming in general
use right now I'd say 8 gigabytes is the
sweet spot so unless you're doing some
very heavy photo and video editing a lot
of those programs will literally just
eat up as much RAM as you can give them
it's an 8 gigabytes I'd say is fine when
did you start YouTube and what equipment
did you start off with my first video
when that just over 5 years ago so in
the beginning I didn't have a whole lot
of anything so I had a 400 laptop which
was half broken at the time I had a
microphone that I stole from the game
rock band and I had an iPod touch that
was it I didn't have a webcam I didn't
have like a digital camera and anything
like that so what I did was I took
screenshots on my ipod of like apps and
things then I did a voiceover with the
rock band Mike and I cut it together in
Windows Movie Maker one thing the
realistic side little graphics they're
phenomenal you get a third person view
in addition to the normal first person
view which shows you and you're quite
detailed the character in the game it
was bad it was enough to kind of get me
hooked and kind of learn how to do it
and from the area I was finally able to
get a camera and better computers a lot
kind of stuff but at the beginning I had
very very little do you know how to
program I've worked on a few websites oh
I know some basic HTML and a couple
years ago I learned Java but I've pretty
much forgotten all of that now so I have
to say
No why isn't asked me called hey Austin
this is guys that's a good point
have you ever broke a test product that
you borrowed from a company yes so it's
actually kind of happened twice so a
couple years ago at CES I was actually
doing a video on the Sony Tablet P which
was this clamshell folding tablet kinda
looks like an overblown like Nintendo DS
or something suggestion see this a
little bit of a different tablet of
course it does have a pair of screens
but you guys can see yeah piglet didn't
break however once I actually did
completely destroy a review unit so it
was actually my first Moto X that I did
a video on late last year so I went out
go-karting and I left it in my pocket
mind you not like my back pocket like I
wasn't sitting on it just my front pants
pocket and when I got out and I walked
out to the car I pulled the phone out
and it was busted like the screen was
like cracked it was very slightly bent
but it was enough to completely kill the
phone so that was a little awkward
do you play or have you ever played
Warcraft I never played the old-school
Warcraft games and I stay way away from
World of Warcraft and any kind of other
MMOs
I know that that kind of game is
absolutely something that could get me
addicted I mean I spent so much time on
Fallout 3 to like take the step up to
like a MMO like you would never see me
again are you satisfied with what you've
achieved on your channel and what you've
replaced since your house went down I'm
not satisfied is the word I mean I'm
happy with where things are going I'm
happy with where things are but I'm not
satisfied I don't think I'm ever going
to be satisfied with anything right like
it can always be better I can always you
know learn how to present better or you
know film my videos better edit better
or whatever I mean there's always going
to be more and more that I can do so I
don't think satisfied is the right word
but definitely I'm I'm happy with where
things are now and happy where I see
things going in the future so kind of if
you guys have any more questions feel
