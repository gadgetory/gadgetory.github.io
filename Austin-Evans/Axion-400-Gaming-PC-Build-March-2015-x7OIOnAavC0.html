and the IC on is a great way to get into
it for $400 you can get a computer that
can handle most any PC game out there
while still being easy to upgrade at the
heart of the acción is an intel pentium
g 32:58 this is not your old school
Pentium on paper it's an ordinary 3.2
gigahertz dual-core Haswell processor
but there's one big advantage the
ability to overclock as you'll see later
even without overclocking the Pentium is
a solid choice but crank it to 4
gigahertz or higher and this will give
much more expensive CPUs a run for their
money on the graphics side we've got an
MSI r7 250x for well under $100 this is
a solid graphics card with 1 gigabyte of
gddr5 memory along with DVI HDMI and a
DisplayPort that supports 4k monitors
don't expect Crysis crushing performance
here but it should easily be able to
handle most games on medium at 1080p for
a motherboard the acción is using an
msi h 81 m ii 34 it supports
overclocking our Pentium right out of
the box along with USB 3.0 and 4 SATA
ports for hard drives SSDs and optical
drives memory is handled by a gigabytes
of Crucial Ballistix sport this is a
single 1600 megahertz module which is
important as it leaves a free slot on
the motherboard if you want to upgrade
to 16 gigabytes of RAM later on the
acción uses a one terabyte Western
Digital blue hard drive I've used a lot
of these in PC builds and they've always
been rock-solid they're decently fast
for the 7200 rpm spindle speed and one
terabyte should be enough to store
plenty of games for the power supply
we've got a corsair CX 430 like the WD
blue the CX 430 is one of my favorite
parts for budget builds with 430 watts
of capacity and an 80 plus bronze
certification to make sure the acción
stays reliable and efficient tying the
bill together is the new fractal design
core 1100 this brings the same basic
layout from the core 1000 including
support for micro ATX motherboards a
front 120 millimeter fan and a new front
fascia put all these parts together and
you've got the acción but let's see how
it performs jump into League of Legends
and you'll see it's absolutely no
problem to run on max settings at 1080p
and together it's the same story for
Minecraft the exile keeps it right up
against 120 FPS even with the graphics
turned up
getting into a more demanding title
shadow of Mordor is playable on medium
at 1080p at around 40 frames per second
move over the Metro last light Redux and
here you're getting a solid 49 FPS on
medium
prepare with the r7 250x you don't
really have to overclock the Pentium to
get solid performance but having the
option can be a big help even from
normal day to day use for $400 the
acción is a solid gaming PC that can be
easily upgraded later on of course you
can customize it with things like a
Wi-Fi adapter an optical drive and all
the links you need in the description of
this video if you enjoyed and want to
see more PC builds like this definitely
be sure to subscribe to the channel
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
