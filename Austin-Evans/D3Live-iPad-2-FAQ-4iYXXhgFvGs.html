to be talking all about the ipad 2 so of
course ipad 2 launched yesterday and
I've had lots of coverage on my sham
what you guys can check out on but today
I'm going to be totally focusing v3 live
on your questions so of course every
episode III life is filmed in front of
log TV we've got quite a few people in
here now so just go ahead and start
answering some of your most asked
questions what is the megapixel for
camera skills on the ipad to the ipad 2
has the exact same camera is on the ipod
touch 4th generation okay it's got shoot
720p video and point 7 megapixel stills
they're not really it's not a good still
camera that's okay for video but what it
really relies on is a lot of light
outside is really nice camera inside
it's pretty grainy although for facetime
that really doesn't matter because it's
going to be a little bit pixelated
anyway so it's pretty much just a
FaceTime camera you're not going to want
to you know walk around trying to felt
like that it's a little bit silly um how
much rain is the ipad have it has 512
megabytes of RAM you know that's a
little bit lower for example a couple of
the other tablets such as the blackberry
playbook and the motorola xoom have a
full gigabyte of ram however since the
ipad is based off of iOS and it's
typically not to ram hungry i have
noticed any slowdowns any major issues
whatsoever with 512 megabytes of ram in
fact i think that was probably more that
really needs but of course more is
always better how the audio quality high
tone low tone etc audio quality is
really good with the ipad 2 there's now
a speaker down on the bottom left it
provides really really deep and actually
pretty powerful sound I mean I haven't
really gotten into too many tests I need
to listen a lot of music and stuff
because of course I've had this for less
than 24 hours but my first impressions
are is really really nice portion out
for you know listening to music for
watching movies especially for movies
and game time sort of stuff it's going
to sound really really valid and very
very accurate I definitely noticed you
know compared like an ipod touch or you
like some laptop speakers or something
the sound seems to be really add
you know there's the right amount of
base and all that kind of stuff again I
would get into that after i do a little
bit more testing how is reading books on
the ipad 2 excellent I pretty much do
all my book reading in the kindle
application so Kendall work excellent
for the ipad and of course this is
literally no major differences between
the ipad and ipad 2 as far as ebook
reading but respect really nice
experience the 9.7 inch display is
perfect for reading books and of course
ipad 2 as plenty of power to you know
get the nice page scrolls and all that
kind of stuff but notice the difference
in battery life I'll tell you what I am
currently at forty-two percent battery
life on this ipad i purchased it last
night about six o'clock so that was what
about 20 hours or so ago i've been using
it on and off and i'm only down to forty
percent so yeah it's pretty good if it's
taken me this long just to get fifty
percent yeah i'm really impressed so far
i'm not even so much as plug this in one
since i got it at the box um do i do
have a way to view flash video yeah
there are a couple of different apps in
the extra food that you can use to view
flash video on the ipad most notably i
know the one is skyfire i use that on my
ipod touch all the time it works
decently but uh it's not a perfect
solution generally have to wait around a
little bit and wait for it to buff and
all that kind of stuff although with the
ipad 2 which is the same as on the
original iPad you can view youtube
videos and that sort of thing just
embedded no problem but as far as
standard traditional Flash content
you're not going to be able to view that
without some apps such as skyfire will
you recommend the ipad 2 to family and
friends like the hostler 0 uh well I
said I hadn't quite had the ipad 2 long
enough to give my full review but my
early impressions are absolutely this
thing is great you know it's really nice
for viewing websites in fact with the
dual core processor I'd say it's pretty
much as fast as most laptops of course
you've got you know watch movies the
apps the games everything ah first
impressions are yeah i would recommend
it to family and friends in fact I've
already done that to a couple of my
friends but yeah really really solid so
far um big noticeable difference in
graphics um not yet what the ipad 2 does
have a much more powerful graphics
indeed they say that around
nine times faster which take it with a
grain of salt but anyway it does have
much improved graphics however the rules
aren't a ton of games that are available
I mean current games are going to look
pretty much the same as on the iPad and
there are a couple such as dead space
that are optimized for the ipad 2
however I have really gotten into a lot
of the gaming yet and mostly been making
videos about various apps that sort of
thing so yeah there is a big difference
in graphics but I haven't really been
able to test that too much so you know
what we'll see a little bit later why
didn't apple add retina display to ipad
2 I think glue the major reasons is cost
I mean if you take a look at like the
iphone ipod touch you know when they
update the screen that's a small screen
so they can afford to spend a little bit
extra on the display over with an ipad
but what you got understand is this is a
9.7 inch display if they made this a
Retina display he would have a higher
resolution than for example the Apple
LED cinema display which is over one
thousand dollars so um I'm sure Apple if
they wanted to they could have a Retina
Display iPad but that ipad would
probably cost twice as much and I don't
really think that that's a trade-off
that they're worth you know they think
is worth it so threaten the display is
still pretty solid on this it's got
fantastic viewing angles I'll cut stuff
but it is fairly low resolution so no I
think it's just a trade-off just you
don't have to pay a thousand dollars for
an iPad should you upgrade from the
original iPad that is an excellent
question um it depends on the iPad one
is still a great piece of technology
however the ipad 2 is better in several
key ways most notably in speed and the
thinnest i think i really think that the
thinnest is probably the one of my
favorite things about the ipad 2 um one
of the biggest things i think if you're
considering upgrading is how much is
that going to cost you so if you're
considering selling the current ipad go
on ebay see what they're going forward
or I should throw a variety of websites
on all about selling try to figure out
exactly how much it will cost you to
sell that and then go and figure out
which ipad 2 you want to do you know if
it's only going to be a little small
difference as far as you make like a
hundred dollars two hundred dollars then
yeah I'd say definitely go if I had to
however if you're going to be spending a
lot of money to upgrade uh you might
want to think about a little bit go test
it at your local best buy or apple store
I think it's a solid upgrade um but the
ipad one is still pretty solid piece of
technology
is on the interface good absolutely I
actually just recently did some videos
about it showed you guys a video i
filmed from my movie as well as i had to
edit and all that you guys can check
that on my channel but yeah overall I
movies pretty solid slightly just the
slides a little bit laggy every once a
while but not too bad and I guess that's
it to this week's episode of d3 live if
you have any additional questions about
the ipad to feel free to leave them in
the comment section below i'll try to
answer as many as i can anyway guys if
