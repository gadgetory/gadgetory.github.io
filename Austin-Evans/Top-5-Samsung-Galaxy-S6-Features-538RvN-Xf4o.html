used for the galaxy s6 and after
spending a couple hours with it last
week I've got to say this is the biggest
upgrade to the galaxy line yet the
biggest changes with the design gone are
the days of plastic and fake chrome and
in is an all-glass of metal build it
definitely shares some DNA with the
iPhone with a band of aluminum sandwich
in two sheets of Gorilla Glass 4 on
front and back but it's the best kind of
inspiration the glass feels grippy in
the hand and allows for some awesome
looking color shifting depending on the
light while you do lose the removable
back and waterproofing instead would you
get as a foam that finally looks and
feels premium another big addition is a
second model the Galaxy s6 edge this is
completely identical to the normal foam
but it curves both edges of the display
unlike the half-baked note 4 edge this
gives you easy access to swiping in from
both sides with a slight but noticeable
wraparound effect it's hard to get
across on video but after years of
staring at flat screens even a minor
curve goes a long way in giving the
illusion of the screen flowing around
the phone
couple that with thinner and more
comfortable bezels and I'm surprised
Samsung bother with a normal galaxy s6
at all as far as phones go the GS 6 is a
spec monster inside it's using an 8 core
samsung exynos system-on-a-chip one of
the first SOC is based on the new 40
nanometer process paired with three
gigabytes of RAM this is as powerful as
it gets right now and while benchmarks
will have to come a bit later I couldn't
get the phone to lag or stutter at all
in my time with the device it's also got
a 5.1 quad HD display with a whopping
resolution of 2560 by 1440 putting it at
a slightly ridiculous 577 pixels per
inch at this point I think we're hitting
the point of diminishing returns but
there's no doubting that this is a very
very nice looking screen wireless
charging is also now built in which is
nice with the added benefit of
supporting both Qi and Powermat meaning
this should work with basically any
wireless charging system out there
Samsung pay not the most creative of
names but this is Samsung's take on
mobile payments this works alongside the
fingerprint reader in the home button to
authenticate which thankfully now works
by tapping instead of swiping bringing
it right in line with touch ID on the
iPhone just like you would imagine this
works with NFC but there's one
major advantage the ability to use it
with normal magnetic stripe readers
Samsung pay won't be up and running for
launch
but according to Samsung it will work
similarly to normal and Etsy payments by
holding the phone against the credit
card reader which should work on roughly
90% of systems where project zero was
needed the most is on the software side
and here TouchWiz has finally been tamed
Samsung has slashed the amount of
preloaded apps they include to a minimum
and replace them with some actually
useful options like Microsoft onedrive
and Skype the skin has been brought
closer to stock Android and thankfully
is running the latest 5.0 lollipop
update it might not be quite as clean as
the Nexus but compared to earlier Galaxy
models it's like night and day so what
do you guys think about the galaxy s6
let me know in the comments below and if
you want the other side of this video
check out my buddy Jon from TLD where he
goes over what you need to know before
getting the GS 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
