he was asked me episode four so if you
guys never seen this before this is
where I answer all kinds of questions
from you guys whether it's on Twitter
Facebook Google+ or here on YouTube so
let's jump right on in ask me number
four how I do my hair okay I'll admit
it's a little bit big right now I've got
to get a haircut but seriously this is a
big improvement over my last year it's
an even bigger improvement over the hair
I had before that so um yeah but I will
definitely have Austin's hair style tips
coming up soon I'll do an entire video
on how I gently I won't I will don't
don't don't look for that it won't
happen probably do we see the better
graphics performance from the
PlayStation 4 against Xbox one in
third-party titles that'll be really
interesting to see so overall yes I do
think so now if you guys aren't familiar
both the Xbox one and PlayStation 4 have
very similar hardware inside the big
difference is that the PlayStation 4 has
about 50% more on the graphic side which
is actually a very significant amount
now generally speaking even though the
PlayStation 4 will be more powerful I
would expect a lot of games to look
pretty much the exact same just because
if you're a developer and you're making
for both consoles it's not really gonna
be worth your time to spend a lot of
extra money and a lot of extra
developers and everything making one
version of it look better than the other
when no one really cares that much
however I do think that some games
especially the exclusive games that are
made by Sony should I should look
significantly better not you know any
kind of insane amount but you know 50%
more power is quite a bit so I do think
that some games not all of them will
look quite a bit better on the
PlayStation 4 how would you feel if
Apple entered the game console world
could they pull it off that's an
interesting point
Apple pretty much already has everything
they need to make a game console so they
have the App Store where there are tons
of games already and I'm sure if they
made it simple they could pretty much
port all of these over to any kind of
future console they wanted you have tons
of people with iPhones and iPods and
iPads they have the Apple TV and they
have airplay so that you can already
play games from your iPhone over to your
Apple TV which would then go on the big
screen so they pretty much have all the
you know the the whole recipes already
there for making themselves the game
console now will they do it I don't know
but if they wanted to they definitely
could be successful in my opinion I mean
you make some games with you
you can use with your iPhone kind of
like the Wii U where you have multiple
screens and then you use something like
airplay to stream it over to like a game
console there's a definitely a lot of
cool stuff that Apple could do if they
were interested a my awesome trick
question of course I am
haha but you are awesome - the answer is
yes I think why do you think the Xbox
one is not letting you reuse 360 games
the reason there's no backwards
compatibility with the Xbox one or
Playstation 4
it's simply because the hardware isn't
compatible so sometimes there's a new
console generation is really simple to
upgrade for example when we went from
the Gamecube to the we do we would say
we'll play all the kinds of GameCube
games no problem however most of the
time when there's a new architecture
like there is this generation pretty
much the only way to do that is to
actually build in a physical chip or
Malta in this case multiple chips
they'll actually be able to run Xbox 360
games or PlayStation 3 games into the
new consoles and that's what happened
with the original ps3 the house some of
the original fad models could actually
play ps2 games and that was great but it
was also expensive as they had to build
the extra chips in there which would
specifically just be able to run ps2
games and if they did that in this
generation not only would it add a lot
of cost but it would add a little bit of
bulk to the consoles and general I don't
think the Microsoft persona really
thought it was a big enough deal to make
you have to pay like an extra $100 just
so you could play ultra games when most
people probably already have an Xbox 360
or ps3 hanging around anyway what is
your opinion about the Nvidia shield and
its features in price point I'm looking
forward to the shield so a couple weeks
code III I was able to try the final
version of it and I was actually
impressed with how good the controls
were I mean something like this I really
wasn't expecting a whole lot like yeah
sure it's got a couple of sticks couple
buttons whatever but it actually felt
very similar to an Xbox 360 controller
which is definitely two big thumbs up in
my book now as far as the price they
recently did actually cut the price um
so before is going to be to 350 dollars
now they recently cut it down to 300 I
still think 300 is a little bit much but
considering the fact that it is running
Android it does have a nice screen so
you're gonna be able to play games and
emulators and you're also going to be
able to stream PC games over to it if
you have an Nvidia graphics card
I think it'll definitely be an
interesting thing I definitely can't
wait to check it out when do you think
we will see Intel Core i3 or i5
processors coming in foreign factors
like 7-inch tab
and phones Intel is already working on
this they already have atom processors
and both phones and tablets which are
already really fast but give them a few
more years and I don't think it'll be
any kind of stretch whatsoever to see
the same level performance we have on
laptops today beyond our phones and
tablets room tour I'm in the middle of
moving right now but once I get the new
place all set up and have a new place to
film and have the office all organized
it's never gonna people organized but
once I get all you know kind of set up
I'll definitely doing a room tour or an
office tour for you guys just keep in
mind it'll probably be a little while
before I actually get it all set up
because it takes a while and I'm lazy
but yeah mostly the lazy thing anyway
that's about it if you guys have any
questions for next time feel free to
drop them over on Twitter Facebook or
Google+ and all those links will be in
the description of this video as well as
you can also leave comments on this
video and who knows you might be in the
next episode of ask me if you're
interested in more feel free to check
