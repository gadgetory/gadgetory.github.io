highlighting some smaller upcoming
youtubers recently I've been very
impressed with the video quality and
professionalism of several new tech
youtubers who have less than 1000
subscribers so let's take a look at some
people you should check out the first
youtuber is Kendall from why try what I
really like about his channel is the
fact that he's got a nice I for good
camera angles and saw it editing as you
can see here in his file cut 10 review
his channel is mostly focused on mac and
iphone videos but there are also a few
camera and miscellaneous videos from
time to time he hasn't posted quite as
many videos as usual the past few weeks
but if you like what you see you can
definitely check him out perfect perfect
upgrade because I came from iMovie 11
the interface is very similar and
therefore very easy to learn let's go
ahead and get started is review next we
have can of full circle reviews his
reviews are very professionally made
with solid visuals and a helpful
narration like on this exo-m review a
typical it covers accessories but also
does a few tutorials and screencasts you
won't find much else beyond reviews on
its channel but hey it's called full
circle reviews for a reason about in
weird angles relative to me now what I
was not particularly impressed with was
the materials used to make them out last
but certainly not least we have Robert
from the technology flow his channel is
only a few months old but the quality
and attention to detail of his videos is
already great he covers iphones and
ipods reviews of products as well as
tutorials as you can see from this
review of the cad one USB microphone
he's honest and helpful in his reviews
so if you like be sure to check him out
according something if you want to kneel
a certain part you've got that knob for
doing that and now when you buy the
microphone you don't only get the
microphone we also get a nice high
quality stand so there you go my
highlight of a few upcoming youtubers if
you like what you've seen here
definitely check them out on the links
in the description and tell them I sent
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
