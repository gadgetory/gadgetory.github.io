for you on the blackberry torch so the
blackberry event just wrapped up and so
go ahead and cover everything we talked
about and then did talk about blackberry
OS six I actually not even get to index
on that i'm not going to focus on the
torch but i will mention it is a pretty
substantial upgrade and it does actually
bring it quite a bit closer to the
android and iOS as far as features and
polish odorless when just focus on the
blackberry torch so this torch is
actually a pretty interesting phone
especially for a blackberry as it has a
slideout keyboard very similar to the
palm pre so taking a look at it is
actually really interesting as it does
have like i said a full qwerty keyboard
as you slide it out as well as an
optical trackpad so this is interesting
as it also does have a touchscreen so
you have a lot of different options of
depending on how you want to go ahead
and input text etc etc okay so some of
the specs include it has a 3.2 inch 480
x 360 resolution screen it also has of
course the blackberry 60 s a 5 megapixel
camera with flash 802 11 and Wi-Fi full
these the bites of onboard storage as
well as an included four gigabyte
microSD card 512 megabytes of wrong and
512 megabytes of RAM and of course the
optical trackpad now this will be
launching on AT&amp;amp;T and it will only cost
199 dollars so it's not too bad I've got
to say guys I'm actually really
impressed with the new torch what I
really like about it is that it's a step
away from the standard blackberry design
and that thing gets that that blackberry
still makes some of the best keyboards
and you know a really solid phone
however it's about time I'm glad that
they've done it it's about time to step
away from that and sort of get into the
same sort of market as you know the
iphone and android so what's really cool
about the torch i like is i really like
the portrait slide out keyboard I like I
liked the pre a lot at find out probably
like the torch once I once it actually
comes out so of course it does have a
great keyboards has a touchscreen I find
interesting that has an optical trackpad
as well so you really do have a lot of
options
how you want to use the phone and of
course the hardware it looks really
solid as you know most libraries of
hardware it anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
