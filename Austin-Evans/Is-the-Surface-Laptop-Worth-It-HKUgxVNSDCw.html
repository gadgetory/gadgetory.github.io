surface laptop is it worth it so be sure
to Microsoft we're hooking us up with
the surface laptop early now this is not
a sponsored video but they're cool
enough to let us take a look at it
before it actually goes on sale so this
is the mid spec model what I'm really
curious to find out is what is the
service laptop like to use so Microsoft
has been making services for quite a
while but they definitely never done a
laptop quite like this there's the
surface pro which is much more like a
tablet and there's the surface both
which is kind of a laptop but it also is
detachable and it's a little bit
unwieldy whereas this is a proper
honest-to-goodness laptop did I just say
honest-to-goodness inside we get the
power adapter so what's cool of this one
and something that actually I think that
more people should do is it actually has
a USB port on the adapter so only can
you charge your surface but you also
plug something like your phone in this
is the laptop itself my first impression
of the surface laptop is that this feels
like a really high-end piece of hardware
so unlike previous surfaces which were
made out of magnesium this is all
aluminium it feels awesome on top of
that when you look on the inside you'll
see that instead of having a metal sort
of cover for the keyboard it's actually
lined in this ultimate are of fabric
finish what this allows Microsoft to do
is offer some really cool-looking colors
so this is burgundy and I've got to say
it looks like no other laptop I've ever
tried so let me inside you still get
that same Alcantara but in the red it
really does pop this Alcantara finish
does feel nice but I'm curious how it
will hold up over a few months or years
of use I can definitely imagine with
your palm sitting on the rest all the
time that maybe you could get a little
bit stained or dirty now that's not a
huge problem with the surface pro 4
keyboard which of course you could just
take off and replace with something else
where it was something like this it's
pretty much stuck on I don't think
there's any way of taking that not
definitely not coming out there for
comparison I've been spending a lot of
time with the LG Graham lately now this
is a very lightweight laptop which is
nice and that is definitely not the case
with the surface laptop now that's not
exactly a huge downside that extra half
actually does make this feel like a very
premium product but it also is going to
way a little bit extra in your back one
slight issue with the surface hardware
are the ports so on the right side all
we have is the magnetic service
connector which is mostly used for
charging or dropping it on the dock
around the other side the only other
ports we have are a headphone jack mini
display port as well as USB 3 there's no
USB see
there's no thunderbolt and there's only
that single USB port it will be nice if
there's a little bit more especially on
a high-end laptop like this the big
elephant in the room with the surface
laptop though is Windows 10s so unlike
the standard full version of Windows 10
that most laptops come with this guy is
running the S Edition and what this
means is that it cannot run any apps
they're not from inside the Windows
Store however say you want download some
third-party apps such as Google Chrome
too bad it's not going to be in the
store to be fair there are a fair few
apps that are available in the store
such as Netflix Facebook and VLC but the
issue is say you need to install some
weird piece of hardware that needs a
program to set it up well that wouldn't
work on Windows 10s unless that driver
is going to automatically install once
you plug the device in you're out of
luck now I get the general idea of
having windows 10 s as an option so say
you're going to be buying a budget
laptop and to save a few bucks they
decide to use the S version instead of
Windows 10 same thing goes first say if
you're a school you want to make sure
that the kids aren't installing random
malware exe that's fine that's great
however this is a $1,300 laptop the idea
that I can't even install Google Chrome
on is a big issue the good news is you
can't upgrade the service laptop to full
Windows 10 Pro for free the only problem
is you can only do that until the end of
the year after that it will cost you $50
to do the good thing is the upgrade from
10 s to pro actually only took about
like three minutes and now we have the
full copy of Windows on the laptop
inside the surface laptop has fairly
standard specs so this is the mid tier
version which will run you $12.99 and
for that you get a seventh generation
Core i5 processor a gigabytes of memory
as well as the 256 gig SSD I feel like
I'm going to keep making this comparison
but that's literally the exact same
expect as you get with the LG gram which
coincidentally cost a couple hundred
dollars left
this guy is rocking a 13.5 inch display
with a weird resolution of 20 256 by
1504 what that means is it actually is a
really nice display not only is it sharp
it has really nice color contrast
viewing angles all the standard stuff
and stop it all off it's a touchscreen
hey guys is Austin my voice might be
gone but what is this is the MacBook Air
what also isn't are the speakers this is
she sounds pretty good
the keyboard also is pretty solid so it
does feel very similar to what you would
find on the surface pro 4 type cover but
that's not really a bad thing now with a
Windows 10 laptop generally I want to
use the touchscreen more than the
trackpad but as far as Windows trackpads
go I don't really have a lots can play
about it all here alright so we are up
and running with overwatch now this is
definitely not a gaming PC but you can't
play some lighter titles and here we're
running a 900 key on low it is usable
however luckily we have a professional
MLG overwatch player named savage Kent
the framerate is not ideal I mean we're
we're hitting like frame rates that are
definitely like usable but if you're
especially taking overwatch very
seriously I find it really hard to like
what what I'm getting out of this laptop
oh my god once you upgrade windows 10s
the service laptop is a solid piece of
hardware however the value is just a
little bit hard to justify don't get me
wrong this is a terrific laptop but for
the price you're definitely paying a
little bit extra for that nice build
quality and for that terrific screen so
what do you guys think about the surface
laptop let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
