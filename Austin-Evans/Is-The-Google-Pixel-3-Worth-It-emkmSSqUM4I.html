side-by-side with last year's model
you'll find something that looks a lot
like a pixel 2.5 at least until you look
at the display which is slightly
style-challenged thanks to the giant
knotch
look past the looks though which is
sometimes difficult and you're going to
find a truly excellent smartphone
there's no doubt that the pixel 3 is a
nice piece of hardware it's an all
aluminum and glass build with a few
interesting touches the rear has a
two-tone finish again it is all glass
while on top its glossy the bottom is a
much more matte finish which not only
matches the previous pixels but still
feels really nice by adding a little bit
of grip to the phone importantly this
also enables none of the ip68 water
resistance but importantly the brand new
fast wireless charging on the pixel 3
which is all fine and great until you
realize that well a slight drop on the
concrete
might shatter the entire back of your
pixel 3 specifically if a certain friend
of yours borrows the phone to shoot some
footage and the wind blows it onto the
concrete guys we're supposed to tell him
through although this dropped from like
3 feet and the entire back is shattered
and even the front corner is shattered
yeah I mean I think it hit just right
but this is gonna crack either way
oh yeah it's it's does scratch pretty
easily here so fun fact don't drop your
pixel 3 or the glass back of shatter and
you'll have to ask jerryrigeverything
very kindly to fix your phone for you
get a case at Austin Emma's comm slash
pixel cases great ok I'd like to make it
better URL know something I appreciate
is we have the same squeeze feature to
access Google assistant from last year
in my opinion this is way more useful
than say if a company were to put a
hardware button on the phone which can't
be remapped and is only useful for a
very useless voice utility feature
Bigsby anyway what do you do is you
squeeze it what's the weather tomorrow
tomorrow and Clermont it'll be sunny
with a high of 85 and a low of 61 it
should be no surprise the pixel 3 only
has a single USBC port there's no
headphone jack to be found but what's
nice is it now has there a pair of USB C
headphones in the box
would you also have the USB C power
cable the fast charger and importantly a
headphone jack adapter and a USB a
adapter you know like none of the things
that Apple includes with the iPhone 10
which is more expensive so yeah the
stereo speakers have returned and while
there's supposedly 40% louder I've got
to say the pixel 3xl sounds know slowly
better than the standard pixel 3 now a
big part of that I think is that this
one seems to distort a little bit at
higher volumes whereas the XL sounds a
lot richer and specifically doesn't do
that same Distortion now my June neither
these phones are going to compare to
something like the razor phone 2 but
they sound pretty good
just the 3 XL is a lot better it might
be a small thing but something I
appreciate on the pixel 3 is the smaller
camera bump we lay it down flat on a
table it doesn't really rock as much
especially compared to the iPhone the
pixel 2 has the best camera of last year
and arguably this year as well and it
should be no surprise that the pixel 3
steps it up even farther what most
impressive things here is not like just
the dynamic range but the overall color
things look so so good on this camera I
don't think it's really an exaggeration
to say that this makes every other
smartphone camera look bad serious let
me just look at some of this stuff the
portrait mode is also fantastic even
though it doesn't have the telephoto
lens to get that extra depth data Google
does such a good job of being able to
isolate a subject and really pull it out
of the background of a photo I've said
it before I'll say it again
this camera is straight-up awesome now a
lot of it really just does come down to
the level of AI machine learning
buzzword are' that really just makes
this camera dope I'm just gonna keep
saying that because it's really good
well the pixel 3 still has a single
rear-facing camera what it has new this
year is a pair of front-facing shooters
a standard angle camera as well as a
much wider angle which is what like 184
percent wider than the iPhone 10's
did you all stick around in the back of
me what school is that there's a zoom
slider that will seamlessly move between
the front-facing cameras and when you go
wide it is really really wide so you
know when you want to take a photo with
all your friends you can get them all in
a shot with a pixel three right friends
friends friends yeah there we go all my
friends with my pixel three it's great
take that west this is what for cape
video looks like straight off of the
pixel three it's not lis can you tell if
there's a decent amount of dynamic range
and pretty good stabilization but on top
of that in this really good autofocus
all you do is tap on a subject and it
will track it around so as I get closer
or farther away from the camera the
focus shouldn't actually follow the only
real downside here is that there is no
4k 60 support unlike most other phones
this year but with all the processing
that's been going on here the pixel
three looks seriously dope as far as
video is concerned at the launch event
Google heavily focused on features like
cloud computing AI machine learning
other cool buzzwords but whether they
didn't talk too much about his
performance which actually is really
really solid the pixel 3 has very
standard specs for 2018
you've got the snapdragon 845 only four
gigs of ram as opposed to six or eight
and 64 or 128 gigs of storage if that
sounds a bit underwhelming in a world
where the much cheaper poco phone has
the same processor and more memory than
you aren't alone at the press conference
I was kind of disappointed the 8:45 has
been around for quite a while at this
point and the next generation is
definitely right around the corner now
this is a complaint I've levied at other
phones have come out recently including
the Galaxy Note 9 but it's just as
relevant here on the pixel 3 this is a
smart phone with specs that will be
outdated very shortly however after
about 10 seconds with a pixel 3 my
doubts quickly vanished this thing is
straight up fast and when you compare it
to the 1 plus 6 which up until now has
been the Android speed King this is even
faster and even smoother and that might
not be a huge surprise considering that
Google hopefully knows a thing or two
about optimizing phones for Android and
to be fair there are definitely some
other advantages here including nolle
does it running Android Pi right at the
box they've got the animations nicely
tuned but the long story short here is
that it is incredibly fast it's
incredibly smooth
it's well maybe not the most outdated
SPECT in the world because it works with
Android 9pi onboard you're getting a lot
of nice little additions but one of my
favorites is the gesture navigation now
I'll be honest this is one of my
favorite parts of using the iPhone 10 is
it's really easy to move between apps
and it is almost as intuitive here on
the pixel there are a lot of other
smaller features including some that
will be coming to previous pixel devices
but my favorite by far is call screen
the way this works is similar to Google
duplex is if you get a call in and you
don't want to answer it you can just
allow Google to screen the call and you
get a live transcription oh look
Matt's calling I'm going to screen it hi
the person you're calling is using a
screening service from Google and will
get a copy of this conversation go ahead
and say why you're calling do you need
to get a hold of them urgently yes just
so it's clear go ahead and say more
about why you're calling they can't talk
right now but they'll give you a call
later thanks and goodbye
automatically hangs up this is like the
greatest thing ever that's so cool
I'm never gonna answer anyone's phone
call ever again looking back I think
it's safe to say that pixel 2 is aged
well it's hard to avoid the elephant in
the room while the pixel 2 did pretty
well the pixel 2 XL had some major
screen issues smelly did the XL have
some color issues rather the box was
brand new but it also had some fairly
severe burn in with those early units
now to be fair your software is solved
some of these problems and they've
replaced most of the issues with the
actual burnin but still pixel to excel
screen not too hot which brings us to
the pixel 3 so first of all we have the
standard pixel 3 which does have a
larger 5.5 inch display now this is I
believe still an LG panel but the gist
of it is is that while it is OLED we
don't have any of those same issues that
we had last year colors very vibrant it
looks to be fairly accurate and that
also applies to the pixel 3xl of course
there's no overlooking the knotch and
the chin yeah okay look I'm gonna be
completely real with you this is one of
the ugliest phones I've seen in
a while now for some people that's
probably going to be no big deal I mean
you know you're looking at the screen
not what's around the screen but I've
never seen a notch I didn't like until I
saw the screaming tortured face of the
pixel 3xl
unlike other large notches like on the
iPhone which has Knology front-facing
camera but all of the face ID tech here
we've got something a little different
to front-facing cameras as well as the
front firing speaker
now the speaker does sound good but it
just sounds like the little bit of a I
don't know is it really worth this huge
notch maybe they could have just moved
some things up or made it not quite so
deep and don't get me started on the
chin it's just not symmetrical I mean I
don't mind having a little bit of a chin
but I mmm not good looking not not uh it
still is a great phone but as far as I'm
concerned I would much rather use these
standard pixel three which doesn't have
a notch but it also doesn't look ugly
and unsymmetrical and there's also a
normal human size phone I like something
that's gone up this year is price so
where the pixel to last year was six
hundred and fifty dollars the pixel
three now this year starts at eight
hundred bucks
now it's not quite a big of a difference
when it comes to the Excel models last
year was eight hundred fifty dollars and
this year it's nine hundred bucks but
regardless this is definitely a more
expensive phone this year I can't
believe I'm saying this but it actually
isn't totally unreasonable this is
definitely a year where $1000 flagships
have become the norm so $1,800 is kind
of not that bad what I really want to
see is a comparison between the iPhone
10 R and the standard pixel 3 now this
is a smaller phone it's about $50 more
expensive but they have similar aluminum
build with a glass back a single great
camera on the back of it as well as what
should be pretty decent screens if only
we could do a comparison test of these
two phones when the other one comes out
soon an intent wink-wink subscribe for
the full video coming soon whether it's
the smaller pixel 3 or the larger pixel
3 XL as well as a pair of sunglasses so
you don't have to look at the chin and
the notch all day I think it's pretty
clear that the pixels are worth this
year if you're looking for a very
high-end flagship not only are these
some of the best phones of 2018 but
probably some of the best phones of 2019
as well yeah you know so you have to
look at the chin of the knotch
just quit it's fine what's the problem
just look just I can't see anything
besides my glorious screen that notch is
just not even there it's it's blinded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
