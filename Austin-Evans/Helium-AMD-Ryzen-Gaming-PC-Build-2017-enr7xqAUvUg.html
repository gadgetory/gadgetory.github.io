just a couple of my budget gaming PC
build however today we're doing
something a little bit different
meet helium a brand new high-end gaming
PC powered by rising so big shout out to
Andy for hooking us up with rising early
so inside this box you'll see that we
have some fun toys to play with for this
build so first of all we have the brand
new risin 7 1800 X processor now this
thing is no joke now they just have
eight full cores that are hyper threaded
but it can light up to four gigahertz we
also have the new MSI X 370 X powered
gaming titanium motherboard because of
course the longer the name the better
its board but this is just the beginning
of what we have in store for helium for
the case we're doing something just a
little bit different this is the corsair
600c now from the outside it might look
like any other case but take a look at
the 600 C you'll see that it is a little
bit of a different looking case so you
pop it open and what you'll find is it
inside everything is flipped upside down
so your power supply goes up here the
motherboard goes in upside down the
graphics cards are here and while in
theory this will allow it to be a little
more compact than a normal large ATX
case honestly also just think it looks
really cool powering the helium is a
700k wives EVGA supernova power supply
so while this might technically be just
a little bit more than we actually need
to run this system I always like to have
just a little bit of extra Headroom and
since it's an 80 plus gold supply it
means it should be reliable and
efficient for quite a while so since
we're using a rising CPU we have to have
an AMD am 4 motherboard which is where
the X power comes in so in theory this
actually will support future AMD chips
however Rises 7 should be about as
high-end as it gets for a while and this
still has all the bells and whistles
that we want also that looks really cool
so this is my first close look at an AM
4 motherboard and for the most part
everything you expect to be is right
here so the biggest difference you'll
see is the cooling is obviously going to
be different to most intel boards but
for the most part you'll find stuff like
ddr4 and to support everything is here
I've got to get MSI props this is a
crazy crazy looking motherboard
just the idea of having that silver
finish across the entire thing it looks
so so clean I absolutely love it
this is going to be much without a rise
in processor to power it
so the
is the 1800 X which means that the box
itself is actually going to be pretty
empty there's no stock will included
here you will have to plan on getting
something else as you'll see we have
something a little special in mind but
what we do have the most important is
the 1800 X as well as a little ricin
stickers if you want to let me know how
cool you are guys so to install all we
need to do is just pull the arm back to
open the socket we line our 1800 X up
nice and carefully until it rests into
place and then we push the arm down and
it's going to be fully installed
remembering we have six pages of ice of
Corsair Vengeance lpx so not only is
this ddr4 but it actually can clock up
to 3000 megahertz so here with our
rising processor this should be a pretty
pretty speedy system 3 SSE we have a
Samsung knife if you Pro now I'm a big
fan of these they are really really fast
and since it comes the m2 form factor it
means that we can nicely sort of tuck it
away in the build now I to doubt you
have to turn 56 version but if you want
to upgrade to more storage you can't get
this in 512 gigabytes and of course we
do have a normal hard drive to go in the
system as well keeping our 1800 I school
is an ek predator 240 this is an
all-in-one water-cooler revising logo on
the side and it's thought this is way
overkill but it should allow us to do
some pretty decent overclock this is
looking a little bit more like it so we
ended up doing is putting our water
cooling on the front of the case and
then changing the case fans to pull air
in from the bottom so the idea is is the
air should be coming up into the
graphics cards and exhausted out the
back now the Rison branding might be a
little bit over the top so not only is
it on the actual block itself there's
also a little logo here but once we get
the graphics cards in we get cables a
little bit more managed there should be
a really clean looking system the other
graphics cards we got a pair of GTX 1080
now yes the 1080p I was just announced
but I don't have any of those and j2
sensibility bar was 1080 so that we're
using for the build
well the cool parts about using this
system though especially with this case
is it actually looks pretty cool we
actually are able to show the graphics
cards off pretty well last but not least
we have a 4 terabyte Seagate Barracuda
hard drive now this combined with the
950 Pro should give us plenty of storage
space with the helium with that the
build is pretty much done so let's do a
little bit of cable management and see
where this guy can actually do alright
so the helium build is up and running
before we get into the actual game I'm
curious how the rising 7th processor
performed so instead of inch on the
single thread side it's little bit down
on something like a cable a core i7 but
most importantly when you get into the
multi thread side it absolutely kills it
and that just makes sense of course we
have eight cores and sixteen threads
here so there's going to be a lot of
power to tackle not only gaming the
things like editing or streaming
something cool but Rison is that all the
CPUs are going to be overclockable as
long as you have a motherboard that
supports it and when the high ends that
should be no surprise especially as more
and more affordable rising ships come
out that's going to be a big advantage
and they're all capable of using the
rise in map commute ility so this is a
windows-based overclocking tool it wants
a little bit basic you still get a lot
of the major things that you would
expect and khlo√© be able to change the
clock speed voltage memory clocks that
kind of stuff however it's in beta right
now and I've had a few issues with it so
I'm going to be overclocking using the
BIOS
with a quick overclock we've got the
1800 X running at 4 gigahertz across all
eight cores and we did that without
needing any additional voltage now it's
not a huge improvement over stock but
it's essentially free performance if you
don't like throwing more voltage and you
have enough cooling so there's
definitely more headroom left in it but
what I'm curious about is how Rison
performs it's topped with GTA 5 the
helium is hardly even breaking it's wet
so playing on the LG ultrawide monitor
which is running at 38 40 by 1600 even
with basically everything cranked up
we're still getting over 80 frames per
second across the board while overwatch
might not be the greatest game to play
on ultra wide monitor this is complete
overkill even playing on epic settings
at full resolution we're still averaging
about 230 to 250 frames per second next
we have ashes of the singularity now
this might not be the most popular game
in the world but it does a great job of
not only taking advantage of DirectX 12
but also as much CPU powers you can
throw at it and here on extreme settings
we're getting a very respectable 55
frames per second next up we have
battlefield one and this is another game
that's fully supported by DirectX 12 so
the nice thing here is that with those
dual 1080s and our rise in CPU nothing
is really being bottlenecked so even
with full Ultra settings I'm still
averaging about 80 to 90 frames per
second well Rison might not have a huge
advantage when it comes to gaming
compared to something like a core i5 or
an i7
having all those extra cores is helpful
for things like editing as well as
streaming and
ii totally handle canes no problem so as
always links to everything you guys need
to build the system will be in the
description i'm curious what do you guys
think about rising let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
