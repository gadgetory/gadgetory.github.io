today I'm here in the next in my series
but must has city application videos now
before you asked yeah it's been a while
I know kinda haven't been doing these
very often but to be honest there have
been a ton of really great apps but that
said this one is a really cool it is
called Android lock and yeah it's it's
very very cool if you've ever seen and
the newer like the Nexus One
it's got it instead of you know the
slide to unlock and they punch in your
keypad instead it allows you to do a
number pad sequence and so yeah it just
been pulled over to the iPhone and iPod
Touch and I'm going to show you guys
what's all about anyway let's get this
one started
so obviously the first thing I need to
do is go to City and before you ask this
is in the BigBoss repo so no worries
I still go ahead and open up search cop
here and cop here there we go okay now I
need to type in Android lock all one
word okay of course city is good okay
Android is close enough so if we look
down here there we go you see here it
says Android lock go ahead and click it
it's very simple just quit as always for
this and hit install
alright have it and I will know that it
does need you to reboot so yeah so
anyway once you have it downloaded and
you've rebooted your device or do is
just turn it off and then turn back on
and you see we had this pattern so I
wanted to show you so obviously you know
you need to do a pattern so I'm just
doing I'm just doing this so obviously
you can see so basically it's very
simple my pattern is and there we go
unlocked so obviously can't quite get
unlocked so obviously it doesn't work
you know it works just like a keypad so
like if I'm trying to get in so I saw
that try to get in so I'll go like this
I won't do any things so you know you
can just do
but my keypads this so I do it locks so
real quick let me just show you a little
bit how it works it's a very simple app
but it's really helpful because I know
I've had my keypad off for a long time
it's just not worth it for me and it
just kind of is really annoying to have
to slide to unlock and all that so let
me go ahead and show you guys real quick
go into your settings obviously and just
come in and it'll be a new thing called
Android law so you can donate or change
pattern obviously you can donate if you
like but let me show you had change of
pattern first guys draw your old pattern
just like you know anything else like
you have to change your keypad so show
you mine in Austria new one so let's go
you do pretty much anything you want
although I think it's limited to about
nine so let's go just draw it again and
there we go so if we back out and lock
it I'm gonna try the new keypad there we
go see you guys that's a pretty quick
video showing you guys
Android lock it's a very cool little
application and I definitely recommend
you guys go give it a shot you know I'm
totally tired of not being able to you
know use my ipod and really lock it up
well so this is a really simple thing
that you just go a few simple little
things and you're good anyway guys
