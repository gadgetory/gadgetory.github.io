MacBook Pro and it is Apple's most
expensive laptop now this is actually
the computer that we've edited all of
our videos for the last year on Hoover
starting at $2,400 it does not come
cheap that's where Microsoft comes in
with their new service book - now full
disclosure they actually did send this
out for review pover as a laptop
starting at $2,500 I'm curious to see
how it stacks up so I should do the
video on the original surface book a
couple years ago and there's a very very
weird concept so the idea here is that
you're getting a computer that on the
surface looks very much similar to
something like a macbook but you can
actually detach the screen and turn it
into a tablet this guy open and the
first thing we see is the wall surface
book itself what really makes this
unique is the hinge so as you can see
when you close the laptop it actually
doesn't go completely flat and that's
because so if you press the button here
for a second what you'll be able to do
is remove the actual tablet put these
two side-by-side and it first means they
look pretty similar but there are a ton
of differences so first of all while
they do have 15 inch display is each the
port selection is very different where
the MacBook has four Thunderbolt three
ports two on either side the surface
instead has a single USBC paired with a
surface connector for charging and
docking but importantly it also has two
full-sized USB ports and an SD card
reader when it comes to screens it is
really hard to argue with either of
these laptops but the surface is
slightly sharper with a resolution of
thirty to forty by 2160
compared to 2880 by 1800 on the MacBook
and the service has the added benefit of
being a touch screen where the surface
book 2 really excels in performance so
inside it has a core i7
8650 you a gtx 1060 16 gigs of ram and
anywhere between 2 and 56 gigs and 1
terabytes of SSD storage with a gtx 1060
inside this is going to be a very
powerful laptop when it comes to video
editing and eating gaming so to put
things in context a 1060 is usually what
you find in fairly high end gaming
laptops but one of the advantages of the
surface book is that still fairly thin
Microsoft has updated the surface book
design since the original so the main
things is that you can now just open and
close it without having to put a hand on
it to sort of steady it and the hinge
feels good so in tablet mode you do get
the full PC experience so the main thing
is you're pretty much losing all the
ports besides the headphone jack but
what's cool is you can just drop it
right back on even backwards and you can
have yourself a super cruel even weirder
than usual looking computer it might be
a bit low-key at this point but I really
appreciate the addition of a USB C port
so yeah it might not be thunderbolt but
I've actually moved a lot of my
accessories over to USB C at this point
and it is really nice to be able to use
a single cable to not only connect to a
monitor but also to get power into the
laptop speaking of power I love the idea
that I can use a single power adapter
for not only the laptop but also my
pixel or even a MacBook
I like the keyboard so the keys are on
the stiff side but unlike on the MacBook
there's actual travel here you know I do
think I slightly prefer the way that the
butterfly switches work on the MacBook
Pro but you're not going to be
disappointed with either of these
something interesting is that
Microsoft's slightly tapers the middle
of the keyboard and that comes down on
the sides and it's kind of hard to see
this on video but we're actually typing
what it means is that your fingers are
going to be slightly elevated which for
me alleviates a lot of wrist strain the
trackpad is decent so as you'd expect
from a Microsoft device it is a Windows
precision touchpad and that means that
not only do you get the additional three
finger gestures like swiping up to pull
up your desktops but it also tracks
really accurately as good as it might be
though it can't match the MacBook Pro
this trackpad is enormous I mean serious
it's like the size of my hand now yes
you can totally get by with the surface
but Apple has the best track pads in the
business as you'd expect from a device
straight from Microsoft there's
basically no bloat in Windows except
they're actually kind of is so a lot of
laptops this included have a few
different pre-installed games such as
march of Empires candy crush and while
that's fine on a 300 all a laptop I'm
paying over $3,000 for a laptop I don't
want to have any bloatware at all sure
it's easy enough to uninstall it just
feels weird that they're trying to make
a few extra bucks on something that's
this expensive where the surface book 2
really shines is in performance so
something by side with the MacBook you
can see that for shorter periods and
single-threaded tasks it does hold it
pretty well from the multi thread side
you're going to lose some performance
but the real star of the show here is
that GPU with the gtx 1060 inside while
you should be using this for video
editing i'm playing some rocket league
now actually we'll say that with this
much power you can play a lot more
demanding games at rocket League but
even at 2560 by 1600 with pretty much
all the settings cranked up this looks
really nice we're getting in order to
feel like 60 and 70 frames per second
and because this is Microsoft there's a
little bit of Xbox inside the surface as
there's an Xbox one wireless radio
built-in no it's interesting about
having a GTX 1060 and a laptop that's so
thin is that besides the battery the
base of it is totally dedicated to
cooling it so yes it's a little bit loud
but no worse than most gaming laptops
and it's a lot thinner for 15-inch
laptops battery life actually isn't bad
so the MacBook should go for around 10
hours where the surface is rated for up
to 17 hours now part of that is because
it has two batteries one in the screen
and one in the base but something to
keep in mind with both of these guys is
that when you're actually doing heavier
lifting such as gaming and especially
video editing expect that number to be a
lot less the surface has a pair of front
firing speakers in the screen and it
sounds good but the MacBook sounds
phenomenal it has two giant speakers
besides the actual keyboard and this is
hands-down the best sounding laptop I've
ever tried when it comes to price both
of these laptops are incredibly
expensive so the surface book starts at
$2,500
but that's only with a 256 gig SSD bump
that up to 512 and you're at $2,900 the
MacBook is $100 cheaper but I don't
think that's going to change anyone's
mind at this price point if you can take
advantage of the extra GPU horsepower
and especially the ability to use stuff
like the surface pen the surface dial
for maybe something like graphics work
then the surface can make sense however
when it comes to the MacBook it's just a
solid laptop all around it's thinner
it's lighter and while the touch four
might seem like a gimmick it really
doesn't affect the actual laptop itself
and stuff like touch ID is actually
really helpful to have the surface does
have a wider variety of ports but I've
got to say over the last year having
four Thunderbolt three ports on the
MacBook has come in handy quite a bit
the surface book 2 might be the most
incredibly engineered laptop you can buy
today everything from these hinge which
will maybe not perfect is actually a
really clever way of doing something
like this screaming everything you need
for a full 15-inch PC into the thin
screen they've done an incredible job
however the MacBook kind of wins in its
simplicity
both of these laptops are available on a
smaller 13-inch size and in that
comparison the GTX 1050 inside the
smaller surface book is a major
contender with
or pro however when you look at the
15-inch sizes the surface book is a hard
sell so what do you guys think about the
new surface book - let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
