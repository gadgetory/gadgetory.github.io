edition 50th episode of d3 live so we've
been doing a little bit of a different
video today we've been live on blog TV
for quite a while now and we're gonna be
doing a little bit of a different thing
while talking about two full topics so
the first thing we'll talk about is HP
pretty much getting out of the consumer
business as a whole and that's a little
bit of an exaggeration but of course
they axed off webOS they're blowing out
the touchpad as well as all the phones I
was able to pick one up right here but
they're blowing all that out and even
trying to you know spin off their
hardware division with the computers and
whatnot now I definitely have talked a
little bit about this before if you guys
want to check it out i did a video about
when what they announced webOS would be
getting killed off which not really
happy about that but in addition they
also of course we're going to be
spinning off their PC line now thinking
about this that has a pretty big impact
around you know the entire tech industry
if you think HP which is I believe the
number one by volume of computer
manufacturers so they make me most
computers out of anyone and they're
deciding to that PC business and we're
good with that that's not exactly good
news for everyone now don't get me wrong
don't try to say that I'm duck saying
the PCs are dying or anything no not
that at all but uh it's certainly very
very curious to see the HPS you should
decided you know what forget this where
you go into businesses this is this
selling to people that's too hard but
yeah so I know I give HP a little bit of
rough time and I know certainly that
everything that everything is perfect
but I don't really agree with their
decision on well I don't really too so
much care about the computer side I mean
I'm not really huge into business but I
definitely do you know what products
they make I know what people like and
what people don't like and what I really
wish is that they would have kept webOS
around for now I mean of course they
just bought palm they spend like a
billion dollars on palm and of course
they've I don't how many millions of
dollars they spent developing all the
products on the advertising mean of
course when you launch a company when
you have like you know all the products
inter thing that costs a lot of money
and that's all down the drain in fact
and they're selling these touch pads
these are place probably costing three
or four hundred hours to make you're
just throwing them away for like a
hundred dollars so there's a lot to talk
about on that side but I kind of try to
keep it brief but I definitely think
that HP is maybe not making a really
a decision business-wise but the way
they did I don't agree with it all i
think they could have fried web what's a
little bit longer got a couple more
products worked on a little bit more but
i thought those kind of my thoughts on
that if any of course you guys would
probably have your own opinions on all
that i know the second big thing of news
this month this week was that google is
buying motorola now this is probably the
biggest news because motorola was the
first time google is really getting into
the hardware market horse Google is
hugely richd I mean I'm sure they can
buy motorola without blinking an eye but
they've always been in the software e of
course you have google search you've got
all kinds of online properties such as
YouTube which you guys probably watching
this video on right now um but this is
the first time they've actually really
hard court well they really pretty much
got into the hardware market at all of
course they will be making motorola
phones and motorola does make android
which horse google owns so there are
definitely some st. they kind of sync up
pretty well there but i definitely think
it's going to be very curious to see
what Google decides to do now there's a
lot of reasons what a lot of things that
they can do with Motorola of course i
can continue making the phones i can
perhaps like amp it up and like all make
all the Motorola phones like you know
special google-branded or know kind of
like tie in Android in that and try to
get a little bit more of a cohesive
experience there that's what we could do
that but from what we know that not
really planning on doing anything like
that whether plenty i'm doing is just
had them kind of like separate just kind
of like we own them but you know we're
not really going to be doing anything
special of course they're going to be
keeping the patents to keep protect from
all these lawsuits that they're getting
which she kind of what happens in the
tech industry but as far as this goes
I'm not really against I think it
definitely could be really cool i would
definitely like to see some really cool
google-branded and you'll really android
like pure Android and all that kind of
stuff on these motorola phones but we'll
definitely have to wait and see what
exactly their plans are google plans to
do with this and you know all the phones
that we may or may not see in the future
okay so for the second segment of d3
live well we taking live questions from
every one of the chat as always every
episode of d3 life is filmed room from
the live audience we've got quite a few
people in fact a record amount of people
in here right now so i'm just going to
take a couple of questions what do I
think of Microsoft Apple Nintendo
insanity came together to make a product
well there
well realistically I'm sure they would
probably get shot down for you know like
abusing their status or whatever
whatever the competitive I forget
exactly but yeah the feds are probably
walk in and stop that but I'm just
assuming that you know that was just an
eye that just what wasn't a really a big
deal I think there could be make
something awesome I mean Sony makes
great hardware Applewhite's great
hardware my pills can make some really
good software where's not too bad I mean
there's a lot in f course Nintendo has
amazing games so they could make
something awesome like a like a game
console TV laptop computer Meyer yeah
that's what they make but now that would
be pretty awesome um what do I think
about the intel core i7 um I love the
eye center I've got an i7 choice a
clinician my computer blazing fast
absolutely ridiculous there's no even
really well I've got my new o'clock but
it's so fast anyway it's almost not
really a big deal um for the money or
just pure having just for a processor
right now the i7 is absolutely the top
of the range that may be changing when
some of the bulldozer ships come out but
force we grab the ivy bridge which going
to be the next generation of core i7 so
yeah I don't see any reason why you
shouldn't if you're looking for a really
intense gaming rig or something with a
lot of power the ice M is definitely
something you should at least look at I
just outright to pick one up what are we
use to edit videos I edit all of my
videos on corals videostudio pro x4 if
you guys are interested i had to do i
have done a review on my channel before
so you guys can check that out um pretty
much i like it a lot I've used for video
studio for quite a while it's really
good editing software it's not really
all that expensive and what you get is a
really solid editor it's not quite on
the level of like so many Vegas or
something but it's going to be cheaper
and it's a lot easier to learn it's not
quite as complicated but you can still
do a lot of the same things that Vegas
can does the touchpad do anything better
than the ipad you know that's kind of
hard thing yeah I mean certain things
that will I mean for example has flash
the ipad doesn't have flash i mean even
something simple as it has two speakers
that are pretty decent as opposed to the
one I mean yeah some things but overall
I do like the iPad better and well the
ipad 2 it's kinda hard to compare it
against the ipad 1 but yeah i do like
the ipad 2 better overall but for the
price for one
dollars compared to 500 I don't think
it's a competition I mean it's there
Justin totally two different legs I mean
you don't compare a Kia to a Lamborghini
so all that's not the greatest analogy
but yeah um as I do think the eyepet
does things better than the touch pad
but if you can find one for the cheap
price it's going to be a great talent it
really is it's just it's for that cheap
you're not going to be able to get
anything that's going to be anywhere
near touching this what are my thoughts
on minecraft beta 1.8 adventure mode I
if you guys will probably know I've been
doing videos on and off for the past
year but yeah I'm a pretty big fan of
minecraft I'm really looking forward to
the adventure mode update because I'm
not familiar it's going to be a pretty
major probably the biggest update we've
seen from minecraft it's going to
include basically a adventure mode if
you guys move guessed already you can go
ahead and do all kinds of stuff that
will have an actual story somewhat um
you guys should have towns and NPCs it's
going to be bring minecraft from you
know just a general open-world game we
just build stuff to something where you
actually have a goal which i think is
going to be awesome so yeah brutally
looking forward to the 1.8 Update it'll
just the general release of the game uh
retina display on ipad 3 yeah I don't
think it's gonna be a problem I think
early next year I would probably say
somewhere probably march april may be
made it i would say probably somewhere
in the march to april time frame we will
see an ipad 3 and it will almost
definitely have Retina display I mean
there's nothing really wrong with the
current iPad display it means it's not
bad it's just a very high resolution so
once they put it a Retina display on
there I think it's gonna be absolutely
stellar hey guys it's going to be about
it pull this 50th episode of d3 live I
definitely give a pause and give you
