today I'm here with a tutorial on two
really cool things in Windows 7 first
I'm going to show you guys how to use
god mode it's a really handy tool to get
through all kinds of different prompts
and stuff that you would normally have
to you know search through the control
panel or something it's pretty cool and
I'm also going to show you guys we're
really nifty utility that will allow you
to change your login screen I know you
guys probably know this but you can't
really change it in Windows 7 and it
kinda gets a little stale oh that's kind
of nice design you know like to change
everything up so this is a really cool
utility allows you to do it and it works
really good really polished and of
course it's free so yeah let's get this
one started
okay so first we're going to start out
with showing you guys god no like I said
God mode is basically a kind of little
Easter Egg that actually Microsoft put
in Windows 7 and Windows Vista that I'll
get to that in just one second it's a
little easter egg that basically allows
you to get into some different things
basically it's nothing new there's
nothing you know god no it sounds really
cool and it's fairly useful but it's
nothing amazing basically it brings
together a lot of different things like
I mean everything from changing your
password to connecting to a printer I
mean just probably like 150 200
different options and menus and stuff
it's all in one place it's pretty cool
now this works in all versions of
Windows 7 so you can follow this and it
also does work in Windows Vista but I've
heard some problems I know there's a lot
of problems in Windows Vista 64-bit I
know that that doesn't work pretty much
at all I think it works in 32-bit but I
haven't tested it so you know I might
not I might be a little cautious I guess
anyway this is if you have Windows 7 any
version disorder fine okay so this is
really simple you don't need to download
anything all you need to do is you're
going to need to create a folder now you
see this ok and I will have this in the
description okay
I do is copy it okay now you need to go
and create a new folder can be on your
desktop whatever you want it doesn't
really matter all you need to do is
create a new folder okay now you need to
go ahead and paste that code in now as
soon as you hit enter you see it
automatically changes and a little to a
little new icon now if we click double
click this now you will see that God
mode is here and this is just a folder
just like anything else but as you see
here you have all kinds of really cool
options so you see like check security
status you have defragment your hard
drive you've got backup your computer I
mean the list I mean you guys can see is
just huge I mean you've got all kinds of
stuff and you change the theme I mean
seriously you see there's probably a
couple hundred different things here now
there's nothing groundbreaking like I
said everything here can be found in
other places but the problem is in other
places it can kind of you know sometimes
I want to just get it like three or four
different things and change once that
happening you know pull up control panel
and look through eight or nine different
menus open up this god mode folder roll
through it find what I want open it up
and what's just fine so yeah guys that's
a look at God mode pretty helpful and
you guys might want to test it out okay
guys so let's move on to part two of the
video which will be focusing on this
really cool program that will allow you
to change your logon background in
Windows 7 now I will note this only
works on Windows 7 so unlike the
previous one we sort of works on Vista
doesn't work on anything besides Windows
7 you know it does work on every kind of
bit of Windows 7 except for the Windows
7 starter edition so if you have usually
that's the starter it comes with
netbooks so if you have a Windows 7
starter netbook this won't work but if
you have pretty much any other Windows 7
including the release candidate you'll
be good anyway
so all you got to do is come to let's
come to this link which I will have in
the description you scroll down to the
bottom you can read this but I'm about
to show you guys so it's not a big deal
so just come down here and download
okay so once you download go ahead unzip
it you'll find an exe file and one
really cool thing I will note about this
program is it doesn't need to install or
anything so it's a nice thing that you
know you don't have to be junk in your
computer up so just don't download the
program and uninstall it and I I'm sorry
unzip it in a place that you won't be
deleting it or anything and yeah we can
go ahead and show you guys what it does
so now that you have downloaded the
application you're ready to go ahead and
get started
okay so just find the link wherever you
put it and go ahead and open it up okay
so give just one second here and
instantly you will see the screen
recorder doesn't quite run at full speed
but you'll see it's got a very nice
animation down here and it works really
well as you'll see in just a second so
anyway basically you will see that this
is the little program it's very simple
and this is basically what you're a
little preview of what your logon
background was going to look like so
obviously you can see this is what mine
looks like right now just the default
now you can change it okay
so you have a couple options here for
one you can go through some of the
default ones up here so like let's say
not this one that was kind nice this one
and you can go all all along the lines
so we can go through say I like this one
now there's a couple other things let's
we'll go ahead and choose a folder now
this is probably your gonna want to do
basically you can pick your own okay so
let's go ahead and oh I don't know scrap
something one second here so let's pull
up this folder I've got a lot of stuff
let's grab there we go
that works nice so as you can see here I
can use the isolate picture as my
background now once you pick yours and
obviously you can pick out any folder
you want and grab the right file then
you can either hit apply or you can hit
settings now settings you probably won't
need it but you might so let me show you
a quick so you can go ahead and do a
couple things like reset default vent
other users but it's not a big deal
main thing is you might want to change
the the text so standardly there's a
light shadow around it but if you have
like a really dark or really light image
you also might want to put no shadow or
a dark shadow to make sure that that the
text doesn't just disappear so you know
you guys might want to consider that but
this one looks okay so in a big deal so
let's go ahead and hit apply and wait
just one minute okay so if you don't do
anything obviously this is what your
logon wallpaper is going to look like
but after you use the program it's going
to turn into something just a little bit
like this so as you can see it looks
really pretty cool and obviously you can
change this into any picture this is
just you know one I just happen to have
but it's really simple as you guys saw
just about the only thing you have to
watch out or with that is that once you
click apply there's going to be a little
loading screen on the bottom which I
hopefully you guys saw a minute ago
absolutely absolutely make sure that it
finishes out and the little loading
screen will disappear and then the
program of action normal if you try to
close the program and do something in
the middle of it it will mess up your
computer and you know you don't want to
have something corrupted so just be
patient it only takes about 10 seconds
so you know just don't click the button
in close real fast anyway guys that's
just about it a quick look at how to
change your wallpaper for your
lockscreen
as well as how to use Windows 7 god mode
both pretty useful things hope you
hopefully you guys enjoyed anyway thanks
