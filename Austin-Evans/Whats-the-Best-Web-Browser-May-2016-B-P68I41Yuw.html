web browser to find out I gather the
most popular browsers available
well Google Rome is by far the most used
today that doesn't necessarily mean it's
the best Firefox remains a force to be
reckoned with
and out of the ashes of Internet
Explorer Microsoft has built a
surprisingly solid edge browser Apple
Safari remains a solid option on the Mac
side while opera might be overshadowed
by Chrome there's a new option on the
block Vivaldi this is also based on
Chrome but promises to bring more power
user oriented features do you get
perspective on both Windows and Mac I'm
using a 2015 13 inch MacBook Pro that is
running El Capitan in addition to
Windows 10 via boot camp
the first test has been my standby for
years peacekeeper it's being phased out
but it's still hard to beat as a general
test of a browser to performance here
Firefox pulls out a pretty solid win
where the chromium based browsers do
reasonably well and edge falls behind on
the Mac side Safari ends up commanding a
solid victory with Firefox coming in
second next up we've got octane which is
a pure JavaScript benchmark on Windows
things are incredibly close edge does a
lot better here but there's no clear
winner it's much the same story on OS 10
as you'd expect chrome Vivaldi and opera
all perform similarly and only Safari
really falls behind moving on we've got
the html5 test to measure just how well
each browser supports the latest new
features on websites here again the
chromium trio are approaching perfect
scores where the default edge and Safari
browsers are starting to fall a fair bit
behind why let's us these have made a
huge difference to loading times over
the years it's still interesting to
measure the time it takes to open and lo
google.com interestingly edge is
blisteringly fast on Windows where the
fairly new Vivaldi looks like it could
use a bit more optimization things are
much closer on the Mac with everything
well under two seconds except for
Vivaldi which struggles even more here
something that's especially important
for less powerful systems is memory
usage so here I measure each browser
with 8 tabs open cromoz actually made
big strides since my last test beating
everything else which is especially
impressive considering it lost by quite
a bit to Firefox last time where Safari
is very well optimised which is one of
the benefits of being exclusive to the
Mac there's more to a browser than pure
speed though
edge has cool features like the ability
to annotate over screenshot right inside
the browser and a fairly clean interface
with Microsoft's take on omnibar to
search and go to a URL all from one
place Safari takes the simplicity up a
notch and it has a fair few extensions
in addition to some of the smooth
scrolling and animations and a browser
period chrome looks very similar to when
it first came out but
it's not a bad thing the table' out
nominee bar has been copied by basically
everyone at this point opera is similar
you'll get the standard variety of
extensions on the fair few themes but
there really isn't a lot here to
separate it from the others but volte
gives you more options to customize the
look and feel of the browser and you can
go fairly in-depth here even down to
customizing all the keyboard shortcuts
it can also change the interface color
based on the site you're on there's a
lot to like here the Firefox interface
is looking a little dated it is
definitely time for a refresh when in
Firefox as biggest strengths have always
been the extension support from all that
is still fairly healthy these days the
other browsers are quickly catching up
so what is the best browser both Firefox
and opera are starting to fall behind
where Edge has made some big steps since
the internet explorer days but it still
has a ways to go Vivaldi is still a
little rough around the edges but
there's a ton of potential over on Mac
the optimization of Safari makes it hard
to beat for Windows chrome remains the
best bet for most people it pairs good
speed with tons of features and solid
security of course it's not for
everybody so what browser do you use let
me know in the comments below when I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
