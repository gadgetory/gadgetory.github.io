the video going over some of the most
popular gaming pc myths and problems
that people have so I get a lot of
questions about gaming PC's and here a
lot of the exact same misconceptions
over and over and over again so today
we're going to go ahead and tackle some
of the biggest gaming pc myths one of
the most common ones i get is that game
pcs are just expensive
well it certainly is true that a decent
PC will set you back more than that 200
on Xbox it is also of course a
full-fledged computer that you're going
to do a lot more than just gaming on on
top of that it actually might not be as
expensive as you think as of course
while on xbox or ps3 game is almost
always going to be $60 brand-new if you
can wait just a little bit of time you
can find some really killer deals on
steam sales and fill your entire library
up for a fraction of the price another
common misconception is that you have to
go out spend a ton of money and buy a
full gaming PC with all the lights and
bells and whistles now this just simply
isn't true you can very simply build one
for yourself and almost always save
money by doing it and the really cool
thing about building it yourself is that
you also get to fully customize it so
hey guess what you have a giant library
and you want a ton of storage get 10
terabytes of storage in your rig you can
do whatever you want because you're
building it usually the next thing I'll
hear is I don't know how to build a
computer I'll break it the funny thing
is gaming PC's and just PCs in general
are actually not difficult to build at
all so the way I like to describe it to
people is that they're like adult Legos
sure you might need the instruction
manual in a few hours of time but almost
anyone can put together a fully
functioning gaming PC with just a
screwdriver there are lots of fantastic
tutorials online which will show you
step-by-step how to put a computer
together and even if you have no idea
what any of the parts do you can also
find different guides which I make one
every single month which will show you
exactly what kind of performance you can
get what kind of budget and all the
parts that you need to do it another one
I hear all the time is that the
processor is obviously the most
important part of the build
while CPU definitely does play a major
role if you're building a gaming
computer you really should be spending
the bulk of your budget on the graphics
card so take for example you spend $300
on your CPU $100 on your graphics card
you're going to be entirely limited by
that graphics card however if you spend
$100 on your CPU and $300 on your
graphics card you're going to get much
much more performance another common one
is that AMD is so much better than
Nvidia or vice versa
sometimes this can be true for example
if you pick a certain AMD card it might
be a certain nvidia card but for the
most part if you have any budget between
$100 and $500 you're going to find both
an AMD and NVIDIA card around your price
range and both are going to be
absolutely fantastic options well
sometimes it can be true if you take a
specific comparison the Nvidia card
might be way better than the AMD card or
vice versa but generally both these
companies are so well matched and so
neck-and-neck it generally actually
comes down to what games do you like to
play as a lot of games will work better
on NVIDIA cards and a lot of games will
work better on AMD cards I'm interested
to know what are some of the most
calling gaming pc myths that you guys
hear definitely be sure to let me know
in the comments below and of course if
you ever hear anyone talking about
gaming pcs or mentioned any of these
myths be sure to share this video with
them and they might learn a thing or two
if you're interested in more feel free
to check out some of my gaming pc videos
including the 600 or pc build if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
