path the time is drawing near the next
version of iphone OS 3.2 with the first
bait is on the way any day now let's
take a look it was likely to come in the
latest itunes update to new formats were
introduced itunes LP and extras itunes
LP is the new album format that
incorporates many nice additions such as
cover art animated lyrics videos and
more iTunes extras aren't quite as
special as they mostly include the same
kind of special features in Amethi as
you would find in a DVD however both
could be included in iphone OS 3.2 Apple
has spent the past two months since
releasing itunes nine porting over the
new features to the apple TV so there's
no telling whether it may be coming to
the iphone and ipod touch there are the
problems of getting the size of the
content to work on the small screens
which is why I'm leaning more towards
just itunes LP coming and not extras who
knows though one new thing that could be
on the way in iphone OS 3.2 is support
for 720p video the new iphone 3gs and
ipod touch 3g both are capable of
recording at least in the three gs's
case and playing back HD video it
wouldn't be a stretch for HD video
playback via a new component cable to
come via the 3.2 update as it would
certainly put the latest i devices on
par with the zune HD in that category
likely the only thing standing in the
way is battery life the processor and
the devices is actually under clocked by
a considerable amount to keep it from
burning through the battery in just a
couple hours it would be interesting to
see if the zune HD is a big enough
motivator to Apple
to remove this restriction even if only
in limited circumstances to allow the
devices to handle 720p video something
always possible is a UI update while
iphone OS was a real shock in 2007 once
it was released it is decidedly average
as of late compared to many other mobile
operating systems such as web OS and
Android this sort of decent overhaul
will likely be saved for four point oh
but smaller tweaks are always possible
the one thing that I would bet on most
heavily to come in iphone OS 3.2 is
certainly the addition of a radio
application similar to the one in the
ipod nano 5th generation what many
people don't know is that since the ipod
touch 2nd generation the iDevices have
been equipped with Wi-Fi chips that work
as FM radios some rumors have been
circulating about apple finally
unlocking this capability just as they
unlocked bluetooth in three point o the
iphone 3gs and ipod touch 3g are almost
certainly ringers for it but it's
unclear if they will add it for the ipod
touch 2g i tend to think that they will
as they are still selling the a gigabyte
model and seeing as it's perfectly
capable I see no reason why it's
crippling unless they think that they
need to make the newer devices look more
special sadly enough the iphone 2g and
3g as well as the ipod touch 1st
generation can't use the radio
regardless so there you have it my
predictions for what's on the way an
iphone OS 3.2 the first betas are
overdue so it likely won't be long until
we know more but i think this covers
most of the likely scenarios what do you
guys think do any of these sound good to
you be sure to let me know what you
think in the comments anyway thanks for
