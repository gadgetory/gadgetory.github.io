unboxing and review of the book req 1m
headphones so let's go out and just jump
right in um as you guys can see the
packaging is really quite nice that's
why don't you open these up so i will
mention i did get these sent out to me
for free to review by Bukhari so do want
to thank them so i'll be doing that
boxing then i will use these for a
little while and then get to the review
but we actually have a nice little
carrying case which I presume has the
headphones well it's actually guys uh no
actually you guys can't see it's a right
yep pretty cool it has the bukhari logo
on it pretty nice headset I mean
carrying case um see what else we have
in the box you get um hat tells more
about their other products um then you
get the part serial number I guess the
price and show you that lifetime
warranty yeah so I guess that's kind of
nice it does have a lifetime warranty
and that's all in the box so sighs you
go ahead and push all this aside and get
into this is actually that's look pretty
cool i have to admit obviously this is
reusable so you can go ahead and store
them have quite a few things in here we
have the headphones themselves and
actually i'm not sure where this is oh
these are ear tips this ticket awesome
so the actual night i pull them all out
but as you guys can see there are quite
a few different ear tips so guys you
guys you can see they're pretty nice
i've got in it um the blackens the black
ops so the silver accents actually looks
really nice says bukhari around there
okay so guys now i'm just going to go
ahead and give them a listen test
quality all that kind of good stuff and
i'll be back in just a second with my
review ok guys so I've now used these
headphones for about three weeks now I'm
ready to give you my full review so the
first thing I want to talk about is the
looks I know you guys just saw this but
I wanted to show you one more time cuz
honestly this is probably the biggest
feature whether you want by these are
not in my opinion is the art of looks on
personally I think they look pretty good
a lot of people who you know saw me as I
was you know testing these out for the
past few weeks really did enjoy them so
guys you know it's kind of personal
preference again like I said I
personally like them but you know this
might not be a little too you know
lashes for your style I'm i will inch
they also do that come in a couple other
different colors on the coming gold pink
obviously this is black and you know so
you know you can go ahead and take a
look at it you know again personal
preference another cool thing is that it
actually does have a microphone
something go ahead and turn on my ipod
touch here i'll just show you really
quickly here it actually does all you
have to do here it is right here you
have your ipod controls here all you
have to do is just go ahead and hit
record it works just fine the mic is not
amazing quality obviously but it works
just fine and it's not an issue okay so
let's go and move on to sound quality
now I'll two guys to be entirely honest
I was not impressed with these
headphones as far as sound quality now
don't get me ready I don't mean to say
that they were terrible but for the
hundred twenty dollar price tag I did
expect more so they are forced in your
headphones and a lot of times their
weakness is based I've found and this
holds true for the q 1n headphones um
now for pop songs for stuff generally
that was no wasn't really that heavily
focused on base I thought they sounded
pretty decent however for me if I'm
going to spend this much money on
headphones there are quite a few options
that will give you both good bass and
you know give you the whole package um
so guys I don't really want to just say
don't buy these headphones because
obviously there are a lot of people who
would buy these movie just fine I mean
it's nice to have a microphone as well
as to have a at all this and a really
nice package however if you really like
your you really like your music you
really liked you know let's go ahead and
really just listen to the highest
quality that you can get and you really
like to let's talk to base and stuff you
might be better suited going ahead with
a different sort of headphone but of
course that's just my opinion anyway
guys if you're interested in these
headphones go ahead and check it out I
will have a link in the description you
can go ahead and check them out for
yourself anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
