unboxing and review of the bukhari q1 m
headphones so let's go ahead just jump
right in um as you guys can see the
packaging is really quite nice that's
what just open these up so I will
mention I did get these sent out to me
for free to review by bukhari so I do
want to thank them so I'll be doing that
boxing then I will use these for a
little while and then get to the review
oh we actually have a nice little
carrying case which I presume has the
headphones it's actually guys oh no
actually you guys can't see it's a right
yep pretty cool it has the bukhari logo
on it pretty nice headset I mean
carrying case um see what else we have
in the box you get that tells more about
their other products then you get part
serial number I guess with the price
entry that lifetime warranty yeah so I
guess that's kind of nice it does have a
lifetime warranty and that's all in the
box
so go ahead and push all this aside and
get into this it's actually that's look
pretty cool I have to admit now
obviously this is reusable so you can go
ahead and store them have quite a few
things in here we have the headphones
themselves and actually I'm not sure
what this is oh these are ear chips
let's take a look so the action that I
pull them all out but as you guys can
see there are quite a few different ear
tips so guys you guys you can see
they're pretty nice I've got in it um
the black and the black ops so the
silver accents actually looks really
nice it says vocare around there okay so
guys now I'm just going to go ahead and
give them a listen test quality all the
kind of good stuff and I'll be back in
just a second with my review okay guys
so I've now used these headphones for
about three weeks now I'm ready to give
you my full review so the first thing I
wanted to talk about is the looks I know
you guys just saw this but I wanted to
show you one more time because honestly
this is probably the biggest feature
whether you want to buy these are not in
my opinion is the are the looks um
personally I think they look pretty good
and a lot of people who you know saw me
as I was you know testing these out for
the past few weeks really did enjoy them
so guys you know it's kind of personal
preference again like I said I
personally like them but you know if
this might not be a little too you know
for your style I will interests they
also do that come in a couple other
different colors on the coming gold pink
obviously this is black and you know so
you know you can go ahead and take a
look at it
you know again personal preference
another cool thing is that it actually
does have a microphone something go
ahead and turn on my iPod Touch here
I'll just show you really quickly here
it actually does all you have to do here
it is right here you have your iPod
controls here all you have to do is just
go ahead and hit record it works just
fine the mic is not amazing quality
obviously but it works just fine and
it's not an issue
okay so let's quite a new Vaughn to
sound quality now I'll check guys to be
entirely honest I was not impressed with
these headphones as far as sound quality
now don't get me wrong ready I don't
mean to say that they were terrible but
for the $120 price tag I did expect more
so they are forced in your headphones
and a lot of times their weakness is
bass that I've found and this holds true
for the q1n headphones now for pop songs
for stuff generally there was no wasn't
really that heavily focused on bass I
thought these sounded pretty decent
however for me if I'm gonna spend this
much money on headphones there are quite
a few options that will give you both
good bass and you know give you the
whole package um so guys I don't really
want to just say don't buy these
headphones because obviously there are a
lot of people who would buy these movie
just fine I mean it's nice to have a
microphone as well as to have a at all
this and a really nice package however
if you really like your you really like
your music you really liked you know
it's go ahead and really just listen to
the highest quality that you can get and
you really like to listen to lots of
bass and stuff you might be better
suited going ahead with a different sort
of headphone but of course that's just
my opinion anyway guys if you're
interested in these headphones go ahead
and check it out I will have a link in
the description you can go ahead and
check them out for yourself anyway guys
