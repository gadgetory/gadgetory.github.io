state of jailbreak video so I don't wait
and give you guys keep you up to date on
the latest jailbreak for 4.2 point one
now redsnow has recently been updated
however there's a couple of reasons why
this is a state of jailbreak video and
not just a tutorial showing you how to
run the jailbreak so number one it's
only available for Mac so if you have a
PC or Linux or anything like that you're
not going to be able to do this but for
two this is a beta and I really want to
stress this beta jailbreaks are not for
you know the unless you were very very
very experienced with your brakes and
even then there's really not that much
point I said is a beta and a lot of
stuff will not work so before I tell you
anything let me go ahead and run through
what does not working right now in the
jailbreak so this first beta is limited
to just the iphone for the ipod touch
4th generation and the ipad so if you
have any other device not going to work
right now in addition to that you're
going to need to go ahead and have the
brand the brand who had it but the iOS
4.2 beta 3 ipsw on your Mac now this is
only the only way to get this that
without pirating which I definitely do
not recommend you guys do is to go ahead
and actually be a developer now if
you're not a developer and you never
download that that's gonna be a big
problem and again another reason why you
shouldn't do this now in addition to
that there are a couple things that are
not working there's no bluetooth so the
bluetooth isn't working a couple of odd
things such as you know the ipod players
not really quite working correctly and
stuff like that so really guys do keep
mine this is a beta unless you're very
experienced with jailbreaking i didn't
recommend trying this out and of course
you can go ahead jailbreaking any device
whatever you want and it will be Ted
which is what I'm on right now so if you
want to tell you a break go for the
standard red snow and if you're feeling
you know if you're if you're feeling
like you've got you know you can get all
the stuff you need bluetooth isn't a big
deal I Paul players in a big deal then
you can go ahead and try this untethered
jailbreak I'm you know go ahead and get
the dev team some you know some of your
thoughts and your opinions and you kind
of help them out test it hi guys i just
wanted to go ahead and give you this
update now I won't be doing a tutorial
on it just for the reasons I just stated
I don't recommend that ninety-five
percent of you guys do this however if
you're one of the five percent feel free
to go ahead and check out the link in
the description
ocean give you all the information you
need to know download links all that
kind of stuff anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
