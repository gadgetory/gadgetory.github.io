going to be doing a little bit of a
different video so I'm here with my
buddy Jays two cents so we thought what
if you already have an old computer
laying around or access to it does it
make more sense to buy a new GPU and put
it in that so this is the first episode
of all said scrapyard worth I think it's
time to hit Craigslist
$30 for Core 2 Duo machine what is that
this one was 195 bucks though so I
alright 5 it also says Windows Vista on
it I mean that's what the finest
operating system ever it's clearly what
I want my life be sir math on 64 for 50
bucks this might not be crazy okay what
I'm gonna text him now what's another
here's a place I sell trade and repair
hey so a friend and I we're trying to do
a project and we need a little bit like
an older and cheaper desktop that has a
PCI slot okay perfect much appreciated
man have a good one
it's not far away it sounds like it's
got options and if it's maybe missing
something
could talk the price down a little bit
it sounds like yeah lots of parts so
even if we don't want to sell a fully
built system like if we're able to get
everything we need we can throw
something but if it doesn't have like
say an air cooler all right so I heard
back from that the guy that I texted
before we found this other shop so I
think it's really good back-up plan in
case this store doesn't work out how far
is this from the store there they're
both in Fontana okay so they're in the
same city and they are available today
so I think we got a good backup once we
got to the store though we quickly
realized we might be in a little bit of
trouble awesome hope there's something
maybe come clean enough that we can at
least make sure powers on and I know for
a fact in it turns on what about these
guys these are or to Joe a cooler now
all right he's got no Rambo yeah Jiraiya
he's gonna be pretty complete system I
can almost guarantee you it'll turn on
to homages out ah this one's gonna be
one day cosmetic damage all right Otis
70-200 okay it's good it's got a gig of
ddr2 there are a few options that could
sort of work but the system we really
wanted was the $50 price list PC hi I'm
the one that was texting you about the
computer for sale if we could get an
address and come meet up if you were
really interested in it it's working
right all right have it going and like
three blocks away
Oh perfect with you okay so so this guy
was like this is like an old guy okay
wasn't the key it wasn't someone that
beat up the computer
it literally sound like an old man that
just got a new computer she was trying
to get a couple bucks for his old one so
I think we're actually left out right
now 50 bucks 50 bucks is pretty much
perfect the two gigs of RAM worries me a
little bit and it's a 32-bit system so
we might not be able to do everything
but I mean we're all in on this computer
less than $200 right now it's the yellow
house no house that's a lot of birds all
right we have been successful so
Craigslist pulled it up so we've got a
huntress to gig hard drive a little
dusty but man we blow this thing out
throw graphics card in here you got
Wireless I got a card reader it's got
bonus stuff yeah he's bringing the heat
right now I mean like it's actually hot
okay so we successfully made it it is 5
o'clock so it's time to upgrade this guy
I still can't believe we scored this for
50 bucks 80 bucks I look really happy
although now I realize missing a foot oh
so we could 45 I mean you know money
back I mean we do only have to ninja
gram that's not only
learn about some of the games and
benchmarks probably won't work ideally
we want it for but we realized that
trying to keep this on the super low and
hitting for gays wasn't really gonna
happen so not only is a fifty bucks we
scored upgrades because it says Windows
Vista but it has windows 7 pro albeit
32-bit I mean this is like what a nine
year old system
it's like chose closer than seven yeah
this actually is a pretty solid card
like it's not it doesn't need a external
PCI power so it's perfect for something
like this so on addition to our sick
graphics card we have a dedicated Wi-Fi
card and a modem because the future you
help you know what I'm not sure I've
never done this before right here will
you do it like this right if it doesn't
go just push harder there we go moment
of truth and I mean unless something got
damaged in transit I mean we we did
check before we bought it to make sure
it we're a surprise would be if it
didn't move I feel like this might
because it's a really old system I feel
like this might be one that we have to
go into the BIOS and set it to do
external GP which ended up being a
problem because we actually didn't have
a VGA cable lying around so one quick
trip to Best Buy later we now have a VGA
cable I can't believe we didn't have one
are we adding that to the price of the
system this monitor is like really ray I
was right for once abouts alright
alright let's look at the device manager
don't see if the GPU is even seen that
are you back okay so for 60 100 100
built-in but it's not seeing anything
plugged in right now for the GPU is it
something all the way it looks like it
maybe not after some tinkering we got
the card to boot
however we were about to run into a much
bigger issue is it a dual-core at 3800
plus is that a dual-core is that a
single-core wait hang on wait let's
let's Google this per second oh no what
are we actually working single core 2.4
gigahertz oops um this actually might be
a big problem
I think all of our games NIEM dual core
well we could benchmark publisher that's
a joke when it came time to install the
graphics drivers we realized just how
screwed we were oh my goodness these are
64-bit only damn ah ok maybe we pin it
maybe this is a $100 gaming PC build and
we use that
240 luckily you're sitting right here
and r7 240
now I know for a fact this will support
32-bit windows so and it really it
brings that price down a lot now mind
you the 240 is not a card that I really
recommend for most things but for a
situation like this
so when junkyard battles runs into
failure we don't give up
oh no we double down on the failure so
with a little bit of upgrade action with
the 240 let's give this a try like I let
you forty slipped right in no problem
we'll clear this away don't worry this
this never happened
don't worry is totally not so to save
some time so we're not here to like
midnight I'm using a laptop and a
external drive just to load all our
Steam games so hopefully once we get
drivers installed we plug it in and
we're good to go
oh we got good zeros like yes zero you
have a something oh oh look at that
yes you do the name you donate money in
the menu but still I mean that's really
all we really care about gaming is
overrated
let's just take our 120 FPS all about
the splash screen yes what do you think
it automatically picked for us lololo
off-off-off 1080p I see a medium I see
very what shader detail very high should
we try it - try what it thinks it can
handle there's no way she can they say 8
8 X what the hell dude 16 frames per
second we've got 8x MSAA right now this
is actually kind of playable ok well you
say kinda but still with such a low
powered CPU next we tried dropping bots
and playing online at 7:20 okay so look
at that
32 fps 34 fps so with this game almost
double and it's a shooter yes at csgo
and I know at die hard csgo players
right now we're throwing something at
the screen like that is not playable hey
if it's this versus not having a
computer ok so go into the settings
let's let's crank it crank it back up
yeah leave it at 17 no go back to 1080
since we're entirely CPU bottlenecked in
theory running at a higher resolution
will put more strain on the graphics
card to even perform itself alright so
now we're playing mind you still low for
a 10 43 44 45
it's totally this is 100% playable it's
not even jittery sixties because you're
getting your in that year I'm in that
small spot but still poor look at the
ground just look at the ground
yeah even able to play some relatively
newer games like dota 2 provided you're
willing to deal with a lower frame rate
jump into an older game like the
original modern warfare and it not only
works but a place of presently well if
you want to play some indie games and
stuff this is perfect oh yeah I think
the cool thing is if you don't have a
computer right now and you want to like
build your first PC or even just like
work on one right this is a super easy
upgrade to do grandmas got one in the
garage selecting dust you know hey
grandma can I have that PCE oh sure take
it yeah mow some lawns spend 60 bucks on
a GPU and look I'm really happy with how
this turned out like it's not a killer
game PC it's not gonna blow you away but
it works I really like find myself
speechless yeah but this it works man
never underestimate single-threaded
