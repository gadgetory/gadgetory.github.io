here's a video on quick pic click pic is
an awesome little application allows you
to add custom links to your notification
center so for example if I want I can go
straight to make a new tweet and keep in
mind this is not just opening the
Twitter applications actually going into
the Twitter application and creating a
new tweet which is pretty neat on top of
that you can also open up a safari link
so for example you know if I feel like
I'm not wasting quite enough time today
I can just immediately get to read it
and waste a few more hours you can also
do different things for example you can
call and text people you can also email
them I won't demo that and i want to
show anybody number anything like that
but of course that does work now on top
of that you can also get to system
settings so for example if you want to
know really quickly get to your
brightness turn on and off Wi-Fi 3g etc
this is a great way to go so let me give
you guys a little demo of how this works
so all you do is open up the quick pic
application and one of the really nice
things about this is that it does not
require a jailbroken device this is an
app that you can download in the App
Store so go ahead make a new one here
the application is very very basic very
simple basically the entire point of the
application is just to be able to get
your links here so don't expect anything
really amazing what you can do is you
can add up to five links if you have an
iPhone and if you have an iPad you can
have up to ten say let's go ahead just
give you guys a demo of how to make them
so if you want to there are a few
presets so for example if you wanna call
to somebody open a website compose a new
email or text message you can just set
those up automatically and you can just
pick them out from your contacts but if
you want to do something a little bit
more advanced you can just do it
manually so for example I want to let's
say I want to create something for Wi-Fi
so I want to just punch and Wi-Fi here
as the title and that's why it will show
up up there and then i can create the
link now the links are actually a little
bit more tricky there are links for
pretty much everything on your device so
you know pretty much all apps can be
open with links like i said their
settings there's all kinds of stuff but
these really require you to actually
find the links themselves i will have as
many of them as I can put in the
description but it really helps if you
can actually find them yourself but i
will go ahead and try to show you guys a
couple so for example if you want to do
something like preferences you can just
do this so i will just add up here it's
prefs and this is of course to get a
I strike toggle to Wi-Fi so get
semicolon and we have root equals and
all caps Wi-Fi the way that works is for
the most part like if you won't get to
settings you just go prefs semicolon
root equals and then you know Wi-Fi or
whatever like that so once you're done
with that you can click done pull your
notification center down and if i click
on it now it'll take me straight to
Wi-Fi so i can turn it on/off etc etc
quick pic is a dollar in the App Store
and if you're interested I would highly
recommend getting on it sooner rather
than later these kind of apps have a way
of disappearing from the app store after
a few days once Apple catches wind of
them so if you're interested again just
look up its quick pick in the app store
hayleigh guys if you enjoyed this video
