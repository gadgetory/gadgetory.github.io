with this my personal gaming PC which is
seeing quite the update over the last
couple videos we started out by trying
to build something that was very
high-end we had a core i7 and important
that we have 14 terabytes of hard drive
space update memory all kinds of fun
stuff over in the last update we update
even farther with the brand-new coral
1990 900k and Archie X 20 atti but it's
still a PC that's sitting all by itself
which means it's time for a brand new
set so Ken what do you got place so we
got this brand new LG monitor I don't
even think this is out yet right no this
is the new ultra gear so we did take a
look at this briefly at Aoife and LG was
awesome enough to sponsor this video by
not only hooking this up with a minor
but trying to get this set up finally
well not by itself what's cool about
this monitor is is that it is a full
Ultra Y as you would expect 34 40 by
1440 but importantly this Ken rips the
box in half it also runs at a full 120
Hertz and that's with G sync all right
this for that boy well it's actually not
that huge this is a 34 inch monitor but
behind it manageable with one person can
you grab the stand
yes probability sout this is actually
easy enough to set up I mean usually
these LG monitors just kind of slot in I
mean most monitors are like that too you
know I'll be real I mean obviously LG is
sponsoring this video but I have
personally been using LG monitors for a
long time right I mean my monitor work
as LG my monitor at home is LG this
seems really sketchy to do this with one
hand but I'm gonna do it anyway yeah
there we go cool all right that was fall
off the table I'll say first this looks
really cool from the back oh so it
doesn't even have the RGB on look at
this like just the vents alone with like
the red accents it's cool the next step
is to actually get this set up well
where it should be so right now we're
just putting it in the corner here to
just make sure that all the accessories
and the cables and stuff work at some
point this is going to make it to my
house if we ever stopped needing this PC
and every single video we do so let's
figure out how to move everything I'm
actually really excited to try this
monitor
so we briefly got to take a look at it
it Aoife and it looked really nice but I
didn't actually get to playing games on
it for such a high resolution ultra wide
and it's 120 Hertz with g-sync
I'm ready
do who bath you look cool and the red
lights up - yeah everything lights up so
we should almost for the final version
of this setup leave this in an open area
so we can catch own the back Oh actually
to be fair the lighting might work if
you do it against the wall so it might
look sort of like an under glow so
something that I got is this Corsair
mousepad that has a Qi charging zone so
you can charge your phone in addition to
using it as a mousepad I really like the
idea be able to charge your phone on
your mousepad I mean you already have to
have a mousepad anyway and I'm charging
my phone at the time I sit down at my
desk it's a little less thing to have
and you have more space for a mousepad
in general if you don't use the Qi
charging right so we have a lot of USB
ports we need for this one in fact
actually we're kind of out of ports on
the back well it's okay because the
monitor also has two alright 34 40 by
1440 120 Hertz oh look at that look at
that the mouse is really simple if the
BenQ Zowie FK one it's the same one that
I've been using for or what like at
least a year now so we've got that
plugged in we also do have our charting
station which if I drop my phone on hey
it works so the idea is you can be
gaming and obviously if you want to
clear off the entire pad you can sort of
get that full range of motion but if you
want drop your phone on while you're I
don't know on reddit or something what
do you do on your gaming PC that's not
gaming the keyboard was a really easy
decision here we have the Razer Huntsman
elite now we've done a whole video about
this we featured it in a couple of
videos cents this is hands-down my
favorite keyboard that you can buy it
all right now now that do we have one at
the office I know Jimmy uses one I have
one at home this is straight up as good
as it gets as far as keyboards go you
get the full RGB the chroma but
importantly you have those awesome opto
optoelectronic an optical optimum
optomechanical switch keyboard I knew it
I always thought it was kind of close
alright this setup is looking a whole
lot better right now so just to recap
first of all we do have my gaming PC
it's got that core I $9.99 hundred K as
well as the RT X xx atti and this is a
lot of power because it is powering a
very nice monitor a monitor that's been
overclocked to 120 Hertz
now this monitor is definitely not cheap
what I appreciate is this pretty much
the best of both worlds so as far as the
gaming side you do have that high res
it is a not only ultra wide display but
it also is curved but importantly it
runs a full 120 Hertz now I've seen a
couple monitors that are ultra wide but
they're much lower resolution but you're
getting a full 1440p panel what's also
nice about that is that you're not
losing that vertical screen real estate
for things like video editing which is
the secondary use of this monitor as it
actually has a full nano IPS display
which means that you can do some proper
creative work on Eire
you can watch some ultra wide video you
can do gaming it really can do
everything that sounds like a huge
marketing tagline but this legitimately
is one of the most impressive monitors
I've ever tried because usually when it
comes to gaming monitors you have to
make some kind of sacrifice but the
ultra care really doesn't make you make
that sacrifice
we've got a serious serious audio setup
going here so first of all running from
the PC into the audio engine d1 this is
serving as our DAC and then it goes into
the audio engine and 22 which is
powering our bookshelf speakers when you
crank it but essentially the best audio
system I think we got our had for a
video listen to that
I'm using it here okay so we've had some
really nice fortnight's that up slightly
especially with the ultimate Thunderbolt
but this look at this I'm playing at
full 1440p on a curve ultra wide at
almost exactly 120 frames per second
that is obscenely smooth that's just not
even funny I mean obviously the video is
not shot in hundred twenty Hertz so you
can't really see it but I mean the
smoothness is ridiculous I'm really
happy that this setup is finally coming
together we spend a lot of time working
on this PC and trying to get things as
close as possible but it always feels
like we're missing something but now
we've got the great display we've got
the great audio we've got the great
peripherals it really does feel like the
entire setup
anyway hopefully you guys enjoy this
wonderful video all about the new setup
and specifically huge shout out to LG
for sponsoring this video with their
dope ultra clear monitor as always links
to all this stuff will be in the
description and if you'll excuse me I'm
going to go probably lose again because
that's what I do best right ken yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
