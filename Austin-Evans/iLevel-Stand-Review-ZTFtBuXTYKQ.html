of the eye-level stand for the iPhone
iPod Touch put a lot of its smartphones
it's a very Universal stand and it works
very very well ask why just give you
guys a quick tour of it as you can see
here on the bottom i'm sad i can keep
this all in frame it's very large Stan
I'm you have a very very strong clip you
do not want to put your finger in there
it is very strong actually has I'm not
sure if you guys can see if it actually
has rubber now this stand actually we'll
go ahead and melt pretty much anything
specially um I just go over here and you
guys can see just clamping it down to
the edge of my desk and you soon the
camera a little bit you go ahead it
mounts on a desk the amounts on quota
two different things very very well it's
very powerful and in addition you can go
ahead and just lay it flat like I had a
minute ago now on to the second part of
the review which is this long bendy
extendable arm and of course that's the
technical term for so guys this is
actually like the main part of the stand
obviously and its really really pretty
impressive that's kind of hard to kind
of show you guys what keeping it all in
the shot here but it is very very
flexible so as you see here I mean we
can go ahead and just twist it all kinds
of you know bizarre ways I mean really
actually I rather like that i think
that's that that's the way i'm going to
start using this 10 um as you can see it
is very very flexible you know really
not a whole lot to worry about and
though it does come in two different
sizes now I had the 16 inch here I does
also come in eight inches on depending
on what you can use the poor and i will
get into some of the possible uses for
it later depending on what you're going
to use it on either could work pretty
well but i had to say the state is
really pretty interesting as far as this
arm goes because I mean as you can see
here and just go ahead and say it here
I'm like that's fairly high my totally
other shot I set low so does give you a
lot of options now let's go ahead about
the third part of the stand which is
this kind of amount for your device so
I've taken off my ipod to show you guys
here on it's actually pretty well
designed there are quite a few different
ones under sun specifically for the
iphone ipod touch there's one for
specifically for blackberries
cetera et cetera I'm however this is
just universal and the way it works
pretty simple basically it just kind of
extends here and does have rubber feet
so you have to worry about anything
scratching it up and strike and do this
on camera right but basically I just
pull it down here and there you go it's
already mounted I'm as you can see it
works pretty well obviously in
conjunction with the stand civ and get
good this kind of difficult keep
everything that shot but it works really
well obviously as you can see here you
can swivel it upside down undo it
however pretty much you want so as far
as the saying goes it's pretty solid it
does support quite a few devices in
addition to this you also can buy a
special version of the eye level which
supports the kindle the i believe is the
six inch kindle so all it really does
support quite a few different devices
i'm really impressed with you know the
just kind of the variety of the stand
now as far as the uses of the eye level
there actually are pretty impressive so
as i showed you the clip we'll go ahead
and clip onto pretty much anything it's
very very powerful so the way i like to
use a lot is actually go ahead and clip
it on to the edge of my desk and then
just using that nice long arm kind of
swiveled around and then when you're
doing that it's it basically at eye
level when you're sitting at a desk you
can go ahead and be running anything
maybe you have a twitter client you have
like an email or maybe whatever you can
only just use your ipod or iphone or
indeed any smartphone as like a second
monitor to your computer it's actually
kind of cool in addition also is it
really got a great application for in
the car so if you have a gps capable
cell phone and I believed actually
because if you went the universal mount
you probably could even fit some GPS
systems in there of course they had to
be a little bit smaller but it actually
does work pretty well I'm sure most of
you guys whoever you kind of had to deal
with trying to mount one of those
handheld GPS or indeed even near know
your cell phone it kind of gets a little
bit complicated you know you're gonna
have to figure out where to put it a lot
of the time you know it's going to be
kind of in the way maybe one of the
suction mounts on the windshield or
whatever I'm with the eye level you can
go ahead and put it in quite a few
different places so if there's maybe a
spot where you can go ahead and clamp to
your dash like on towards the front of
the dash that could work waiting when
Matt on the console totally depends on
your car but the eye level is really
flexible like that so there's quite a
few
places that you can use it so yeah guys
that's it for my review of the eye level
I'm very impressed with the stand you
know usually I've never really been to
big understands your I just hold it or
whatever it's not a big deal however
after using I low for a little bit I
really am very very impressed it's great
to be able to have this you know mount
it to your desk it's worth fantastic for
watching movies obviously you know
you're depending on the screen size of
your device but you know if you're just
sitting on your desk you watch a movie
you can do all kinds of really great
things so guys if you're interested this
will collect something that you would
you know use on a daily basis I do
definitely recommend the eye level
everything's very very solid the build
quality is fantastic I mean you know the
sprinting the clamp is ridiculously
powerful you know I think you could just
twist around that arm forever and the
universal mount as well as all the
individual mounts I'm sure will work
just as fine as what i have here so guys
if you're interested you can go ahead
and get this in several different
varieties there is an eight and a 16
inch I do have the 16 inch here it does
come in white as well as black so if you
want to go ahead and get the 8 inch it
is going to run you thirty dollars
currently if you're going to go ahead
and get the 16 inch is going to
currently run you 35 so guys for the
price that think you're getting a really
solid product and it really doesn't work
so well that I really have no problems
recommending it in addition I also do
have a giveaway of to eye level stands

up in the bubble wrap I have a black one
as well as a white one and now guys I
