comparison between the iPad 2 and the
iPod Touch 4th generation along with the
iPhone 4 so obviously there are some
major advantages in the new iPad 2 most
notably and a bump in ram to match the
iPhone 4
along with a new dual-core 1 gigahertz
processor so there are a couple of
things I'm going to be testing probably
the biggest way that you can tell is
just by reloading a website so I just
been doing this really quickly here of
course this is not a super formal test
we should definitely give you a good
idea of how fast or slow the iPad 2 is
so I'm going to be just opening both of
these up now hover over and go and do it
so here's gonna see here the iPad 2 is
gonna be considerably faster there we go
it's done iPad iPod Touch is also done
so you know the iPod touching the iPhone
4 certainly are not you know suddenly
just totally obsolete but there is
absolutely no question that the iPad 2
is going to be considerably faster okay
so let's just try one more website it's
gonna beat Apple comm we're gonna be
doing the same way so let's hold them
down same time and go so as you will see
here again iPad 2 much much quicker now
you know this is pretty considerate I
mean pretty much all of my tests I've
done as far as Safari show that the iPad
2 is white way faster so definitely very
good news there now let's move on to
opening an app in this case is going to
be tiny wings so again it's gonna be the
exact same app do note that tiny wings
is not optimized for the iPad so this
should be a fair comparison between you
know like a standard app and a non iPad
optimized application so let's hold it
down and go so you guys can see here
again the iPad 2 is considerably faster
uh let's just cancel a chase before I
get all kinds of noise in here but
pretty much across the board like I said
guys as far as apps as far as website is
pretty much anything that I tested the
iPad 2 is just going to just be much
much quicker than the iPod Touch or the
iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
