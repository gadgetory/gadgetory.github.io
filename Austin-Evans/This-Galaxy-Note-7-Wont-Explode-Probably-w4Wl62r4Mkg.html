7 was one of the hottest phones of last
year exploded onto the scene last year
by far the most lit phone of all time
after less than a month on sale it was
recalled but now it's back the issue
with the note 7 originally was that the
battery was slightly too large for the
actual phone which meant that in some
cases the nuke 7 would literally explode
in your pocket after recalling the
nearly two and a half million phones
they have sold Samsung spent most of
last year reminding people that not all
of their phones are fiery death machines
however the note 7 is officially back
with this the Galaxy Note fan edition
what's interesting is this isn't even
called the Galaxy Note 7 anymore it is
just the Galaxy Note fan edition now
right now it's only on sale in South
Korea but with millions of these phones
sitting around in a warehouse somewhere
I assume that we're probably going to
see more of these sooner than later so
even though Samsung promises that this
will definitely not explode totally for
real this time
feel like safety is definitely sort of
the name of the game so I'm gonna make
sure they don't die here we're gonna
unbox your Galaxy Note fan edition can
pick this dear Alan I don't think this
is going to be protective at all I don't
think this is a bad idea
we're good pretty good it's fine
all right all right we're in
we have the phone you have the phone it
is it's here so I'm just going to be
very gentle with this right now
ease it out yeah phones out of a box
it's interesting to think that the note
seven design is nearly a year old at
this point don't get me wrong it's still
like very nicely put together phone with
the glass and metal build you've got the
curves on either edges of the display
but when you look at compared to
something like the Galaxy s8 it really
does feel a little bit behind what this
means is that while the Galaxy s8 is a
physically smaller phone it actually has
a very slightly bigger screen than the
note 7 now that the dangers past to see
what else we get in the unboxing it does
come with this case which is actually
kind of cool it's a little bit weird
that it covers up the screen but as
savage Kenny so rightfully points out no
really wants to be seen with the Galaxy
Note 7 so maybe hiding it is your best
option I'm curious whether this is an
actually new phone or not so Samsung
does have a couple million notes sitting
around that I'm sure they're going to do
something with at some point but if I
had to take a guess I would say this is
a brand new phone Nelly is it super
clean on the outside but it really
wouldn't surprise me if Samsung still
had extra parts to build notes just with
a couple minor internal changes from the
outside this looks pretty much exactly
the same the big difference is instead
of having a 3500 milliamp hour battery
which may or may not explode this guy
has a smaller 3200 milliamp hour battery
notice very similar to what you're
getting with the Galaxy Note 8 now I do
have a couple of additional things that
are mostly because this is a Korean
model phone but you also get the
wonderful Bigsby pre-installed I keep
going back to how nice the Galaxy s8
feels in comparison to the note don't
get me wrong like I said this is an
amazing looking phone with glass and
metal but when you look at how big the
screen is on the galaxy s 8 with the
rounded corners and everything it really
does make this feel a lot older one
thing you're not really giving up with
the note are specs so this is going to
be the Exynos 88-90 version which is the
International note 7 and no is that
going to be a fairly powerful processor
paired with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigs of storage but compared with the
Galaxy S a it is very very similar in
performance this is also walking a very
similar 12 megapixel camera to what
you'll find on both
galaxy s7 as well as the s8 well sure
it's a little bit old at this point is
still one of the best looking smartphone
cameras you can get today the more I
think about it the more the note fan
Edition just doesn't make a lot of sense
to me not only is this a phone that is
essentially the exact same as what came
out a year ago but with a smaller
battery but it does not come cheap in
Korea this cost equivalent of six
hundred and ten dollars almost the same
prices of new Galaxy s8 don't get me
wrong the note 7 was a great phone and
this sort of solves the whole exploding
and not being allowed on planes thing
which is cool but at the end of the day
I can't see a lot of people wanting to
buy one of these in 2017 besides for the
novelty so would you guys want to pick
up a Galaxy Note fan edition let me know
in the comments below and I'll catch you
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
