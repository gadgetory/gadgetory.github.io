review of Braun I'll say it right up
front this is one of the most unique
games I've played in quite a while
Braun is an on rail racing game for the
PC where you compete against the
computer other players locally or your
previous records all while avoiding the
obstacles in the track if you control
sphere which is able to roll along the
track and whatever orientation you'd
like and couple with it's blazing fast
paced it makes for a lot of fun while a
bit dizzying at first you'll quickly get
the hang of it once you begin learning
the fairly short courses to find the
best line to run if you do run into an
obstacle it's not a big deal as you
can't die however it certainly will slow
you down as you progress through the
championship you unlock a couple new
tracks as well as faster and even more
frantic speeds it's been unfortunate
there aren't more levels included
however the developer will let you
create and download additional levels at
the website which helps add more replay
value to the game the graphics are
exceedingly clean and colorful and it
runs smoothly on most computers made in
the past few years for an indie game I
was very impressed there is next to no
screen tearing or lag and the sound
design is also top-notch the music
consisting almost entirely of smooth
jazz is quite catchy although it does
get repetitive after a while
well there's no online multi-player
right now there are online leaderboards
as well as local split-screen
multiplayer for up to 4 players about
all the buttons you'll need are the WASD
keys for controlling the ball and the
shift key to use boost which is saved up
the longer you go without hitting
anything the WASD Keys work just like a
normal racing games giving plenty of
sensitivity without making them too
twitchy well I think the game would be
better suited to an Xbox or Playstation
controller I found that it works just
fine cram is a stall game in general
with great graphics good controls and
fast-paced gameplay even better is that
it is a pay what you want game so you
can even pay nothing although if you do
pay something you'll get a bonus track
other than that
even if you download for free you get
the full version of the game so if
you're looking for a very fun and unique
racing game deadly check out crown
