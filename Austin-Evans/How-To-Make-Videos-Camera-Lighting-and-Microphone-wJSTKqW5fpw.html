series of videos showing you how to
improve your video quality and we'll get
this question asked all the time how do
I get better video quality how do i
improve my audio my lighting this that
does that so I'd like to do for you guys
split it up and kind of explain some of
the things that I've learned over the
years to hopefully help you improve your
video quality now the first thing I want
to talk about today is equipment now
equipments kind of a funny thing on the
one hand the better equipment and you
can get really good stuff it's going to
definitely help you out it's super
important on the other hand though you
would be absolutely surprised at how
much you can do with cheap stuff with
stuff you may already have around your
house so there are a couple of things
that you're going to typically need for
when you're going to make videos first
of all it's going to be a camera now
contrary to what you might think that
this may not be your best option
a lot of times it's not half bad to get
a camcorder or you may already have a
pocket edge point-and-shoot camera that
has video or even an iPhone iPhone 4s
have really good video so there's a lot
of different steps before you decide
exactly what you have so what I like to
do and what I did when I was first
starting out is figure out what you have
and make the best of that now if you
have a lot of money if you really would
like to get into video and whatnot then
you can slowly start working your way up
with maybe a camcorder maybe something
like this maybe something better you
certainly do that
so as far as the camera goes typically
going to want to look for something with
720p really right now I mean for video
quality is not the most important thing
but if you're going to get something
with less than 720p video generally it's
not going to be very good and you'd be
better off just not wasting your money
on that so you know some smartphones are
pretty decent like I said there's some
putt cameras you there are some smaller
cheaper camcorders and then up and up
and up all you wait till you get to
DSLRs and professional camcorders so
that's number one thing you should look
for now of course video quality is not
everything with just the camera you know
I mean you might buy one of these and
think oh that's going to be the best
video quality no matter what that's
certainly not the case is you need other
things to back it up take for example
what I'm doing right now while of course
I've got this here I'm obviously I
felling I'm filming with the instead a
sends a cue camcorder this thing is
about a hundred bucks right now so with
good lighting with good audio with this
quality is certainly not half bad so
getting away from the cameras I want to
go ahead and talk a little bit about
your audio as well
you're lighting so audio can be handled
in a couple different ways when you're
first starting out it's best to just use
the inboard microphones on your camera
typically that's going to be really
simple it helps on video editing and it
helps you with not having to get
external microphones and sync it with
video editing on kind stuff so it really
simplifies it so like that it's really
cheap obviously it's going to be built
into your camera and it's just going to
work however if you want to improve your
video quality you want it to sound
better and all that kind of good stuff
you're going to want to go ahead and
either get something like a rode
videomic if you have something with a
hot shoe what a rode videomic is I
actually do not have one but it's
basically a shotgun mic or some kind of
external mic for your camera now not all
cameras have microphone inputs and
that's definitely something you should
look for when you're buying a camera is
whether or not you can actually improve
the quality by buying an external
microphone that's one thing you can do
you can also get something like a zoom
h1 it's like a pocket camcorder or
pocket a voice recorder rather um that
will get you good audio quality or you
can even go with something simple like a
desktop microphone so you can have it
off the shot like I have one right over
there but can't show you guys since it's
off to add a frame but that's what I'm
using to report right now so there live
four ways you can go about getting good
audio but of course like I said if
you're just starting out or whatever
just using the standard microphone that
comes with the camera not worry I will
be okay now one of the most important
things right up alongside audio is your
lighting now it depends now lighting is
kind of an interesting thing because it
depends on what you're doing so for
example if you're shooting outside if
you do like outdoors kind of videos
you're probably not going to really need
lighting the Sun is a pretty bright but
if you're shooting inside which I'm sure
most of you guys will be then there's a
couple things you should look for now
again when you're first starting out
just turn on as many lights as you can
you have extra lengths around the house
do you have other light you know any
kind of light will definitely help you
well okay I don't want to say any kind
of light but pretty much any kind of
light that you know lamps overhead you
know fans when you name it it's got a
light more than likely it's going to be
nice to turn on and help you improve
your video quality because cameras
absolutely do so much better and good
light compared to bad so you really be
surprised and if I turn off all these
lights in fact I'll do that right now
turn off a couple of these lights
and I start pulling so now I've got
still sunlight in the rooms you guys can
see the video quality got much worse if
I start opening everything back up
turning on my studio lights back on
because I see that the video quality
improved quite a bit so that's just kind
of a general way to do it if you can get
more lights I mean and it doesn't happen
it's not like you have to go spend a ton
of money on light boxes I mean if you
have a lamps around the house that's
going to be great just be sure to do it
where there's not going to be a lot of
glare and also you typically were going
to want to have more than one light so
instead of having one overhead light I
might have a couple lights from the side
as well as from behind me so you know
it's good to have lighting from multiple
angles I'm not going to get super
in-depth into that but that's definitely
what great way to go and as you improve
and as you decide you need to upgrade
then you can certainly go and you know
get into that some of those lighting
boxes or buy more lamps you can do
whatever you like there now as far as
computers video editing software goes
I'm actually going to cover that a
little bit and later on I can go over to
the computers really quickly but like I
said I'll do the video adding little bit
later on on as far as I can cure pretty
much any modern computer should be able
to video at it that's that's kind of a
broad statement but it's pretty much
true I mean everything from an iPhone
and iPad all the way you know to laptops
and even desktops should be able to
video edit basically now obviously the
faster the computer you have the newer
it is more likely it's going to work
better than something old so in this
case usually just try it on your
computer right now if you see it's
really lagging it's really glitchy you
know you might have to know improvise
but if you have a newer computer
especially if it's been bought in last
year two years or so more than likely
unless it's a netbook you're going to be
able to do some decent video editing and
of course like I said as you move on as
you get nicer computers and whatnot you
can certainly do video editing much
faster to take you less time do more
cool stuff so guys that's it for my
first video talking about how to make
better videos hopefully this kind of
helps you guys out kind of get a good
idea of what kind of equipment you need
I definitely stay tuned for future
installments will go over tips on
actually filming what settings being in
various camera such as DSLRs and typical
camcorders as well as how to video edit
and all that kind of stuff if you guys
enjoy the video definitely be sure to
