the ipod touch 5th generation I've done
a couple of videos talking about this in
the past however there's been some new
things that have come up in the past
couple days I definitely want to share
with you guys so the first of which
isn't disappointing news the ipod touch
5th generation is largely going to be
unchanged from the current 4th
generation model we have today so
previously i as well as many other
people expected that it would be a full
redesign just like the iphone 5 every
year the ipod touch the iphone i get the
new processors they get the new screens
this that is that holder this year it's
going to be an exception as the ipod
touch 5th generation is going to be
pretty much the same there will be a
couple of changes you will be able to
pick it up in white as well as black I
know this doesn't really surprise me too
much of course we'll see black and white
iphone 4 as well as the ipad 2 you know
it seems pretty obvious that Apple is
going to go ahead and roll this out to
the rest of their iOS line and there
also will probably be a couple of
smaller things for example a new screen
coating that helps keep the fingerprints
off but by and large it's going to be
the exact same ipod as we have today now
there are three reasons why i say this
the first which is reportedly came out
of macrumors this morning which
basically detailed exactly what i just
said that you'll be able to pick it up
in black and white we have a couple of
small minor changes however it will be
by and large the ipod touch 4th
generation just roll over for another
year now the second is just overall
timing of it and leaks and rumors and
all that kind of stuff now if you guys
have followed apple stuff you always
know that no matter what you're going to
see leaks and rumors parts this that
buzz all its kind of stuff and it really
has not been a lot of talk about the
next generation ipod touch of course we
have seen a couple of times where it was
leaked in white but beyond that we
haven't really heard of any new
redesigns like we have on the iphone 5
now the last most important key to why i
believe this is real is based on a
source of mine who is deep level access
into the iOS 5 code and you guys not
familiar with way the iOS betas work
when you go in you can't really take a
look and see like ipod 31 or etc etc it
shows you what the new ipods and iphones
and ipads are going to be inside the
firmware and now while my source did say
that there are two new iphones as well
as a new apple TV there is no word
whatsoever about a new ipod touch now
this makes sense because if the ipod
touch 5th generation is the exact same
as the ipod touch 4th generation
internally as any other specs the
hardware all that kinda stuff is going
to be the same then
no reason why would be listed in the iOS
5 beta so it looks like the ipod touch
is going to have a minor update this
year that's not going to be the entire
story it seems very likely that there
will be a new cheaper version of the
iphone perhaps dubbed the iphone 4s
which will be similar to the iphone 4
that we have currently however is going
to be much cheaper probably something
more like three to four hundred dollars
off contract which is not all that much
more expensive than ipod touch so if you
guys are really interested in getting
something that's you know like an iPod
or an iPhone but you don't want to pay
the full price that's something that the
iphone 5 that very well might be the
best bet for you anyway guys it's going
to be about it if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up it really helps spread the word
everyone know about what's going to be
happening with the ipod touch 5th
generation and if you guys are
interested in more videos about iphones
i pause and all that kind of good stuff
definitely be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
