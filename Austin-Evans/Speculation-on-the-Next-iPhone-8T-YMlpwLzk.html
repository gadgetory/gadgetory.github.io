today I have some speculation I'm going
to take some guesses at what I think
that what the next iPhone will be
released at the Worldwide Developers
Conference next Monday I'm going to take
some guesses probably most all be
totally off but I'm just going to take
some guesses see maybe maybe it might
figure some stuff out maybe not and
basically that you guys know what I
think is coming so let's get this one
started
with the Worldwide Developers Conference
coming up next Monday everyone really is
going crazy with speculation from
supposed memos to employees from
seemingly everywhere stock is almost
non-existent with current iPhone 3
cheese to the various specs and pictures
being released almost on a daily basis
is clearly a great time has fun and
trying to figure out what exactly Apple
has in store for us
many people have gone to great lengths
come up with their own ideas of what the
next iPhone will look like with the help
of Photoshop we can all see that some of
the ideas are very clever indeed there
is rampant speculation of everything
from a faster processor to more memory
different colors bigger screens and deed
just some really wild stuff that
probably can only happen in our dreams
while the odds are that the majority of
these specs that are being spread around
are total fakes seems impossible at
least a few nuggets of truth aren't
floating around of course no one really
knows anything for sure really for sure
but with less than a week to go I think
there's nothing around for me to make
some decent predictions on what I think
is coming while they're on totally
off-base or fairly close
minds we'll have some fun with it the 3G
currently has and is available with the
either eight gigs or 16 gigs of memory
same as the eye touch is available
within it with those in addition to a 32
gig option seems fairly obvious to me
that very least the next iPhone will be
available on a 32 gig option some people
speculate the Apple may really since 16
gig and 32 gig version of the next
iPhone and continue selling the current
3G with 8 gigs a discount but maybe even
as low as $99 I'm sceptical on this one
as mainly for the reason that most
retailers seem to be running on
extremely low inventories of all 3G
models so it seems like they're phasing
them out I don't really see any reason
did they would try to keep the old ones
for any longer than they had to um a
slightly more likely way for Apple to
sell an iPhone for less than $200
would be just to sell an 8 gig model of
a new of the new phone for maybe
somewhat less than 200 maybe 150 hundred
seventy-five and there's also been
speculation on a 4 gigabyte phone which
supposedly would sell for less than 100
one thing that people might be
forgetting our is that Apple charges a
lot more than it costs for memory
upgrades take the iTouch for example an
8 gigabyte model costs $230 okay while a
32 gigabyte model cost 400 you really
think that 32 gigabytes of flash memory
cost almost as much as an iTouch with
eight gigs I don't think so
charging extra from memory since the
Apple does to make more money why would
they do it in reverse and charge you way
less for half the RAM I mean half the
flash memory now I don't I don't really
see any upside for Apple to sell an
iPhone with less memory for any big
discount I mean if it was a 25 or maybe
is something if something reasonable
discount I I could get that but if it's
any kind of like hundred dollars they're
not gonna they're not gonna say that
will give you a four gig for half the
price of an AE I just don't see that now
the only way I see them really cutting
the price would be if they had the
supposed I phone nano ever since the
first iPhone came out an iPhone Nana has
been rumored while there really hasn't
been any real concrete evidence of it as
of yet I actually like the idea and I
like the idea of it coming out this year
now let me tell you what a lot of people
expect there to be lower in a lower end
version of the iPhone preps and slightly
less features but I think an iPhone man
who could actually make more sense I
think about when the first iPhone came
out it really was totally in a class by
itself there really no challengers to it
so why would Apple make a cheaper model
they would make less money and probably
take sales away from the main model same
goes for last year even then no one
really had a decent challenger to the
iPhone
now the thing is this year the
competition is starting to catch up palm
is about to release the Prix which looks
like it could and I say could be a
genuine challenger blackberry is also
trying the iPhone formula again with the
next-generation storm which also could
challenge the iPhone now I say could
because I don't really know a whole lot
about them these are out yet so you
don't know but there's at least the
possibility now that there could
actually be an actual challenged the
iPhone it does make sense in my opinion
for an iPhone nano it could be merely
just a deacon tended version of the
upcoming iPhone types lacking some
features such as Wi-Fi but what I hope
that it could be would be an actually
different phone together likely having
maybe like a smaller screen and fewer
real features now there's no real
evidence like I said this is just what I
think makes some sense so I don't
actually think this is going to happen
it would be cool I would like it if this
what happened but I actually don't
really think it it's kind of a long shot
okay so this has been just a lot of
speculation just just a lot of guesswork
and you know just this is list a lot of
fun guessing because I mean you know
this doesn't happen but what what's here
so let me just give you my predictions
on what we will see next Monday a 32
gigabyte option is a definite in my mind
probably along at least along with a 16
gig and perhaps along with an 8 gig that
would be slightly cheaper than the $200
price to get in under the pre and
everyone else go we've got 100 like 170
or whatever a faster processor also
makes sense along with an upgrade of to
256 megabytes of RAM compared to the
hundred 128 supposedly if any of these
rumors are true doubling the RAM will
really really pick it up and seeing is
the current iPhone and iPod Touch are
constantly constantly wanting more
running out of memory I think that
that's that's that's just a no-brainer a
better camera also makes sense I think
and so does maybe an LED flash for it
now the main thing is I would strongly
strongly bet on the iPhone keeping the
same size screen perhaps with a no LED
screen which is an organic compared to
the standard LED screen which generally
gives much crisper much much nicer
looking images along keeping the same
roughly the roughly same size and
dimensions I would imagine a change
perhaps similar to the change between
the first and the second generation
iPhone something gradual something it's
easily recognizable as an iPhone but you
know has some tweaks and maybe some
everything a little bit here there ah a
front-facing camera along with software
that would make it similar to a chat
that's a possibility I get that but I
really wouldn't hold my breath on that
one that's just kind of now these are
just easy to guess things and I would
definitely bet on Apple having a few
tricks up its sleeve as well and I
didn't even get into the 3.0 software
update which will probably be available
next week as well
definitely don't forget about that guys
and remember the update is free if you
have an iPhone technology that if you
have an iTouch anyway these are just my
ideas with our next iPhone could be like
but what do you guys think let me leave
what you think in the comments below
umm because these this is just what I'm
thinking I this is just total just I
think would be a good idea you guys
think you have something better or you
think I'm totally wrong or you agree
with me whatever leave comments down
below and just just tell me what you
think be sure to check out xergiok calm
