mysterious brown box is what I very much
hope is the Xbox one X but the question
is is it worth it so first of all I have
to give a big shout to Microsoft for
actually sending us out the Xbox 1x
early moment of truth
oh yeah so first we get all of our
paperwork in this nice little folder so
we get the getting started guide
actually something cool about the 1x is
that if you do have a one that's right
now literally all the cables are in the
same spot and they use the same cable so
you just unplug the one as plug the 1xn
and works just fine you also get one
month of Xbox game pass as well as what
I assume is a month of oh 14 days of
Xbox Live Gold we also get to be some
cables yeah so we have the tiny power
cable one of the nice things about the
1s and the 1x is that you don't need a
power brick just plug it right in
alright we also get an HDMI cable as
well as the yo controller I don't think
the One X has a different controller
than the 1s they already update it last
year with Bluetooth Nicole things but
let's take a look yeah that looks pretty
much like a normal Xbox one controller
does have a little bit of a texture on
the back but I think it's the same as
the 1s just in a different color but
nice although what's not nice is that
the $500 console still comes with
double-a batteries assai should have
that big of a deal but having to charge
an extra $20 for the battery is kind of
annoying now
the Xbox 1x
so I've actually held one of these
before and ah it is so heavy so this is
actually slightly smaller than the Xbox
one s but it weighs a lot more and
supposed to because they put some crazy
cooling to actually get this thing to
work
there it is
Xbox one X so if you look here in the
back it's literally just a giant
heatsink so the idea here is that
because this is so much more powerful
than something like the Xbox one s that
they need to get a lot more cooling to
actually make sure this doesn't like you
know explode or catch on fire or red
rings so just like on the 1s we have the
power port HDMI out as well as HDMI and
a pair of USB 3.0 ports IR out speaker
out as well as Ethernet my big takeaways
from the One X as far as hardware goes
it's just so heavy I'm just gonna keep
saying that this is so heavy King very
heavy I mean it's cuz it's smaller than
1s2
right it's very slight it's basically
the same size it's like a little smaller
but like it this is very dense vapor
chamber cooling inside which is like
what you find on like a 1080 T is but
also this thing like probably draws more
power to you at the power seems to say
unless she's surprised that they were
able to do that because the ps4 pro uses
a more PC style yeah speaking of the ps4
Pro to me the One X is a much more
attractive console across the board not
only does it pack more power and a
smaller and better-looking chassis but
you're also getting extra features such
as Ultra HD blu-ray that you just can't
get on the ps4 pro or the 1x side by
side with its little brother and the
family resemblance is clear it drops the
vents on top in favor of a matte black
finish all the way across well this is
nice for usability and allowing you to
actually put things on top of the
console to me I still feel like the 1s
is the better looking console especially
in white it is such a classy look
but the 1x is very similar like the ps4
pro the major advantage of the One X is
that it is a more powerful version of
the Xbox one s look at the specs and
it's no competition well it has a
similar eight core processor on the One
X it's clocked higher at 2.3 gigahertz
compared to 1.7 memory C's a massive
upgrade we're going from 8 gigabytes of
ddr3 to 12 gigabytes of gddr5
now having that extra space means that
not only can you do things like store
higher resolution textures but is of the
faster gddr5 variants the original Xbox
one relied on ddr3 memory which is a lot
slower but it was backed up by some very
small and very fast vs Ram on the actual
chip itself and this was expensive and
part of the reason why the original Xbox
one did not have as much power as the
ps4 which decided to bail on all of that
and just go with the faster gddr5 memory
out of the box and the xbox 1x needs it
so it has an AMD Vega based GPU with a
pretty impressive six teraflops of
performance and I put that in
perspective the original Xbox one had
about 1.2 teraflops while the ps4 and
ps4 pro have 1.8 and 4.2 teraflops
respectively that is five times the
graphics horsepower of the original Xbox
one and it is right up there with a lot
of high-end gaming PCs now it's actually
kind of necessary in 2017 the original
Xbox one barely struggled to hit 1080p
and a lot of games much less 4k the idea
is that all current Xbox one games will
run right out of the box no problem on
the One X but some games especially new
ones going forward should be 1x enhanced
now this can mean different things
depending on the game so a lot of the
times this means that you're going to
get 4k and HDR support but at the very
least you should see some resolution and
quality improvements as I'm doing this
video before the release date not all
these game patches are live however a
couple of them that I can test are Gears
of War 4 and titanfall 2 gears is right
up there with some of the best looking
options on the Xbox one and you get a
ton of options on the 1x it only does it
have a 4k rendering mode with enhanced
textures but you can also opt to play at
1080p at 60 frames which is awesome now
it all games do this but it brings
experience closer to the flexibility you
get on PC when you're playing on a nice
4k TV the difference is very noticeable
take a closer look and you'll see that
not only are textures on his face and
jacket much improved but the higher
resolution helps clean up stuff like his
hair in action while the details aren't
quite as obvious the extra resolution
and textures make a big difference it's
not a next-generation leaf or anything
but especially if you have an HDR
display it looks great Titan vol 2 also
shows a substantial difference this is a
game that struggles to get close to HD
on standard hardware but here it's
running with a dynamic resolution that
aims for 4k while keeping locked to 60
frames per second in most areas it's not
quite at 4k but the difference compared
the standard Xbox isn't even close it
goes from being a bit of a blurry mess
to looking crisp and detailed this is
all based on playing on a 4k TV but you
will see some of these improvements if
you're using a 1080p or even a 1440p
monitor the One X will super sample down
to HDD to get you a sharper image with
the same improved texture as etc you
won't be getting the full benefit but is
4k and HD are compatible TVs become more
and more common having more powerful
console isn't a crazy idea
Microsoft recently brought out backwards
compatibility for original Xbox games
which works well on the XS you'd expect
what's really impressive is the 360
emulation on the standard one it looks
essentially identical to base 360
hardware but for some games including
Halo 3 and fallout 3 there's a special
1x rendering mode not only does this
massively improve the resolution but it
can also add things like HDR support
without touching the base game code or
at least supposedly take a look at halo
3 and the difference is kind of
incredible there's a massive leap and
not only resolution but just in sheer
detail if you take a closer look at
arbiter here for example he goes from
being a few blurry pixels on the 360 to
being razor sharp on the 1x it's clear
that they're drawing higher quality
textures farther away than was possible
before and the results are awesome
unfortunately this won't be the case on
every 360 game on the One X but it is
still incredibly impressive get outside
of gaming and you'll find a very
familiar sight so the new Xbox one
interface is shared across all Xbox ones
and while it is a big improvement it
still is a little bit cluttered compared
to what I'd like ps4 you do get some new
options including being able to record
gameplay at up to 4k 60 an HDR although
if you want to record for longer than 30
seconds you will need an external drive
also just a little tip if you want to
know which games take advantage of the
One X there's a drop down menu which
will show you which titles are 1 X
enhance the vapor chamber cooling inside
the One X absolutely does its job so it
does get a little bit warm around back
thankfully that doesn't mean that the
fan speed is going to be all that high
it's only just a little bit louder than
something like the one s given the power
draw Tops 165 watts I had to give
Microsoft credit they did not cheap out
when it comes to the cooling which
brings me to one of the biggest issues
with the One X price at five hundred
dollars it's not only $100 more than the
ps4 pro but it's basically double the
price of the standard Xbox one the Xbox
is fighting an uphill battle
one hand there's the more successful ps4
and on the other is the surprisingly
excellent Nintendo switch so is the Xbox
one axe worth it well it depends if
you're the person who wants the most
powerful console out there then yes but
for a lot of people the cheaper ps4 Pro
is going to deliver not only more games
but the performance is close enough that
it might just be enough so what do you
guys think about the 1x let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
