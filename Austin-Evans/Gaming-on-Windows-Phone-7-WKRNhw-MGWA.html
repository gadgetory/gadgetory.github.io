youth the video going over gaming on
windows phone with Xbox Live integration
and quite a few exclusive games let's
take a look the first game is zombies on
the phone a mobile port of the awesome I
made a game with zombies in it this is a
dual stick shooter that features you
guessed it zombies just like on xbox
live arcade what's great about this
isn't just the gameplay but the
presentation the music is time with the
gameplay perfectly and the graphics look
good if a bit seizure-inducing at times
there are weapon pickups and a wide
variety of enemies from zombies to
crystals which break off into smaller
shards when you shoot them there's also
an endless Zombies mode along with an
awesome mode called time viking it's cut
another really catchy song and a
platform where you have to defend
against ninjas oh yeah for three dollars
and with full Xbox Live Support
including achievements this is a must
for anyone with a Windows Phone Hydro
Thunder go is another great game just
like the original arcade game that I
grew up playing you pilot an absurdly
fast boat through pretty absurd tracks
with all kinds of action this one uses
motion controls and while it might not
be the most graphically intense game it
certainly does work the gameplay is
pretty simple and learning the maps is
very helpful as there are lots of
shortcuts and boost power ups all over
the place to do well you need to collect
enough boost and use it almost
constantly overall for five dollars it's
not a must-have but fun for fans of the
original and games like this last but
certainly not least we had snake 97 and
no you aren't seeing things this is a
nearly perfect port of snake on the
Nokia 5110 some of you probably never
had the pleasure of playing this on the
original nokia but this was how i spent
many afternoons after school in the game
you control snake us to eat food every
time you eat a pixel your body gets that
much longer and if you run into the wall
or your tail game over this one's
definitely a novelty with the original
nokia buttons and all but it's a game i
gladly paid one dollar for so there you
have it a few examples of gaming on
windows phone while there might not be
the same selection of games is on the
iphone or even android there are
definitely some good ones and even some
exclusive games tied into xbox alive if
you enjoyed this video be sure to leave
it a thumbs up and if you're interested
