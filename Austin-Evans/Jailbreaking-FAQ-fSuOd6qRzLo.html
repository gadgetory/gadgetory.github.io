jailbreaking frequently asked questions
video now since the new jail breaks are
just around the corner I've decided
right now would be a great time to go
ahead and talk go over some of the more
common and frequently asked questions
about jailbreaking now obviously these
questions really this video in general
is not really meant for the advanced
jailbreaker somebody has been around a
while however it's more focused towards
the novice jailbreaker who maybe you've
never jailbroken before and you're
thinking about it or you had your broken
maybe once or twice but you don't
understand everything about it so if you
think that you might you know want alarm
just a little bit more about
jailbreaking feel free to stick around
with the video
jailbreaking is the term used for
removing the Apple restrictions on your
Apple TV on your ipod touch your iPhone
as well as your iPad now jailbreaking is
kind of you know like a kind of
interesting term but that's pretty much
what it does now what what I mean by
that is take for example your iPhone and
whatever if you want to go ahead and
download an app customize something
twink something everything you do has to
go through the apple app store and to
get into the app store apple has to
individually go through each application
so basically is a very closed system
only exactly what Apple wants is allowed
through now for some people this is not
a problem you know that obviously are
quite a few really nice apps in the App
Store everybody likes the App Store
however jailbreaking through
jailbreaking by jailbreaking your device
allows you to do pretty much anything
and everything you want so instead of
being limited by Apple what they think
you're limited by what your device can
do so what this means you can go ahead
and download apps but maybe apple
doesn't like such as google voice
grooveshark quotes do others like that
in addition to modding tweaking pretty
much doing anything and everything you
want
Cydia is the quote unquote jailbreaking
App Store now what this means is that
when you jailbreak generally your device
will pretty much identical to the way it
was with one key section and that is the
fact that city is now on your device
Cydia is for all intents and purposes
and App Store for geo broken
applications so the way cydia worse
however it is quite a bit different from
the App Store as that you can pretty
much do anything you want with Cydia is
just a grandma so using City you can
download paid applications and yes there
are paid jailbreaking applications so
quite a few developers like to go ahead
and charge for their mods their tweaks
their applications which is totally fine
however the overwhelming majority do
give all the content away for free and
using stood in you can download and
install pretty much anything you want in
addition City allows you to add your own
repository now what a repositories are
basically places where you store
software so with Cydia you can go ahead
and add any repository and anyone is
free to make one so I felt like I can do
make my own repository put my own custom
app in there and then give you guys the
link to go ahead and add it and then you
can download through cydia so that
really is the key difference between
city and the App Store and the fact that
a lot with city yet anyone can download
anything they're pretty much no
restrictions whatsoever where the App
Store tis very closed and parrying are
narrow now when you do get cydia it's
not like you lose the App Store either
when you download cydia basically
through jailbreaking it's the exact same
thing you can still have full access to
all your App Store applications so
obviously you're still able to buy all
the great games applications from Apple
however you do have a secondary source
to go ahead and download other sorts of
things that you cannot get through the
app store
now there are two terms that are used a
lot with jailbreaking and then this is a
tethered jailbreak and an untethered
jailbreak so this is really quite simple
and you have a tethered jailbreak what
this means is that when you go to turn
off your device not just lock it but
actually totally shut it off when you
get the slide to unlock then and then
when it shuts off you will not be able
to boot it up by itself with a nun to
the jewelry so basically what this means
is pretty simple is that whenever you
have it totally off your iPhone iPod
whatever when it's totally off you will
need to go ahead and plug it into your
computer and rerun the jailbreaking
software that you originally gentle
Brook with now this is a little bit of a
hassle as it will take you a few minutes
every time maybe your your device you
need shut up whatever you need to go
ahead and plug it into the computer and
rewrite it however it will go ahead and
boot up just fine but for that reason I
really generally don't recommend these
gipsies types of jail breaks as they get
really pretty going pretty fast as you
have to deal with plug it into the
computer speaking 12 minutes every time
your device maybe runs out of battery
need to restart for some reasons so like
it's pretty annoying on the other hand
and untethered jailbreak is pretty much
exactly the way it sounds you referring
to go ahead and turn your device on and
off no worries you never have to really
run the jailbreaking program again now
these days pretty much all major jail
breaks are untethered tethered gibberish
used to be a thing a little while ago
but it looks like they're kind of
becoming a thing of the past in other
words there are still a couple of
intelligent energy or its rounds
now as far as this question goes it
really depends on you so the best
analogy I can think of is think of your
out of your iphone or ipod your ipad
think of it as when you jailbreak it
turns into a small computer now
obviously if you have a desktop computer
when you have a lot of programs up if
you mod if you tweak you to bunch it's
going to go ahead and slow it down well
the exact same thing holds true for your
Apple device so what I mean by this is
pretty simple just don't add a bunch of
stuff okay so obviously that's the
beauty of joy but you're free to do as
much as you want you want to style every
single icon redo every little bit of
graphics on the entire device run a ton
of different modifications tweaks you're
absolutely free to do this however you
are still limited by what the hardware
can do so like I said it's the exact
same thing is if you take your maybe
your Mac or your Windows computer and
you make it video wallpapers and just
you want it like crazy sure it's going
to work but it's going to be very slow
so in general jailbreaking really
doesn't slow anything down it pretty
much if you fresh 2 jailbroken device
it's really not gonna be any slower than
what it was before however when you do
get to add a lot of these custom apps
tweets themes and mods it will slow your
device down so what I recommend is
always kind of if you're going to
download something always be sure maybe
if you don't this is how you don't
really need it uninstalled keep your
device running nice smooth and clean
absolutely so take for example my ipod
touch 2nd generation now I'm not even
joking ipod jailbroken it's well over
100 times in a couple of years that I've
had it however all it takes is for me to
go ahead and plug it into itunes and
press the restore button and it is going
to be one hundred percent as good as new
that's one of the great things about the
white Apple has designed the hardware
and the fact that it is very hard to go
ahead and you know leave any sort of
data behind in fact all it takes is just
plugging it into itunes like I said
impressing the one restore button it
will go ahead and wipe everything on the
device and restore it to a
non-jailbroken state this is very handy
if you would like to sell it if you want
to decide if you know maybe geo ratings
not for you whatever reason there's
absolutely no reason why you can't go
ahead and go back to it clean and
unjailbreak in state
no using a standard jailbreaking program
from one of the established development
teams you should never actually totally
kill your device so the way this works
is that Apple has a very clever system
in place that pretty much prevents
anything from actually totally killing
your device and actually is two modes
the one is called dfu mode and one is
called recovery mode and I'm not going
to get into exactly how to enter these
modes or anything like that but
basically do know that these are
safeguards that are in place to prevent
your iPod iPhone or iPad from getting
totally destroyed or bricked as usually
what it's called so there can be a lot
of reasons why you can have problems now
of course you know if you download a bad
tweak maybe there's a glitch going on or
in fact maybe something more serious
like you know when you're in the middle
of jailbreaking your computer crashes
you accidentally unplug the device there
are a lot of different reasons why
something could go wrong however there
should never be a situation where one of
these little problems mistakes actually
totally renders your device unusable
another are several different methods to
go ahead and revive it from the dead now
the most common and the one you
absolutely should go for first is iTunes
all you can do is take your device plug
it into itunes and click restore almost
always you should be able to go ahead
and revive it it should go ahead restore
back to normal and you should be just
fine now in much rarer cases where that
won't work then there are a couple of
other programs which of course now go
ahead and get into today but do just
know that assuming that the hardware
itself isn't busted so you know as long
as your iphone or ipod touch or your
iPad is in good working condition a
jailbreak should never actually go ahead
and render it unusable
yes if you update your device using
iTunes it will remove the jewelry and
this is something that a lot of
first-time directors don't understand
and gets them into trouble is that Apple
is constantly updating the firmware on
their devices now of course this is a
good thing because they continuously fix
bugs and add new features however if
you're jailbroken you definitely need to
be very wary of these updates so let's
say for example the last firmware update
which is 4.1 now the last working
jailbreak was made for 4.0 point one so
a lot of people from four point nine
point one saw the updating itunes and
went ahead and updated not really
realizing what they were doing now by
updating your device through itunes it
does remove your jailbreak so this is
something that all directors need to be
very cautious of the best thing to do is
if you're jailbroken and you obviously
want to stay jailbroken ignore the
iTunes updates now every time there is
an update it takes the development team
quite a while to go ahead and make a new
jailbreak specifically for that firmware
now sometimes it takes less time than
others so for example sometimes it takes
almost no time in fact sometimes
jailbreaks just carry over however the
majority of the time if you know there's
a new firmware today well the tape might
take the development team week a month
several months to get a new jailbreak
out and in case in a lot of time you're
going to be stuck on that firmware and
not have any other options so that's why
we're in jail broken always be very very
wary never go ahead and update your
firmware until the jailbreak teams goes
hey we have a new Jo read for it and you
have the all clear
now this is one of the most important
things about jailbreaking today as an sh
sh blog to put simply is the key to
allow you to downgrade your firmware now
like I touched on earlier when there are
firmware updates a lot of the time that
are not jailbreakable immediately and
they take quite a while so you always
want to be able to downgrade to lower
firmwares now before about a year or so
ago you could do this freely all you had
to do is take your device put it into
itunes and you should be able to go
ahead and downgrade your device however
Apple has put in place the system that
does not allow you to do this so this is
this is really annoying for a lot of
different reasons however the major
reason is that you just basically cannot
downgrade unless you have saved your
SHSH blobs so like I said you're an sh
sh blog is basically the key to allowing
you to downgrade your firmware now there
are two different ways to get your SHSH
blobs the first one is through cydia so
when you have Cydia it always go ahead
pop up with a little thing that says
should I let make my life easier go
ahead always click that button as it
will allow city and to save your SHSH
blobs and at any point you can go ahead
and download the bobs from Cydia and
Denver 82 that firmware is a fantastic
feature and i highly recommend that you
go ahead and enable it now the second
feature which is a little bit more
robust as personally what I use as well
it's called tinyumbrella now I've done
videos on previously you can go ahead
and check out my channel to see but
basically tinyumbrella will actually
save your sh sh on your computer now
again this is great as you can go ahead
and use it with your site with your sh
sh safe you can go ahead and downgrade
to that firm are no problem now there is
a catch however you can only get your sh
sh blog while you were currently on that
firmware and Apple still signing it so
basically what this means is that as of
this video the most current firmware for
the iphone and ipod touch is iOS 4.1 now
let's say I don't have any SHSH blobs
and I want to go ahead and down by eight
to four point zero point one well I
cannot do that because
Apple is no longer signing those blobs
so that is why it's imperative to go
ahead and save your SHSH blobs as soon
as you upgrade to the firmware so really
pretty simple and doesn't take that long
but you would be I mean it very very
surprised at how many people do not know
how to do this so i highly recommend
every time go ahead and save as many
SHSH blobs as you can because you never
know when and why you might need to
downgrade but by just simply saving the
bobs you always have that choice anyway
I hope that you found this little
frequently asked questions video helpful
and answering some of your questions now
of course there are always new geo
bricks on the way there are always new
updates on the way as well to kill the
jewelry's so it's a constantly changing
game and you always really should stay
on top of it you know if you're really
into jailbreaking you really like the
freedom that it affords you then really
there's no reason not to go ahead and
pay attention you know when there's new
update don't do it when there's new
jailbreak that's when you update you
don't update immediately lots of little
things like that are very important and
a lot of first-time jailbreakers in
trouble however as long as you know you
just pay attention you don't just start
raining like pressing buttons and iTunes
you should have no problem keeping right
ahead of the train so anyway guys if you
do have any questions you want to know
about anything about jailbreaking
including a full tutorial for pretty
much every single jailbreak that comes
out feel free to subscribe to my channel
like I said I'm really big into
jailbreaking and I always do go ahead
and put full tutorials pretty much as
soon as the jailbreak comes out so you
always have you know the little tutorial
to go ahead and show you how to do it
it's pretty simple but I let's go ahead
and help everybody out by making
tutorials anyway again hope you found
this helpful and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
