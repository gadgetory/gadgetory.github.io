is a comparison between four top-tier
smartphones to see which one is the best
of the best while I can't compare every
good phone that's out I rounded up a few
of the best including the iPhone 5s HTC
One m8 Google Play edition Samsung
Galaxy s5 and Moto X to kick things off
we have the build quality the Moto X has
some interesting options like wood
however it's mostly made out of plastic
it doesn't feel all that bad but there
was some very obvious scenes and I was
able to break my first Moto X without
too much trouble the galaxy s5 takes a
step forward with a sturdier build and a
ridged band that runs around the edge
holding things together nicely
unfortunately it's also got a little
flex but it's definitely an improvement
over earlier Galaxy S phones the HTC One
m8 and iPhone 5s are on another level
however both are mostly made out of
aluminum and feel absolutely rock solid
in the hand with no flex or give
anywhere so for the best Billo quality
it's a tie between the iPhone and One m8
next we have economics to see how each
of these phones feel in the hand while
the all-metal build looks great it also
makes the HTC One a bit slippery
especially with the polished gray model
put that together with being the biggest
and heaviest phone here and it can be a
bit unwieldy to use even though it has a
bigger screen the Galaxy s5 is quite a
bit lighter which makes it easier to use
with one hand the back is also made of a
grippy rubber material which feels nice
when holding it step over to the iPhone
and we're looking at a much smaller and
more manageable device you can easily
reach the entire screen with one hand
and the Shaam furred edges make sure you
can keep a good grip on it
pick up the Moto X though and it's like
you found Goldilocks it packs a much
larger screen and a frame barely bigger
than the iPhone and the back is almost
perfectly shaped to fit in your hand
getting the Moto X the easy win in the
ergonomics Department now let's take a
look at the special features of each
phone with the One m8 you'll find a few
things like a micro SD card slot to
expand your storage along with a
built-in IR blaster for controlling
devices like TVs the iPhone 5s is a
pretty straightforward phone as the big
headlining feature is the touch ID
fingerprint scanner it's not perfect but
it works pretty well just needing you to
rest your finger on the home button to
unlock the device
the motor wax allows you to customize
colors and materials using moto maker
which is an awesome feature even when
the phone is off you can say ok Google
now and it will immediately open up a
voice search in Google now you also have
the awesome active notifications which
will light a tiny part of the display to
tell the time in show notifications when
you pull it out of your pocket not to be
outdone Samsung loaded the Galaxy s5
with features including a micro SD card
slot and IR blaster like the HTC One
along with the fingerprint scanner from
the iPhone although it's not quite up to
the same level as it can be a bit hit or
miss and actually working it's also
packing a heart rate sensor which is a
nice feature and water sealing allowing
you to take it for a dip without
worrying taking the galaxy s5 the clear
winner when it comes to features next we
have the specs and responsiveness of
each phone jump into the benchmarks with
Geekbench 3 and you'll see the iPhone
Galaxy s5 and One m8 are all fairly
closely matched where the Moto X falls
quite a bit behind move over to the
graphics side with the manehattan test
and GFX bench and again the results are
fairly close with the Moto X trailing
the rest well it's not bad by any
stretch the Moto X is let down a bit
thanks to the older Snapdragon s4 pro
dual-core CPU it's not a slow phone but
the UI cant stutter sometimes especially
when multitasking while the Galaxy s5 is
packing some serious specs it's also
running Android with Samsung's TouchWiz
UI it's a lot better than it used to be
but there are still traces of hesitation
here and there on paper the iPhone has a
slow dual-core CPU and half as much RAM
as the others however the Apple a7
inside is no joke and iOS 7.1 is very
smooth and fluid with the HTC One m8
especially the Google Play edition
you're getting one impressively fast
device no matter what you throw at it
for this one it's a tie between the
iPhone and HTC One for the most
responsive device something that's easy
to overlook is the audio performance
with one small speaker on back the
galaxy s5 just doesn't sound impressive
especially when you consider a single
finger can almost entirely drown out the
sounds the iPhone moves the speaker over
to the bottom which helps things a bit
however we're still looking at an only
average listening experience while the
speaker's around back on the Moto X it's
surprisingly decent
there's a nice volume in an actual bit
of dynamic range could you make things
pretty solid move up to the HTC one go
and it's no contact with a pair of
excellent boom sound speakers up front
pointing directly at you the audio is
much clearer and better sounding than
any other phone out today making the HTC
One m8 the clear winner in the audio
department moving on let's take a look
at the screens while I like the 4.7 inch
size of the Moto X display the quality
is a bit lacking even though it's 720p
compared to 1080p on most flagships the
real problem is a black olestra color
from the older demo lip screen the
iPhone sports a much nicer looking LCD
screen with solid color and brightness
however it's a comparatively small 4
inches with a sub 720p resolution take a
look at the 1080p displays on the HTC
One in galaxy s5 and you'll find some of
the best screens on any phone out there
the galaxy s5 is slightly bigger at 5.1
inches versus five inches on the one
however they're both the vibrant
detailed and have fantastic viewing
angles there are slight differences but
both screens look so good that this one
is going to be a tie between the one and
galaxy s5 while this has a lot to do
with your preference next we have the
software while it might be running the
latest Android 4.4 KitKat the Galaxy s5
is also saddled with quite a bit of
blood where you've got Samsung versions
of most google apps along with plenty of
carrier junk to TouchWiz is much
improved here but I still find stock
Android a better experience while iOS 7
was a step back in a few areas 7.1 fixes
a lot of the minor problems making it a
solid modern operating system there are
sore spots and disappointments like Siri
but the iPhone 5s is still a very easy
to recommend platform the Moto X is
running nearly stock Android which has
gotten very very good lately there are a
few small customizations like the active
notifications along with Motorola apps
like assist making it a great place to
be overall move to the One m8 Google
Play edition and we have pure stock
Android KitKat paired with the excellent
hardware powering it this is the nicest
Android experience I've ever used
however you can also opt for the
traditional HTC One which comes with
sense and is surprisingly solid for this
one though one
and made google play edition is the best
of both worlds in the software
department now let's take a look at the
cameras with 10 megapixels to work with
the Moto X sports a unique sensor which
is a bit disappointing get some great
light and it can pull off a decent shot
but too often it completely misses the
white balance and it can really smudge
the details in a low-light the HTC One
isn't much better well it's not bad at
all in low-light get into normal shots
and there's not a huge amount of dynamic
range and colors tend to be a bit flat
you can use the depth sensor to get some
decent shots sometimes but for the most
part is not that useful on the other
hand the camera on the galaxy s5 is on
an entirely different level having 16
megapixels to work with is a big plus
but more important than that
is that the images you can capture are
colorful and detailed with impressive
depth of field throw in 4k video it's a
nearly unbeatable package nearly on
paper the 8 megapixel camera on the
iPhone doesn't seem too impressive but
it consistently pulls in excellent shots
colors accurate things are nice and
sharp and even low-light isn't that bad
something equally important is that it's
incredibly fast at snapping pictures
which has helped me get shots that I
otherwise might have missed it's close
but in the camera Department the iPhone
5s is the winner moving on to arguably
one of the most important smartphone
features we have battery life while the
iPhone is definitely well optimised to
get the most out of a charge the simple
issue is that it just has a small
battery it gets to an average day but
for most longer days taking an external
battery is a must the Moto X does a bit
better largely because it just has a
bigger battery but here again it doesn't
have the longevity to get through some
longer days the Galaxy s5 is outfitted
with a removable 2800 milliamp hour
battery which gives an impressive
stamina quite a bit more than the Moto X
or iPhone while that's incredibly close
I'd have to give the slight edge to the
HTC One even though it's sporting a
slightly smaller battery the cleaner
software of the Google Play edition has
less bloatware eating up your longevity
which gives you this too
see one m8 the edge and battery last but
definitely not least we have price even
though this does change 10 times as of
May 2014 there's really not much
competition the unlocks versions of both
the Galaxy s5 and HTC One come in at a
hefty $700 u.s. with the iPhone 5s at is
still expensive six hundred and fifty
dollars compare that with the fully
customizable Moto X which is a much more
reasonable $350 off contract and the
Moto X is the clear winner when price is
concerned so this has been a long video
with a lot of info what's the bottom
line if you're on a budget and want a
solid phone that runs near stock Android
with fantastic ergonomics the Moto X is
the clear choice if you don't mind
stepping up the price range the galaxy
s5 delivers a solid overall package with
a great screen lots of features and a
really impressive camera while the
screen is tiny the iPhone 5s is still a
rock-solid device with tons of power a
nice compact and lightweight form factor
with fantastic build quality and an
incredibly great camera even though each
phone has perfectly valid reasons why
you might want to pick it over the
others it wouldn't be a comparison
without a winner and for this one it's
going to be the HTC One m8 with
excellent build quality a great screen
awesome speakers and one of the best
software experiences out there the One
m8 is hard to beat the biggest weakness
is the only decent camera but when you
put it all together the HTC One m8 is a
stellar package so what do you guys
think
