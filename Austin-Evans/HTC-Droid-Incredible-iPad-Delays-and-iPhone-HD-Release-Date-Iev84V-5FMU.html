tech today we won't be taking a look at
HTC's new smartphone the droid
incredible going to take a look at the
specs features release date everything
we know and everything would expect sort
of really solid problems in addition
we're also going to take a look at why
Apple has just been delayed the shipment
of iPads to international customers
what's going on with that we don't know
but we're going to definitely take a
look in addition wants going to go over
some rumors about the new iphone OS 4.0
as well as the iphone 4g HD we're going
to call it i'm going to take a look at
that and we actually might have a date
once coming out anyway let's get this
one started
okay so let's begin with the newest
addition to the droid lineup the HTC
incredible on this phone is going to be
really solid I think because it brings a
ton of really cool features the whole
full spec list was just late and unequal
head and go or a few of whom would seem
to begin with it has a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor the one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor is hands down the
best mobile processor on on the market
are now it makes phones even like
netbooks and all kind stuff makes a
blazing fast it's also in the nexus one
as well as a lot of new phones will be
coming out so that's a great addition
although it also has 512 megabytes of
RAM which is completely really solid
because it runs android 2.1 with those
ends you I interface moment on top of it
now I love this interface it really
looks really solid and it brings up
together the best of both worlds with
Android but also brain could really
really nice interface so I'm glad
they're going to do this and it
definitely looks like the specs going to
be capable of handling in addition it
also has an 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus and video capture now this is
a pretty cool feature this is one of the
highest megapixel cameras on the market
today it really looks like it's going to
take nice clear picture 8 megapixel it's
kind of pointy doesn't seem like it's
going to have a high definition video
shooting but hey we'll just have to take
a look at it the HTC droid incredible
will be on sale April 29 no price is
announced yet but it probably should be
around 200 of dollars or so I don't
imagine they're going to really Jack it
up a lot so assuming that it's not an
incredible expensive phone which I
really don't see a reason why it should
this is going to be a very very solid
song it's got the specs it's got android
it looks great it's got nice looking
screen everything about it is really
solid we're just going to take a look
and see once it comes out but i say this
is going to be one of the best android
phones available once it's released then
so the next row we will be covering is
that the ipad has just been delayed for
launch and a lot of different
by roughly a month give or take a little
bit of country this is kind of
disappointing that's the Apple was
saying there's been huge demand and
everything and that you know they sold
out but really they haven't sold that
many they feel roughly about 500,000 and
while of course that's really good for I
mean especially a new product like that
you know a lot of people expected they
would sell a lot more so the fact that
they were planning on doing this I don't
know maybe Apple was planning on saying
less or something I don't know but so
unfortunately if you're in a lot of
countries you have to wait another month
it's go ahead and check you might want
to check your local wherever you
pre-orders your iPad or whatever to see
but it looks like you might have to wait
another month ok so the last we will be
covering today is some possible news
about iphone 4 HD we don't know whether
they're going to call it but the next
iPhone so according to host on gizmodo
that they think that the senator Davies
previously in the past for releasing the
iphones whether it was you know the 3g
or the 3gs they have booked it before
jun 22nd you know this is not really all
that surprising everyone knows that
knife i was coming here in a couple
months but what we're not clear about is
when exactly in june the previous two
iphones came out to eighth and ninth so
for the next one to come out the 22nd
might be a little odd but nevertheless
we do know that Apple does plan on
having some sort of event or some sort
of product we don't know what it is but
they are going to be doing something jun
22nd whether it's the iphone or maybe
something else and iphone be a couple
weeks before then we don't know okay so
that's it for this episode of inside
tech Lex thank you all for washing and

posting more episodes hopefully fairly
regular basis now of course will cover
