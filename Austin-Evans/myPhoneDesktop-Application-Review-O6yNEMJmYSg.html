application review that I think you guys
are going to really like I know I guys I
saw this app just a second later I
bought it and using it and I've loved it
I mean it is called my foam desktop so
basically what this app is all about is
it allows you to push different
information from your computer to your
iPod iPhone or iPad cut sound simple but
guys it's really really good um so if
you're taken with my computer screen you
go ahead and there's two there's two per
clients you can run you can either run
the web client which would just run
inside your browser I've all you have to
do is log in or you can go ahead and run
the standard client for Windows Mac and
Linux so I'm on windows 7 so I'm running
the Windows client okay so basically the
way this works is that you have to have
the app on your iPhone iPod Touch or
iPad and then just I have it it'll
automatically start running on your
computer all I have to do is log in the
first time they'll remember and you
after that okay so the way this works
guys is that all you have to do is type
something on your on your computer and
it will send it over to your iPod or
whatever now guys this might seem kind
of odd but there's a lot of really cool
things you can do with it
okay so for example my first thing I'll
show you guys is how to send a web
address okay so I'm go ahead and open up
maps let's go and open up maps okay
so you see here I've got searched one
infinite loop at California so I have to
do is copy the code and then go ahead
and then punch in the URL okay so that's
the Google map so all I have to do is
hit open and then we'll send it over and
my punch should pick up in just a second
and there you go you scoop automatically
it's launching the Maps application and
it sent me to one infinite loop so guys
that's just one example of it it's very
very quick and easy I do notice that
when you're over a kind of spotty Wi-Fi
networking it can kind of get a little
bit slow but generally it'll if you as
long as you have it set to automatically
search every five seconds you shouldn't
have any lag at all the next main thing
that you'd use this application for is
to send text over now of course this is
a bit less useful but it's also a bit
more useful depending on who you are
um so let's take for example you need to
tap a word document you need to bring it
over to your ipod or whatever and you
need to go on a trip or something well
it's very simple with my phone desktop
yeah all you have to do is just take it
and just paste it in so you see that and
then you have a couple of options you
can just have a show on your iPod or
iPhone or you can have it copied to copy
the text so you can paste on something
else so for example we're gonna go ahead
and show it so send it up send it across
and in just a second it should pop up on
my ipod and there we go so as you see
here you guys this is a full Word
document and then what we can do now is
by clicking the top right right here we
can go ahead and copy or assign the
contact Twitter so we can go ahead and
copy it in the first place and then we
can go ahead and bring it over to the
notes application or whatever you use
for your documents and stuff so that's
another really cool feature
now the next one and arguably guys this
might be one of the coolest ones is to
send images over okay so this worksheet
just strings simply so I have an image
right here something's go ahead and
click this and pull up the desktop just
going to open it okay so now you guys
can see it's loaded it now I can have a
copy to the clipboard on my iPod
which obviously that I could paste
anywhere I want I can just have a show
on my iPod or I can have it saved to the
Photos app just what have it saved to
the Photos app so it just takes just a
second and you can see here it says
image saved you see here that it sent
that image over very very quickly and if
I'd like to take a look at my foes app
it's already in there so I can go ahead
and have it and do whatever I want with
it very very cool stuff now the last
thing you can do with my phone desktop
is send either a phone number or an SMS
and of course guys this is only iPhone
only but if you want all you have to do
it does not display properly oh if
you're using an iPod Touch or I'm sure
an iPad but basically all you would have
to do is type in the number which that's
not so useful
what is is typing an SMS so what you
might want to do is instead that you
know typing it out on your cramped iPod
I mean iPhone keyboard you go ahead and
very simply send it type it all on your
computer
send it and it will go ahead and send no
problem that's a pretty cool feature
I've gotta say okay guys so there's one
last thing and this is the web client so
basically this you don't have to install
anything at all all you have to do is go
to my phone desktop comm and click the
running browser button then you go ahead
and of course you just need to sign into
your account but all you have to do is
you download it and well rather go ahead
sign in you don't have to download
anything at all and then you will be
greeted with this little box and just to
show you guys it works it works just the
same so we're going to go ahead and do
text let's type in hello YouTube
okay so now let's go ahead and have it
show on my ipod and there we go just as
fast it's not there's not a big
difference at all whether you're using
the web client or on your computer so
it's a very very cool thing anyway guys
this has been my review and
demonstration of my phone desktop the
images is pretty handy where you can go
ahead and just send it over it does not
work the other way around but that's not
a big deal so you can when sent it over
and of course text you know pretty old
to bring more documents or anything that
you need on your iPod iPhone or iPad you
go ahead and type it up on your computer
send it over and you're all set
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
