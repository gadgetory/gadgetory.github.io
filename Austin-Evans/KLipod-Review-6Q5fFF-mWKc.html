review of the clay pot so the Clyde pod
is very similar to a product I reviewed
just a little while ago which was the
eye level now the major difference
between the Clyde pod in the eye level
is that the Clyde pod actually allows
you to go ahead and use it as a tripod
although obviously it's not exactly the
same thing it will allow you to get your
own digital camera your flip whatever
into really interesting in nice places
I'm actually I've protesting in a while
there's a really interesting ways you
can use this so they'll sweat just first
start and go ahead and recap the state
the clip as well as the stand are
identical from the eye level so all the
great things I said about them
absolutely do apply to the Clyde on the
clip very very strong clip it on to you
know the side of a desk there's a lot of
really knew your third adjust all kinds
of different ways to use the clip and
indeed with the Clyde pod I'm actually
found some really interesting things
such as going ahead and clipping it too
I'm really bizarre places to get some
really interesting shot so I mean you
know I put it onto a ceiling fan you get
into all kinds of really interesting
places to get these you know the kind of
shots especially if you do YouTube
videos it really makes it very handy arm
still the same of course which is the 16
inch he does come in eight inches which
actually I kind of do recommend eight
inches because many as you can see here
is very very large but depending on how
you're going to be using it eight inches
would probably be a little better just
because this is a little bit too much in
my opinion but uh I the way you can go
ahead and do that arm is very bendy you
can do it too much you know any way you
can twist up as a pretzel and also guys
work pretty well for you know you're
putting in your backpack or whatever
you're doing you can go ahead and fold
up nicely now one of the main features
obviously of the Clyde pod is this
little clip when you go ahead and just
slides right off you go ahead and just
mount your digital camera your flip
whatever it is right onto here and slide
it on ok so let's go I just show you
guys really quickly here like I said
work for pretty much any sort of
lightweight digital camera or you may be
a flip maybe a kodak zi8 maybe you know
a sanyo xacti any sort of smaller sort
of camcorders long
huge will work so the way to do it's
pretty simple just go ahead and flip
over whatever device you have and find
the tripod mount and just line it up
right here see well I can do this but
looking through the camera here and then
just take you know coin or whatever and
just go ahead and screw it a couple
times and it will be nice and skipping
ok so this is what it will look like
once you've got it fully set up as you
can see it works pretty well up
obviously we can go ahead um like that
like it was saying earlier one of the
really cool things about the clay pot is
it really gives you a lot of you know
possibilities I mean you can see here I
can shake it upside down all kinds of
stuff and really the arm doesn't even
budge much less you know the camera fall
off or anything like that I'm not just I
don't really recommend you do that
because you know you always maybe
something got loose or whatever but in
general i'm very impressed with the
clyde pod the manufacturer really is
kind of you know marketing eight towards
the youtube crowd and I do have to agree
I think this gives you a lot of
possibilities if you're just starting
out on youtube or even if you've been
doing it for a little while um it's
really nice to go ahead and be able to
get your smaller camera and kind of
interesting locations so it does give
you a lot of your possibilities like
that so if you're interested you can go
ahead and pick this up I this come in a
couple different comes in eight as well
as 16 inch lengths as well as it comes
in white and black in addition if you
already do have an eye level stain so if
you may be bought one of those or you
saw my previous video and you got one
you should know that they the tripod
mount itself can actually go ahead and
clip on so you already have an eye level
instead of buying a whole new one you
can just go ahead and buy the tripod
mount itself or rather the Clyde pod
mount itself and it will work just fine
so anyway guys I would like to go ahead
and give a quick thanks to eye level who
sent this out to me for free review show
you guys I'm really am pretty impressed
with it and so you know if you like like
I said if you're like in to youtube
videos or you know you just like to kind
of get some really interesting looking
of shots all that kind of good stuff you
definitely will not go wrong with the
Chi pod anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
