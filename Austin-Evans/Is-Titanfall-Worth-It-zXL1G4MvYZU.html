amazingly enough titanfall is actually a
lot of fun as the first game from
respawn the guys who made the original
call of duty modern warfare titanfall
has a lot to live up to it takes a lot
of the typical elements you would find
in first-person shooters and adds a
couple major new ideas the first and
most obvious are the tightness these are
giant mechs that you can call down
throughout the game and jump into
terrain some heavy firepower down on the
other team a first I want it to be
inside a Titan as often as possible
however the game is surprisingly
balanced both in and out of your giant
net when the game starts you play as a
human pilot and for the first few
minutes things play pretty standard Lee
pilots are especially mobile with quick
running speeds and a jetpack that allows
you to double jump and wall run covering
a crazy amount of ground quickly once
you learn the maps there's a lot of
verticality in titanfall with most
buildings having multiple levels and
high vantage points like roofs or
everywhere flight Call of Duty you can
customize your loadout with two guns and
an anti-titan weapon along with water
essentially perks such as being able to
quote increase your movement speed and
more one thing a lot of people got upset
about is that titanfall matches are
limited to 6 vs 6 however the games are
almost always full of action as there's
also AI similar to League of Legends
although nowhere near as vital computer
control grunts inspectors constantly
spawn for both sides they're generally
not much of a threat however they're
useful for farming points to help your
team and get your Titan faster every
couple minutes faster if you're doing
well the game will let you call in a
Titan once inside the game changes in a
big way instead of being small and quick
you're enormous and slow you can also
customize your Titan with different
weapons as well as chess ease to go for
more armor power etc as you expect with
an enormous robot you can kill humans
quickly but you'll have to hit them
first
Natalie can pilots cloak which one that
incredibly effective against other
pilots makes you nearly invisible to a
Titan but you can also jump on the back
of the Titan and tear it up it's not
always the smartest choice as if you
time it wrong you can get shot or even
stepped on but there's something
incredibly satisfying about taking down
a Titan with your assault rifle if you
prefer to stay on the ground
you can also put your Titan into a
and have it guard a location or try to
follow you around and blast everything
it seems I found myself doing this a lot
especially in hardpoint which is where
you have to capture and hold three
points across the map blast Titan
standing starts both teams and Titans
and can result in some incredibly
awesome looking fights
as a multiplayer only game don't expect
to be playing titanfall offline or
without Xbox Live Gold there is however
a campaign mode which has a bit of a
story in two factions the IMC and
militia these games play out mostly like
normal multiplayer however with set game
types in the occasional twist I knocked
out both the IMC and militia campaigns
on PC and Xbox and a couple hours each
and the reward are two new Titan jassi's
most individual games take less than 10
minutes however instead of just
finishing the match once one team set
the score limit there's an epilogue
where the losing team has the chance to
escape to a dropship it's a fun addition
that makes the losing feel nowhere near
as bad if you successfully escaped in
fact there are a lot of nods to less
experienced FPS players burn cards are
essentially one-use power-ups you earn
throughout the game that can give you
upgraded weapons getting a Titan earlier
or cool ones like disguising yourself as
an AI controlled spectrum you can equip
three burn cards per match and select
one each time you respawn making it a
nice touch there's also the smart pistol
which essentially takes aiming out of
the picture at first it seems pretty bad
you have to give it a couple seconds to
lock on to another player before pulling
the trigger
however it's not too difficult to just
double jump and use your time following
to lock-on and wipe out your opponents
I've spent about 12 hours playing
titanfall split evenly between the Xbox
one and PC versions both run best locked
at 60 frames per second although the
Xbox one version does dip below that
when the action gets really crazy
usually when there's a giant Titan fight
titanfall is a ton of fun between the
Titans themselves the huge variety of
gameplay and even smaller things like
the addition of AI I'm sold but what do
you guys think are you planning on
picking up titanfall let me know in the
comments below anyway thank you guys so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
