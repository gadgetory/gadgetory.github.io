the hands-on of the Sony SmartWatch so
let's go ahead and take it away I'm
showing it to you here you are here you
can see it's a watch by pressing on it
you can see the first which is you see
is all the van widgets so I decided to
be updated on my calendar reminders sms
emails Facebook and Twitter if you
scroll to the right then you're able to
see the music player so maybe to control
my music from my phone from my smart
watch and then I'm also able to see the
weather if you press on it you actually
can see what the weather will be the
next few days twins up to go back let me
show you all the apps that we're going
to have at launch let me show you an
example the missed calls I was in a
meeting i couldn't take a call then you
have the possibility to press on it and
to call back and use your smart wireless
headset pro to call back or to send a
predefined SMS that I'm busy let me show
you as well the camera no my phone is in
my pocket that's why it's black but I
can take a picture from the distance it
took a picture and now I'm able to share
it on Facebook for example go back again
and then you can see you can see
endomondo we have a partnership was on
the mando's it's possible to find an app
on the android market through this
product so that you can use it as a
sports watch as well ki tell anything
about the specs what kind of like it
obviously runs android of some kind so
it's Bluetooth connected to you most to
your Android phone so it's compatible
with most on droid phones okay and
