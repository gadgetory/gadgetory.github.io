hands-on of safari five now actually
this one kind of slipped into the radar
that actually did not announce at WWDC
at the main keynote they asked a little
bit later and I guess nobody was really
paying attention so guys I'm go ahead
and show you guys a little bit about
safari five if you use the party for
this will be very very familiar but
there are a few pretty nice features so
the first one is well it's basically the
same but as you see here guys top sites
has taken a slight makeover as you can
see it's a little bit different colored
and thumbnails seem to be a little bit
wider and of course as always you can go
ahead and go into edit you can get rid
of them you can pin them down so I guess
I want to pin that one is you also do
small and load a ton up or going to
large and just add you know maybe six of
your favorites so that's that's pretty
cool but of course if you've ever used
safari for it should be very familiar
let's go ahead and go to a site and
squid goes injured so you can see you
guys it's still very very smooth you
know it's it's supposedly faster and I
have run a few preliminary speed tests
and they say it's as fast as they said
it's about three percent faster than
chrome but in my test that it's actually
somewhat somewhat slower than both
chrome and opera so maybe in their test
it's as fast as chrome but in all my
tests it wasn't it was behind by a
decent margin so Oh guys I wouldn't 100
trust that I will have to do a lot more
tests to figure out everything out but
when I know it is not quite as fast so
of course though guys it does work just
the same as you'd expect there are a
couple new features on so here I'm gonna
go ahead and actually go to this page
and if you see right here it has the
status bar i'll go ahead and refresh it
so you guys can watch it it now has the
status bar behind there which is
fantastic that was a really really good
feature of you know safari 3 you know of
course you can do it on the iphone as
well so i'm really glad they brought
that back but another really cool
feature is the reader so if we're going
to want to go ahead and hit this and you
can see it will pull up a custom page
will basically strip out all the other
stuff and just
do the standard guys know this isn't for
all websites but as you can see it's a
pretty nice thing so for example on this
page it's not that long this is just
talking about android 2.2 running on the
iphone but as you can see it's a pretty
nice feature it works a lot better when
you get into websites that you know
might have like six pages or whatever
and it will condense them all into the
reader view that's pretty good you can
also go ahead and do a couple things you
can go ahead just exit it you can print
this page which is going to be excellent
if you like to print pages and stuff
this is going to be perfect because you
go ahead and print I you know a very
sleek thing you're not going to be
pretty much ads and stuff so I'll be
good you go ahead and mail the page you
can also go ahead and zoom in so I can
go ahead and make the text really big or
go ahead and zoom out make it small as I
want I'm just kind of up to you go ahead
and get out so yeah guys there's not a
ton new as you can tell the interface is
almost the exact same I really wish they
would have put a new tab bar of course
you can go ahead and get a new tab by
clicking all the way over on the right
but would really have preferred they
would put something there that is really
annoying to have to go all the way over
there to get your tabs but guys that's
all for my first hands-on of safari five
guys is if you didn't like safari 4
there's really not a ton safari five
that you will like there are working on
some more things but to be honest just
for the basic stuff you know just
getting on you're doing basic web
browsing that kind of stuff it's
basically the same is a little bit
faster the reader is a nice touch but
beyond that it's basically the same so
guys go ahead and give it a try it is
i'll have the link to download it in the
description and of course it is for mac
and it is for pc so you know if you're
if you're interested go ahead and
download it anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
