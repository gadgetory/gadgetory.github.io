we're getting something a little bit
different than what I expected of course
there's the standard booths from Sony
from Microsoft Nintendo there's all the
new games that you would expect but what
I did not expect is talk about the next
generation of consoles it has been a
full five years since the PlayStation 4
and Xbox one were launched here at e3
2013 there been a lot of things they've
changed since then both consoles have
seen a slim revision we've seen stuff
like the PlayStation VR on the Sony side
as well as the death of Kinect on the
Microsoft side but really one of the
most important changes over the last few
years has been the addition of the mid
cycle console refreshes that's not a
great way of putting that but we've got
an Xbox 1x in a Playstation 4 Pro now
make sure there have been improved
consoles in the past stuff like these
Sega 32x add-on for the Genesis or the
Nintendo 64 expansion pack are cool but
they don't come anywhere close to the
same sort of level of functionality and
extra performance that we've gotten
added the One X and the ps4 pro then let
a lot of people myself included to
assume that this current generation
consoles would have quite a bit of life
left however here at e3 the next
generation has actually been mentioned a
couple times already it started on
Sunday night with the Bethesda
conference where they showed off not
only one but two brand new IPs that are
meant for next gen so they very briefly
teased the Elder Scrolls 6 which was
really just a tiny little trailer but
more impressively they also talked about
starfield
we have also been working on a brand new
next-generation single player game now
the trailer for starfield didn't exactly
give us a ton of gameplay but what it
did do is show off a game that as far as
I know is going to be meant only for the
next generation so that's actually sort
of not really what I was expecting out
of this e3
sure they're going to be forced new
consoles at some point in the future but
the idea that developers are already
showing off games that are meant to be
running on that means that it can't be
that far off or Kanaks unless Bethesda
is in the business of teasing a game
that won't be out for four or five years
which I guess I can't actually rule out
odds are we are going to be able to see
the next generation consoles in two or
three years and that was further backed
up by what microsoft said on stage on
their event on sunday the same team that
delivered unprecedented performance with
Xbox 1x
is deep into architecting the next Xbox
consoles now Phil Spencer didn't just
say there's going to be a new Xbox he
said they're going to be new Xboxes as
in like plural Nellie is this going to
be a pretty smart marketing move to get
people talking about the next generation
of Xbox but this combined with the fact
that Microsoft is actually purchasing
several major studios to sort of juice
up the Xbox game development means that
they're actually are doing a good job of
putting a lot of resources a lot of
money and more importantly a lot of hype
behind the next generation still though
it's really interesting to think that a
year ago d3 they were talking about the
Xbox one X and how I was about to come
out and now they've already moved on to
the next generation the rumor mill has
gone into overdrive since the
announcement so supposedly Microsoft is
working on codenamed scarlet which is
the series of next generation X boxes
now what these actually will look like
is kind of hard to say but we can take
some educated guesses on the other hand
it seems like Sony is perfectly content
to write out their sales leave with the
PlayStation 4 for a little while so in a
recent interview with The Wall Street
Journal the head of PlayStation John
Coderre was quoted as saying that the
next PlayStation is three years away
which would put it in 2021
so not exactly around the corner but it
is very clear at this point that both
Sony and Microsoft are well underway
developing the next generation of
consoles the real question is what do
those consoles actually look like so if
you look at the current generation of
consoles they're both based on very very
similar tech so both the ps4 and Xbox
one have an eight core AMD Jaguar base
CPU as well as Radeon graphics sure
there are some key differences so not
only does the ps4 utilize the much
faster gddr5 memory something that's
also shared now with the 1x but the ps4
also does have a more powerful GPU
however at their core they're sharing
the exact same AMD based fundamentals
the same holds true for the enhanced
versions of the consoles so both the ps4
pro and Xbox 1x are using very similar
layouts but with more memory bandwidth
bigger GPUs and higher clock speeds so
realistically what we're looking at is
another x86 processor that is very
likely going to be based on AMD Tech so
sure there are lots of other options
I'll get into those in just a minute but
I think the main takeaway here is that
by sticking with x86 nothing do you keep
backwards compatibility with previous
generation games something important for
both the one and the ps4 but importantly
it also makes developers lives much
easier when it comes to porting games
from the PC now backwards compatibility
is
the Xbox already does really well so now
this is the Xbox one support original
Xbox games and quite a few Xbox 360
titles
well you bump up to the One X you're
actually able to play some of those
games and a full 4k which is impressive
considering that's all happening with
emulation if you have the very very
similar sort of feature set and sort of
similar hardware in the next generation
of consoles that makes all this even
easier to keep up to date you can
imagine the next generation of Xbox
having full backwards compatibility and
that being a huge selling point sure you
can still go buy an Xbox one who I
bother when you can play an Xbox 2 that
will play all the same games and then
some right now the only company that can
deliver an experience like this is the
same one that did on the last generation
AMD so of course they have modern GPU
tech and especially in the next couple
years you can imagine that you're only
going to be able to get access to better
and better stuff but almost more
importantly than that they also have
some new high-end x86 CPU cores so with
the current generation using the very
slow mobile focus Jaguar cores I can
easily imagine a scenario in which the
next generation consoles are going to be
using AMD Rison especially if we really
are a couple years away from the next
generation of consoles it's very easy to
imagine a full eight core rise in CPU
setup inside a console APU
there are already some whispers that
rise in tech is being implemented in the
next gen of consoles so supposedly with
the Sony software that they're using on
the ps4 and presumably PS 5 there is now
going to be support for the timings of
the first generation rising processors
now that's cool but it's maybe not the
most exciting option take one look at
the Nintendo switch and you can see that
the next generation get takes several
forms make sure this is not going to be
as powerful as something like the ps4
Xbox one but the portability really does
unlock it to be something that is very
very different because Nintendo opted
for a mobile focus processor with the
NVIDIA Tegra x1 not only are you going
to be getting arm CPUs which are
typically shared with phones and tablets
but importantly you're also still
getting a high-end solution with Nvidia
graphics
again nothing that's going to be quite
as powerful as in the night be current
generation of consoles but the end of
the day graphics definitely aren't
everything sure the switch delivers a
decent chunk of the performance of the
current generation consoles at a
fraction of the power budget but I don't
think that means it's going to be a good
fit to go for this approach for the
PlayStation 5 as well as the Xbox 2 not
only has Nvidia taken the tegra line of
processors and a much more automotive
focus area mostly because they make a
lot of money there
even with a couple years of upgrades and
sort of performance improvements you
really still can't expect a mold
processor to come anywhere close to the
level of something that the PlayStation
4 pro or the Xbox 1x they sure at some
point we might see a mobile playstation
or a mobile Xbox but I don't think that
is going to be what the proper next
generation of consoles looks like on the
other hand we have Intel now sure they
do have the CPU technology and they are
working on dedicated graphics but that
is going to be several years away and it
is doubtful they're going to waste all
those resources on trying to put
together some bespoke version of a
console APU now yes there are lots of
possibilities but I think the smart
money is definitely on another fully AMD
solution for both the PS 5 as well as
the Xbox 2 I think it's very likely that
Sony is telling the truth well we'll
probably see a glimpse of the places you
find a little bit earlier it will likely
go on sale in 2021
Microsoft is more exciting the Xbox has
been beaten and beaten badly this
generation now sure they've made some
major strides in the last couple years
with stuff like backwards compatibility
as well as the Xbox one X at the end of
the day most estimates put the
PlayStation 4 outselling the one roughly
two to one and that is not easy to
overcome my best bet is we're going to
see the next generation of Xbox at the
next year's e3 now give us an early look
at something that would probably be
launching in 2020 a full year ahead of
the PlayStation 5 if everything goes
according to plan and by according to
plan I mean the plan that I just totally
made up on my head that is only vaguely
substantiated with real rumors and
speculation but it sounds good so so
between next-gen rise in tech and stuff
like game straining which is only going
to be more and more popular I do think
there's a lot of interesting stuff that
we're going to see over the next couple
years for the new consoles some curious
what do you guys think about what you
expect to find in the PlayStation 5 and
Xbox to let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
