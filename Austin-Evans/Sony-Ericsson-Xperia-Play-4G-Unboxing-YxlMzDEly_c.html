of the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play 4G and
this more commonly known as the
PlayStation phone has been around for
quite a while it was leaked it was
rumored and now of course it did come
out on Verizon in the United States and
now it is available on the AT&amp;amp;T 4G
network so squatting just jump straight
into the unboxing however there's one
thing I did want to point out though the
box over here and focus the camera a
little bit here for you guys will say
there are two little things right here
the first of which is a PlayStation
Certified handset which means that it
will be able to play some certain
PlayStation 1 games and some extras now
get into that a little bit into the
review a bit also the official mobile
handset of a major league gaming which I
thought was pretty funny of course major
league gaming is a pretty cool little
operation and you know to have actually
on the box the official handset it I
think is pretty cool they laid enough of
all this let's jump into the
unboxing itself so well open the box
itself here umm and right here we'll
actually have some paperwork so it looks
like a QuickStart guide we have the
phone itself which we can take a look at
in one second and let's pull back the
flap and see what all we have now this
but she does have come with quite a few
accessories so let's go ahead and take a
look first of all we do have the the
wall adapter so you just plug in the USB
here plug it into your wall wall outlet
for charging you also do have what
appear to be some yet some stereo
headsets so actually these look fairly
reasonable actually home looks super
cheap so definitely be giving those a
shot but here we go
alright so here we do have a dock for it
so it just plugs in like this looks like
a pretty reasonable dock and you just
plug in your charging as well as your
headphones so that's pretty cool little
addition that they did add into the
package so let's go ahead and jump keep
going here so we do have a 3.5
millimeter - 3.5 millimeter cable so we
can go ahead and plug this in example
from here to something else very nice
they include that and lastly but
certainly not least it does look like we
do have the cable which is micro USB
alright so let's go ahead and give you
guys a quick run around the phone so up
front here you guys will find the 4-inch
display is w VGA which is 480 by 800
very common for Android phones I'm along
the bottom here you'll find your for
Android and that capacitive but rather
physical buttons so you got your back
home
your menu as well as your search and
they are physical and force plants they
seem to be pretty solid up top here you
will find your front-facing camera I'm
flipping around on the back here you
guys will see the rear facing camera as
well as the flash I know this phone is
blue which I think actually looks pretty
good
very very different most phones these
days are you know black or white or gray
or something but I think the blue looks
pretty nice so coming up around on the
top here has to be able to see it does
have the l and r buttons which are used
for gaming i mention taylor sure what
this button does to try that out a
little bit later on the bottom here
there's not a whole lot of anything
flipping over to this side because to be
able to see your 3.5 milimeter headset
jack as well as your micro USB for
syncing and charging on the top here you
do have better on the right side you do
have your lock and unlock now of course
that's all fine great but there's no
real major difference between that and
any other phone what is different is
this this is the monthly playstation in
the whole whole point of this phone so
let's lock it back up so while we're
we'll leave it open so of course we do
have your d-pad here and at first glance
the d-pad does seem to be pretty
responsive and in fact where this pop
out of this I actually don't know
anything we also do have our PlayStation
buttons here you're selecting your start
I believe that's a Menu key and these
are going to be for controlling the
phone itself so rather than controlling
your game so kind of like virtual
joystick anyway guys it's going to be
about it for my unboxing of the Sony
Ericsson Xperia Play 4G you guys enjoyed
the video definitely be sure to leave it
a thumbs up and if you're interested in
