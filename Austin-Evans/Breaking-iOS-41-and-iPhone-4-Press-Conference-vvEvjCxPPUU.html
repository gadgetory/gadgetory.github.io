there are a couple really really huge
things if you follow Apple that happened
today the first of which is iOS 4.1 beta
has just been released so guys this is
for developers only so you know you
don't know don't start looking to update
your device for anything doesn't seem
like it's going to be a major update a
few things are does seem like a game
centers going to be a little bit improve
they're going to start to start to get
it ready for maybe a full release in 4.1
as well as the signal bars have been
fixed and when I say that fix just means
they're bigger and literally you guys
it's not a big deal it you know if you
have if you're having problems why phone
for this is not going to help anything
the bars will look better suppose
they'll be more accurate but if you're
still dropping calls whatever it's not
going to help you now guys 4.1 will
probably be out in the next week or two
so guys absolutely absolutely do not
upgrade to it no don't if you can't get
on right now only for your developer of
you know you don't really care about
jailbreaking but guys watch out for we
will probably have that as soon as it
comes out spirit and you know all the
other jailbreaks will probably come out
pretty soon so guys just keep an eye out
for that and if you have an iphone four
guys check out the link in the
description it's a tutorial on how to
get your SHSH blobs on four-point-oh guy
that's very important if you don't have
that you won't be able to get back to
four point oh and if a jail big jail but
it comes out it's not working on 4.1
you'll be out of luck now guys continue
along with the iphone 4 News this is
even bigger I think is that Apple has
just announced that there will be a
press conference at this friday so
talking about the iphone 4 that's all
they say they don't say what it's about
this is guys this is not going to be
good news for Apple it might be good
news for the rest of us basically of
course the death grip and you know
losing reception is bin just getting
bigger and bigger and bigger so apples
finally going to make a press conference
they're going to talk about it what
they're going to say who knows maybe
doing I start giving away free bumpers
maybe they're going to know not
surprised cut a redesigned iphone form
you know a recall maybe Steve Jobs going
to talk for an hour about how to hold
iphone 4
I don't know but guys definitely stay
tuned again check out the description i
will be going live during the entire
event I don't have the exact time off
the top of my head just of course check
the description I'll have everything you
need in there but guys you can go ahead
if you're interested in seeing you know
that up to the second news of what's
going on i'll be live streaming the
whole thing so you know Apple NASA's
that you know everyone who bought an
iphone 4 gets all their money back or
what or who knows guys but definitely

going to be big and of course i will
