reporting live from CES 2013 at the
nikon boost to take a look at some of
their new cameras they announced a new
DSLR as well as a couple of new one
series compact so let's take a look to
start once we have the nikon s1 this is
a new lower end of the one series and it
starts only 4 or $99
now for starters that this look is a
couple of features from the others but
it still does have a 10 megapixel camera
so of course all the other features
including 1080p video a lot kind of
stuff as you guys can see here the kit
lens everything is all the same color so
for example there's green there other
different colors you can choose from the
other camera is the Nikon j-3 now this
adds a couple of extra features so for
example it does have a higher resolution
921,000 LCD which is definitely good
looks much better for in framing and all
that kind of fun stuff you also do have
a mode dial up top which again morphic
manual controls are great but the big
deal here is the fact that it does have
a 14 megapixel sensor so 10 megapixels
is definitely usable and a lot of people
think that you need more when you really
don't but having those extra 4
megapixels is definitely going to be a
nice thing to have both these cameras
will be on sale in early February
so the s1 will be going for $4.99 and
the j-3 going for $599 both with kit
lenses the other major camera announce
of the show is the nikon d50 200 now of
course the d50 100 was their kind of
middle range DSLR and is the newer
version of that so this F several key
features from the GD 5100 so for example
you have this tilty flipping screens for
example I could shoot low or high or
whatever I want to do and on top of that
also does have a brand new 24 megapixel
CMOS sensor so still crop sensor but
still 24 megapixels
I believe it's probably the same as the
D 3200 and 900 sure but regardless if it
is like the D 31 is you can expect some
very nice performance now this will be
on sale a little bit later on this year
for about $8.99 and then guys it's gonna
be about it if you enjoyed definitely be
sure to leave this video a thumbs up and
subscribe for more CES 2013 content
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
