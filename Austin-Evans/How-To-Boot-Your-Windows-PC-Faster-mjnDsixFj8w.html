I'm here with the video that should be
pretty helpful to a lot of you guys this
is going to be how to boot your Windows
PC much faster in addition to allowing
you to free up RAM free up system
resources and in general hopefully make
a computer just a little bit speedy and
just you know just speed up some anyway
let's get this one started
okay guys so I'm going to be showing you
a very simple trick that should really
speed up your computer and really speed
up the boot times now this doesn't
matter i recommend if you've never done
this board do it on any computer it
doesn't matter if you bought it today or
if you've had it for five years doesn't
really matter um because this really
kind of just keeps your computer from
loading all kinds of programs that you
really don't want it to be so it's very
simple we should be I mean just two
minutes you not download anything it's
just really simple okay now if you're
running XP I need you to open up run
okay you know just go into your Start
menu and open up run if you're running
vista or windows 7 all i have to do is
just hit the Windows key and then you
should already have the start search
down here okay so regardless of whether
you an XP or windows vista / 7 i'm going
to need you type in this m/s c 0 n f IG
okay punch that in and then open up ms
config okay now you will see a little
system configuration window now don't
worry this is going to be very simple
don't worry about you know messing
something up okay so you're going to
need to go over to the fourth tab just
start up okay now let's go ahead and
just stretch it out so go ahead and
stretch out the you see the startup item
so you can actually really see what
you're looking at okay now what we're
going to be doing here is deleting some
startup items not to kind of explain
what I mean by this what it does is a
mini programs when they're installed on
your computer whether they came
installed on your computer or you
download them like itunes etc will want
to run automatically when you start up
sometimes this is good so you know you
don't have to actually open something up
it's already running in the background
as soon as you turn on your computer but
the problem is that takes up not only
your time you know it could take 10
seconds to load a program that you might
not necessarily be wanting to open and
you might not even know about it
and to it also can just gobble up ram
can you know slow your computer down I
mean sometimes there's programs that you
really didn't know that you had or you
don't really need and the thing is you
don't you're not deleting the programs
you're just not having them
automatically open that what all it is
is that if you click let's say like you
have itunes not start then if itunes
won't start at the beginning when you
boot your computer but if you click
itunes it'll come right up it's just
that you're instead of you know spending
two or three minutes loading all these
programs when you first turn on your
computer you're loading them after if
you need them okay so now at this point
um just go ahead and just deselect as
many startup items as you can safely now
some obviously you're going to need to
stay like Windows Defender you know some
different things like audio and you know
different drivers and that sort of thing
like obviously you know you don't want
to deselect Windows operating system
that might be bad but you just go go
down through go through stuff that you
know if you don't know what it does if
you mean you know some things like you
know like this control center which runs
graphics that sort of thing if you're
not one hundred percent sure what is
might just want to leave it alone but
you come down here like here I've got
this backup thing I don't really ever
use this power DVD program I don't need
that quick time I don't need that you
know steam my web my webcam program none
of that stuff I really need when i boot
up my computer if I need to I can open
and run it up but I don't need I mean
I'd much rather you know save 45 seconds
by not opening any these programs and
just you know open one or two and you
know wait an extra two seconds for them
to load some of the guys that was just a
really simple video on how to speed up
your windows pc booting as well as just
general day-to-day use you know it's
really simple I know some of you guys
might have already done this but it's a
really simple way to really not only
speed up your computer but just you know
quit spending all this time and all this
effort loading all these junk
programs that you probably don't even
need anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
