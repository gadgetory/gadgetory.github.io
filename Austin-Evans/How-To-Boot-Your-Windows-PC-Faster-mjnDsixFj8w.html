today I'm here with the video that
should be pretty helpful to a lot of you
guys this is going to be how to boot
your Windows PC much faster in addition
to allowing you to free up RAM free up
system resources and in general
hopefully make a computer just a little
bit speedier and just you know just
speed up some anyway let's get this one
started
okay guys so I'm going to be showing you
a very simple trick that should really
speed up your computer and really speed
up the boot times now this doesn't
matter I recommend if you've never done
this before do it on any computer it
doesn't matter if you bought it today or
if you've had it for five years doesn't
really matter because this really kind
of just keeps your computer from loading
all kinds of programs that you really
don't want it to be so it's very simple
we should be I mean just two minutes you
want download anything it's just really
simple okay
now if you're running XP I need you to
open up run okay you know just go into
your Start menu and open up run if
you're running Vista or Windows 7 all I
have to do is just hit the Windows key
and then you should already have to
start search down here okay
so regardless of whether you an XP or
Windows Vista slash seven I'm going to
need you to type in this M s c-- o-- n f
IG okay punch that in and then open up
the MS config okay now you will see a
little system configuration window now
don't worry this is gonna be very simple
don't worry about you know messing
something up okay so you're gonna need
to go over to the fourth tab just
startup okay now let's go ahead and just
stretch it out so go ahead and stretch
out the you see the startup item so you
can actually really see what you're
looking at okay now what we're going to
be doing here is deleting some startup
items not to kind of explain what I mean
by this why did it does is mini programs
when they're installed on your computer
whether they came installed on your
computer or you download them like
iTunes etc will want to run
automatically when you start up
sometimes this is good so you know you
don't have to actually open something up
it's already running in the background
as soon as you turn on your computer but
the problem is that takes up not only
your time you know it could take ten
seconds to load up a program that you
might not necessarily be wanting to open
and you might not even know about it
and to it also can just gobble up Ram
you can you know slow your computer down
I mean sometimes there's programs that
you really didn't know that you had or
you don't really need and the thing is
you don't you're not deleting the
programs you're just not having them
automatically open that what all it is
is that if you click let's say like you
have iTunes not start then if I choose
won't start at the beginning when you
boot your computer but if you click
iTunes it'll come right up it's just
that your instead of you know spending
two or three minutes loading all these
programs when you first turn on your
computer you're loading them after if
you need them okay so now at this point
you just go ahead and just deselect as
many startup items as you can safely
now some obviously you're going to need
to stay like Windows Defender you know
some different things like audio and you
know different drivers and that sort of
thing like obviously you know you don't
want to deselect Windows operating
system that might be bad but you just go
go down through go through stuff that
you know if you don't know what it does
if you mean you know some things like
you know like this control center which
runs the graphics that sort of thing if
you're not a hundred percent sure what
it is you might just want to leave it
alone but you come down here like here
I've got this backup thing I don't
really ever use this power DVD program I
don't need that quick time I don't need
that you know
steam my web my webcam program none of
that stuff I really need when I boot up
my computer if I need to I can open and
run it up but I don't know I mean I'd
much rather you know save 45 seconds by
not opening any of these programs and
just you know open one or two and you
know wait an extra two seconds for them
to load so my guys that was just a
really simple video on how to speed up
your Windows PC booting as well as just
general day-to-day use you know it's
really simple I know some of you guys
might have already done this but it's a
really simple way to really not only
speed up your computer but just you know
quit spending all this time and all this
effort loading all these junk
programs that you probably don't even
need anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
