talking about the best places to
purchase the ipad 2 as well as what's
going on with the whole sony versus geo
hot saga so force earlier this week
Apple announced the brand new ipad to
the successor to the very popular ipad
now there's a lot to like about the ipad
2 and i'm sure that it's going to sell
really really well however they did kind
of a little bit of bad news as far as
the fact that you cannot pre-order it so
if you do want go ahead purchase one
this friday on the release day you're
going to have to go stand in line and a
variety of different places or of course
you can order it and wait a few days for
it to come in for shipping but i'm sure
a lot of people want to get it on the
release date so there are a few
different places you can purchase it let
me go ahead and roll you guys to it so
number one is going to be the apple
store apple stores probably going to be
your best bet odds are gonna have the
widest selection the good plug and had
the most inventory so if you have an
apple store in your area it's not really
a big deal to have to go find one i
definitely recommend try that first now
the apple stores is going to be opening
at five o'clock this friday so do keep
in mind that they're probably going to
be a considerable line no matter any of
these places but so if you can get there
a little bit early it probably will help
you out so apple store going to be the
number one place to go now best buy is
also going to be carrying it i know i'm
not entirely sure they haven't announced
as far as like when they're opening or
anything like that but i can't imagine
that you'll be able to get it any sooner
than at the apple store so i probably
expect five o'clock same deal they might
have a little bit better deals or
anything like that as far as like when
they open and all that kind of stuff but
if you have a best buy a public going to
be your second best bet now your last
option is going to be walmart now this
one is kind a little bit sketchy you're
not probably going to be able to pick up
the ipad just any walmart now they
haven't announced you know what will
marks or anything like that so your best
bet is to go call your local walmart if
you don't have the best buy you don't
have an apple store near you call you
walmart see if they will be having it
I'm and all that kind of stuff and see
what times and all that kind of good
stuff but although on the other hand
there is one good thing if you do
purchase it at walmart you gotta save a
whopping one dollar so if you want to
take that dollar definitely check out
walmart now something that's been a lot
of people's minds but lots of talk and
lots of speculation about it is the
whole sony versus geo hot legal battle
so if you're not familiar with it G what
is a really well-known hacker
he's mostly known from the iphone he's
hacked the original iphone jailbroken
pretty much everything else sends a very
very talented hacker nobody can deny
that well recently he turned his
attention to Sony in the PlayStation 3
when they removed other ausa port which
of course was the support to allow you
to install linux on your playstation 3
well he took a look at it not too much
longer he totally cracked the
PlayStation 3 wide open now obviously as
you might expect Sony was not pleased
with this whatsoever and they decided to
go ahead and Sue gio hot ah now this
really comes down to the fact of whether
or not you actually own your video game
console so for in the example of the
iphone back in a couple of years ago
when he first started jailbreaking it
Apple was very similar they never
actually out right sue them but he
definitely if we were not happy with
jailbreaking however recently with the
DMCA it has been rewritten slightly it
allowed actually that anyone can you can
modify jailbreak your mobile phone no
problem at all which made jailbreaking
perfectly legal however a phone and a
PlayStation obviously a game console or
two very different things and so it's
kind of a little bit unclear of whether
it actually that is okay or not and
that's obviously what this whole court
cases to decide whether or not ji Hye's
was in the right or whether he was in
the wrong it any rate I'm very curious
to know what you guys think about this
so do you support Sony you support geo a
lot or somewhere in the middle
definitely sure to leave your thoughts
in the comments below okay so for the
second segment of d3 live I'm going to
be taking live questions from the chat
as always every episode of e3 live is
filmed in front of log TV we have well
over 50 people in the room right now so
let's just take a couple of questions
what do I think Sony wants from Gio hot
I think Sony doesn't really want
anything in particular I think Sony
mostly wants to scare people away from
me I know I mean they've put down
ordered like to have the the jailbreak
code removed but that's why way out of
the bag I mean it's been copied a
million times across the internet so
that's not going to happen I don't
really think that Sony will really
particularly wants to punish you hot I
mean I don't think that's going to
accomplish anything what suddenly really
wants to do is scare off other people if
they can win this other hackers going to
think twice about trying to jailbreak or
anything like that as far as how
effective will be I've got no idea I
don't think it'll be particularly be
that helpful I think that's pretty much
Sony's goal um do I think the iPad will
be jailbroken probably uh you know the
iPads pretty much always do broken same
with iphone ipod touch it's just a
matter of time between how long it's
going to be so yeah I wouldn't really
worry about you know like if but
probably more like it was gonna be like
a week or a month or two months at
whatever like that um well be getting an
ipad 2 most likely yeah I had a hard
person to decide whether I'm going to
get an hour later but almost definitely
I will be getting an ipad in the next
month or so so yeah I'm planning on
doing it um do you think apple will
still try to do their best to stop
jailbreaking yeah now that that's one
thing is they have full rights to stop
jailbreaking because technically
jailbreaking is you know exploiting a
security hole in the iphone the ipod or
whatever like that and actually you know
injecting code now obviously when people
jailbreak that's you know you're doing
it now you want that to happen or
anything but it's pretty much the same
way is if you know what I was on my
Windows computer and I used a virus to
change something I mean it's a little
different than that but yeah and pretty
much Apple has the full rights to you
know close up the jailbreaking holes
that's no problem at all and nobody
really you know is all that particularly
mad I mean if Apple really wanted to
stop jailbreaking I think the best thing
would do is just allow people to
sideload apps like city I think that
will do better than you know just trying
to crack down jailbreaking which pretty
much doesn't do anything um this is why
does jailbreaking slow down your device
this is a question I get a ton on the
way to think of jailbreaking on iphone
or you know an iPad or anything like
that is basically imagining turning it
into a PC it's very similar as far as
you can run programs ops tweaks mods all
that kind of stuff so you know if you
had your pc and you stripped all the
programs and everything out of it and
just ran its talk it's going to be
pretty fast but as soon as you start you
know downloading programs and themes and
all that kinda stuff is going to start
slowing down well its exact same way for
your iPhone or your iPad as you
jailbreak and you know you install cool
tweaks and themes and mozz all that kind
of stuff that's going to slow your
device down so jailbreaking itself
really shouldn't slow it down but as
long as you just do it in moderation
don't you know download 50 themes not
kind of stuff you just keep it kind of
you know basic and you know keep it to
the minimum
mount that you can you know appreciate
not that kind of stuff and you should be
good to go anyway guys that's it for
