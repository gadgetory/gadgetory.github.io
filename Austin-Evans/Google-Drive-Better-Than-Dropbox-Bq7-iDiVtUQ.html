video going over Google Drive so this is
all about is it's kind of like a mix
between Google Docs and Dropbox so when
you're first set everything up it'll
automatically bring in all your Google
Docs and no worries there everything
works just as you would expect over the
major difference is that you can now
sync all kinds of files and folders
across your different devices so this
setup you just need to grab the app so
on Android all you need to do is just
get it from the Google Play Store and on
OS 10 or Windows you can just as soon as
you go to drive Google calm when you
first set everything up there'll be a
button where you can go ahead and
download a little application and once
you get everything set up it's very
similar to Dropbox so you get a new
folder on your device so it's going to
be called of course Google Drive and
everything inside here is automatically
synced across all your different devices
and of course your Google Drive account
when you first set it up it will
download all the files from your Google
Drive account into the folder now of
course you can kind of change it in the
settings and you know if you want to
only sync certain files or folders you
can do that but by default it will just
grab everything and of course it will
include all your google docs so for
example I can access any of these
offline if I like but it's not limited
to that you can pretty much upload any
kind of file format you like so here's
an mp3 but again there's no real
restrictions as far as that goes but the
real cool thing is is of course it will
keep everything synced so go ahead just
grab an image here and drag it in to my
Google Drive account you know see
there's a little syncing thing on the
bottom left here and I will go ahead and
upload it to my Google Drive account
this is done right where it is right now
let's go ahead and switch back over and
take a look so let's just search for it
so ran and ban it already has shown up
so BAM so you guys can see you're just
that fast we took a picture that was on
this computer and brought it into the
Google Drive account and as soon as
we've done that we can do pretty much
anything else we want so we can go ahead
and sync it to another perhaps I may be
an Android phone a tablet a Mac PC
pretty much anything you want to do once
you have a file upload to Google Drive
you have a few different options as far
as sharing goes so all you do is go
ahead click on the little check mark and
hit on this button here and now you have
a sharing menu so by default it's only
accessible to you but if you'd like you
can add other Gmail users or if you want
to go ahead and just change the whole
privacy settings overall you can go
ahead and make it totally public so
anyone with the link can grab it or you
can do just anyone with a link so kind
of make it unlisted you can also search
your files into folders so what you do
is you create a new one so for let's
just say video
and then you can drag-and-drop whatever
you like so let's just grab this drag
into the video folder and bain't we're
all good to go so it just kind of helps
you if you want to sync specific folders
you just kind of keep everything a
little bit more organized on top of that
you can also sort so for example you can
do it by quota used now typically Google
Docs do not take up any of your storage
space however you upload anything so for
example music pictures video pretty much
anything that you upload will take up
some of your storage Google Drive comes
with five gigabytes of free storage
however you can expand that up to
twenty-five gigabytes for two dollars
and fifty cents a month and 100
gigabytes for five dollars a month so
it's a little bit more expensive that it
used to be however it's not half bad
especially considering that you can go
ahead and expand it all the way out to
16 terabytes if you guys are interested
in trying out Google Drive for yourself
I will link in the description it's
simply Drive Google com so overall I
like it a lot
I think it's not all that different from
Dropbox but doesn't really need to be
Dropbox is great and having everything
synced into your Google account is gonna
be really nice for a lot of people
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
