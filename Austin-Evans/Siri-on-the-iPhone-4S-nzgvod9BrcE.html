Siri on the iPhone 4s so without further
ado let's just jump straight into it to
activate Siri you just need to hold down
the home button Siri what's the weather
going to be like in New York City on
Friday so there we go so you guys can
see here it was actually really quite
fast now the way Siri works is that it's
record your voice and saying whatever
you want it sends it to an apple server
and then comes back to the iPhone and as
you can see here I do have Wi-Fi
disabled I am just over Verizon 3G so
that worked really quite fast you hasn't
see here
Siri what's the weather be like in New
York City and because stutter a little
bit there so let's try something else
what is pi so just add a little math
question here nothing is going to answer
it okay there we go alright so what it
does here is if we scroll to the bottom
you guys see here it will pull
information from Wolfram Alpha an
absolutely fantastic site so we have so
we have exactly what pi is which only
goes so far unfortunately but hey if we
can we can't ask miracles from the -
Flores all right so we can ask a couple
of other questions
Siri what is your name those you can see
here you can actually ask it some funny
questions it's not just like it you know
you have to ask it like specific things
like voice control used to be like you
can ask it all kinds of things so let's
go ahead and ask another one Siri tell
me about this iPhone 4s and as you guys
can see here it opens up a Google search
and iPhone 4s so there's a lot of things
we can do but let's go ahead and
continue on so let's go ahead and say
we're gonna send a text message
let's try that Siri send a text message
to ty moss how are you liking your
iPhone 4s so far question mark I think
we should do some more videos on it
period so cancel the analytic heard
there anyway there we go cancel but if
we scroll up you guys can see here well
it put a keeper stamp on it
Vizio see it actually did it perfectly
another way to do it when you're
dictating text is that you do need to go
ahead and tell it like question mark
period comma that kind of thing but it
does work really quite well so you guys
this has been a quick demo of Siri on
the iPhone 4s now forth there is a lot
more that it can do I could probably sit
here for a couple hours doing all kinds
of different things on it but I
definitely have been pretty impressed
with it so far and yeah who knows I
might do some more videos if I find it
says something really funny or anything
like that so anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave a
thumbs up really does help me out and if
you're interested in more iPhone 4s
videos definitely be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
