state of jailbreak video so today I'm
going to be talking about to new updates
for 4.1 jailbreaking programs so the
first one is going to be redsnow zero
point nine point six so this latest
version of red snow will jailbreak iOS
4.1 on the iphone 3g and now ipod touch
2nd generation so if you have one of
these two devices you will be able to be
fully jailbroken on 4.1 however there is
one thing that you will need to know and
that if you have as MC model of the ipod
touch 2nd generation you will be a
tethered jailbreak it will be a tethered
jailbreak i'm sure most of you guys know
I telling jailbreak is if not basically
every time you go to show off your ipod
not like you know you're not just
shutting off like blocking it but
actually fully shutting off like this
when you actually get the slide to power
off either that or the battery runs out
anytime that happens you will need to go
ahead and plug it into a computer and
rerun redsnow so basically you're
tethered to a computer you know any time
it shuts off you go ahead and plug it in
and rerun it so for that reason I really
don't recommend tethered jailbreak
especially because there is going to be
a new jailbreak coming out soon however
if you have an env model or the iphone
3g i say definitely go for it it's a
really good jailbreak it will enable
multitasking background wallpaper all
that kind of good stuff so definitely if
you have an iPhone or from 3g or ipod
touch stranger ation i say go for it
unfortunately it is Mac only for the
moment so I actually have not been able
to do a tutorial because I do not have a
mac but if you have a Mac you can go and
do it right now if you have a Windows
computer like me the latest redsnow
update will be ported over probably any
day now I think all that we're waiting
on is just a couple of bugs to defects
so pretty good news there definitely
like red snow a lot and i will make a
tutorial on when it comes out the next
thing i want to talk about is snowbreeze
2.0 so this one actually is more of a
warning and i really cannot recommend to
anybody relate to use snowbreeze right
now basically the main reason is is that
it is not really working for most people
including myself so yeah I think
snowbreeze will be able to be fixed I
think
as I hate snow was able to work out some
of the bugs because you know any time I
tried it and quite as long with quite a
few other people itunes premature always
gave some sort of error and of course
guys you know me I'm really big into
jailbreaking so I pretty much tried
everything I could I downgraded to
several different firmwares jailbroke on
all of them put my ipod to dfu mode I
know how many times I've tried pretty
much every trick that I could think of
still it was not enough to go ahead and
get snow buries to work so guys really
do not recommend to use snowbreeze right
now especially because it's pretty
complicated for example like if you have
an iphone 3gs new bootrom and you try to
do the method for the old bootrom you
can actually go ahead and set into a dfu
mode loop which is never good because
that's actually kind of a kind of a big
deal so guys definitely do you want to
recommend stay away from snow buries to
a point over right now now once I hate
snow is able to go ahead picks it all up
and I've actually once I'm able to test
it once i actually do see it works just
fine i absolutely will make a tutorial
show you guys how to do it but in the
meantime do want to recommend that you
guys stay away from it so anyway guys
that's pretty much it i just want to let
talk talk to you let you a little bit
know a little bit about the latest two
updates now course there's going to be
another jailbreak i know it's kind of
hard to keep track of all this there's
going to be another jailbreak here
hopefully the next week two weeks maybe
a month i don't know it's the chronic
dev team as well as the iphone dev team
are working on and this one is going to
be the shadow jailbreak or there's a lot
of different names greenpoison and this
one will jailbreak pretty much
everything should be a pretty simple
jailbreak so you know if you can't
jailbreak right now on snowbreeze or you
don't have a device that supported by
redsnow don't worry the next jailbreak
will be coming fairly soon and I of
course will make a full tutorial as soon
as it's available so anyway that's
pretty much it just wanted to give you
some updates like keep you all in the
loop you know I always like to sew these
stay of jailbreak videos are for to keep
everyone informed you know I get a lot
of questions and stuff like hey does
this work hate is that work so always
one quite just do it in video form to
answer everybody all at once and you
know even somebody who didn't know so
guys that's pretty much it and I'd like
to thank you for watching was kind of
long and rambling sort of video I just
had a lot to get through
and yeah so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
