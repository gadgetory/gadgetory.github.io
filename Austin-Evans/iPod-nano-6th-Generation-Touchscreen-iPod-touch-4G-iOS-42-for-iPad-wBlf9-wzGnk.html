of the recent Apple event so honestly
just finished up roughly about 45
seconds ago so I'd only what I'd give
you guys the full rundown thing and now
there's a ton of new stuff a lot of it
looks really great something didn't look
so great but I'm go ahead and just tell
you guys about everything they announced
so the first thing absolutely has to be
the new iPods and actually a little bit
surprising they refreshed every single
iPod which basically looks like the
standard iPod shuffle from the second
generation just a little bit smaller so
they do now have a full bug all the
buttons everything back I like that but
it's not a huge deal you actually will
be able to go ahead and take it for $49
though that's pretty good now moving on
we do have to also clean new iPod Nano
now the new iPod Nano is a huge
departure from the standard one as it
now is a sole either they lost all the
click wheel and now it's totally touch
based now this one actually I think it
looks really cool on now they actually
did not say it but looking at the OS I
almost have no doubt that it is actually
based off of iOS 4 at least they you
know of course they very cut-down
version so it does have a multi-touch
screen it does have a clip on the back
and it is a really really cool looking
device now this one's actually going to
be $149 for the a gigabyte $179 for the
16 gigabyte and it doesn't come in quite
a few different colors so I'm really
impressed with the name I think they did
a good job there now moving on to what
was definitely in my opinion the biggest
thing the new iPod touch and pretty much
take all those rumours that we heard
about you know Maya this that they
pretty much added it all so to start out
with its redesigned so it's even thinner
which I didn't think was really possible
but it's even thinner it does have a
full 720p HD the same camera from the
iPhone 4 on it
it now has a front-facing FaceTime
camera it has the Apple a4 processor
with the gyroscope it has the Retina
display really guys it has pretty much
everything and the really cool thing is
it's actually not that much more
expensive on so they did tweak the
prices just a little bit but I want to
be honest actually the price technically
it went down a little bit now you can
get an 8 gigabyte models for $239 or 229
rather you can go ahead and get the 32
for $2.99 and the 64 for 399 now first
things that it looks like it actually
you know the base model is now 229
instead of to a 199 but the main
difference was is that if you go today
and buy one for 199 that's the second
generation not a third generation so
technically the third generation iPod
started at $300 so now the fourth
generation iPod actually starts at 2:30
so in my opinion no that's that's a
really solid deal you only do get 80
gigabytes of storage but for most people
including myself because I have a 8
gigabyte iPod Touch I've used for
several years and I never even come
close to filling up so you get a
gigabytes you get of course the Retina
display the cameras the all the all the
really great stuff including that really
freely thin body now of course I don't
know you know it depends on here which
one's the best you know thirty two is
definitely not a bad way to go for not
that much more money but it does kind of
depend but aha I was really impressed
with the ipod touch now moving on for
the last little bit of hardware was the
new Apple TV so it is still going to be
remained the Apple TV and to be honest I
was a little on the fence about it
a lot of the rooms we heard such like it
would be Iowa's beige and some things
like that we're not true it is going to
be just pretty much the interface has
been tweaked some but it does look
fairly similar to the current Apple TV
um however they did do quite a few
different changes now instead of having
a hard drive it actually is really
focused on renting so you actually don't
buy things on the Apple TV you strange
stuff from your computer and you can
rinse stuff but you actually like I said
if you don't buy and download stuff so
it's a little bit odd but of course all
you media that you do have bought on
your computer you can't go ahead and
string so that's pretty good now it
actually is much much smaller than the
outgoing Apple TV and one of the major
things about though because of course
there are a lot of different things such
as you know it does Netflix and YouTube
some things like that but my major thing
got really takeaways for two things one
it's smaller so that's always really
good it's much much smaller out a
quarter of the size of the Crone Apple
TV but the main thing was the price the
new Apple TV will only come down on at a
100 I'm sorry $900 $99 so really for the
price it's really really solid and I
know I say really less hot a lot but
honestly I think for the money that's a
really really good deal and you can't of
course do a lot of TV shows so actually
from ABC and Fox you can go ahead and
get $0.99 high-definition rentals with
no ads so I think that's pretty decent
so
if you're in the market for an Apple TV
or something similar to that you know
maybe a Google TV or something
non-dollars gonna be really hard to be
so there are also a couple other things
as far as on the software side so we do
have iOS 4.1 which is going to be coming
for the iPhone iPod Touch next week now
this book one's gonna bring quite a few
improvements it should speed at the
iPhone 3G there actually should be
there's going to be a new HDR or camera
option where actually will take multiple
pictures and put them together to make a
better looking image so that's
definitely nice
it also will come with Game Center
pre-installed so game centers finally
coming and they're also going to be a
couple bug fixes such as the proximity
and the Bluetooth issues should be fixed
in four point one now this is going to
be coming for all the devices that are
currently on 4.0 so this iPod Touch
first generation and the first
generation iPhones still left out but
for all the devices that already are on
4.0 they will be updated next week for
free
in addition 4.2 they also talked about
it in which you will be coming for all
devices including the iPad now 4.2 is
not a major update it's mostly for the
iPad there's just a couple of smaller
things for the iPhone and iPod Touch
including airplay really quickly airplay
allows you to go ahead and take your
music photos and media all kind of stuff
and string from one device to the other
over Wi-Fi which is really great so for
example let's say I'm looking at you
know I'm watching movie on my iPod Touch
I can go ahead with a clean little click
of a button shoot it over to my Apple TV
and continue watching you there so
that's pretty cool but really the main
part of 4.2 is really the iPad and well
just like me on iOS looks really just
giant on the iPad screen so does all the
4.0 obviously 4.2 improvements so you're
gonna go ahead and be able to do
multitasking with the same sort of
interface folders all that kind of stuff
but one interesting thing about the iPad
though is it actually now has wireless
printing so one little cool thing like I
said about the printing is that you
actually as long as you do have a
wireless printer you can go ahead and
send documents from pages I'm sure
they'll be tethered maybe like from
Safari and stuff like that we can go
ahead and you send straight to your
printer and actually just have a fairly
robust printing application so
definitely a really nice thing I'm glad
that they finally did decide to go ahead
and update the iPad now only problem
with that though is that you will have
to wait
till November for four points you to
come out so for all devices but mostly
for iPad because this is really the one
that needs it you will have to wait for
November but once the rumor comes around
and does get on 4.2 shouldn't be too bad
so the last thing I'm gonna go ahead and
talk about iTunes 10 I'm so yeah like I
say guys they have announced a lot of
stuff it was pretty much non-stop the
entire conference um so basically I just
10 is actually available for download
today currently it's not but I will
actually have a video later on give you
guys a tour of it ages 10 is available
as of today and it brings some new
features but mostly it is the same on
the actually redesigned icon which and
that's so I'm not so I think pleased
about I think old one looks better but
they redesigned the icon some of the
views are a little bit different but
mostly the everything is really really
similar the major difference that is in
iTunes 10 is the fact that they new hat
now have a new sort of them social media
it's actually somewhat similar to little
similar to Twitter checks you go ahead
and you know follow your favorite
musicians or even your friends and stuff
see what your friends are buying stuff
like that personally I'm not really all
that soul on it it's gonna be built into
iTunes and you can go ahead and access
it from iPhones and iPod touches as well
as the iPad but I know it just doesn't
seem like it just seems like apples are
kind of trying it well I have to try it
out and really you know get to using it
but really from first glance it just
kind of looks a little bit generic I'm
cinema guys that's my full wrap-up of
the app to the Apple September 2010
event they asked a ton of stuff but what
I'm really looking forward to probably
is the iPod Nano I think that looks
great the iPod Touch looks fantastic in
my opinion and the Apple TV's not too
bad either so actually if you want to go
ahead an Apple TV what it's going to be
going on sale in about four weeks so
about the end of the month and the all
the new iPods will be available next
week we actually have an exact date that
they will be available next week and all
these things all the new hardware is
actually available for pre-order today
so it's really great guys definitely
definitely leave in the comments what
are you looking forward to what what now
what are these you want to go ahead and
get what are you interested in what you
don't like definitely leave all your
thoughts and opinions
I'm really curious to know anyway guys
