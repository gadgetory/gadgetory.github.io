and it is a fully modular smartphone
what's different about this is unlike
something like the essential or the moto
Z which is more about adding things to
your phone to get more functionality
with the fairphone say something like
the screen breaks or the camera is
outdated the idea is that you can
literally just pop the screen out and
put into an end without having to throw
away your phone open this guy up and we
see the fairphone itself which actually
looks really cool so idea here is that
you should be able to very very easily
swap parts out so now let me take out
the battery but there are actually a
couple of tabs on the bottom so if we
flip these back in theory or she's done
this before but we can just pop the
screen right off seriously I just unbox
the phone and took the screen out in
like eight seconds with the screen gone
we can get access to several other
modules so up top here we have the
headphone jack as well as the
front-facing camera we have the main
camera module here we also have the
speaker as well as the microUSB cable on
the back so it's cool about the
fairphone is that there are seven
different modules that you can buy and
so say something breaks or you just want
to upgrade it you can pretty much buy
all of them on the fair film site this
would be the first time that I've
completely taken a phone apart before if
you can finish the emboss so with just a
couple screws we have the camera out of
the phone so what they're doing here is
actually have these little pins that are
on the actual camera itself I assume
that these are the same pins that go on
all of the other different modules to
connect things so that I believe is the
fairphone fully broken down so this is
what I believe they call the core module
so inside here is where you have stuff
like the CPU the radios all that kind of
stuff
but when you look at it like this it's a
cool package once everything is put back
together you'll find acknowledges the
support dual SIM cards but also a
microSD up to 64 gigabytes so the thing
with the fairphone is it's not a
flagship it's reasonably decent respect
but don't expect too much the real
novelty here is the fact that you can
really just take the whole thing tear it
apart put it back together and you have
a working smartphone we are up and
running so the first thing they jumped
ask me about the fully assembled fair
phone is that it's a
a bit chunky this is definitely not the
most slender phone in the world but of
course most smartphones are nowhere near
this easy to get into so you do have
some trade-off inside this is rocking
specs straight out of 2014 so it's
rocking a quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor with 2 gigabytes of RAM as
well as 32 gigabytes of storage this
isn't that bad when you take a look at
the benchmarks it's definitely well
behind a more modern flagship keep in
mind though that the Snapdragon 801 was
super high-end in 2014
yes that might not mean a whole lot
three years later but this is still
going to perform just as well if not
better than a lot of budget phones today
to be fair the screen is pretty decent
so what is a 5-inch panel with a 1920 by
1080 resolution it definitely won't
shame any current flagship but
considering that most of the specs of
this phone from 2014 it's actually kind
of similar to the HTC One m8 in that
regard good but definitely a couple
years behind the time it also has a 2000
420 milliamp hour battery that's fairly
small for a smart phone these days now I
get it the fear phone is definitely not
meant to be a spec monster the real
benefit here is the fact that's modular
but you're definitely giving out a fair
few specs to get there hey this guy's
also walking an 8 megapixel camera so if
we why not mr. Pulido here this doesn't
look bad it might not be the most punchy
image in the world but again 2014 specs
are kind of a trend with this guy we
also have 1080p video it looks decent
but again the camera here is really
nothing to be that impressed about most
importantly we have a super-high
resolution 2 megapixel front-facing
camera for that awesome selfie action ok
well that actually looks a little bit
crunchy but you know you can take it
apart the real advantage of using the
fairphone 2 though with absolutely that
modularity so it does bring a lot closer
to something like a PC save some part
goes down you can just swap it out when
theory upgrade it with something better
when it comes out and the purse
themselves are actually not that
expensive so you break the screen you
want to replace it it's only going to
cost you five hundred dollars even
something that the camera module is only
going to cost you about $40 to get a
replacement so it's not exactly like
you're going to break the camera very
easily but one of the big draws of the
fairphone 2 is that in theory as new and
better
things like cameras come out it's going
to be fairly simple to just throw a new
one in your phone and that's really
where the idea of the fairphone 2 starts
making a lot more sense so it's a decent
phone today instead of throwing it away
in a year or two when you're ready to
upgrade to your next phone imagine
instead where you throw in a new screen
when something comes out a better
processor bigger battery all of that
kind of stuff should in theory give you
a lot more life out of the phone
unfortunately all this relies on the
idea that fair phone is going to
continue making modules and continue
supporting the fair phone - that's
obviously their idea but until more
stuff comes out it's a little bit of a
risk and that brings us around to one of
the bigger downsides of the fairphone -
Meli is it only available in Europe
right now but it's pretty hard to get
your hands on once you do it's not going
to come cheap this guy runs about 530
euros which in American dollars is like
600 actually let me do that
translational ok I didn't new thing but
the answer is five hundred ninety two
dot seventy four cents I pretend I knew
that that's pretty much in full flagship
territory well the phone is cool there's
a lot of advantages it's hard to justify
that kind of price for it to be fair a
lot of people on Twitter are really
curious about the idea of a modular
smartphone so let me know in the
comments below what would it take for
you to buy a modular smartphone fair
phone or otherwise let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
