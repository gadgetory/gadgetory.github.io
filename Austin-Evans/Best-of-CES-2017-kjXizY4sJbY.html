of the best stuff that I've seen at CES
2017 also have a super cool mic so you
know let me Jun legit going this is the
second year in a row that I was
literally filming the intro to my video
and some famous youtuber walked up
behind me how's it one
I appreciate the commitment so before I
talk about all the cool things that I
saw what did you see at CES that you
actually liked you have six second scope
a project Valerie perfect thanks anyways
so one of my favorite things I saw at
CES this year was Razer project Valerie
it is essentially a triple screen laptop
so the base of it is a fairly standard
Razer Blade pro a cool laptop but it
traditionally has a single 17 inch 4k
display mere child's play when you can
actually have three of those 4k displays
built-in so the way they fold out is
interesting they had a couple of
different prototypes at the booth so if
the Rays are a lot of time after you see
these sort of projects at CES before too
much longer they actually ship them so
Valerie's an interesting idea having
essentially 12 K gaming a triple screen
for case setup on a laptop is actually
kind of insane it's also going to be
insanely expensive and probably very
hard to drive from a laptop but it's a
really cool idea subscribed a bit would
probably should do that bad idea I'll
leave a link in the description you guys
be the judge but not a good idea you
probably shouldn't do it bad for you bad
idea continuing on the crazy laptop
train there is the Acer predator 21 X
this thing is actually insane but the
difference is you can buy it in February
you know for $9,000 no big deal standard
laptop spare change inside you get two
gtx 1080s
you get an overclockable core i7 5 drive
bays to power supplies and a 21 inch
curved display on a laptop I'm not
exactly sure what the audience for a
20-pound $9,000 laptop is but if you
want some insane performance Acer also
has you covered completely changing
gears on the laptop side there is the LG
gram 14 now first glance this looks like
a way more normal computer so it's made
of plastic it's got some cool things
like you actually have a 14-2 display
but the chance is about 13-inch because
it's got a small bezel there's actual
ports a decent keyboard what's cool
about this is that first of all it's
incredibly lightweight
from the gram name it's less than a
kilogram which for a 14 inch laptop is
not bad but more importantly than that
it has a big 60 watt hour battery yes
pause stop the music you heard that
right there's a laptop in 2017 that is
still thin and light and they added
battery isn't that incredible it's not
an amazing idea moving away from laptops
one of the absolutely coolest things at
CES this year was the LG w7 wallpaper TV
so not only was it insanely thin but
it's actually flexible so that is it's a
4k OLED panel that you attach to your
wall with magnets and we're ready to
take it off you literally just peel it
back alongside it LG was also showing
off a brand new Atmos sound bar so the
idea is that it has top firing speakers
to fire sound off the ceiling to get a
full surround experience the only
downside to all of this is that the
actual TV itself costs $8,000 so like
everything else at CES it's really
expensive but this is really cool
there's a 4k OLED panel there's
legitimately flexible that you can just
stick on your wall alright so what was
your favorite thing you saw at CES well
I really like the LG room they had a
tunnel full of TVs that was awesome yeah
I think it was like something like a
hundred and sixty or something like that
they're all 4k and they have a huge
galaxy display it also has it was all
OLED so was this your first CES or have
you been before what you think it's
awesome I'm coming again okay if my dad
will take me yeah that's move dad is he
going next year we have video proof now
we have video proof you're good man
Oh as you ride off into the sunset
Hisense was also showing off a 100-inch
a laser projector TV thing so the way
reason I say it like that is it while
it's an ultra short throw projector it
actually comes with a dedicated 100 inch
screen so you're really meant to only
use it with one side unlike a
traditional projector and kind of adjust
it move it back and forth it really has
to be set up precisely it has a full
sound setup and the cool thing is
because it is certified by that display
that means that they can actually say it
is going to be HDR compatible it's full
4k and what's pricey because you know
everything at CES is pricey as I keep
saying over and over again it's a cool
piece of tech so we're talking about the
best of CES what was your favorite thing
that you saw the show I think my
favorite thing was the Xperia projector
I did see that what was what's the deal
it was a smaller projector that was
probably about like that probably
probably said that far off the ground
and once you turn it on it has a camera
on there but it also projects on the
wall or you can have a project on a
surface and use it like a tablet as well
you can also have it project like a
gallery wall on the wall if you're not
going to use it as as like an Android
tablet or whatnot or watch videos so you
can use it like that and then I also
switch it switch it up and do your
entertainment on there too so dude
that's right I wish you can can we like
go and check this out completely outside
the realm of stuff that you and I are
going to have anytime soon is the
Panasonic window projection so
essentially from the outside this looks
like any standard window however there's
a full display built in so for example
if you're at a sporting event you're
looking out the window you can have live
score you can pull player information
you have all kinds of stuff that is
actually projected on the window itself
so this one might be a little ways out
but it is actually pretty legit
something I didn't see a lot of this
year at CES for smartphones however what
they jump out to me was this dual screen
smartphone from Hisense so on the front
it has a 1080p OLED displays Android
smartphone it's pretty standard stuff
however when you flip it around there's
an e display on the back so the idea is
is that you can have things like
notifications show up on the back but
the cool part is since it's ink it even
works with the phone off so for example
say your phone dies but you have your
boarding pass on the back of the phone
well the problem scan it you're good to
go
there were a lot of cameras this year at
CES but what jumped out to me was the
Panasonic gh2 the G series has been
really big for a while the gh4 is really
one of the first 4k cameras
that didn't cost a ton of money that was
actually decent and the gh 5 improves on
that so not only do we get improved 4k
recording modes with higher frame rates
and better bit rates and better color
space but we also get a 6k photo mode
which is kind of video but not proper
but there are also other cool things
like it's a bigger body with dual SD
card slots you actually have inbuilt
body stabilization it's a cool camera
unfortunately it's still micro
four-thirds which is a little bit of a
small sensor size for me personally but
this is definitely a big upgrade from
the previous model alright so what was
your favorite thing you saw at CES this
year to be honest the Jones section it
was a project called hover camera it's
basically like a book you just open it
and flies automatically I think one of
the things about drones that really gets
me excited is the idea that it's
something that can actually be portable
right because all of these drones like
the the inspires and the Phantom's
they're amazing drones but huge yeah
you've got to like carry like a huge
carrying case but the idea of having
something small that can track you
everything is really cool Canon also had
some pretty crazy cameras in the booth
so they had a 2 megapixel video camera
which doesn't sound too impressive until
you keep in mind is a full-frame camera
which means those pixels are enormous in
the low-light performance is insane this
camera goes up to 4 million ISO you
literally can see in the dark with it on
the complete other end of the spectrum
they had a 250 megapixel camera now this
is sort of an engineering prototype so
it's not something that you'll be able
to buy any time soon but what was
interesting was it was actually an ApS H
sensor which is not even the same size
as like a full-frame like 5d or
something over they packed 250
megapixels on it now honestly I'm not
totally sure how useful that's going to
be most lenses are not sharp enough to
resolve that much resolution but it's
really interesting the idea of having
some crazy crazy high resolution cameras
coming on the horizon yo yeah ok hang on
alright alright I got this I got this ok
can I run it can outrun it right now oh
it's lost me it's gone oh no no no
you always it's pretty good oh it's even
at the cables alright alright you got me
you got me this is cool what is this
first autonomous suitcase in the world
hold on hold on
autonomous suitcase okay okay I got you
and the wheels retract so that way it
doesn't like drag on the floor when you
dude alright alright this is cool
so this is a prototype is something you
actually go by now 80% complete we're
funded on IndieGoGo we started about two
months ago you never know to find a CES
I'm more specifically you never know
what finds you at CES but what was your
favorite things you saw the show
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below and if you missed it I
did a video on this super cool BMW
sculpture interior which you guys go
check out here anyway thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
