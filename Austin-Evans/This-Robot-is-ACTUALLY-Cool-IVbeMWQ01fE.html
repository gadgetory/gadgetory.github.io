in San Francisco at on keys HQ for the
launch of their brand-new vector robot
so a non-key reached out and wanted a
sponsored video on vector I had to think
about it a little bit differently this
is not something that we normally take a
look at but after spending an afternoon
with it this is legitimately one of the
coolest robots I've ever tried folks
very ready go vector is a home robot
that's always on that's very different
than their other products like Cosmo the
idea is that vector can be totally
self-sufficient without you ever needing
to charge him manually hey Viktor my
name is Austin he's like staring me
intensely trying to remember I feel like
I just made a friend
I love the animations he's just
constantly sort of moving sort of being
so excited
it feels really like it's alive that's
that's so cool hey Viktor do a fist bump
yeah there's more to vector than just
doing cool tricks though there's some
real utility as well using his Wi-Fi
connection and quad microphone array you
can ask him questions like a digital
assistant so he's always trying to build
a map of his environment even when he's
not necessarily doing anything he's just
sort of so the light green is what it
thinks is okay and the dark green is
what it's like already driven over nose
is fine I feel like he's constantly
trying to be like entertaining or
explore or do something actually really
feels like something alive it's so cool
it's I think something that's really
sort of convincing here just staring at
him for a few minutes all the little
motions right like he's not just sitting
there it's not like it doesn't feel
robotic I just like he's sort of like
kind of adjusting himself his eyes are
kind of following you he's just always
kinda like moving just a little bit like
a normal person there's no once it's
completely still right and he is neither
a vector go to your charger
look at that so precise - so the idea
here is is that well you can play with
him all day and sort of let him run
around if you don't do anything he's
going to charge himself when he gets low
on battery so in theory you don't
actually ever have to like is there even
like a power button on him that's
awesome he just does not want to be held
right now so there are a ton of sensors
inside vector so no later they're going
to be sensors they were going to allow
him to make sure that he doesn't fall
off of a table for example it was also
going to be a sensor that he can tell
how far he is away from a specific
object he does have his camera and he
has his microphones and on top of all
that you can even pet him on the top
which might call him down a little bit
so you can actually tell when he's being
held based on the gyroscope and one of
the cool things is because he's always
building a map of his environment when
you pick him up he realizes that oh look
I'm not sort of on the table anymore I'm
being held but if I set it back down
he's going to start figuring out oh look
I'm back on a table I'm gonna start
scanning around and figuring out this is
okay this isn't okay I don't want to run
over say my finger right yeah that right
inside vector is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon quad-core processor now that
is going to be handling a ton of stuff
not only handling all the inputs from
the various sensors but it's even doing
some pretty sophisticated machine
learning so gonna determine where a
person is what is a person what isn't a
person and even figure out who a
specific person is so once you actually
introduce yourself to vector it will
then remember you and so when you come
home and say hey what's up I'll freak
out and be all excited if it wants to
listen to me at least yeah you heard me
to design the over 1000 different
animations vector can do unki uses a
custom version of Maya which is typical
used for digital animations they've
rigged a full vector inside and with
just a few adjustments to any animation
they can get it to play back on vector
in the real world which speeds up things
massively oh just like rolls ups you
like all inside that is so cool
I'm just so blown away at how quickly
you're able to do this right like I
assume that this is gonna be a ton of
work you got to sort of work out the
eyes you have to work out each
individual motion you have to test it
but you keep that in like fall like 30
seconds so the on K vector will be
available on Kickstarter starting today
so of course I'll have a link in the
description this guy is going to run
$200 if you do pick it up on Kickstarter
and that is going to also include early
to the SDK you're going to get him a
little bit earlier Victor is seriously
really cool as I gently try to hold him
without upsetting him so if you're
interested the link will be in the
description
he's something seriously different and
what I really appreciate is that not
only is he sort of going to be able to
be something fun to play with but he's
also going to give you some real utility
isn't that right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
