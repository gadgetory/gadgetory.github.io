video going over what to expect on the
new Xbox 720 now the current Xbox 360 is
actually coming up on 7 years old this
year and in videogame terms that's
pretty much an eternity so today we're
going to take a look at what you expect
with the next-generation Xbox as with
any major console release there have
been leaks and the Xbox has definitely
had its share so one of the biggest ones
was a couple months ago when a 56 page
document leaked which went over the
entire road map of the Xbox 720 now of
course some of this probably isn't
actually going to happen as this was
done about two years ago or so so it was
leaked just recently but it was probably
a little bit of an older roadmap there's
definitely some really interesting
things in it some of the more important
things that were included in this
document where the specs so the current
Xbox 360 has a triple core processor
half a gigabyte of RAM and a DVD Drive
fast-forward to the Xbox 720 and we're
looking at more like a six or eight core
CPU four gigabytes of RAM and a blu-ray
drive also slated is backwards
compatibility with Xbox 360 games as
well as a brand new Kinect 2 now all
this is fairly straightforward but
there's not a lot of details of course
this is a couple years ago while they
were still in the planning stages
however that's not all so a couple weeks
ago there was a posting on a forum of
someone trying to sell on Xbox 720 dev
kit for $10,000 the guy posted a few
pictures of it and for the most part it
looked pretty generic so of course you
can see a few things such as Durango
which is the Xbox 720 codename but
overall it looks pretty fake but when
these pictures were shown to some
developers who would have access to the
Xbox 720 they all said yes this is
actually what we're using right now Don
I'm assuming this is real and for the
most part it seems pretty legit we can
see that Microsoft has made several
changes from the planning stages which
was the first thing we saw to the actual
dev kits they're shipping to developers
for starters it has a gigabytes of RAM
which lines up perfectly as since this
is a debit it's not actually the final
hardware and the developers who are
making games on it are going to need a
little bit of extra room for their
various tools it also sports an 8 core
Intel CPU as well as an Nvidia graphics
card unfortunately we don't have the
exact specs here so we don't know if
it's going to be based on a
next-generation chip maybe the current
generation of PC parts or more than
likely than the last generation however
regardless it definitely should be
capable of 1080p gaming overall though
the hardware seems very similar to a
gaming PC now this isn't all that
surprising now
the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 both
to use totally custom parts if you look
at something like the Vita it uses
fairly standard stuff and it looks like
that the Xbox and the next PlayStation
will both do that as well as it's very
very expensive to create custom CPUs and
graphics cards and all that kind of
stuff where they can just buy stuff
right off the shelf my best bet would be
that the Xbox 720 will be on sale late
next year probably around the holidays
as far as price one likely around three
hundred dollars or so I don't think that
we're going to see any more of the you
know the $700 and $600 launch prices I
think that Microsoft Sony and Nintendo
they've all kind of figured out that
that really doesn't work anymore
actually it never worked
anyway I'm curious to know what do you
guys think of the Xbox 720 or xbox eight
or xbox next or whatever they decide to
call it definitely be sure to let me
know what you think in the comments
below anyway if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
videos on the new Xbox definitely be
