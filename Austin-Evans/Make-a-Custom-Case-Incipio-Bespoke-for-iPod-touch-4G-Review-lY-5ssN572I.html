case now I really don't like to review
cases that often I like kind of you know
take a look a little bit bigger things
however this case definitely did catch
my eye
I'm go ahead and show it to you guys
it's really pretty cool so ordinarily
this is just a normal Incipio feather
case I'm sure a lot of you guys know
about it you know it's a very nice case
it's not gonna really add any bulb mom
very very little bulb because you
actually see it's super super thin I
mean you know it's a really quite nice
case however this is a customized
version using their bespoke app
basically the way it works is if you
want to pay a little bit more money it
costs $25 you can't really go ahead and
have it fully customized version of this
case now what this means is it will be a
black case with as you can see here all
this is totally customizable so this is
just a really standard pattern that I
got you can get all kinds of things you
can get maybe you can put a picture on
here you know maybe you and your friends
you can put you know a picture of your
pets whatever you want the entire back
of it is customizable very very cool
stuff not only boy just give you guys a
quick run-through of the case itself
flipping it over on the front this is of
course the iPod Touch version you can
get this for the iPhone 4 as well yeah I
know before I get in comments I didn't
put my screen shield on right I know I
know but on the front there is literally
nothing
there's no lamb the table design
anything like that I'm sure a lot of you
guys know I'm a big fan of the lay on
the table design but and this is this
case is so thin that it's not a huge
deal and you do have nice access to your
volume so you can get to your volume
switch and again this is really a nice
thin case you know really doesn't add a
whole lot of bulk you guys see it's
super super thin and of course you can
get to all of your reports and
everything no issues at all of course it
does well I do take it back um just can
see right here the power button is a
little bit difficult to get at now one
thing that I'm not really a big fan up
on the iPod touch now of course the
iPhone version is gonna be different but
on the iPod touch the the sleep/wake
button is a bit recessed and unlike
cases actually had like a raised thing
where you actually push on top of the
case which puts down the button gives
you a little bit more room well this
does not have this and so basically it's
the exact same
definitely you can't really do it from
the front you really have to reach your
hand around the back not a huge issue
but definitely something that I wish
they would have you know thanks but
again this is a better case supposed to
be SuperDuper lightweight so no big deal
SuperDuper lightweight that's cool
anyway moving on of course you have you
the camera cut out plenty big you're not
gonna have any issues there so that's
the case itself it's pretty cool now I
want to go ahead and just give you guys
a quick run-through of how to make this
case it's really pretty simple it's all
done on an app so let's just go ahead
and jump over to that okay so the way
you can find this is just by going into
the extraordinary little act a little
bit slow but since you'll be using it
the one time it's not a big deal um so
you will have two options you can get it
for the iPod Touch 4th generation of the
iPhone 4 so what I shouldn't go ahead
and do an iPod Touch now once you open
it up it will be you know you'll just
see the standard case this is where you
can start to customize so you can do a
lot of different things you can go ahead
and open up text so if we open this up
we can put some random text in here like
oh hi okay that that'll be good um I
should just do that and then we can pick
a font and a color okay that looks
excellent so he said you can do you know
two-fingered stuff everything but we'll
just put it right here so there's a hi
there you know there's a lot of things
we can do with this we can add just a
standard pattern which is what this was
I'm not very creative you do a lot
better than what I did but you just get
this neon just a normal pattern so we
can just you know perhaps add this but
where this really shines and you just
ignore this I'm whether this really
shines is when you get into the artwork
now there's a lot of stock images but
what I prefer is when you actually use
your camera now I don't really have any
interesting pictures here but of course
you know any of the pictures from your
library such as you know a picture of a
pet or you know there's all kinds of
things you can do I mean you just take a
picture with the camera and then let's
say this is the one we've got we've got
some really cool picture you just have
to go ahead and click next and you can
purchase it all straight from inside the
app anyway guys that's it that's like go
ahead and check this out if you're
interested it's a pretty cool idea
case prices are not really all that bad
considering that you're getting a custom
case and it's a pretty good case in
general it's nice and lightweight and
thin so if you're interested definitely
check it out anyway guys
