the video going over ultrabooks
over the last 10 to 15 years we've had a
lot of different kinds of notebooks so
we've had normal laptops we've had tiny
little netbooks we've had gigantic
desktop replacements and more of course
we did see some in 2011 including the
Apple MacBook Air
so although several windows-based ultra
books including the Isuzu den book
whoever I think this year we're going to
see a lot more that's all fine and great
but what is an ultrabook
well in my opinion there are three major
things that separate ultrabook from your
standard run-of-the-mill laptop first
off is the size in general ultrabooks
are very very thin most of them coming
in at well under an inch then on top of
that the screen sizes are also fairly
small generally somewhere between 11 and
13 inches
what separates an ultrabook from
something like an ultra portable is the
fact that an ultrabook is really made to
be a primary computer so it's going to
have plenty of speed and plenty of power
to do most any task now you will be a
little bit shy on ports for the most
part as they're very thin there's not a
whole lot of room to add a lot but for
the most part it will be just fine for
most people of course since they're so
thin in line the first thing that has to
go is the optical drive well personally
that's not a problem at all for me I
can't remember the last time I used a CD
or DVD or blu-ray if it is an issue for
you you can easily get an external DVD
burner you just toss it in your bag
which is not a really big deal
considering just how small thin and
light an ultrabook really is the second
thing that sets an ultrabook apart from
other laptops is the fact that they
pretty much all have a solid-state drive
now a solid-state drive also known as an
SSD is simply a collection of computer
chips that serve as a hard drive very
similar to a flash drive but of course
much much faster in comparison most
computers today have what's known as the
mechanical hard drive and while there
are some pros with is most notably the
fact that you're going to have a lot
more storage space than on SSD for the
most part the stall state drive is just
way better in a lot of different areas
it's going to be a lot faster of course
generally by 3 or 4 times depending on
which solid-state drive you get it's
also going to be a lot quieter since
there are no moving parts there's
nothing to make any noise and since
there are no moving parts you're a lot
less prone to getting something
destroyed if you draw for shake your
laptop so that's really nice if you're
doing a lot of traveling whatever
because it's very difficult to damage a
chip you would really have to bust that
pretty good they also put out less heat
which is very important when you
consider just how thin most
books are and they take less power which
can give you a bit more battery life my
opinion once you get a solid-state drive
you never want to go back now I did this
allow ultrabooks between nice and thin
nice and light but on top of that it
gives them plenty speed play power to
keep up with standard laptops the third
thing that separates ultra books from
other laptops is the speed and battery
life in general when you look at
something that's this then this portable
it's either going to be very anemic and
hardly have any power at all it's going
to have better awful about 10 seconds of
battery life the great thing is that
these really is the case pretty much all
ultra books come with either Intel Core
i3 Core i5 or i7 ultra-low voltage
processor this means you really can't
have your cake and eat it too
with battery life that can exceed five
hours and the tiny thin chassis and with
enough power to do some moderate tasks
like web browsing and all that kind of
stuff but on top of that you can also do
some more heavy things such as gaming
and even video editing as far as I'm
concerned the only real downside to an
ultrabook
is the fact is they're fairly pricey
however I do expect this to change as
this year they're going to be a lot of
new ultra ebooks and of course I'll be
taking a look as many as I can next week
at CES anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this little informational video as
always if you have any feedback on the
video or you want to see me cover
something else next time be sure to
