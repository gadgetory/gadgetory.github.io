going to check out the brand new
snapchat spectacles so we are on our way
to Venice right now to meet up with our
buddy Dan from what's inside who's able
to get his hand on the spectacles early
okay so it is spectacles time you have
them are you I am so the first time
you've seen that dude check it out
that's actually really cool appeal this
is something you actually would get at a
vending machine these things are
extremely hard to come by they've only
resold 70 of them in the entire world
off of ebay and so I got two of them
actually but this is the first one that
actually came I had to fly out here from
Utah to get it it feels kind of like an
oversized tennis ball this yes isn't it
first of all they're actually not that
heavy I guess this is where like the
battery and the camera is on the side
but the thing with this case is not only
is it the case but it's also how you can
charge them you have a couple little
pins here so I think we just drop into
the case oh yeah it's magnetic oh I love
thumbs down yeah little bit in the
middle kind of middle I'll take the
middle I don't think there are strange
as the Google glass where you have the
yes you know that you can see the actual
screen and sometimes they don't even
have lenses and the thing is there's a
light on one of the sides so if someone
you're you're being recorded by these
people will know so it's not kind of
incognito where since walking around
with Google glass and like oh hi how's
it going you can rock those come pretty
nice yeah so on this side we have a
camera I don't imagine it's gonna be
super high quality but since it's for
snapchat it doesn't have to be anything
crazy to set up the spectacles put them
on you look at your snap code and press
the button on your spectacles alright
let's try this oh it did it done
wider connected I didn't know how I hit
the button and immediately was able to
figure it out clever it is once you're
ready to start recording you just hit
the button and it will record for 10
seconds for snap you hit it one more
time in record another 10 seconds I
wonder if they don't charge without oh
wait am i recording right now I think
I'm recording right now right here stuff
yeah Boston fans okay that's cool so
it's not automatic it's not like you
push it and it's actually working like
beam would be oh yeah exactly so you
still get to pick so from here if I
won't go through one of those snaps that
we just took I can then selectively post
it but yeah it's not automatically
starting every turn oh that's good to
know it's rare to find a new piece of
technology which is not only cool but
also just fun like this is just fun
alright so we're now recording a snap so
the cool thing is really do I have the
LED here but I also have a little LED on
inside so I can see how long okay so you
know you know how much flashing right
now and then it's awful so basically you
tap it to actually start recording so if
I want I'm now recording so I can look
around however if I'm done I just happen
hold and that's it's off okay yeah the
first thing that jumps out to me about
these is just how seamless they are this
just feels like I could be doing
anything right like I'm just walking
down the street no big deal but I'm
actually snapping there's no way there's
no one here give me someone I don't even
know it's hard to really grasp the
concept of turning your phone having it
yeah well I used to do this all day the
reason why this vechicle shoot circular
video is that no matter what orientation
you have your phone in the video always
stays the same so this is actually the
original snapchat headquarters so right
here on Venice Beach I mean I feel like
this is such like a perfect spot to play
with the spectacles it's a fun things
with a fun spot this is really cool I'm
having a blast
okay these are kind of fun dude so what
do you think
all right so overall I think they're
nicer than I thought and I feel a little
bit bad about destroying them oh well if
you guys want to see what's actually
inside the spectacles doesn't be sure to
go check out what's inside man I I think
it'd be fun
I just this is so cool you can't
describe this no I feel bad but we've
got to do it for science or a science
but science I'm an see if it what was
that sock what was that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
