dollar HP stream so when I did a video
on this recently I was impressed with
just how much laptop you're able to get
for that kind of price
however lots of you guys commented some
other options for around 200 dollars on
the laptop side one of the main things
people suggested was to pick up a
Chromebook and you can see if there's a
lot of Appeal here what you're getting
is a very cheap computer that while it's
going to be lightweight it's only
running Chrome OS so it's actually not
really going to be a big problem however
even more people suggested to pick up a
used laptop so that is where I found
this HP EliteBook which even though it's
a couple years old still comes in around
$200
ever since Chromebooks were first
announced they've actually kind of been
pretty much the same thing so what
you're getting here is a very very basic
laptop however when you're just needing
to run a web browser that kind of
actually works out okay and especially
considering just how cheap it is
especially how easy it is to set up
stuff like schools and different like
places that are kind of constantly going
through hardware I actually really do
get a big advantage out of using a
Chromebook so this is a fairly small
laptop with an 11.6 inch display so I
will say it actually does feel
reasonably well-built even though it is
all going to be plastic and if we open
it up we'll see lots and lots more
plastic inside the design is about as
safe as it gets so to be fair
Chromebooks actually do have a lot of
the basics figured out so the keyboards
are pretty much always fine the track
pads are pretty decent the screens are
going to be kind of mediocre but you're
going to be getting decent Wi-Fi as well
as just enough ports for while whatever
you're gonna do on a Chromebook what
you're getting here is a stripped down
operating system that is entirely built
around Chrome now for a lot of people
you actually can do most things inside
the browser however there are also some
other options that happen to run full
windows when you get into the world of
used laptops there are options
absolutely everywhere they try to keep
things at least somewhat even I want
Amazon and tried to find something that
was going to be refurbished at least you
get some kind of warranty and you know
it's not going to be completely beat up
or whatever at least I hope it won't be
super beat-up and terrible in the box oh
well okay that's quite the unboxing
experience
we get the giant old-school power cable
so that's the laptop and this giant
cardboard thing well that's actually
really heavy as you can see things that
definitely evolved in the last few years
and your two hundred dollar laptop is
much much thinner and lighter than it
used to be there are advantages to using
something a little bit older though
including a ton of ports so addition to
a full DVD Drive we also have an SD card
reader a pair of USB 3.0 ports we get
firewire around back you're going to be
getting VGA a modem Ethernet and you
flip it over to the other side we're
getting a full-size display port another
USB port as well as issei that and your
headphone and microphone jacks so you
know don't complain about your single
port macbook anymore this guy for 200
bucks has you covered you'll have the
magical experience of being able to
remove your batteries so when inevitably
your old laptop has a terrible 35 minute
battery life is easy just grab another
one off eBay and throw it in there
definitely advantages in going with a
little bit of an older design but what
I'm curious about is what are the
trade-offs is this really going to be
your best option for $200 when it comes
to the Chromebook 3 use it for about 30
seconds and you will immediately
appreciate just how small and
lightweight it is just over a kilogram
or about 2.5 pounds it's so lightweight
it kind of feels like a toy however with
the exception of the bezels which are
shiny and look a little bit cheap it
actually is reasonably well-built take a
look at the screen and you'll see it's
rocking an 11.6 inch 1366 by 768 panel
well it's not incredibly sharp it's
going to be totally usable for something
especially at this price point I'm kind
of impressed with how bright the screen
gets a lot of the time when it comes to
a budget laptop the screens are a little
bit on the DEM side but it's actually
pretty impressive here although it's not
impressive are the viewing angles but I
mean for less than 190 bucks what do you
expect the biggest consideration when
you're picking up a Chromebook though is
whether or not you're ready for Chrome
OS now for a lot of people it's going to
be more than enough and completely fine
but for a lot of other people they're
gonna want the flexibility of something
like Windows it really just does depend
on what you're using it for the basic
idea is the Chrome OS is a stripped-down
version of Linux that is focused around
the Chrome browser now while that might
sound crazy especially if you live your
life and a lot of web apps such as
Google Docs and office 365 it is usable
some newer Chromebooks though including
the Chromebook 3 do support Android apps
and while it's an option it's not
exactly a great one on this system first
most ads expect a touchscreen which is
fine when you're using an Android phone
but not so great when you're using an 11
inch laptop so when it comes to actually
clicking to say jump in Super Mario run
it's not the greatest experience and on
top of that a lot of other games just
won't run all that well even completely
ignoring the controls and performance
really is an area where you notice the
low price of the Chromebook it's powered
by a seller on in 3050 processor which
is a putt as low-end as it gets and a
laptop in 2018 to be fair for basic web
browsing which is what most people are
going to be doing with the Chromebook
anyway it's totally fine maybe not the
fastest thing in the world however once
you start loading up a few tabs it does
noticeably slow down and keep in mind
that I'm using the upgraded model with 4
gigs of RAM there is another model of
the Chromebook 3 which only has 2
gigabytes of RAM if you know you're
really all about that single tab light
as a Chromebook you don't exactly need a
lot of storage which is good because the
Chromebook 3 only has 16 gigs of storage
onboard now well that might not be
enough to get you a full copy of Windows
10 onboard it's actually fine for Chrome
OS it gives you about 9 gigs or so free
to install other Android apps or
whatever kind of stuff you want to
actually download one thing that is
decent is the battery life so Samsung
claims up to 11 hours on a charge and
while that might be a little bit
ambitious this is a laptop that I would
feel totally comfortable going for a
full day without taking the charger I
know they sound pretty negative but
don't get me wrong there is definitely a
market for Chromebooks
however if it's my money I'm gonna spend
my $200 elsewhere like for example with
this giant used HP EliteBook look this
thing is absolutely enormous I'm sure
you're getting a lot of extra ports and
features that you're not getting on the
other laptops but you're also getting
something that weighs over five pounds
it's like basically both of those
combined there are also some really
weird quirks with the elite block so
beside the webcam there's a little light
button press it that tiny LED pops out
to illuminate the keyboard so you know
if you're heavily working in the dark or
your need to sign some incredibly
important legal documents on your
keyboard this tiny light has got you
covered a quirk that I'm not as big a
fan of is the trackpad now sure you're
going to have left and right click
buttons on top and bottom but even for
2012 this one's a little bit raw now it
does support two finger gestures my big
problem is just the tracking
sure once you crank up the sensitivity
it's not that bad but especially
compared to even low-end stuff like on
the stream in the Chromebook is just not
in the same league on the plus side
though in the middle of the keyboard is
a little trackpad nipple
you know who's ever gonna complain about
having an extra nipple and those
performance-wise you're getting a core
i5 3360 em now is a third gen Ivy Bridge
part it is definitely little bit on the
older side but it actually holds up
surprisingly well today we run it
through Geekbench and there's no context
it absolutely destroys both the
Chromebook and the stream it's not just
for benchmarks either you really do
notice the difference when you use all
three of these laptops back-to-back the
EliteBook just feels much much faster
and to be fair I'm not going to want to
do a lot of gaming on this for example
but for normal use it stays very snappy
pretty much throughout which is
definitely not something I can say about
the stream especially when it starts
doing something like an update in the
background and everything grinds to a
halt that Core i5 is backed up by a good
bytes of RAM and a 320 gigabyte hard
drive well 4 gigs of RAM is fine on the
Chromebook and feasting on the stream is
really nice to have that extra memory
when you load more than say 2 things up
at a time and something that really
surprised to say is the 320 gigabyte
hard drive actually isn't terrible
screen wise we're looking at a 40 inch
panel with a resolution of 1366 by 768
and that's actually pretty mediocre
these days to be totally honest but when
you compare to these other two laptops
at the very least you're getting a nice
we're looking panel it's low res but
it's not gonna you know make your eyes
bleed or something something else is
slightly behind the times is the 802 dot
11 and Wi-Fi now keep in mind this is
actually a pretty solid implementation
with 2x2 Wi-Fi antennas and I was
actually able to get around 200
megabytes per second on the download but
it isn't quite match up to the latest AC
solutions still though for under 200
bucks I'm not complaining and speaking
of price this laptop was originally over
$1000 five years ago considering that
it's now about 20% of that value
it's actually not too bad and you do see
a lot of the advantages of having
something that was much more expensive
when it first came out however
everything comes crashing down when it
comes to the battery life so as you
would expect from a five-year-old
business laptop it's exactly the strong
suit I'm meeting somewhere between two
to three hours of fairly basic use on
this guy a big part of that is because
it has a pretty small 55 watt hour
battery so even though it is swappable
andthere you could carry a couple around
I feel like especially when you put this
side-by-side with the newer laptops like
the Chromebook in the stream which are
getting well over double the battery
life it
kind of hard to justify carrying this
huge big of a laptop around and of
course the other big wildcard is the
fact that you're buying a used laptop so
like I said earlier I picked up a
refurbished model from Amazon which does
come with a warranty and at least
someone in theory went over it to make
sure everything works and thankfully I
lucked out everything actually does work
pretty much flawlessly now there are a
couple of very very minor blemishes on
the outside of the laptop but honestly
I'm surprised with just how clean this
thing is of course your mileage will
definitely vary depending on where you
find a laptop whether it's been
refurbished or not whether someone took
care of it or not for me it really comes
down to two things you can either go
with this safe option and get a brand
new laptop with good battery life it's
gonna be small and portable but you're
going to be losing performance or do you
want to take a chance on an older laptop
that might have a couple of problems
that is going to deliver a lot more
performance and a lot more features if
it's my money if you find the right used
laptop I think it's totally worth
considering even something that's five
years old it's still going to be good
enough for 99% of people and the good
thing is a lot of the upgrades that you
might want to do and like more memory or
an SSD or fairly cheap these days I'm
curious what do you guys think is the
best option for a two hundred dollar
laptop today let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
