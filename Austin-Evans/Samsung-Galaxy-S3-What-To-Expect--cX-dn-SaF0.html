talk a little bit about the samsung
galaxy s3 samsung just sent out invites
for the galaxy s3 launch event will be
taking place on May third in London now
I'm going to say I'm really excited
about this the galaxy s2 remains to be
one of my favorite android phones even
today the galaxy s3 is looking to have a
lot of really nice upgrades according to
BGR we're going to be looking at a phone
that has a quad-core Exynos processor 4g
LTE as well as I screen somewhere
between 4.6 and 4.8 inches with a
whopping 1080p resolution it should have
an 8 megapixel camera capable of 1080p
video a color choice of both black and
white as well as either 16 and 32
gigabytes of storage it looks like
Samsung is also going for a faster
release so the Cal cs2 in took months
and months for it to finally be released
all around the world Oh with the galaxy
s3 it looks like they're going for a
simultaneous global launch supposedly
supposed to go and Salem like July
around the same time as the 2012 summer
olympics begin i'm really excited about
the galaxy s3 besides a little bit of
time with weber west i pretty much been
using iOS for the past several years
however i think the galaxy s3 is going
to be enough to give me to switch over
at least for a little bit of time and
kind of take a look and see exactly how
good it really is my only problem is the
screen no BGR is set on multiplication
through this will be a 1080p screen and
while i'm all for it more pixels the
better as far as i'm concerned over
1080p on something that small than five
inches seems a little bit weird to me of
course most phones these days are slowly
starting to get into 720p and I think
that's pretty much perfect I mean you
really can't see any more pixels beyond
that unless you're like pulling your
phone like right up to your eye and
that's no no one really does that but of
course if they find a way to get a 1080p
screen in there and make it even more
awesome hey I'm not gonna complain
anyway guys what do you think about the
new galaxy s3 are you interested you
might want to be able to pick one up not
really something that you like you had
