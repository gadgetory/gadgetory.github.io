the review of the Nintendo 3ds XL as a
larger counterpart to the current 3ds it
looks like a fairly straightforward
update but is it for you taking a look
around you'll see the XL isn't half bad
looking compared to the 3ds it's got a
clean design that looks right at home
next to a DSi it's definitely big and
heavy but it's got the Nintendo quality
you would expect as you may have guessed
from the XL name the biggest change are
the larger screens with the 4.9 inch top
display and 4.2 inch screen below it
nearly as big as the Vita and this isn't
a bad thing when you're using the 3d
it's a much more immersive experience
than before you're probably not going to
want to carry this around with you all
day but when you sit down to play it's a
better experience speaking of gameplay
its 3ds XL plays the exact same games as
a 3ds and the software is identical so
here it's all about the bigger screen in
games like new Super Mario 2 you can
notice more jagged edges but for the
most part the added screen real estate
makes the trade-off worth it full 3d
games like the excellent Resident Evil
Revelations they're even better as a
lower pixel density is hardly noticeable
at all same goes for Ocarina of Time the
3d models don't suffer much at all and
the extra screen real estate makes the
3d effect easier on the eyes of course
it's not all good news as the 3ds is
only just over a year old Nintendo
carried over quite a few things like the
VGA cameras which rival cell phones from
2005 it's also still fairly bulky just
like all Nintendo handhelds dwarfing
phones like the galaxy s3 for the most
part the software offerings are solid
the last year is seeing the 3ds get
non-stop improvements via firmware
updates and the ability to access Game
Boy Game Gear and NES games through the
Virtual Console is great you can even
download full 3ds titles from the eShop
although you really shouldn't as it's a
pain to transfer the licenses over to a
new 3ds battery light is somewhat better
I averaged about 4 hours of gameplay on
a charge which is a decent improvement
over the 3ds another improvement is in
the stylus which is now a proper size
and back to the normal position on the
right side what isn't an improvement is
the lack of a second circle pad
well I'm sure Nintendo has the reasons
why they chose not to include it if you
want to fully enjoy games like resident
evil you'll have to buy the circle pad
pro for the 3ds XL when it comes out
later this year overall the 3ds XL is a
solid improvement with a year Android
spell the 3ds finally has some great
games out and while 3d is still mostly a
gimmick you can
leave it off and enjoy like a more
powerful D s the only reason I would
recommend the 3ds over the XL is that
the slightly more portable size is
important to you but otherwise the
Nintendo 3ds XL is the one to go for if
you're interested in more 3ds XL videos
