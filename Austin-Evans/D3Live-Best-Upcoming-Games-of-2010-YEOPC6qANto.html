five of d3 live so today guys once tuck
games something go over some of the top
games I'm looking for two for 2010 guys
this year has been fantastic for video
games already so far we've seen all
kinds of just fantastic games such as
Red Dead Redemption and many many many
others because there's a lot more in
store for the second half V or something
go ahead and go over five over the ones
I'm looking for - of course there are
many many more but yeah so as the first
one has absolutely got to be portable -
if you've never played the original
portal go play right now guys it's hard
to explain portal is a very very
innovative game well basically you have
a portal gun and you're able to shoot
two portals between on one wall or a
ceiling and roof or whatever and you can
walk from one to the other it really
messes with your head that's a fantastic
game and really lets you go ahead and
think about it so guys portal 2 is
coming out and this time it's going to
be a full game before it was already
duggle with in the orange box you know
with half-life 2 and Team Fortress
but guys now it's going to be its own
standalone games going to be much longer
and it's looking fantastic so guys
absolutely looking forward to portal 2
it's looking like a great game so guys
the next one I'm looking forward to is
Fallout New Vegas so guys I'm a huge fan
of Fallout 3 I've played at a time I
have all the expansion packs it's a
fantastic game and I'm really looking
forward to Fallout New Vegas I'm suppose
if you don't know what about New Vegas
it's very very similar to fallout 3 you
know a lot of this stuff such as your
pip-boy menus sounds a lot of it
especially the game engine has been
recycled but it's in a good way as
fallout 3 was a fantastic game already
um so guys it's actually now over in and
you might have guessed Las Vegas and the
sort of post-apocalyptic you know
nuclear fallout world fallout 3 and guys
it looks really really great you know
you're actually in Vegas and you know
you knew all the kinds of you know
quests and you know it's a ton of fun
guys so it doesn't forward to new Vegas
as well I'm so that's a third game I'm
sure a lot of you guys have been
really looking forward to this is Halo
Reach um so guys Halo Reach is of course
the final bungee creating Halo game now
I'm sure there will probably be more
Halo games than future but it doesn't
look like they will actually be made by
Bungie so you know we'll just figure
that out as we go
um guys Halo Reach is the final
installment it's not exactly you know
it's not like ODST or anything like that
it's a bit of a different game it
doesn't actually feature Master Chief
I'm guys it still it's really solid
there's I've been a playable paid out
for a little while so a lot of you guys
have probably already played the online
part but guys the full game including
the campaign which is just looking
pretty good and of course the great halo
online multiplayer experience will be
coming later this year guys so just
looking forward to it
Halo Reach is looking like a great way
for halo to go out I'm so glad the
fourth game and well technically this
isn't technically to to attend this
should be out early next year but I had
to put something for the way out and it
is Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword I'm
some guys of course this game really
really reminds me of Ocarina of Time so
of course if you guys know a period of
time is probably one of the best video
games of all time so guys that's
definitely not a bad game to be compared
to so guys this guy sword is a horse for
the week and it really does seem to be
focusing on the motion controls with the
Motion Plus so you know a lot of Wii
games get into the you know the problems
where if they just don't seem very
realistic you know he's trying to you
know aim and doing different kinds of
stuff of that and doesn't seem that
great um but you know the Skyward Sword
actually does look pretty good so they
did demo it at e3 this year just a
little while back and it didn't work so
much because there's a lot of
interference but guys I'm seeing we've
seen lots of gameplay on it it does look
like a really innovative game probably
it's gonna be good enough for me to go
ahead and go out buy it go dust off my
way and play it some
so guys the final video game I'm looking
forward to I am looking forward to more
but or discussed it with five on the
final I'm looking for to biz Gears of
War 3 so guys if you've never played
Gears of War is a portion Xbox exclusive
but
Gears of War 2 especially was a really
really great game and Gears of War 3
looks even better so that's one thing
that really sticks out about Gears of
War 3 in my opinion is the graphics so
if you take a look at some of the recent
PlayStation 3 games
heavy brain or God of War 3 for example
you can tell that the graphics are
actually starting to you know outpace
the Xbox 360 the guys people take one
look at gear of this of war 3 you will
really kind of doubt that because Gears
of War 3 is probably one of the best
games looking for the Xbox 360 and of
course guys it's still going to have the
same great combat with of course some
new enhancements and in general guys of
course it is a bit of a violent game
it's not for everyone but if you're into
Xbox gaming there's a good chance that
you're going to go ahead and want to
pick up Gears of War 3 I'm so guys
there's a lot more games I'm not looking
forward to such a Gran Turismo 5 etc etc
but those are the main ones that I
really got stuck out in my head and I'm
probably gonna get pretty much every
single one of them ok guys so for the
second segment do you think that I'll be
taking live questions from blogtv
of course I do every day through dive in
front of it and right now we have almost
50 people which is really great
so go ahead and take a few questions ok
so let's see here Sony or Nintendo ok
that's a good question um I like I feel
I've traditionally been a Sony fan you
know I was my first system with you know
a Playstation one you know I'm really
like Sony but in recent years I really
haven't I mean I had PSP I thought I got
rid of that it just really wasn't into
it I got an Xbox and I never really
bought a PlayStation 3 so right now I'm
probably more into Sony I mean I've got
a big fan of the wave but the DES is
pretty good and Sony and Nintendo both
but especially the Nintendo has really
put out a lot of really quality software
and especially the of the games the
hardware is pretty good too but they
really have specialize in just putting
out great games quick franchises such as
Mario Zelda
pokemons really really really high
quality stuff so yeah I'd have to go
with Nintendo let's go ahead and go with
a new one
halo series battlefield or called duty
that's another good question um well
halo is obviously great you know there's
no beating you know halo 3 was a
fantastic game I mean maybe maybe not
one of the best games of all time like
some people say but it was a really good
game um several other recent games such
as Halo Reach looking pretty good also
you know Battlefield Bad Company that
was a really good
Battlefield Bad Company 2 looks solid
but I'm probably gonna have to go and
call duty I'm not a big fan of try our
games so a lot of the example World War
was just not that great but modern
warfare both 1 &amp;amp; 2 were really really
great so I thought I had to go with Call
of Duty but to be honest if I have any
one of the three in front of me I'd
probably play it says not a big deal
what was my first console in first game
on my first console was a PlayStation 1
and my first game 4 was the original
Gran Turismo guys I play Gran Turismo so
much it's not even funny you know it was
just like the first time because I
always used to play games in arcades you
still swim occasionally but I feel like
the racing games like Hydro Thunder
cruise in the USA a lot of really great
games like that so when I finally got a
PlayStation that was probably one of the
first things that one I want to play on
PlayStation games such as you know Gran
Turismo racing games but yes I mean I of
course I have this huge collection of
ps1 games I just kept collecting but
yeah Gran Turismo was the first one okay
well like Lego games like lego indiana
jones and lego starwars
um I think the Lego games are usually
pretty innovative I haven't really
played in very many of them I play a few
of the original like Lego Harry Potter
I've played a few little games but in
general I mean they're kind of fun but
to me they just seem a little bit you
know oriented towards just a little bit
of the younger audience that so the
mayor of still really good games was the
worst handheld I've ever had that's a
great question um well I've had quite a
few most of them were game boys um you
know I don't know if there's one that
was really sticks out in my mind is
terrible um the PSP was not terrible by
any stretch of the imagination just that
is probably my least favorite either
that are probably the original Game Boy
Advance just until I got the SP the
Gameboy Advance SP was fantastic so
probably either the PS Peter the Game
Boy Advance but like I said guys I love
pretty much I've ever really had a bad
you know handheld so it's not so much
bad it's just not really loved I guess I
don't know what's my favorite game
released before mm it's a good question
um well
you know there's a there's a Buddhist
point of view I probably have to go with
maybe God gran turismo to guys literally
I play Gran Turismo to the original act
like quite a bit but Gran Turismo 2
literally never left my apply station
for a very long time I mean it was a
fantastic game I was like one play every
day for just weeks and months and months
and months I mean it just never got old
to me I mean there were hundreds of cars
the graphics for the time were fantastic
that said though guys back then I really
wasn't a big game Robbins I mean I was
somewhat younger so I really wasn't into
a lot of the really cool games that you
know I know about today but back then
probably Gran Turismo 2 okay what's
better ps2 or xbox umm well if we're
talking about that I actually never did
get an Xbox I was I thought about it but
and I ended up going having the Gamecube
and the ps2 on that so guys yeah I
probably would go with the ps2 I did I
think it a little bit late I almost got
I got towards when the Xbox came out but
yeah the ps2 it was really saw platform
I mean you know it obviously was like
you know the DVD player which was really
cool back in the day but you also could
play a ton of games and I mean the
graphics were a huge step up I mean like
I said guys I was playing the original
PlayStation so this is I saw a place
they should do them like wow that's
awesome
yeah probably go the PlayStation 2 what
did I think of Steam for Mac another
good question I'm glad that I'm glad
that steam is for the Mac you know I'm
like many of you guys know I'm mortal
console game or I prefer play on my xbox
or whatever I had to do it play a few
games on my computer but that said
though guys the morfs the sprat it is
because of course Macs have been just
famous for just being really bad with
game for quite a while so now that new
valve is actually stepping out they
brought steam over they're really making
a big effort to try to bring game to the
Mac I'd say all this is great for them
you know it really gives you just one
more reason to go ahead and get a Mac
you know just you can't say that Oh most
people are games they still can't to
much but at least it's a step in the
right direction let's go ahead and take
one more question
probably hundred ATAR here oh um well I
used to be
like back when you know the original
rock band came out I was big into it
like I'm sure a lot of you guys were I
had the original rock band I've tried to
give you a guitar hero several times but
I always never worked with the rock
being in control or I'm sure you guys
probably had to deal with that too so
just because I never was actually able
to get guitar hero I played it but
really I sat there and guys I mean I
spent forever you know mastering the you
know the original rock band with the
guitar you know getting you're trying to
beat this all songs an expert and you
know the gold stars on cuff stuff so
yeah I have to go with you know Robin
but yeah so no guys that's it for this
