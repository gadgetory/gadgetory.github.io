back-to-school gadget guide and when
you're going back to school there's all
kinds of gadgets that can really make
your life a lot easier and today we're
gonna be taking a look at several leads
including tablets laptops ear eaters and
much much more my back to school laptop
hick has ought to be the MacBook Air
that's what I'm currently using in
university and I absolutely love it now
you're not gonna get the most power out
of the MacBook Air but you get amazingly
good battery life obviously it's super
thin making it portable and light to
throw in your backpack you don't have to
worry about it you don't have to pull it
out when you're in between classes it's
fast it's easy its quick now the new
2011 models do have certainly more
impressive specs I have the 2010 model
you can get an i5 or an i7 Sandy Bridge
processor which for the $999 price
especially since it does hyper threading
and all that other stuff it really is a
decent priced computer now it's not an
overpriced ultra portable like it used
to be it's gonna come a thunderbolt
there is a 11 and 13 inch and it starts
at just 999 dollars it comes pre-loaded
with Lion the excellent OS 10 operating
system that I as well as many others
love and that is certainly my
back-to-school pick I think unless
you're doing some super heavy-duty
processing you don't really need a
macbook pro and for most students the
MacBook Air is a more practical solution
so that is my back to school laptop pick
for laptops my pick is going to be the
Sony Vaio SP series now this laptop has
a lot going for it it has a 13 inch
display which means it's not going to be
a very big laptop in addition it does
have a full DVD drive which is not
something you'll find very often on
laptops of this caliber and addition it
has the brand new Intel Core processors
including the I threes and the I 5s so
what makes this laptop really great is
it's just a generally really good
all-purpose laptop it can do some light
video gaming and in addition it can also
do all the kinds of standard tasks such
as web browsing watching videos and all
that kind of stuff on a really nicely
built machine for starting at $800 I
think this is a great way to go to get a
good laptop that will definitely last
you a long while now my eager to pick
has ought to be the Nook touch I've
always been a nuke fan and if always
preferred it to the Kindle but now
there's actually some solid reasons as
why you should choose the Nook over that
of the Kindle now there a book library
and by them I mean Barnes or Noble their
ebook library is almost as
as amazon with almost as many titles but
one thing I've often noticed is that
Barnes and Noble books are sometimes
even a couple bucks cheaper than
Amazon's ebooks and so really cheap
books as one of the main incentives also
with the all-new Nook you get a great
touchscreen it's just $130 so you can
get rid of the keyboard and kind of a
trackpad and some of that other stuff
you don't really use on the Kindle and
make it a smaller more petite device now
even though it is a touchscreen it's by
no means a bad touchscreen you can
navigate it with a pen and you know kind
of other screens uses IR technology
super advanced it's super quick and
responsive and it is one of the best
touchscreens I've used even really
period especially on an e-book reader
and I think out best that of the Sony
touch-sensitive displace now the
greatest thing about the tablet for me
is their super-fast page turns when you
get that refresh on the Amazon Kindle
and some other eBook readers it only
does that once every 6 page turns on the
note so you will literally press the
page and the second you press it boom
that text is there there's no waiting
even if it's you know half the second
it's time wasted and with the new Nook
it doesn't do that and that's why the
nuke is one of my favorite picks and I
recommend it for your back-to-school
reader for an e-reader my pick is going
to be the Amazon Kindle now there are a
lot of readers available on the market
but what sets the Amazon Kindle apart
from the rest in my opinion is going to
be the selection of books available it's
not only can you download a wide variety
of new as well as older books but in
addition you can also pick up textbooks
now instead of having to carry around
the whole backpack full of really heavy
and very expensive textbook you can just
download them or even rent them on the
Amazon Kindle and I'll combined that
with the full capability of a physical
keyboard a nice e display and the
indolent Kindle is an excellent choice
if you're looking for a solid really
dependable eReader
my tablet back to school pick is going
to be none other than the Asus
Transformer this is a wildin out tablet
coming at a groovy price of 399 for the
16 gigabyte version and 499 for the 32
gigabyte version now this is by no means
spec shy it comes with a Tegra 2 1.2
gigahertz dual-core CPU you've got 3.2
honeycomb UI and Android loaded on which
means you're going to get Adobe Flash
Player and all of those other goodies
are not going to get on the iPad it
comes with a Seuss's wave share UI which
is the best honeycomb skin I've seen
hands down it
with a whopping 16 hours of battery life
which even wrecks the iPads very
impressive 10:00 to 12:00 it's super
thin it has two USB ports and an SD card
so it is a little bit thicker than that
of the iPad 2 but again you are packing
those super powerful specs as well as
that extra battery
it offers expandability of course you
have the App Market and I think it's an
excellent tablet if you're looking for
an iPad alternative so that is the Asus
Transformer and that's my back-to-school
tablet pick for a tablet I've got to go
with the iPad 2 there's a lot of reasons
why this is a good tablet for starters
it has an excellent design so it does
have a nine point seven inch display
which is a little bit big for tablets
but of course it's going to be a still
quite a bit thinner and smaller than any
kind of laptop that you would be able to
pick up and on top of that if you're
interested in doing a lot of typing on
the tablet it's very very simple to just
connect a bluetooth keyboard wirelessly
you're gonna have no problems whatsoever
on top of that like I said it has a
really nice design with dual cameras of
course plenty of power with the Apple a5
processor and on top of that you have a
really really wide selection of
applications available in the App Store
that's it for our picks for the best
laptops readers and tablets available
however that's not everything we have a
full other video where we go over the
best smartphones the best cameras as
well as the best headphones simply be
sure to have the annotation on screen
