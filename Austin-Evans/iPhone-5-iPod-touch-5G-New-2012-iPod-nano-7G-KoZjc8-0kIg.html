here with a recap of the new apple event
so they announced quite a few new things
including a new iphone new ipod touch as
well as a new ipod nano to start with
let's talk about the new iphone the
iphone 5 and yes it actually is called
the iphone 5 even though this is the 6th
iPhone Apple Matt the biggest story here
is that the leaks were spot on so you're
going to find a 4 inch display with a
resolution of 11 36 x 640 you're going
to find support for LTE as well as a new
apple a6 processor the design is pretty
solid so overall it looks fairly similar
to the iphone 4 and 4s however of course
with that wider screen it's going to be
a little bit taller up front you're also
going to find a new FaceTime HD camera
which is finally HD and around back
you're going to find a new 8 megapixel
camera it still shoots 1080p video is
still mostly the same holder they've
added a few new features including a
panorama mode the rear of the phone is
no longer a single sheet of glass
instead you're going to find a large bit
of aluminum with two glass windows on
the top and bottom now flipping it over
to the side you'll see this is a very
thin iPhone coming in at only seven
point six millimeters thick the 30-pin
dock connector has been removed from the
new iphone and ipods instead there's a
new 8-pin connector called lightning get
it thunder bolt lightning apples so
clever the iphone 5 will be available
for pre-order starting on sep tember
14th it will be shipping one week later
on sep tember 21st now that's coming
both black and white and just like the
iphone 4s you can get it in 16 32 or 64
gigabytes of capacity for 199 299 or 309
dollars moving right along we have a
brand new ipod touch 5th generation now
this get several improvements from the
new iphone 5 including a bigger 4-inch
display they've also revamped the design
of the new ipod touch so if you guys
have ever owned an ipod touch you'll
know that you pull it out of the box you
take one blank at the apology Luminum
and immediately it's phil scratches
another awesome addition to the ipod
touch is a decent camera yeah actually
usable camera on an ipod touch so this
is the same unit out of the ipad 3 it
has 5 megapixels and it also is paired
with an LED flash so that means you'll
be able to record 1080p video and of
course those 5 megapixel stills
internally you'll be able to get the new
ipod touch with an apple a5 dual-core
processor which is the same thing that
you will find in the ipad 2 as well as
the iphone 4s the new ipod touch also
finally has siri which is definitely a
big thumbs up and on top of that it does
come in 32 and 64 gigabytes of capacity
on top of all of that you can also now
get the ipod touch in five colors
including
red white black yellow and forgetting
one but i'll put up on screen last but
not least or actually it is least we
have the ipod nano now again it's got a
totally new redesign it actually does
have a home button now if you take a
look at the new ipod nano you'll tell
that the design is interesting it does
have a 2.5 inch touchscreen as well as
of course some iOS like icons that are
weirdly round for some reason he does
have a few new features such as
bluetooth as well as video playback
however i don't know i'm a little on the
fence on it if you are interested in
picking one up though it does have
several colors and does come in 16
gigabytes of storage as far as pricing
goes it gets a little complicated so the
ipod nano is pretty straightforward you
can pick any color you like it comes an
only 16 gigabytes of storage it'll cost
you 115 ships in october so we don't
have an exact date on either the new
ipods but it will be shipping in october
the ipod touches get a little tricky so
the fourth generation model is going to
stick around alongside the fifth gym so
for two hundred dollars you can get a 16
gigabyte 4th generation model for 250
you can get a 32 gigabyte 4th generation
model however if you want a fifth
generation iPod with all the new cameras
and all the kind of fancy stuff that's
going to run you two hundred ninety nine
dollars and only comes in 32 gigabytes
or you can't upgrade that to 64
gigabytes for 399 dollars I know I told
you it was complicated I'm very curious
to know what do you guys think about the
new announcements and I'm sure you're
gonna have opinions you guys always do
as far as I'm concerned the new iphone
looks exactly what i expected i was
really kind of surprised at the lack of
surprises i mean everything was like
there was not one single thing that i
was like oh i did not know that but that
said it still does look pretty solid and
i will be definitely picking one up and
doing some videos on it and a week or
week in three days or whenever it comes
out as far as the new ipod touch goes
big thumbs up all around there's a few
little weird things like there's a
lanyard so if you don't want to drop
your ipod touch you can attach a lanyard
don't ask but overall though it does
look really stall it and the ipod nano
well I I don't know anyway guys if you
enjoy definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up if you're interested
