computer you may find compatibility
issues with the following parts list
today I'll be showing you how to build a
great gaming PC for under $500 while you
shouldn't expect to play crysis 2 maxed
out with this computer
you can't expect solid performance with
medium to high settings on many of
today's games to begin with we're going
with an AMD Athlon 2 x3 435 processor
this is a triple core processor that's
clocked at 2.9 gigahertz which should be
more than enough for most games you can
also look into unlocking the fourth core
and the level 3 cache although do note
that your results may vary with doing
this for $72 currently on Newegg this is
a great starting point next we have the
gigabyte GA ma 78 LM TS 2 this is a
budget motherboard that still offers a
solid amount of features including 2
slots from ddr3 RAM built-in ATI Radeon
3000 integrated graphics and 8 USB 2
ports for $55 after a mail-in rebate
this should work great for you
ordinarily you aren't getting a very
good graphics card in a $500 computer
but with a one gigabyte Sapphire Radeon
4670 you want to be getting some quite
good performance on most games as long
as you keep the settings on medium to
high you'd see very playable frame rates
on most games with VGA DVI and HDMI out
you also should be good no matter what
type of monitor you have an added bonus
is that the 4670 doesn't require a
separate power cable just plug it in and
you're good to go this is going to set
you back around $65 for Ram I chose a 4
gigabyte stick of kingston ddr3 clocked
at 1333 megahertz
4 gigabytes of this speedy Ram is enough
to run Windows 7 in almost any game you
throw at it without issue this will run
you 42 dollars and because this still
leaves another Ram plot open on the
motherboard you can always upgrade to 8
gigabytes if you like with the hard
drive we've got a 640 gigabyte Western
Digital caviar black drive well it might
not be the most spacious hard drive for
the money it more than makes up for that
by being very quick along with having a
great 5 year warranty it's a solid buy
for $65 however it does ship as a bare
drive so you'll need to supply your own
SATA cable
since almost all of our parts are low
powered a 460 watt cooler Master Elite
power supply should do the job no
problem for only $30 while it's not a
necessity you also probably want a DVD
burner especially considering how cheap
they are will be using HP black CD DVD
burner for twenty dollars we of course
we're going to need a case for a great
new computer and the Rosewill Challenger
should work perfect while you can go for
a smaller micro ATX case with built-in
power supply to save a few bucks by
stepping up to the Challenger you'll get
a full sized case that looks great and
features lots of cooling options
including front rear and top fans along
with space to add two more fans on
either side with plenty of room for
upgrades later on and a pair of USB 2
ports audio jacks and eSATA port up
front this is a great case for only 55
dollars last but not least we have a
system builders copy of Windows 7 home
premium 64-bit as the priciest item on
the entire built list at ninety five
dollars currently if you have another OS
you want to install you could definitely
save yourself quite a bit by removing
this option after all is said and done
as the February 19th 2011 the entire
list will cost you four hundred ninety
eight dollars and ninety one cents on
Newegg for under $500 you'll get a
surprisingly good computer for not only
gaining but of course surfing the web
watching high-definition videos and even
some moderate video editing of course
feel free to customize the bill to your
own liking depending on your needs you
might want to shift some of the budget
around you can find the entire list with
links to each part in the description of
this video if this was helpful be sure
