discussing what should we should expect
in the upcoming apple ipod event so the
first thing we want to talk about is
just when it's going to be some people
who have been kind of thought it was
going to be in August definitely does
not look like it's gonna be an August um
a lot of people for some reason think
that's going to be maybe like you know
that towards the middle to the end of
sep tember however letlet isn't making
sense and after doing a little bit of
research I'm fairly confident that it
will actually go on sep tember 8 so let
me just kind of explain so the main
reason why i think it's going to be on
September 8 it was a couple a couple of
reasons but the first one is that it
lines up perfectly with last year last
year's September ninth on a Wednesday
this year sep tember 8th on Wednesday
makes sense in addition I've also been
taking a little bit of look Apple has
been running a ipod event where
basically if you buy if your student you
buy a Mac you can get a free ipod touch
however this thing ends on the September
seventh now I think this actually makes
could make a lot of sense that they
would end the day before they announced
hold a new ipod is trying to get rid of
the old ones I've done this in the past
and I think it kind of makes sense so
guys I'm Matt Harrison sure that will be
on the eighth but that's kind of the
date I think I think it makes a lot of
sense a lot of things kind of point to
that now beyond that now I'm just go
ahead and talk a little bit about what I
expect to see now first and foremost is
absolutely new ipods hustle obviously
here's my ipod touch 2nd generation and
let's just go ahead and start with ipod
touch 4th generation so it looks it's
likely going to be very very similar to
this one um we're going to be a few key
improvements so thanks to a lot of
speculation everything it does look like
it will have a FaceTime camera so most
likely camera right about here you guys
can see in this shot right here of an
actual prototype ipod with the hole for
the facetime camera so right about where
you'd find the other speaker grill on a
iphone you likely will be able to find
the facetime camera on the next ipod
touch so i think it's going to be great
and actually because a lot of the lates
have kind of indicated that facetime
will be used for both email addresses or
phone numbers so you can actually go
ahead obviously because with an ipod
touch
phone number so it really what should be
of work just fine in addition I also
expect you go ahead and flip over the
ipod I also expect that we will be
seeing a camera now what kind of camera
this is gonna be I'm not entirely sure
now I've spoke on this previously it's
probably either going to be a similar
camera very similar to the iphone 3gs or
it's going to be a camera from the
iphone 4 personally I kind of tend to
think it will probably be more like on
the iphone 3gs however we really don't
know it might be something in between
but I'm just not 100 sure that actually
will be up to this part of the iphone 4
as of course ipod touch is very very
thin i'm not entirely sure if there's
actually room for it I'm so flipping
this back over so I do believe that
there will be both a front facing camera
and a rear facing camera now it likely
will also have a flash along not sure
about that but at any rate I do think
that the ipod touch is definitely gonna
be really nicely taken care of as far as
cameras go i'm now continuing on i also
think that the ipod touch will get the
retina display now no offense of course
the display on the iphone and ipod touch
i mean still looks just fine but I
really think that you know always the
ipod touch has followed the iphone so
when I forget something the ipod touch
gets it I don't see any reason why Apple
wouldn't decide to hold off on the
retina display for the next ipod touch
so of course this means going to be much
crisper much clearer looking and much
high resolution now moving on from this
pretty obvious but I do believe it will
we get all the same technical specs so
it should get the 1 gigahertz Apple
April processor as well as probably
about half a gigabyte of RAM so the next
ipod touch should be very very powerful
literally it almost identical to the
iphone 4 as far as speed sky have very
similar cameras if not the same cameras
it's going to be very similar to the
iphone 4 and i'll let see anybody
complaining about that now as far as
what the heck's ipod touch will look
like I'm a little unclear on most of
what everybody has been saying is that
it will likely keep this same sort of
design from the second the third
generation just with the added things
but I would not be surprised whatsoever
if they do decide to tweak something
it may be the corners get a little more
squared-off maybe they get rid of some
of the chrome or whatever I don't really
know but likely I wouldn't bet on a huge
thing I don't think the ipod will get
any larger smaller probably just minor
design tweaks any at all so now let's go
move on to some of the other things that
expect to probably see so one of which
is the apple itv or the Apple TV and if
you watch my videos you know I've talked
about this a couple times so it won't
rehash all that but basically I do
believe that the apple itv will probably
be shown this September now it also
might be shown maybe later on in the
year but I think it makes sense now the
apple itv just really quickly to refresh
is going to be very similar actually
about the size of an ipod touch or an
iphone it's going to be where instead of
you know having a large box that runs
the Apple TVs there's going to be
something very small ios-based that will
really kind of step it up and really
compete with Google TV so I'm not sure
about this one I'm brute I'm fairly
confident about vo seeing a next ipod
but I'm not so sure if we'll actually be
able to see the ITV September I think it
makes sense but will either see it sep
tember or maybe later on maybe early
next year so who knows about that um so
next is the next ipod nano now we
actually hurt a lot of really
interesting rumors about the next ipod
nano to be honest I'm not really all
that sure about them but I go ahead just
gave you guys some of my thoughts my
opinions and let you make your own
conclusions so some of those things that
people have been talking about is that
the ipod nano is actually going to morph
with the ipod touch and a rather with
the ipod shuffle and get a touch screen
yeah I now as you try to follow that so
basically what a lot of people have been
saying is that there is a 1.7 inch
touchscreen so of course this is a 3.5
inch showed me very small very small
touch screen it was leaked and people
saw it and it had apple branding line so
a lot of people think that actually
could be part of either the new ipod
shuffle or the new ipod nano or whether
they combine those lines or whatever
they decide to do so this would likely
be a nano probably a bit so good decent
bit smaller than a nano with a
touchscreen i most likely would get rid
of the click wheel and all a lot of you
guys look
click wheel I mean I think it's pretty
cool too but um as far as how it's going
to work i'm just going to still keep the
camera what the price is going to be if
it's going to replace both the Nano and
the shuffle or just going to be just an
all new ipod i'm not really sure but i
will say that while the ipod shuffle i
mean i think it's just getting too small
i don't think they can get any smaller
if you just be kind of ridiculous and as
far as the ipod nano i'm thinking they
really have just kind of hit a brick
wall there I mean yeah we've had ipod
nanos with click wheels and yeah it's
kind of nice to have a camera but really
there's not a whole lot of room to
improve upon it because I mean why not
go ahead you spend a little bit more
money get ipod touch which can obviously
do much much more so i do think that
they will go ahead and redo the ipod
line up on may be combined the two maybe
do something else but you know what you
have to say about that anyway guys I
will of course be when even if they do
whatever whatever time they decide to do
the ipod of event and i will of course
cover it live so you guys can go ahead
and subscribe to me if you like anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
