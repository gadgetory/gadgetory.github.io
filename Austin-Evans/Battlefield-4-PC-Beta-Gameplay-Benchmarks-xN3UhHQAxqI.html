battlefield for PC beta comes up for
everyone and even though it is only a
beta with a single multiplayer map I
figured it would be a good idea to run
it through a few graphics cars to see
exactly what kind of computer you're
going to need to run battlefield 4 first
of all let me go over the four different
quality settings low is well pretty low
textures are very basic and the lack of
anti-aliasing leaves a lot of jagged
lines bumping it up to medium is a huge
jump with lots more detail along with
real-time reflections on the street and
in the glass on the buildings high isn't
as big of a jump as it mostly focuses on
adding more reflections especially on
the ground along with high-res textures
and better lighting effects ultra
improves a bit on the detail but mostly
affects the lighting in shadows only
with giving you more detail on further
away objects to see what kind of
hardware you need to run battlefield 4
with I grabbed a few different graphics
cards and ran them through the game so
to keep things fair I used an Intel Core
i5 46 70k processor along with a
gigabytes of RAM to remove as much of
the CPU bottleneck as possible however
it definitely does look like battlefield
as a game that appreciates a powerful
processor so the game is fully out and I
can do a little bit more of thorough
testing I'll see exactly what kind of
CPU that you really need but for now I'm
mostly focusing on the graphics cards
with the Radeon 7750 low settings were
best to keep the frame rate from dipping
below 30 bumping that up to a Radeon
7870 it ran nice and smoothly on high
and for ultra GTX 760 did the trick if
you want max performance a single GTX
780 was able to keep things running
above 60 frames per second at pretty
much all times if you're going to be
grabbing the beta I'd really recommend a
Radeon 7770 or a GTX 650 Ti at minimum
as the game really does look quite nice
on medium you will need to install the
latest beta AMD or Nvidia driver to get
the best performance and I of course
have those linked in the description of
this video
but as of right now AMD cards tend to
work much better half the time the game
wouldn't even launched with the GTX 760
and I saw several crashes with both the
760 and 780 whereas I had no problems
with the am
Harden's once you get into the game
though it's actually really fun a huge
amount of the map is destructible from
the cars that are all over the map to
the central skyscraper that can be
destroyed by blowing up the supports the
beta map also nicely shows off how you
can use helicopters tanks and vehicles
boats and of course doing it on foot one
big part of the strategy is to use the
high ground you can use elevators and
helicopters go to the top of almost any
building on the map and rain down
bullets and missiles
so are you guys planning on downloading
the battlefield 4 beta tomorrow or do
you already have it definitely be sure
to let me know what you guys think about
the game in the comments below anyway
thank you so much for watching if you
enjoyed and you want to catch more
videos like this definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date with the latest
and greatest anyway guys I will catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
