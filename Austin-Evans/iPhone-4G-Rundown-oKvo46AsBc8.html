today I'm really excited to say I happen
absolutely 100 cent legit
hold on down at the iPhone 4G / HD tons
of stuff just happen guys Gizmodo
actually got a hands on of the next
iPhone they prove beyond any shadow of a
doubt that is 100% real and I'm gonna go
ahead and give you guys the full rundown
pictures all those leaked pictures we
saw yep they're real specs everything
you probably want to know and all kinds
of great stuff guys it's leaked anyway
let's get this one started
okay guys so let's go ahead and I'm just
go ahead and give you guys just the
straight-up facts right now the story
about how people are getting this and
all kind of stuff is a little bit shady
right now but I won't give you guys the
facts that we do know and that is that
Gizmodo has had the next iPhone for
about a week now
how they got it they said the same story
that they got it at a bar I'm gonna get
into that but it doesn't matter because
they do have it and Israel there's no
doubt so what they've done is that they
have checked it in iTunes X coding
system profiler and each time when they
plugged it in it showed up and that's a
that's a good thing because if it was a
fake it would've been almost impossible
to have it show up like that an edition
did not show up as a 3G or 4G yes it
showed up as an unidentified object well
that sounded weird but then identified
phone so that pretty much guarantees
that it is real in addition they did
take it apart somewhat and all the parts
in it were packed super tight just like
you expected Apple products and they're
all branded Apple anything guys there's
no doubt whatsoever that this is the
next iPhone okay guys I'm going to go
ahead and go over some of the features
it's a very iPad influenced design no
longer is it kind of
you know lots of tapered lines
everything it's a lot more squared off
but that's kind of like it looks pretty
cool now the way it is is it the front
looks almost identical the only major
difference you can see from the front is
the fact that it now has a front-facing
camera and yes guys it does finally
along the sides you'll see that the
buttons kind of look a little bit odd
but it's all a metal ring around the
phone it's a little bit different than
normal bezel it's not quite as shiny so
hopefully it won't be so problem just
scratching everything now I'm going to
flip it over on to the back it's totally
flat and I really like that it looks
very very modern and it just kind of
looks like a blue phone it's kind of
hard to say now they can do not know
what the back is they were kind of a
little bit unsure whether if it's like
glass or ceramic or something but it in
any case it looks like it's going to be
a pretty high quality another cool new
feature about the next iPhone is that it
has a higher quality camera as well as
flash now I'm not the kind of flash
you're thinking actually has a camera
flash the camera would you not know
exactly how high-quality it is but
hopefully it's game took megapixels and
maybe gained like maybe 720 video
shooting but what would you know for
sure is that it does have now have a
flash which is fantastic two more
features of the new iPhone is that it
now has noise cancellation via a
secondary microphone in the back this is
a feature in the Nexus One and it really
does seem to help the call quality it
really cleans up the audio and
automatically you know gets rid of all
of a background noise which in a phone
is powerful as you know the Nexus One
and likely the iPhone that's a really
good feature now we move on to the
display now we of course do not know the
exact specs yet but it does appear that
the screen is slightly smaller than long
current iPhone models which is a little
bit of a surprise we don't know the
exact size but I think it probably might
G just a little bit smaller but what it
lacks in size it's going to make up in
it with resolution as they weren't
actually able to open
the phone physically but what they were
able to do is get it susie you know
their connect to itunes screen and
basically just purely comparing that to
you know compare to connect to itunes
screen another phone they can easily
tell that it looked much much better you
couldn't see any pixels so the good
money I would think is on a 960 by 480
display
we don't know for sure it definitely
looks like that right now now they were
at actually able to get the iPhone
running it supposedly is running 4.0
which makes sense but Apple is able to
remotely kill it which i 100% believe
because of course they would have a kill
switch so unfortunately they actually
aren't able to use the phone basically
all I can do is get to the restore
screen you know the connect to itunes
but guys based on the information we
have so far there's no doubt whatsoever
in my mind this is the next iPhone now
the software there might be some new
things and of course we don't know all
about the maybe of the specs like the
processor and the RAM that kind of thing
but what we do know for sure is that the
design and I like the design it's not
perfect there's a lot of like lines and
stuff that kind of seemed a little bit
on but I really don't think it's going
to be that big a deal on the iPhone this
is the first really redesigned iPhone in
my opinion that really is moved it
forward because really since the very
first iPhone you can compare all three
of the iPhones we have out today and
they all look extremely similar this one
doesn't go a long way but it's much
thinner and it loses love the tapered
lines for more straight angular lines
which I like a lot anyway guys that's
about all we know about the iPhone 4G /
HD we still know the name but yeah guys
so definitely make a comment what you
think personally I really really like it
the sign looks really good in my opinion
I was never a huge fan of although you
know the tapered lines and everything
and is really like this thinner and it
actually looks like it's going to get a
little bit smaller as well not by a
large amount but it's it's just going to
be enough so anyway guys that's my full
wrap-up I will definitely stay tuned
to the channel I will be doing many many
many more videos as we get more
information and all the kind good stuff
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
