here with my review of the new iPad 3 as
the successor to the iPad 2 which hold
roughly 400 gajillion units the new iPad
has a lot to live up to but is it worth
it at first land it's hard to tell the
new iPad from the iPad 2 both have a
nearly identical design and this really
isn't a bad thing up front you have a
VGA front-facing camera along the home
button and Retina display like the iPad
2 you can get the new iPad in both black
and white as well as in 16 32 and 64
gigabyte capacities as well as with and
without 4G LTE the back and size of the
iPad are milled out of a single piece of
aluminum with nothing but Apple and iPad
logos on the back taking a closer look
at the specs you'll see it's slightly
thicker and heavier than the previous
iPad but it's for a good reason that
I'll get into in a minute overall if
you've ever tried an iPad 2 you'll know
what to expect here a very premium
product that looks and feels great of
course I can't do a review of the new
iPad without talking about its
headlining feature the Retina display
compared to the original iPad and iPad 2
it has quadruple resolution in 2048 by
1536 pixels to put it in perspective a
high-definition TV is typically going to
have a resolution of 1920 by 1080 while
a lot of Apple's marketing is over at
the top I think they're spot on what's
the iPad 3 screen it simply is the best
not only will you not be able to see
individual pixels normally but the color
and saturation of excellent especially
as you turn the brightness up and
general usage I got between 8 and 10
hours out of a charge which is roughly
in line with the 10 hours that Apple
quotes somewhat surprisingly however is
the fact that the new iPad has a lot
bigger battery the iPad 2 has a 25 watt
hour battery in comparison the iPad 3
has 40 2.5 watt hours of capacity which
is even larger than the MacBook Air 11
inch has the Retina display is the
culprit here and your battery life can
be as low as 4 or 5 hours with the
brightness turned all the way up
charging times are also much longer
taking 6 hours or more to get a full
charge while we're being on GE here
let's talk a bit about what makes the
new iPad tick it's powered by an Apple
a5x chip which combines a dual-core 1
gigahertz CPU with a quad-core GPU the
processor is basically identical to the
iPad 2 and only slightly faster than the
iPhone 4s but the GPU is twice as
powerful with an additional two cores
compared to the iPad 2 it also has twice
as much RAM at one gigabyte
well this looks like a nice upgrade on
paper it ends up being roughly the same
since the new iPad has to push a lot
more pixels on the display those extra
two GPU cores ended up making the
performance just about even with the
iPad 2 that's not bad as the last iPad
was no slouch when it comes to
performance but it would have been nice
to have a more substantial upgrade
regardless the new iPad is still very
fast and fluid when doing most tasks it
also runs the same version of iOS 5.1 as
of recording this review it remains very
similar to on the iPhone and iPod Touch
and identical to older models of the
iPad although you now get Siri voice
dictation which allows you to use your
voice instead of typing unfortunately
the full version of Siri isn't available
the new iPad also has a brand new 5
megapixel iSight camera around back its
a mix between the iPhone 4 and 4s
cameras and it's really quite good
pictures are nice and sharp and nearly
as good as on the iPhone 4s alright so
I'm now recording using the rear facing
camera on the new iPad one should give
you guys a little example here now of
course no matter what you do the iPad is
enormous you're not really gonna want to
you know use it as a camera or anything
for recording however the camera no dad
do have to say is not too bad so of
course it has all the features from the
iPhone 4 as well as the 4s there I did
it just tapped focus it's not quite as
with the 4s camera but I do think it's a
slight bit better than the iPhone 4 just
like the iPhone 4s was a moderate
upgrade from the iPhone 4 so 2 is the
new iPad compared to the iPad 2 the
screen is fantastic battery life remains
solid the gaming performance is
top-notch and the new camera is quite a
bit better
having optional support for 4G LTE with
3G worldwide is also a nice improvement
that said if you have an iPad 2 I really
don't recommend upgrading the only major
benefit is a better screen and while
I'll be the first to admit it's
absolutely excellent
I really don't consider that enough of a
reason to upgrade however if this is
your first tablet or you're upgrading
from an original iPad or other tablet
then I have no issues in recommending
the new iPad it's simply as good as it
gets
