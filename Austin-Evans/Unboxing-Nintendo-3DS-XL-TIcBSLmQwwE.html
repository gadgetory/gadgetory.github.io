here with an unboxing of the Nintendo
3ds XL has a much larger counterpart to
the current 3ds is the first refresh in
the line but is it for you first thing
is to get the Box open slip the tape on
the top and slide out the good stuff
first of all you'll see the AR cards
replying augmented reality games the
club nintendo pamphlet QuickStart guide
in three languages and the beefy
instruction manual unlike some other
countries the US version of the 3ds XL
comes with the standard charger Nintendo
has been using since the DSi last but
not least we have the 3ds XL on blue
which is quite obviously the superior
color compared to the standard 3ds you
can immediately see the four point eight
inch 3d screen makes a big difference it
keeps the same thickness and gets a much
cleaner design similar to the DSi which
it's a thumbs up in my book all the
glossy surfaces have also been replaced
with matte and this is another change
I'm a fan of taking a look around you'll
see the same button layout with a few
tweaks here and there like the Select
home and start buttons inside you'll
also see a front-facing camera and the
3d depth slider what you won't find is
the second circle pad along the right
side is the Wi-Fi switch stylus which is
thankfully been returned to the proper
position and an included four gigabyte
SD card around back you'll see an
identical layout to the 3ds including
the charging port game slot and infrared
blaster for accessories like the Circle
Pad Pro at first glance the 3dsxl seems
to make a lot of small but appreciate
changes from its predecessor but
definitely stay tuned to the channel as
I'll be doing a comparison between this
and the original 3ds as well as a full
review if you enjoyed definitely be sure
to leave this video a thumbs up and if
