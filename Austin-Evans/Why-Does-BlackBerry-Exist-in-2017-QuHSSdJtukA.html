blackberries to exist but why at what
point black berry was pretty much
synonymous with the word smartphone
however over the last few years they
made some questionable decision first up
we have the blackberry Passport now this
is very much sort of the last hurrah of
the BlackBerry 10 devices as it was
still completely manufactured by
blackberry ran their software and had a
very much blackberry keyboard so this
guy was released back in 2014 however
it's just a little bit different than
the old BlackBerry's back in the day as
a size comparison this is what the
passport looks like compared to a galaxy
s7 well it's not that much taller it is
so wide like this is that's a crazy
crazy phone in the hand I go say the
weight is unique there's definitely no
other phone out there with such a big
display and an actual physical keyboard
so it's rocking a 4.5 inch 1440 by X
1440 display it might be a little bit
weird to have a modern smartphone with a
square screen but in this case it
actually does kind of make sense as
having that keyboard on the bottom is
sort of a blackberry trademark by Kesha
it might be a blackberry trademark an
actual micro trademark something kind of
cool about the passport is that the
keyboard is actually a touch pad so for
example I can use it to scroll up and
down on this or maybe swipe left or
right depending on what it is and of
course it has a touchscreen so that kind
of negates a lot of usefulness of a
touch pad but it is a sort of useful
feature to have
I liked how before you even let you get
into the phone you have to read about
blackberry and how there a global leader
in mobile communication sure guys
alright so we are up and running with
the blackberry Passport
even though this phone is a couple years
old at this point it actually has pretty
reasonable specs so inside it has not
Dragon 801 processor paired with three
gigabytes of RAM and it also has a
pretty monstrously sized 30 450 million
power battery putting a lot of phones
even from 2017 to shame well it coats
the bb10 it's actually not that bad so
some things that I like about it is just
how easy it is to multitask everything
is very nice and smooth pretty
responsible especially considering this
is a few year old phone and when it
comes to apps there are some so for
example if you open up you cube app it's
just a web app which is the same for a
fair few of these but to be fair stuff
like the Twitter app actually we're
reasonably well and you also do have
some support for Android app this is
done through the Amazon App Store the
way it works is there's a virtual
version of Android running on top of VB
10 so if I jump into something like
Spotify it works pretty much as you
would expect some apps don't really take
too kindly to the square screen and
generally speaking performance isn't
great but it does work now beyond that
you can't have some issues so for
example a game like cross your robe just
completely fails to do anything for me
but considering that this is an older
phone it's running sort of a clergy put
together gross version of Android the
app support is not terrible honestly
there's a lot I really do like about
this passport if it was running an
up-to-date version of Android I actually
don't give this a shot next up we have
the blackberry print now this is an
interesting phone for one big reason it
was the first BlackBerry to ship with
Android instead of vbos
take a look at the box and you'll see
they promise privilege and privacy that
is quite the statement to put on your
phone crack this one open and you'll see
a blackberry that looks a little bit
different so at first glance it looks
like a traditional smartphone however if
you roll it up roll it up it actually
does have a full keyboard while the
passport is a really wide phone the
print is incredibly tall of course once
you slide the keyboard down it's not
that much bigger than an average phone
and do you fear the hardware here is
pretty nice it does feel a little bit
plasticky even with the fake
carbon-fiber on the back but it feels
pretty reasonable in the hand it's less
you're consuming that you do have that
physical keyboard I think why Barry did
a pretty good job of engineering it into
the probe so the mechanism feels pretty
solid if you open it up you can feel
just a little bit of flex in the chassis
but it's not too bad but of course
you're getting a very standard
smartphone not even considering that
there is a full keyboard inside the
physical keyboard is decent I don't
think it really quite matches up some of
the earlier blackberries like the bold I
think it just is a little bit mushy err
than I'd like but again I've been on
software keyboards for years so this is
something that's a really big deal to
you I think the Priven might make some
sense but honestly I would probably use
it with keyboard down all the time so
then it really jumps out to me is the
display not only is it 1440p but it's
also OLED and it really shows the colors
are nice the blacks are dark honestly I
really do like the hardware
this phone the proof was the first like
very Android phone but it is most
certainly not the last that's where the
D tech 50 comes in
so this while it has the BlackBerry name
on it is very much not a true blackberry
well this was launched less than a year
ago what you're really getting here is a
little more than a rebadged Alcatel idol
4 so now I did not have a way of getting
out of the box so gone or most of the
traditional sort of blackberry things
like BlackBerry OS is this guy runs
Android as well as a physical keyboard
it very much is exactly what it looks
like a fairly generic 300 dollar
smartphone so here we're getting fairly
close to stock Android there are of
course some BlackBerry apps including
bbm which of course is already available
on Android and iOS anyway right now as
well as DTEC so this is all about
security so in theory this is going to
allow you to amplify the security of a
traditional Android device and it kind
of works so you can see here they'll
give me some sort of warnings as far as
in you set up a screen lock or Tron data
encryption it also reminds me that I am
using a BlackBerry device and therefore
device hardware is a-ok I guess but
generally speaking this is not really
anything that special compared to other
devices specifically Samsung which also
has a very similar style of software so
all these phones aren't running Android
7 just yet they are at least fully up to
date so if you check the Android
security patch it's for March 5th which
is just a couple weeks ago from when I'm
recording this video and that's nice to
see especially since the prep is coming
up on two years old of course it would
be nice to have a newer version of
Android to go along with it
but at the very least they are keeping
these up to date and since it's a fairly
soft version of Android hopefully those
updates will continue for a little while
so well I don't really recommend these
phones there's nothing necessarily wrong
with blackberry sure they're nowhere
near as big as they used to be but these
days they're making decent Android
phones with solid hardware and some
legitimately cool features such as a
physical keyboard it might not be for
everyone but I do believe there's a
place for blackberry 2017 so would you
guys buy a blackberry let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
