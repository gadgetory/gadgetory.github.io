episode of d3 live so team going to be
talking a lil bit about some of the
future Apple products is pretty much on
everyone's mind right now which is of
course the iphone 5 in the ipod touch 5
so of course this want some of the
biggest things around when you know the
new phone comes around everyone talks
about it there's Luke's rumors just like
last year with iphone 4 so today I want
to give you guys a kind of a recap of
what we know we think we know and all
that kind of stuff so to begin with
let's take a look at the iphone 5 now
the one of the biggest things about the
iphone is that it is late this year
pretty much every year since the iphone
was first announced back in two thousand
seven it's been released on a yearly
schedule we always see it at WWDC
usually rather than the beginning of
june they show it off and then we're
able to get a little bit later over this
year that's not the case as WWDC is
common went and no iphone 5 was to be
found so as far as we know the best shot
for seeing the iphone 5 this year will
be September or typically Apple does
their ipod event and shows off the new
ipods and occasionally a couple of max
but what looks like is this year this
September we will see not only the
iphone 5 but also the ipod and probably
a couple of other new products as well
and as far as what two specials the
iphone 5 there's been a lot of talk but
have been people who think it's just
going to be the iphone 4 with perhaps
the dual core apple a5 processor and
then on the other hand there have been
people who say it's going to be a
dramatic redesign it's going to be a lot
more you know kind of taper a little bit
more like the ipod touch or perhaps like
the macbook air with you know the kind
of the tapered lines and more of a
unibody style rather than kind of
sandwich ice cream bar looking thing of
the iphone 4 now as far as i'm concerned
i can tend to think that it will be more
of a total redesign i know i mean
there's nothing majorly wrong with the
iphone 4 design it's still a great
looking phone but especially with the
antenna that's not fantastic and the
fact that it almost looks a little bit
chunky a little bit industrial compared
to some of these other new designs from
other companies it would be surprised we
actually see a bit of a more tapered off
design on the iphone 5 as far as the
specs goes i think it's going to be
pretty obvious we're going to see the
apple a5 processor we may see some other
things such as you know like better ram
and you know some small things like that
but for the most part i think it's going
to be just an incremental upgrade kinds
of keeping it on par with the ipad 2
and as far as the screen goes it has
also been a lot of talk that will be a
little bit of a larger screen currently
the iphone 4 has a 3.5 introduced in
supply which is what all iphones and
ipod touches it that in the past like I
wouldn't be surprised we see it a little
bit bigger preps like an edge-to-edge
display it perhaps 3.7 inches it's kind
of hard to tell exactly how big it will
be but most likely the screen will be a
little bit bigger and while still of
course staying a Retina display now as
far as the ipod touch 5 goes i think a
lot of the same things apply i think
that you know iphone ipod touch are
always been very very close pretty much
ipods just you know an iphone without
you know the cellular radio so i think a
lot of things that are from the iphone
five will come across so we'll see the
apple a5 processor most likely the
larger display we may see a little bit
of a redesign now personally I would
love it if they got rid of the the
aluminum or other type of stain let's do
whatever the type of backing that the
ipod touch has it's so shiny it
literally absolutely requires you to use
a case I mean I've had iPod Touches for
a while and the thought of using one
with that a case is kind of kind of
scared at you scary a little bit so I
really wish that they would get some
kind of I don't care if it's a matte
finish or maybe perhaps different colors
for the ipod touch or something but just
allow us to actually use them without
some big bulky case on it beyond that
like i said probably a larger screen you
know Apple a5 processor perhaps more RAM
when we surprised perhaps when I see 128
gigabyte ipod touch this year you know
it's always a possibility you know
always kind of creeping up getting ready
to you know get rid of the the ipod
classic but as far as a the overall
design goes i wouldn't be surprised if
it does stay the same it might not even
change at all we might a little bit of a
better camera whatever but for the most
part i'm not really looking forward to
the ipod touch 5 too much i think it's
just going to be more of a incremental
upgrade okay so for the second sent me
of d3 live i'll be taking live questions
from everyone in the chat as always
every episode of d3 light is filmed in
from a live audience our blog to me got
quite a few people in the room right now
so squad just take a couple of questions
where do I see tablets in the next five
years well you know if I knew the answer
to that I would definitely go take it to
the bank and be a millionaire I think
tablets are going to be huge but where
what direction they're going to take it
I really can't say I mean really tablets
are just in their infancy I mean if you
took a look at like the very first
smartphone
you know like like some of the early
palm devices or maybe like a riginal
blackberry that was one of the very
first smartphones we look at smartphones
today they are radically different and I
think the same is gonna go for tablets I
think tablets are pretty good right now
but you know in the next five years or
so I mean I can't even imagine where
they're gonna be I mean I I cannot think
that they're not just gonna just totally
take off in some direction that we have
no idea about so yeah I think in the
next five years tablets going to
definitely go up but exactly like what
they're going to do and all that kind of
stuff and what kind of amazing new
features that we definitely can't live
without with live without they're coming
I have no idea um when will the next
version of green poison for iOS 4.3
point 3 be released as far as I know
they are still working on I know they've
always said the green poison will
support four point three point three but
as far as I know they're still trying to
work on the ipad 2 jailbreak before the
four point three point three for
everything since there's off course
already redsnow for that but i don't
know exactly what it's happening or
anything like that but i do know that it
is in the works how much do I think the
ipod touch 5g will cost 5g doesn't sound
quite right but yeah the next ipod touch
will almost definitely be around the
same price they did bump the price up a
little bit when they put out the fourth
generation model but to be honest I mean
it may vary a little bit maybe a little
bit more expensive maybe a little bit
cheaper but to be honest I would imagine
pretty much the same kind of price point
says right now but the only way I really
see it you know varying at all is if
they introduce like a 128 gig model or
perhaps they get rid of eight gig but
that's just as more of capacity I mean
as far as the actual prices go like I
don't think it's going to be a major
difference I do I think iOS 5 will be
out before the next iPhone no I think
they will probably come at the same time
typically that's the way it works is you
know they announced iOS 5 or whatever
the next version of the iphone firmware
is they announced it in like two three
months so later they will announce that
and release it alongside the iphone the
new iphone either so yeah i think
probably in September is when we will
both see the final version of iOS 5 push
out to all the devices as well as when
the iphone five will be released is
there going to be some a new ipod
classic this year you know that's a hard
question answer i mean
they cut the ipod classic around for a
long time they have not i mean really
since the you know the ipod touch came
out if pretty much put a lot of the
other ipods well i would say the ipod
classic the most they put it just kind
of on the back burner i mean they
haven't discontinued it may be a couple
of little tiny things but for the most
part they just kind of lets below and i
think if we do see an ipod touch with
120 gigabytes of storage this year i
think that will finally kill off the
ipod classic i mean they may still keep
it around I don't know but as far as a
new design goes I really don't see that
happening um will there be a refresh for
all ipods are just iphone and ipod touch
well I definitely do think that we will
see iPhone iPod Touch refreshes most
likely will see an ipod nano Apple has
been really good about continuously
adding steps the ipod nano of different
heard a lot of rumors about perhaps a
camera for that as far as the shuffle
those i'm not sure we may see a new
version of the shuffle but if you take a
look at like the last kind of
generations of the ipod shuffle it's
pretty much been well we're just
bouncing around between ideas like that
fourth generation felt like the second
generation and there's not a whole lot
you can do it's not like you can make it
the size of a grain of salt and you know
put it in your hand or something I mean
there's not a whole lot more than you
can do with it so um what I'm looking
for right now is just a new ipod nano
iphone and ipod touch we may see a new
shuffle or we may see a new classic but
i don't really see anything like that
happening it's possible but now i don't
really think it's all that likely why do
you think the ipod 5 is being made so
soon after the ipod 4 actually it's not
I pods have been on a yearly cycle for
bloggers since the first one came out
and it's almost been a year since ipod
touch 4th generation comes out so i
don't really see any problem it's been
practically a lil assuming comes out in
September will be exactly one year just
like every other ipod models so yeah I
don't see any problem with that at all
