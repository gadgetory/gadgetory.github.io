motorola cliq 2 this is the one of the
newest phones is that you're going to be
a 4g enabled phone for tmobile in the
united states then just give you guys a
little quick look so one thing most
interesting things i think is this
keyboard
yes we see that right there the very
interesting keyboard focus and almost
looks like it's hard to say what it
tackler looks like it's definitely very
unique and I've got to say it's it works
a lot better than it looks personally I
don't really particularly like the look
of it but definitely works very well and
the keys you guys can see probably not
too well but it's it's a pretty decent
people don't believe any of these on the
side a little bit of wasted space but
again it's a nice stylish-looking fum
that's the way to show you guys it does
run Android 22 so nothing brand-new or
anything like that but still not too bad
not bad at all as far as the software
goes focus here pretty standard motorola
fair if you can use just the kind of
standard motoblur s
technical call motor boat or not but it
works pretty well now this does have a
guy said 4g for t-mobile so if your
auntie what we can't go ahead and access
their hsdpa plus network or 4g is the
pre much calling it I'm also just have a
one dear hurts processor now I believe
I'm not have insurance the same
processor is in the droid x but don't
hold me on that I don't think it does
have the dual quad I think it's just a
standard but overall I'm pretty good at
11 show you guys the back here here you
have a camera it's a 5 megapixel camera
got a nice texture on the back up two
guys that is motorola cliq tuned for
t-mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
