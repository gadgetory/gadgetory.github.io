here with a review of the new iPod Nano
7th generation this brings back a much
more traditional design but is it any
good first step is to pop open the box
and inside you'll find the iPod Nano and
yellow although in person it's pretty
green you'll also find the new lightning
cable to charge and sync and the Apple
earpods
which look like the old earbuds but
actually don't sound bad at all pop the
screen protector off and finally the
iPod is free take a look around the iPod
Nano and you'll see it's absurdly small
along the left side you'll see the
volume rockers as well as a center
button which allows you to pause skip
tracks and more the top houses the
sleep/wake button and on bottom you'll
see the Lightning jack plastic window
for the Bluetooth antenna and the
headphone jack
to give you a better idea of how thin
the new Nano is it's identical in
thickness to the cable on the earpods
hook and a pair of beefier headphones
and the Nano looks downright silly
speaking of audio of course that's what
an iPod is all about with the included
headphones the Nano sounds perfectly
fine with a moderate amount of bass and
solid overall quality hook up a pair of
more power-hungry headphones like the
audio technica ath em 50s and the iPod
will drive them just fine although of
course not as well as with a proper set
up even though it looks just like iOS
Apple officially calls this the Nano OS
and it's not hard to see why you have no
support for apps and Wi-Fi is nowhere to
be found so it's best not to go toss
your iPhone away just yet to navigate
you can swipe back from any screen or
hit the home button to go to the home
screen it's very responsive and features
a 2.5 inch display with a resolution of
240 by 432 in addition to music you can
always watch a video on the tiny display
it plays 480p video syncs from iTunes
and the player is just fine but honestly
I can't imagine anyone actually wanting
to watch a movie on something that's
small same goes for pictures you can
view them but it's not something
terribly useful mackay plus is built-in
along with a pedometer which can be
helpful for exercising you'll find a few
more apps like radio podcasts and a
clock but don't expect to do much more
than listen to music on it battery life
is really impressive I've been using the
Nano off and on for several days now
with the screen on full brightness and
I've only just dented my first charge
the thing with the iPod Nano is that
it's still entirely tethered to iTunes
want to add a song hopefully you don't
have Spotify because you're going to
need to import the music into iTunes
find your lightning cable let the iPod
stop anything you were doing and then
transfer the files over with music
available effortlessly everywhere you
turn on smartphones and even the iPod
touch this
feels like a major hassle don't get me
wrong the iPod Nano is the best iPod for
music yet it's tiny uncomplicated and
amazingly enough plays mp3s the thing is
that's exactly what the first iPod Nano
did when I bought it in 2005 if this was
100 dollars I'd say it makes sense but a
$150 it's not much less than the vastly
more useful iPod Touch which makes it a
hard sell don't forget to hit up that
like button and if you're interested in
more videos like this I've got lots of
coverage of the new iPod touch anyway I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
