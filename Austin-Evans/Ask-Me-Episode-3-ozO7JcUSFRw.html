if you ever seen this before this is my
series i'm doing it every couple weeks
where I talk about just all the kinds of
questions you guys asked me on twitter
facebook and in the comments Tom for
celtics asks haircut I hope I answered
your question Austin 78 on YouTube asks
what are some tips for becoming a
partner what do you think is the most
popular genre of videos on YouTube right
now well that's kind of a double sided
question as far as becoming a partner
it's actually not all that difficult the
number one thing you need is
determination you need to be able to
make good videos if you're determined if
you're making lots of really good videos
about whatever John root you're most
interested in you will get partner
eventually and you will do a good job
all right now as far as what's the best
genre um well I think comedy has always
been a big john ruag has been good I
mean there's a lot of different ways
that you can go about on youtube so i
don't really recommend just looking for
some specific genre that's really most
popular instead look for something that
you're good at so for example i know a
lot about tech and everything like that
so that's what I'm doing not certainly
not the most popular genre but because
it is something I know a lot about and
everything that's the way I decide to go
but of course if you're big in the
comedy or think you'd be a good vlogger
or I mean there are so many different
kinds of genres on youtube I really go
for what you're good at see me now on
YouTube asks are you excited to the PS
Vita especially about the games coming
on launch well yeah I'm definitely
looking forward to the PS Vita the 3ds
was kind of excited about and then I'll
started seeing some of the games that
were coming out or something games that
weren't coming out rather I kind of lost
interest pretty quickly however the
video looks fantastic I love having a
ton of power in a handheld and they
really look like somebody just threw
everything at he's got all the best
specs it's got all kinds of really cool
features so I'm definitely looking
forward to that as far as the gains are
going to be coming out at launch they've
only announced a few as of right now we
don't even know if they're actually
going to be out at launch or maybe a
little bit later but from what the games
that we've seen so far I'm definitely
looking forward to several of them you
know especially uncharted that one looks
pretty good i've always been waiting to
go ahead and take a look at it on the
playstation 3 so to be able to take a
look at on the v would definitely be
pretty cool take tutorials 01 asks what
camera do I have well the camera i use
for almost all of my videos and 1 i'm
using
now is the nikon d 3100 it's a great
entry level DSLR i've had it for about
6-7 months or so now i've been filming
pretty much all my videos ever since
then with it and i really do like it
there's definitely a lot to like about
using DSLRs for video with
interchangeable lenses and all that kind
of good stuff but yeah okay interesting
question oh p.s girl 2010 asks do
companies send you these electronics to
review or do you buy them for yourself
what's a bit of a mix really most of the
stuff i review is brought by myself so
Frank Poole microphones all that kind of
stuff if I buy it odds are i'm going to
go ahead and review it but of course
companies do from time to time send me
some various electronics phones or what
have you z tutorials asks do you think
minecraft on the xbox will be a failure
I think so because everyone who wants it
already has another computer mobile on
the other hand should be a big hit oh
yeah I kind of tend to agree with you
although I definitely wouldn't you know
knock out the Xbox just yet I definitely
think a lot of people who are interested
in Minecraft will have already bought a
computer since it's not particularly you
know resource-hungry most computers will
be able to run it I think a lot of the
people who have done that but I
definitely do think there's going to be
a big market for on the Xbox you know
xbox gamers typically are not really big
into the pc and of course that's kind of
speaking speaking broadly but most xbox
gamers only game on their xbox so to
have a brand-new game like Minecraft
that all their friends have talked about
for quite a while I do think we'll do
fairly well as far as mobile I
definitely agree with you there I think
especially on the xperia play with the
physical buttons it's gonna be fantastic
fatso jiggly double-oh-seven asks what
video editing software do you use oh
well that's particularly double-oh-seven
i use coral videostudio pro x4 it's my
favorite video editing software I've
done some videos on it before and on a
side note your username is very awesome
no one now twitter asks do you think
youtube live will become a success like
blog to be a new stream well i
definitely think there's the opportunity
i haven't tried it yet it's only slowly
rolling out to people i think one of the
biggest things i don't think that really
youtube is mean to send it out to
everyone it's going to be partner only
for at least for the foreseeable future
and so since it's only going to be for
you know a few thousand people i don't
think they're going to open it up to
everyone just yet so i don't really
think they're looking to compete but who
knows later on wants to get some more
features flushed out once they allow
everyone to use it I think it definitely
could be a pretty good contender Rochus
92 on twitter asks when do you think
about Microsoft and Sony preparing their
new consoles for 2012 is it poss
well certainly possible they definitely
I have no doubt in my mind that they are
working on the next generation Xbox and
Playstation right now I'm pretty sure
that's a given as far as when they will
be released and announced everything not
one hundred percent convinced as far as
the Xbox goes the next-generation Xbox I
wouldn't be surprised if we do at least
see them announce it at the next year
probably III now just because they
announced it doesn't mean that it might
not be a year or more until it actually
comes out so it could be very well be as
a two two and a half years of xbox and
even three three and a half years to
PlayStation 4 see I definitely think
it's possible that we might see some
glimpse they might talk about in a
little bit next year but I certainly
wouldn't expect anything but the way you
to come out frederick norton on facebook
asks Phil Harrison recently claimed that
apple will dominate the gaming market
within 10 years do you agree with this
statement uh well you know I think it's
a little bit of a hard thing to just say
you know it's definitely gonna happen or
it's not gonna happen i mean i could see
if Apple really decided to go into the
gaming market really go for it not just
app store which of course is definitely
doing very well its own right but if
they decide we're gonna make a console
like an iPod with your touch controls or
something if they're really going to go
for that and go maybe like the Apple TV
turn it more of a console if they really
went for it I could definitely see them
becoming a major competitor as of right
now though I really don't think that
Apple is aiming that market I mean sure
the games they've got games on ipods and
mac app store and some stuff like that
but until they make a major decision to
go yeah you know what we're going to go
ahead and start making games we're going
to make this a big focus of the company
but i don't really see them taking over
you know Sony and Apple and Microsoft
rather anyway guys that's it for this
third episode of asked me as always if
you're interested in asking questions be
sure to leave them in the comments or
