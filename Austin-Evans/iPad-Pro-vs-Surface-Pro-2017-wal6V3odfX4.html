going to compare what are arguably two
of the most important tablets all right
now the brand new iPad pro versus the
surface pro this might seem like a weird
comparison but they line up surprisingly
well not even counting that they came
out looking like a couple days of each
other so to start with we have the 2017
version of the surface pro so they
actually hooked us up with the review
unit early which is funny because it has
not packaged for retail sale on the box
so I'm going to bust it anyway because
that's what I do so the service pro as
far as hardware wise should be very very
similar to the surface pro 4 they've
made it a couple of small feet mostly
like smoothing out corners and whatnot
but the hardware itself of the
dimensions are pretty much unchanged
inside we have what should be the power
adapter so these are our surface laptop
video you know that not only is this
adapter magnetic which is kind of cool
but it also has a USB port on it next we
had the iPad pro 12 point 9 inch again
another new product and again something
that actually really hasn't changed much
since the previous generation at least
on the outside side here we have yet
again pretty straightforward so this is
the actual iPad itself and silver we
also have the lightning cable some Apple
paperwork as well as the very very small
power adapter the problem is this is a
tiny 12 watt adapter so compared to the
44 watt power cable for the actual
surface this takes forever to charge a
big iPad like this it still always
surprised me a little bit when I touch
one of these iPads because it is just so
huge I mean look at this this is an iPad
feel like it's a actually is it bigger
than the surface oh yeah
the surface is actually smaller than the
iPad which I guess makes sense to 12.3%
of twelve point nine inch display but
Wow one area where the surface
definitely does have an advantage is
with ports so again like the surface
laptop we have the magnetic surface
connector which can be used not to power
it but also for the dock we also have a
full size USB 3 port mini display
there's also a headphone jack on this
side and you pop open the kickstand
inside of here is a tiny little micro SD
card slot the iPad has a lightning
connector and a headphone jack so for
basic tablet use this is fine when it
comes to say connecting a USB device or
wanting to use a second display the
surface wins hands down so they all
going for this
service is the cake stand so not only
will have stand up by itself right out
of the box but the kickstand is also
very adjustable so pretty much all the
way flat you bring it up and it'll stop
anywhere along the way it does add a lot
of flexibility with the ice ahead you
pretty much have to have a cover or a
keyboard to get it to stand up by itself
that is where the smart keyboard comes
in
so like earlier versions all does just
snap-on with magnets to the side of the
iPad and then once you fold it out get
yourself a pretty decent keyboard that's
going to be attached to the iPad so it
only does the iPad now support quite a
few different keyboard shortcuts so I
can open up something like spotlight I
can actually command tabs go between
different apps and the keyboard itself
is finished full-size and it feels easy
to type on the issue is there's very
little travel it really does not measure
up to something like a proper laptop
keyboard by comparison the surface type
cover feels a lot better this has actual
key travel so this actually makes a big
difference and not only is this a full
layout with backlighting which the iPad
is not it also has a trackpad so well
yes the trackpad is not super necessary
on something with a touchscreen I find I
use with touchscreen about like 80% of
the time or so but sometimes it's nice
to be able to reach down and just be
able to mouse over to something the
issue is that none of these actually
come with their keyboards so the tight
cover for the surface is going to run
you 130 or 160 for this Alcantara
version and the smart keyboard for the
iPad pro is a hundred and seventy
dollars which is a shame because you
really do need the keyboards to get the
most out of these devices one area you
can't complain about with these tablets
are the displays so the surface pro is
rocking a twelve point three inch panel
with a resolution of 27 36 by 18 24 this
pixels this display looks phenomenal no
one looking at the surface display is
going to be disappointed but the issue
is the iPad screen is just better
not only does the iPad have a bigger
twelve point nine inch display with a
resolution of 2732 by 2048 but it also
has some cool features such as true
tones who adjust the white balance
depending on what room you're in
it gets really bright with 600 nits of
brightness but what blows all that away
is promotion what that means is that the
iPad pro has a 120 Hertz refresh rate
display now that's one that you find on
stuff like high-end gaming monitors and
it most awesome in person so in video
it's a little bit harder to show but the
animations are incredibly fluid and also
more important than that it feels super
super responsive hey guys
lonstein this is the fairphone 2 and it
is a fully modular smartphone the
speakers on the iPad pro are also
top-notch
so actually has four speakers so there's
going to be one on each corner and
combined it sounds better than a lot of
laptop hey guys Boston this is the
fairphone 2 and it is a fully modular
smartphone the surface actually does
sound pretty good as well so there's two
front-facing speakers but compared to
the iPad it's just not as loud all
models of the iPad pro now come with the
Apple a 10 X this is a monster of a
processor with six cores three
performance and three low power cores
paired with four gigabytes of RAM it is
a lot for an iPad the surface comes with
quite a few different configurations so
not only can you get it with a core m3i
5 or i7 processor that also has 4 8 and
16 gigabyte ram options both the core m3
and i-5 models are going to be fanless
just like the iPad but regardless of
which surface you pick up they're all
going to be dual core chips based on the
new Intel KB like process now that's
cool but on paper the iPad has a big
core count advantage run them through
deep bench and results are surprising so
not only is the iPad faster when you
consider single core scores but on the
multi-threaded side it is significantly
faster than the surface now this is a
Core i5 processor it's not even the base
model and yet the iPad pro is still
faster that is impressive
also Intel is probably really scared
right now all the power in the world
doesn't mean much without software to
take advantage of it so the iPad pro
ships with iOS 10 so it is not bad
things like split view really make
multitasking a lot more doable on the
iPad however what's really going to
change things is iOS 11 so at first
glance it looks fairly similar but just
like my wardrobe change there's a lot
going on into the HUD so Sam what
browsing I want to pull up the file menu
all I do is swipe up from the bottom tap
it and then drag it off to the side and
I get my normal split view which I can
then just readjust I'd like or if I want
I can shrink it back down if I pull down
from the top it becomes a floating
window so I'm still being able to scroll
in Safari but I can also just toss this
off to the side and do whatever I need
to get done this way you can get up to 3
apps on screen at once now it's not
perfect so since this is the very first
data things are not quite as smooth as
they could be but this goes a long way
making the iPad feel a lot more usable
on the other hand the surface of course
is running Windows 10 Pro now Windows 10
has actually seen some pretty major
upgrade to the last couple years
I've got to say I am impressed with how
much you can do on the iPad with iOS 11
one area where I have no complaints with
battery life so the iPad pro like pretty
much every iPad ever is quoted at 10
hours of battery life whereas the
service actually can go all the way up
to 13 hours regardless you should easily
be able to take these for a full day of
use without needing the charger both
also have solid stylus support so the
surface pro has an all new surface pen
which is supposedly a lot faster and
when I try it recently actually does
feel pretty solid however the Apple
pencil on the new iPad pro is stupid
fast it really does feel nearly
one-to-one the surface pro is definitely
the safe choice it's a great Windows PC
that just happens to be a tablet the
iPad has a terrific display it's super
fast and I always love is actually
pretty good but it might not be for
everyone so what do you guys think about
these tablets which one would you pick
up let me know in the comments below and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
