new version of one of my most popular PC
builds say hello to the boson 3.0 well
there are a lot of advantages in getting
into PC gaming the price isn't had
always one of them that's where this
bill comes in for 350 dollars you're
getting a computer that can match or
exceed the level of console performance
for about the same price inside this is
a huge upgrade over the previous build
we're going from a dual-core to a
quad-core AMD athlon x4 860 K with a lot
of games these days straight up
requiring 4 cores the 8 60 K is still a
solid performer being able to clock up
to 4 gigahertz which is definitely not
bad for a budget CPU when it comes to
budget builds having a decent CPU is
important not only to be able to play
games today but also to give you a
little bit of reassurance they'll still
be able to play the latest and greatest
in a few years paired with the gigabyte
a 68 H motherboard you're getting a
fairly basic set of tools to get the job
done you've got all the expected things
such as USB 3 as well as SATA 3 the real
star of the show though is the XFX
Radeon r7 360 graphics card when it
comes to a bill that's less than $400
your choice of graphics card is
especially important and with the r7 360
you're getting a lot of firepower that's
roughly equivalent to what you'll find
in the latest consoles based on AMD's
latest GC and architecture and paired
with 2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory this
has some serious horsepower when it
comes to grand theft auto 5 you're able
to play at medium settings at 1080p with
these and frame rates you'll have to
bump things down to low at 1080p for the
witcher 3 but it's still absolutely
playable pick a slightly less demanding
title like rocket league and you're able
to play at 1080p on high settings and
still get really respectable frame rates
counter-strike go is also another game
the boson 3.0 has no problem handling
we're still able to play on high
settings and the frame rates are no joke
when you take a step back and compared
to the previous generation boson the
fire strike score tells the story this
is over three times as powerful when it
comes to graphics performance housing
the build is the Rosewell r 363 case now
it's fairly straightforward however it's
totally fine for this build you've got
plenty of room inside to work and it
also comes with a bundled 400 watt power
supply the boson 3.0 is also using a
gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix memory
now 82 bytes doesn't have to run
basically any game out there right now
however it's very easy for you to
upgrade the 16 gigabytes a little bit
later on if you feel like you need to
upgrade for storage I thought a little
bit outside the box and went with a 128
gigabyte a data SSD the
an SSD are huge it speeds up almost all
aspects of a computer however low bytes
is not exactly a ton of room for games
so for a little bit more you could
upgrade to a larger SSD or you could
also swap it out entirely and use a one
terabyte Western Digital blue hard drive
considering there's plenty of room
inside the case for several other hard
drives you can also just stick with the
SSD and add extra hard drives as you
need them and that's one of the best
parts of building your own computer you
can customize it however you want if you
guys are curious I actually have a full
tutorial showing you how to build a
boson 3.0 and you guys can go check that
out I also have links to all the parts I
use in the description of this video
hopefully you guys found this helpful I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
