going to find out which is faster the
new iPhone 7 or the galaxy s7 to find
out I gathered not only the new iPhone 7
but also the plus in galaxy note 7 to
see how things stack up unlike the
previous plus models this year there's
an actual speck ball with the 7 plus
rocking 3 gigabytes of memory compared
to the 7 with the same two gigs from the
success otherwise though they had the
same eight infusion chip which promises
big speed improvements over the last
generation along with an updated
quad-core design for a better battery
life as well of course the galaxy s7 is
no joke either with the latest
Snapdragon 820 processor paired with a
full 4 gigabytes of memory which it
shares with its bigger brother the
smoking hot note 7 to start with we've
got the brand-new Geekbench 4 this is an
update to my favorite processor test
I've used for years and it goes even
more in depth to measure how well phones
will handle day-to-day tasks a high
score here makes a huge difference to
how snappy of foam feels and it's clear
that Apple isn't playing with the 8
infusion with just over twice the single
thread performance and even in advantage
when you take all four cores into
account another big part of the
performance of a phone are graphics
which is where GFX pinch comes in while
higher performance graphics can enable
some seriously impressive games they
also play a key role in keeping the
interface running smoothly especially
when you have bigger higher resolution
displays here again the iPhones pull out
a pretty clear win which holds up even
if you do take the screens entirely out
of the equation while it might be less
noticeable lot of flagships can get
surprisingly hot and used especially if
you're doing intensive tasks like gaming
while both get warm you can see the
galaxy s7 is a bit hotter it tops out
around 34 degrees Celsius compared to 29
on the iPhone but both are totally
within reason for a smartphone
of course benchmarks only take you so
far so here is my good buddy John you
may remember from that famous video a
few years ago
I say something you made some gains from
that video dude it was like a stick so
on top of all the benchmarks let's do
some real world stuff and I think to
start with let's do some games tempo run
this is a sort of non-scientific test
but let's see how long it takes to load
a couple games so ready no cheat go look
at that jump on you there
Oh Alvin Duncan three three three oh
three come on come on oh you're gonna
come on come on I'm done I'm ready
you're like already in the game yep
there you okay I'm good okay so clearly
while the galaxy s7 is a far superior
phone that's not actually totally a
melon let's do asphalt 8 now for this
one quite open the game up base okay
this is loading pure love yeah ready set
go
you got the head start I mean by like a
split second oh that's still dropping
frames phone so it's fine when I get in
it'll be perfectly smooth 60 French oh
that's Dartmouth frames okay so you can
actually win the race though smoke in
you heaven I'm drifting a Dodge Dart
which has never happened in the history
of the universe but you know alright
thanks oh I wrecked myself I am the
superior gamer yeah yeah you should
subscribe to you to calm slash
Jonathan's gaming tech tips it's
actually notice my sword I will give you
that actually the iPhone is surprisingly
quite a bit faster is loading games
which is a huge surprise the iPhone
actually won basically all the
benchmarks as well so you've been using
the seven for what a couple days now yes
sir what do you think about the
performance because I'm actually noticed
it seems a little bit faster than
success the thing I noticed most is the
responsiveness from the home button you
can stop apps from loading its that
responds weird what show me show me like
you can stop stuff oh wow okay let me go
hang on let me try this
okay I see your point I see your point
to be fair the galaxy s7 is an older
phone so the iPhone has a six-month Head
Start but that's cool
she's showing off now so what do you
guys think about the iPhone 7 definitely
be sure to let us know in the comments
you can also check out John's new video
where he put it under water for an hour
that survived you'll have to find out
here do new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
