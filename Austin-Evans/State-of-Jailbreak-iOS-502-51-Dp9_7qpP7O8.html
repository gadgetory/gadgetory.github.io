over the new iOS 5.0 point2 and 5.1 as
well as what is going on with the
untethered jailbreak what is going
around that Apple is preparing a pair of
new software updates for the iphone ipod
touch and ipad 5 point 0 point one was
supposed to fix all the battery life
issues that people were having however
obviously that was not the case and it
does look like Apple is going to give it
another shot with 5.2 if you having
problems with battery life on your iOS 5
device don't worry it does look like the
new iOS 5.0 point2 should be slated to
hit in the coming weeks there also is a
brand new iOS 5.1 update that is on the
way now this is going to be a little bit
more of a substantial update and from
what we've heard it's going to large the
consist of updates to Siri some of the
supposed improvements to Syria it can
include allowing it to open up your
camera app or for example you can say
take a video will take a picture as well
as even get full access to system
toggles so you can tell it turn off
Wi-Fi or turn off bluetooth iOS 5.1 is
going to be a little bit farther out it
should be hitting in about a month or
two over both as well as 5 point 0 point
you should be easily jailbreakable on
all devices that currently do have a
tethered jailbreak speaking of tethered
jailbreaks earlier this month pod2g
announced on twitter that he had found a
way to get an untethered on iOS 5 if you
guys don't understand why it's been so
long since we've had an untethered
jailbreak let me briefly explain back in
iOS 4.3 point for Apple added some new
bits to iOS to make it much harder for
em tethered jailbreaks to actually be
able to work this certainly doesn't mean
that they're impossible however compared
to previous versions is going to take
much more time much more effort for the
intellijel breaks to be developed as
always is there any new updates to the
topics that I've discussed today I'll
have an annotation on the top left of
the screen which will link you to any
new videos as far as new news or of
course new jailbreak the tweak of the
week is any lock app this is a handy
little add-on that allows you to add a
shortcut to any app from your lockscreen
ordinarily when you double tap the home
button it allows you to go to the camera
app but with any locked app installed
you can choose any app you like to show
up instead antioch app is free for all
iOS 5 devices anyway guys it's going to
be about it for this week's episode stay
a jailbreak if you enjoy definitely sure
to leave this video a thumbs up and if
you're interested in keeping up to date
with all the latest jail breaking news
