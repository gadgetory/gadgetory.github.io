today I'm here with the video it's going
to be outlining more Sony's new planets
recently some impressions come out and
basically in a nutshell Sony is about to
be starting to compete with Apple in a
big big way about expand the PSP out
into a line of a foam to fight the
iphone as well as possibly into a tablet
to find the ipad now there's all kinds
of different things they've talked about
and all kinds of reasons why this is
going to be true so I'm go ahead and run
you guys through everything we know
right now and everything that we expect
it's about to happen anyway let's get
this one started
hey guys so this all has really come
about make milk mostly from a post on
the wall street journal and to summon up
they basically say that that Sony is
about to take the PSP line and expand it
out into basically an I fighter line
that makes no sense but basically
they're going and going to go after the
iphone with a phone version of the PSP
or a PSP phone we're going call it also
within a PSP tablet PS pad or letter
though on call it I don't know um so um
there's there's a there's some evidence
in it in that that you know makes law
sense but there's also a lot that they
said previously which makes me really
believe this you know people been
talking for a long time if you don't
know sony has a division called sony
ericsson which is their phone division
so Sony makes phones they make some
pretty high-end phones usually but sony
has their own phone division and people
have for the longest time but talking
about hey wait why isn't Sony merged
PlayStation and obviously PSP move merge
some PlayStation elements into a phone
to really fight the iphone people have
been talking about this for you know
three four years for a long time um and
it's really you know we've seen a few
prototypes but mostly a lot of weird
renders and everything you guys to be
seeing a few of them right now um but
really it's never been totally you know
like it's mostly like you know the
concept phase is nothing never really
actually seen any real evidence that
they're actually really going for more
than you know just maybe making a
prototype or something like that but
this really does make a lot of sense if
you look back at the PSP Go which was
launched last year the PSP go really um
took the PSP and run a lot closer to the
iphone and several different ways for
one it totally just got rid of the UMD
format so it was all digital downloads
exactly like on the iphone ipod touch
okay that's one big step it also totally
like i said dish the UMD and went with
flash drive so everything your music
everything you'll need to be worrying
about memory cards it's all store on the
one device okay and lastly it actually
brought over some iphone apps such as
hero of sparta and their iphone I'm
sorry the better the PSP minis which
were they called which basically very
similar to apps is just download only
and usually you know cost you know less
than you know the thirty to forty
dollars they would cost for a PSP game
so the pits be go was a big shot towards
you know catching the ipod touch mostly
but it didn't it what has not done so
well but that's a whole different deal
and i don't really think that should
discourage them that much because it was
still a pretty good shot and it does
make a lot of sense so if you look at
that and obviously they've been trying
to put the PSP and merge it with the
phone for a long time so that part i
have no trouble whatsoever agreeing with
it sounds just fine and it does sound
like both the tablet and the phone
should be launched by the end of the
year so the phone part 100 sent okay
with i totally think that would be a
really good deal on so now let's go to
the second part what you need the cabin
okay so when we start thinking about the
tablet you know everybody mayo tablet
we've been waiting for it from waiting
for and waiting for it and obviously the
ipad and a lot of people have some
pretty decent problems with it and i can
entirely understand that but the fact is
it's still a pretty solid product very
cheap price in no matter what the way
Apple square now it'll sell millions
doesn't matter if it's doing people
getting like oh this is bad it still got
some millions so they're really starting
a market for tablets right now there
have been Tallis for a long time but
really i think the ipad is really going
to be the trailblazer for the new
generation of you know very sleek
touchscreen no keyboards no i mean
nothing like that just a very sleek
basically giant like an iphone and ipod
touch so Sony very soon I was in a few
days of what's the ipad was released or
an ounce rather they mentioned that
the channel space would be something
that they would be really interested in
getting into and now so many I'm sure
you guys know somebody is huge they have
all kinds of divisions making everything
from you mp3 players with their walk men
playstation three TVs just I mean if
it's electronic they pretty much make it
so it's not a huge surprise to hear that
they're interested in doing a tablet
what is a pretty big surprise is that
they would like to merge it PSP make it
a PSP tablet or a PS pad or whatever
they want to call it um now this
clinical essence because obviously the
iPad can run all the 140,000 iphone apps
a pretty good majority of which or games
so the fact that it's pretty plausible
that some people might want to buy it
maybe not as specifically a gaming
device but the games would be a pretty
nice factor in it so that it's pretty
interesting to think that somebody might
want to go ahead and merge from PSP into
a tablet now as for this there's not a
whole lot to go on no picture is not a
ton of information other than the Wall
Street Journal report but based on you
know the fact that Sony has said that
they're really interested in the tablets
I can entirely believe that Sony is
working on some kind of tablet it would
make sense that if they're going to
expand the PSP line out to you know a
PSP phone why not go ahead and extend it
to a tablet you know it could be pretty
cool I mean it can be a giant PSP or
whatever they want to do but yeah guys
so that's my run down at the PSP phone
and PSP tablet The Wall Street Journal
report and its wall street journal's
pretty solid most you guys should know
they don't they help you know come up
with this kind of stuff so I'm putting
some pretty decent uh I trust them
pretty decently on that report says that
both the tablet the phone should be up
before the end of the year so you know
we're probably looking at
you know Christmastime holiday you know
probably later on winter the this year
so I wouldn't get your hopes up and
start saving for right now but the fact
remains that Sony has always been able
to really crank out some really solid
stuff so I would not put it past them
whatsoever to make a full assault phone
and even a brittle I saw a tablet they
can very well go head-to-head with the
iphone and ipad so yeah guys that's
pretty much all we know so far be sure
to subscribe to the channel I will
definitely keep you updated on all
things sony PSP blows all kinds of other
tech stuff anyway guys thanks for
