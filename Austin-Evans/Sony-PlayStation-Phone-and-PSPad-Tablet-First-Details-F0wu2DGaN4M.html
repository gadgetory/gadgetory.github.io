today I'm here with the video it's going
to be outlining more Sony's new planets
recently some informations come out and
basically in a nutshell
Sony is about to be starting to compete
with Apple in a big big way about expand
the PSP out into a line of a foam to
fight the iPhone as well as possibly
into a tablet to find the iPad now
there's all kinds of different things
they've talked about and all kinds of
reasons why this is going to be true so
I'm go ahead and run you guys through
everything we know right now and
everything that we expect that's about
to happen anyway let's get this one
started
hey guys so this all has really come
about make milk mostly from a post on
the Wall Street Journal and to sum it up
they basically say that that Sony is
about to take the PSP line and expand it
out into basically an AI fighter line
and that makes no sense but basically
they're going and going to go after the
iPhone with a phone version of the PSP
or a PSP phone whatever them call it
also with a PSP tablet just pad or
whatever they won't call it I don't know
so there's there's a there's some
evidence in it in that that you know
makes law sense but there's also a lot
that they've said previously which makes
me really believe this you know people
have been talking for a long time you
know no Sony has a division called Sony
Ericsson which is their phone division
so Sony makes phones they make some
pretty high-end phones usually but Sony
has their own phone division and people
have for the longest time been talking
about hey wait why isn't Sony murdered
PlayStation and obviously PSP moving
merged some PlayStation elements into a
phone to really fight the iPhone people
have been talking about this for you
know three four years for a long time
and it's really you know we've seen a
few prototypes but mostly a lot of weird
renders and everything you guys to be
seeing a few of them right now but
really it's never been totally you know
like it's mostly like you know there's
no concept phase there's nothing never
really actually seen any real evidence
that they're actually really going for
more than you know just maybe making a
prototype or something like that but
this really doesn't make a lot of sense
if you look back at the PSP go which was
launched last year the PSP go I really
took the PSP and brought it a lot closer
to the iPhone and several four ways for
one it totally just got rid of the UMD
format so it was all digital downloads
exactly like on the iPhone iPod Touch
okay that's one big step it also totally
like I said dish the UMD and we
the flash drive so everything your music
everything you'll need to be worrying
about memory clark's it's all store on
the one device and lastly it actually
brought over some iPhone apps such as
hero of Sparta and their iPhone I'm
sorry better the PSP minis which were
they called
which basically very similar to apps
just download only and usually you know
cost you know less than you know the
thirty to forty dollars they would cost
from the PSP game so the pits B go was a
big shot towards you know catching the
iPod Touch mostly but he didn't it what
has not done so well but that's a whole
different deal and I don't really think
that should discourage them that much
because it was still a pretty good shot
and it does make a lot of sense so if
you look at that and obviously they've
been trying to put the PSP and merge it
with the phone for a long time so that
part I have no trouble whatsoever
agreeing with it sounds just fine and it
does sound like both the tablet and the
phone should be launched by the end of
the year so the phone part I'm hunter
percent okay with that I totally think
that would be a really good deal um so
now let's go to the second part what you
need the test okay so when we start
thinking about the tablet you know
everybody you know tablet we've been
waiting for it from waiting for what I'm
waiting for
and obviously the iPad and a lot of
people have some pretty decent problems
with it and I can entirely understand
that but the fact is it's still a pretty
solid product very cheap pricing no
matter what the way apples quarter now
it'll sell millions
doesn't matter if it's I mean people
getting like oh this is bad it's still
got some millions so they're really
starting a market for tablets right now
there have been tales for a long time
but really I think the iPad is really
going to be the Trailblazer for the new
generation of you know very sleek
touchscreen no keyboards no I mean
nothing like that just a very sleek
basically giant like an iPhone or an
iPod Touch so Sony very soon I was they
have a few days of once the iPad was
released or an ounce rather
they mentioned that the channel space
would be something that they would be
really interested in getting into and
now so many I'm sure you guys know if
somebody is huge they have all kinds of
divisions making everything from you
know of mp3 players with their Walkman
PlayStation 3 TVs just I mean if it's an
electronic they pretty much make it so
it's not a huge surprise to hear that
they're interested in doing a tablet
what is a pretty big surprise is that
they would like to merge it PSP make it
a PSP tablet or a PS pad or whatever
they want to call it
now this clinical essence because
obviously the iPad came on all the
hundred and forty thousand iPhone apps a
pretty good majority of which or games
so the fact that it's pretty plausible
that some people might want to buy it
maybe not as specifically a gaming
device but the games would be a pretty
nice factor in it so that it's pretty
interesting to think that Sony might
want to go ahead and merge the PSP into
a tablet now as for this there's not a
whole lot to go on
no pictures not a ton of information
other than the Wall Street Journal
report but based on you know the fact
that Sony has said that they're really
interested in the tablets I can entirely
believe that Sony is working on some
kind of tablet it would make sense that
if they're going to expand the PSP line
out to you know a PSP phone why not go
ahead and extend it to a tablet you know
it could be pretty cool
I mean it could be a giant PSP or
whatever they want to do but you guys so
that's my rundown of the PSP phone and
PSP tablet The Wall Street Journal
report and its Wall Street Journal
pretty solid most you guys should know
they don't they don't you know come up
with this kind of stuff so I'm putting
some pretty decent uh I trust them
pretty decently that report says that
both the tablet the phone should be up
before the end of the year so you know
we're probably looking at
you know Christmastime holiday you know
probably later on winter the this year
so I wouldn't get your hopes up and
start saving for right now but the fact
remains that so many has always been
able to really crank out some really
solid stuff so I would not put it past
them whatsoever to make a full assault
phone and even a brittle I saw a tablet
they can very well go head-to-head with
the iPhone and iPad see you guys that's
pretty much all we know so far be sure
to subscribe to the channel I will
definitely keep you updated on all
things so many PSP blows all kinds of
other tech stuff anyway guys thanks for
