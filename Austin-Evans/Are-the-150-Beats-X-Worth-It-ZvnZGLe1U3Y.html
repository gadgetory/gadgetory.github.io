new beats X headphones but for $150 are
they forcing so they showed up this
morning straight from Pete who system
out a couple days before they go on sale
so it is these are wireless headphones
they're meant for working out and other
wireless headphone activity so these
being beats are probably going to sound
like these headphones which may or may
not be a good thing so they do have some
cool features including the w1 chip from
the Apple earpods as well as it beats
solos they've got eight hours of battery
life as well as fast you'll which
supposedly will give you about 2 hours
of additional listening with only a 5
minute charge similarly do we have the
headphones themselves which are nicely
magnetic together we also do have the
inline controls love these two things
I'm standing is where the batteries and
the electronics are there's like one
button here and what looks like maybe a
lightning point we also have all the
interchangeable ear tech so like most in
your headphones you have different sizes
depending on your ears as well as a
little here hook guys just look at name
for these right your class I feel dumb
I'm just going to move on now that's a
little carrying case for our earbuds as
well as a wedding cable so one like this
deep solo threes which use micro USB
which was weird this actually does come
with a proper lightning connector which
you should be able to just plug in like
this and charge on your non courage
Edition macbook fill your ears with
three three months of Apple music well I
mean if you guys might use that before
so since these do have I can't talk with
these day so sis please have the Apple
w1 wireless chip in theory if you do
have an iPhone a Mac or an Apple watch
it should be pretty easy as hair so if I
press the button here hey that was quick
so if I hit connect
that should pretty much be it there we
go
so not only is this now paired with my
iPhone but it's also not attached to any
of my devices on iCloud so that would
include something like my watch my
macbook whatever it is it should pretty
much be seamless all the way around so
what give them a listen
there's not a ton of base are these
actual beefs is that says BC right so a
little bit more base here but it's still
more of a balance down than I was
expecting
I really do you think I have to compare
it with some other headphone so these
are the jaybird freedom now these are
another pair of very very small
bluetooth headphone you see that while
they keep a little bit longer on the
beats they're pretty comparable now
these are maybe not the greatest
sounding headphones in the world but I'm
curious to see how they actually compare
I will say the bass is less pronounced
here the beats are more neutral than I
thought they were going to be but
there's still definitely more of a kick
than these and I go back and forth here
a little bit these sounds there's just
lots of a punch which I think was kind
of surprising when I first put these on
with it they don't have that real
signature meilleur major sort of scoop
the most beats do where it's a lot of
highs a lot of lows and not a lot in the
middle this seems to be a little more of
a flatter curve definitely not flat but
compared to other beats it is over we're
going forth interesting it's a really
good way of testing headphones when I
export all your reviews right here on
the Austin Tennis Channel so if I
untangle my wireless headphone disaster
here something else I'm interested in
comparing these with are the Apple
earpods so while these are about 130 150
these are like $160 so it is kind of in
that same sort of price category that
never gets old it's so fast
literally clothes I open it up and boom
I'm done so it makes the air pause a
little bit different is if they are
fully wireless so when you pull em out
of the case you can see that the actual
air pots themselves are completely
independent so if you want you can just
put one in or listen to both but there
are no wires whatsoever going between
them it shouldn't be a huge surprise
these are very much ear pods that just
happen to be wireless they don't sound
bad but the bass is nowhere near as
pronounced it's more of a tinny sound
with that w1 chip it is easy to pair
these with an Apple device but they do
also work with other Bluetooth devices
such as Android yeah that works
completely fine so no does it work on
Android pretty much exactly the way it
does on iOS but also we have our inline
controls which work here too
so even though this does have the W one
ship and it works well with Apple
devices it should work for prima
changing the supports bluetooth some of
the big advantages of using wireless
headphones like this is the ability to
go exercise without having a bunch of
cables running all over you so they do
actually have the option of dropping on
the wings to really lock them in your
ear but honestly for me I can just put
them right in and they're nice and nice
and secure this is what nice and secure
looks like by the way how does your
absolutely going to tackle me there so
one of the cool things about the beats
X's is if they actually do stay in your
ears pretty well even when you get
surprised tackled you've been using the
air pops Krypton yes sir I'm trying to
yes I have what you think they fit
really well they don't seem to work very
well with front-flip ease fit better
than any in ear headphones I've ever
tried I don't know but just because like
they're the right size for my ears or
what I feel like we should still have a
little challenge air pod versus peeps
yeah are you faster than me I think you
got to be three two one your fault
nope the procurement yeah so they both
say we're going to surprise me is
isolation something that I can't hear
anything so that's the one thing I
noticed too definitely better at
isolating sound so while these might not
be the greatest sounding headphones in
the world for $100 I think if you do a
lot works speaking of my buddy John did
a video comparing these with the Apple
earpods to be sure to go check that out
and I'm curious what do you guys think
about the beats X let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
