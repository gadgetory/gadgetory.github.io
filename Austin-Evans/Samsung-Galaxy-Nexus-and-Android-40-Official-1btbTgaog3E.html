Ice Cream Sandwich event just wrapped up
so let's go over some of the new things
that they announced first the brand new
Android operating system Ice Cream
Sandwich also known as Android 4.0 now
this is a pretty major rework of the
Android OS there are a lot of new things
but one of the biggest things is that
they've really done IV skin on the
entire OS so there's a new font and
there's an almost Windows Phone 7 style
interface around the entire phone one of
my favorite new features is face unlock
what this allows you to do is use the
front-facing camera on your phone and
then you can simply just use it to
recognize your face as opposed to
putting in some kind of pattern or
something like that the SDK for Ice
Cream Sandwich is already live and it
should start rolling out to phones in
the coming months now the second part of
the event was all about the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus now this is the third get
Nexus phone and I gotta say it's really
really impressive piece of tech now the
biggest and most important thing in my
opinion is going to be the screen if
this for a four point six inch Super
AMOLED HD high-definition display now I
know HD high-definition all custom but
basically what this means is it is going
to be a display with a resolution of
1280 by 720 couple with the Super AMOLED
technologies it's going to be an
absolutely awesome looking screen on top
of all this you will have the Android
buttons that are typically capacitive
you know the search in the back and
electron stuff that's on the bottom of
the phone well I should now be integrate
onto the screen so instead of having to
tap button you actually be tapping on
the bottom of the screen this is pretty
similar to the way that Android has been
doing it on their honeycomb tablets
beyond that it does have a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor a 5 megapixel camera
with 1080p video recording it also does
have several other things such as a
barometer and NFC support there's also a
full gigabyte of RAM as well as
different models for HSPA+ as well as
LTE so no matter what kind of 4G network
you're on you will be covered with this
new phone samsung didn't get too
specific as far as price or release date
however we do know that it will be
available in the United States on
Verizon at least initially most likely
other carriers a little bit lighter
anyway guys what do you think personally
I like Ice Cream Sandwich and the Galaxy
Nexus looks pretty awesome
however fourth don't take my word for it
definitely interested to see what you
guys have to say in the comment section
below
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs

interested in more videos on android as
well as the new Galaxy Nexus be sure to
