test of the kinect amount i'm here with
the video test of the back-facing camera
on the ipod touch so it's not very well
in test subject as you guys can see here
obviously it's daytime so the lights
pretty good on the camera is not so good
in poor light I can't can't show you
here but you're trying to eat a movie oh
but you guys can see here it does it
just pretty well on like tap the screen
right now I'm go ahead and adjust
exposure doesn't really do that much and
it is a fixed focus camera so there's no
auto focus or anything like that means
you can see you guys here like focus on
the tree see it just adjust a little bit
then you just tap on the screen it does
a little bit not that much but it is
overall a pretty good camera get down I
mean it's not perfect I think it's a
decent I'm just gonna give you good
thing hi don't don't eat it I me
but yeah so you guys can see it pretty
well Emily but definitely a pretty
decent camera maybe not quite as good as
on the ipod touch 4th generation but I
may answer on the iphone 4 but honestly
I don't think it's bad at all in that
right you agree he always agrees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
