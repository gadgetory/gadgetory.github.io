the record hey guys this is Austin and
you are probably paying too much for
your phone so my friends over at metro
pcs reached out wanted to sponsor video
the first thing I thought of were cheap
smartphones so if you guys been watching
the channel for a while you know I love
these things it's such a powerful thing
to be able to get a smartphone for 1/10
the price of a full flagship and it's
almost as good so I paid over $800 for
my iPhone 7 plus now don't get me wrong
this is a great phone however we
consider the galaxy on five only cost
$60 it is really hard to justify that
price premium so let's see what you
actually get in the box of a $60 phone
hey-oh it was a week that was weak start
down low right which like don't judge me
something else that you don't find a lot
of phones these days is a removable back
so now I can you get at the microSD as
well as the SIM slot but if you want to
swap out a battery it's super easy to do
and we also have the SIM card so that's
actually one of the nice things about
metro pcs
not only are there no contracts but for
$30 a month you're getting unlimited
talk text and one gigabyte of uncapped
data and the cool thing is you get that
regardless of what smartphone you're
using whether it's the on five or the
iPhone 7 I like the feel of this it's a
nice light phone but more importantly
it's the right size I feel like so many
smart phones these days are just too big
this actually feels good in the hand
and if you want to raise your budget to
a whopping $80 you can pick up the LG k
Tim or the HTC Desire 530 so well the
advantages of the k10 is it's rocking a
slightly larger 5.3 inch 720p display
and just like the Samsung we can take
off the back of the k10 to get access to
the battery microSD Sam the whole deal
I've got to say the look of the k10 is
interesting so it's got this sort of
textured finish on the back I can't say
I've ever seen a phone that looks like
it now we have the desire 530 so this is
actually a phone I'm really curious to
try I have not actually oh this is such
a cool
boom so you've got the sort of colorful
buttons on the side and you have it's a
white bag but it has this sort of
speckled finish it looks like so much
like spill a little paint on it that's
fun that's just a really cool unique
look you also have the blue bezels here
with a front firing speakers I'm Way
more impressed with this and I thought I
was Sochi considering it's $80 like then
it comes with a lanyard drop everything
stop the video stop the music it's
laying your time so I hereby nominate
this the coolest foam of 2016 drop the
phone no I didn't drop the phone no I
didn't okay I could get a little less
clumsy but no big deal to be here it
just has the little loop on the bottom
so you can take the lanyard off if you
don't want it but I mean this is kind of
package right here so with all three of
these phones you're getting very similar
specs so there are quad core processors
across the board
one and a half gigabytes of RAM the
biggest difference really is the fact
that the LG and the HTC have 16
gigabytes of memory and the Samsung has
eight however since all three have a
micro SD card slot it's really not that
big of a deal all three phones have
surprisingly decent screens however one
thing I did notice with the desire is it
seems like it's a little bit over
sharpened so especially when you look at
black text on a white background it just
looks like it's got a little bit of a
halo around it not a deal-breaker but
it's definitely noticeable compared to
the other two the desire does do a good
job with video though so even though it
looks like it has dual front firing
speakers only this one is an actual
speaker however because it's pointing at
you it actually sounds a lot better than
most other phones so even though the k10
feels a little bit plasticky as you
might be able to tell it has the
fundamentals down the screen is great
performance is solid especially with the
fairly light LG UI and the cool thing is
it has some extra features such as
having NFC support of course being
smartphones the cameras are incredibly
important so we'll see how they match up
so this is about as good as light is
gonna get and at least the HTC handles
it well this is a surprising amount of
detail even all the way over on the
mountains so with 8 megapixels to work
with it actually does a solid job as
long as you have light of course I have
to make sure I had to lanyard on at all
times
because safety not that it's a little
soft but that's totally usable so the
k10 actually looks really
nice so even though this is a very
brightly lit shot it completely holds
the detail no problem Ken look an a.1
quality on the LG looks to be fairly
similar we're getting a little bit of
softness but it handles it well you know
something I realized the more spend time
with the LG it snappier than the other
two everything just seems to happen
really quickly the other two gonna slow
but you can definitely notice a little
bit of lag some time now with the
Samsung we're actually working with the
lower resolution five megapixel camera
and if this is anything to go by it's
not quite as nice definitely I was fast
to take a shot with good lighting you
can get decent results however
especially when you look at the details
it just can't compare to the other two
now you can get an okay shot with the on
five however in this comparison it's
just out guns there are legit reasons to
pick up any of these phones the Samsung
is the cheapest the LG wants a little
bit on the boring side absolutely nails
the fundamentals however if it's my
money I'm picking up the HTC you're
getting a phone with unique design solid
performance a good camera and most
importantly its $80 it's hard to argue
with that
you know it's even hard argue with free
phones so if you switch to MetroPCS you
can actually get two free samsung galaxy
on by smart phones running on the
t-mobile network so which phone would
you guys go for definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
