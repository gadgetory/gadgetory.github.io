here at CES 2014 almost at 2013 and
today I'm here to show you guys what is
in my CES bag so I do want these last
year but I've obviously got a lot of
cool new stuff so let's take a look so
the first thing I took this year is the
computer so I am using a MacBook Air 11
inch so I know you guys know that I used
PC and I love PC but for laptops I
really like the air it's super light
super portable but it's fast and I
really appreciate having something
that's nice and portable and lightweight
that I can take with me so yes at all my
videos all that kind of fun stuff next
up I've got my camera so this is a Nikon
d600 so this is actually what I use to
film all of my videos year-round so it's
a Nikon it's not the best for video I
know that but I'm kind of stubborn and
so yeah so this is the camera I also use
a 20 a con 24 to 120 millimeter lens
it's super awesome for video because
it's a wide-angle lens you can see them
all the way in it's nice for like
stabilization I can do handheld stuff so
this is pretty my marilee what I'm going
to be using this week for CES as far as
shooting on my video now as well as
taking the Nikon d600 I also have a sony
rx100 so this is actually not mine this
is my friend m√°rquez's but he's using
mind actually recorded this video right
now with but this is an awesome little
pocket camera so it's something that
well obviously it's small enough I can
throw in a pocket and I've been using it
for vlogs as well as just random shots
you know throughout the show but super
helpful little thing it has very very
good video quality really not too far
off from a full size DSLR but obviously
be able to fit in your pocket means that
you can get a lot of extra shots that
you might not necessarily be able to get
otherwise so this next part is going to
be a little hard to show but as far as
audio for the trip I'm primarily using
the rode pin mic so this is a little lav
mic that's clipped into my shirt right
here it'd show to you but I'm kind of
using here right now is connected to a
zoom h1 so this is actually a really
great little microphone I've used this
for actually a couple years now so it
records audio normally so if I need it
but I can also plug in microphones like
this hook it in there it's really really
great it will record right to the micro
SD card throw at my computer it's great
because I also do have a wireless system
I can show you guys that right now so as
a backup I have these send hi
your wireless mic packs so these are
what I use so I'll put one end on my
camera and then I can monitor and record
the audio there I'll have another one
that is a like a lab or something it
goes in like your back pocket so these
are really convenient especially for
interviews and that kind of stuff the
only problem is is that they are kind of
prone to interference and there happens
to be like 500 Julian different people
recording and using like phones I cut
stuff so I kind of sometimes don't work
the best that's why I usually use the
zoom but it definitely nice to have
options especially you know if I'm gonna
do an interview or anything like that
which well I will be doing all week long
now because the show floor is kind of
dark sometimes I also have a light so
this is an LED light I've got some
rechargeable batteries for it and I
probably gonna blow the cameras out now
but it's super bright I'm gonna do turn
that off no but this is really helpful
because like I said sometimes on the
show floor it just gets dark it's got
hard to film so just having a little bit
of extra lights you can see it makes a
difference so it's kind of nice to have
four phones I've actually got two this
year so I have an iPhone 5s as well as a
Galaxy Note 3 so both these phones are
great so right now I'm using the iPhone
5s is my daily driver so it's got my sim
card in it I kind of like this to be
honest because the camera is amazing and
the software to take the pictures is
great so all my you know tweets and
Facebook and Instagram and all that kind
of fun stuff is taken on the iPhone we
also do have the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
he's got an awesome battery life it's
huge battery now pretty much all my
footage is edited on the MacBook Air but
it doesn't have a very good big hard
drive at all so that's when I use this
WD buy passports this is a one terabyte
hard drive and what I like about this is
it's one chair right so it's plenty of
storage for all the kinds of videos that
I'm going to do this week but it's USB 3
which is really nice so it's nice and
fast pretty much just like having a
normal laptop hard drive but it's
powered by the USB 3 2 so I have to have
some kind of external adapt to whatever
plug this into the macbook it's like
hundred Meg's read and write really
really nice for all the extra footage
and especially for backing it up so I've
actually had computers die on me when I
was at CES and I lost footage so have
you simply at this for a backup it's
great generally but especially when I'm
here at CES and have tons and tons and
tons of footage to take over and to put
all my gear in I have this cada 3n 1-2
two bags so as far as I know they
actually don't make this anymore
I bought it actually a couple CES as ago
but this is by far the best bag I have
ever used so in the back
it's got a laptop pouch so I can drop
the macbook air the 11-inch fits in here
perfectly down here is where i put like
the camera lenses batteries especially
like lights you know big kind of bulky
stuff I have batteries all kinds of
stuff
it's a really great bag and the cool
thing is it's nicely padded so it's nice
to you know carry around the show floor
all day fits underneath an airline seat
really really high-quality bag it's a
little expensive I think it's like
hundred and twenty dollars but it's well
worth it considering that I've been
using it for years and it still looks
pretty much brand new I also have a
fairly beefy tripod setup so I have a
set of Manfrotto legs as well as a
Manfrotto 502 video head and it's got a
ce 100 on it again Marquez is lending me
his video gear to help me film this so
it's really heavy and it's not fun to
carry around the entire time and again
this is the same stuff that I use when
I'm back home but it's nice it's stable
its able to get me like really tall
shots and that 502 video head is super
smooth so if you guys ever see like all
those cool like panning shots in my
videos that's how I get up I just nice
smooth kind of like a silky shot so
that's where I get all the awesome kind
of cool shots well I'm here in Vegas so
it's pretty much everything that's in my
CES 2014 bag hopefully you guys enjoyed
but before we get out of here I want to
give a big shout-out to HH Greg who have
