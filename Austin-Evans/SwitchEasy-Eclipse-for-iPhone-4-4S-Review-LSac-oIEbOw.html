here with a review of the switcheasy
Eclipse case for the iphone 4 on the
iphone 4s so i've been using this for
about a week or so now i've got to say i
was really impressed this is one of the
better cases I've ever used for anything
not just iphone but you know anything
it's an excellent excellent case a
couple little gripes with it but i'll
get to that in just a minute so the
first thing you'll notice is that it's
got a two-tone design so right this part
if you guys in here that is hard plastic
and this has got a little bit more gift
to it although it's still fairly firm
now that'll Natalie does this look nice
fortunately with the two-tone design and
you can get a ton of colors I just got
in black but there's like a million
colors roughly not really but there's a
lot of colors on this which easy site
you guys can check it out for yourself
you had fantastic design and I love the
look of it in the feel of it you guys
can also see it's got that kind of
speckle design I don't know what you
call it but it's a definitely if it
looks very nice go ahead and pull my
iphone in here now one slight drop I do
have about the case is how you insert
your phone into it I can get a little
bit tricky so Quentin slide I like to do
it button side last and you just kind of
have to massage the phone into the case
make sure it gets in there right getting
it in to the case is not that bad but
getting it out is definitely a little
bit of a pain because you really do how
can I have to wrestle with it so kind of
pull it up over the buttons here make
sure it's all nice and firm into the
case and there we go not a huge deal
definitely not a deal breaker but this
is not a case that you're going to want
to be pulling your phone out if you no
need to pull your phone out of the case
very often it's kind of a little bit of
a pain it makes me a little bit worried
for the buttons but it's not a huge deal
alright so let's go and just push the
case off to the side for a minute and
show you guys some accessories it does
come with for a fairly cheap case I was
really impressed it comes with a lot so
the first thing you'll find is the whole
goody bag and it actually comes with
quite a few little things for your
device so you have a user manual spoiler
it's a case you put it on but yeah you
also do have a pair of screen shields I
have one screen shield on right now I've
got to say it's a fantastic screen
shield switcheasy make some awesome
screen shields you know it's very easy
you have to worry about bubbles like you
know pretty much all the cheap ones in
spin forever putting on taking it off
now just put it on make sure you get it
on nice and straight fantastic screen
shield can't say enough about it and you
do get a pair of them you also do get a
little microfiber cloth for cleaning off
your screen which screen shields do kind
of pick up more dust in the normal
screen but who cares and you also do get
a little squeegee now go ahead and pick
up all this and toss it off to the side
we also do that even more this comes
with a lot of accessories so it also
does come with a little stand we just
have that they phone in here so for
example if you wanna watch movies or
whatever just kind of slide it there
it's nothing special it's nothing
spectacular but it's got definitely nice
they kind of include that it kind of
included it's not fully included
obviously here also do get a pair of
dock connectors now this is really neat
so I'm sure if you guys use docks for
your iphone you'll know that if you have
any kind of case on it that extra bulk
will not allow it really to fit but
switcheasy switcheasy has thought ahead
and now if you want you can just go
ahead and pick up one of these dock
connectors it fits for perfectly with
the case and you can feel free to dog it
it's awesome I don't really use dogs
myself but if you do use it you have
both a black and a white one and that's
fantast really appreciate how they added
that last little tiny thing and want to
say a little tiny I mean very very tiny
you have a couple of little inserts for
your 30-pin dock connector so just kind
of my why should put in but of course
you can just kind of put it in there you
can also put kind of cover up your
headphone jack and what that does is of
course allow you to keep dust and dirt
out but I really don't see a whole lot
of point than that as you know if you
everyone listen to music yeah pull it
out or you're constantly charging your
phone but whatever no big deal just go
ahead and go over the phone I mean not
the phone let's go over the case itself
so over here on the left side you'll
find a nice big cut out for the sleep
but I mean that's sleep the silent
switch now the sleep buttons up there if
you guys haven't noticed but of course
you do have a nice big open cut out so
if you have an iphone for verizon iphone
4 or an iphone 4s like i do it's very
simple to get at and also do have raised
sleep volume buttons so that works
really nicely very easy to get at them
you have Doolittle's you have a little
switcheasy logo here flipping over here
and focusing in the camera you guys be
able to see it has plenty of openness
for the 30-pin connect
as well as both the microphone and the
speaker nothing really over on this side
and if we go ahead and take a look at
the top of the phone you'll find that
the headphone jack is not it's slightly
recessed to get some tail but it's not
bad at all I didn't have any problems
with any of your headphones I tried
although it like I said it is slightly
recessed so you may have some problems
but I try to do this about three or four
pairs and I didn't have any issues now
one thing a slight problem when I say
slide I'm very slight is the sleep/wake
button so you guys can tell it's kind of
recessed in there now they did kind of
smooth this bottom edge out so for
example from you getting at my phone
like that it's easy but it would be nice
if they would have done something like
they did with the volume buttons kind of
let you get a little easier but again
very very small little issue around here
on the back you guys will find that it
has a nice big size for the camera now
unlike some cases I've tried there's no
issues with the flash whatsoever and of
course it looks very nice on the back so
you guys it's going to be about it for
my review of the switcheasy Eclipse case
if you're looking for a good case for
your iphone 4 or your new iphone 4s i
would highly recommend it probably one
of the better cases I've ever tried it
comes with tons of accessories and it's
only twenty bucks so considering
everything it gives you you know the
only slight negative desire it's kind of
hard to get in and out of a case and it
would be nice if they made it a little
easier to get your sleep wake button but
beyond that fantastic case guys I highly
recommend it and yeah definitely go
check it out if you're looking for a new
case for your phone anyway guys if you
