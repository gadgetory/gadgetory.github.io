wings for the iphone and ipod touch now
this is currently the number one app in
the App Store and I absolutely agree
with that this is a really really fun
casual game now before we jump angie's
tool i show you there's a couple of
things you can take a look at your own
high scores you do have options or just
a few minor things but pretty much all
there is is just a single game mode
right now so the way it works is you
want to get your bird just to go as far
as you can you're on a timer i believe
it's about four or five minutes or so
before the Sun Goes Down so you just
want to go as fast and as far as
possible now the controls are really
really simple all you do is just hold
the bottom of the screen not like that
but and that just kind of gives you
speed up so if we go ahead and just
start taking off here and you just want
to chain together combos so you want to
go as fast as you can and there you go
ahead as you see here we just kind of
hit the right hill so like recent apply
to do this right there it's gonna kind
of like how just going to start doing
really badly here you see this you just
kind of hold it Daniel Adlai get
anything down you need to kind of chain
together the combos kind of get yourself
the best speed so if you guys saw it
back there there's a little blue balls I
picked out that was a powerup high speed
you up you guys saw those back there
there's a little silver coins or gold
points for Heather and those are just
points so there we go you see here on
the bottom left you have all my points
I'm then over also on the bottom left
you guys take a look there's a little
whoo going pretty fast here huh there's
a little little icon that kind of
indicates when the Sun is going to go
down so like I said you only have a few
minutes so you can't just play forever
just kind of just get the best or you
can but go so we just want to keep going
there are several islands I believe
we're on island two right now I'm one
has ever gotten up to with island six um
I don't actually don't know if there's
anything beyond that i'm sure you guys
will be able to find out pretty quick
but uh definitely a very very fun game
so i met the place is the whole thing
i'm sure you guys get the gist of it by
now i'm really really cool casual game
i'm highly recommended guys this is
currently 99 cent from the app store I
definitely worth that probably one of my
new favorite just pick up and play games
you know you got a few spare minutes
just to go have a you know play a game
or something this is definitely the way
to go so guys are interested again tiny
tiny wings you can check it out in the
app store is 90
sense anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
