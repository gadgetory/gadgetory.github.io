here with an unboxing of the brand new
Sony Playstation 4 as the first update
to the PlayStation since 2006 the ps4
has a lot to live up to especially
considering the Microsoft has the Xbox
one coming out next week kicking the
unboxing off you'll see a security seal
which is no problem and then you can
lift up the flat to get at the good
stuff the ps4 itself is right on top
along with the accessories so let's set
the console aside for just one second to
see what all we get first of all is the
new DualShock 4 controller I've already
done a video on this that you guys can
check out but overall it's a major
improvement from the ps3 you'll also
find a mono headset which looks pretty
cheap
however the controller has a standard
3.5 millimeter jack so you can feel free
to use your own headset if you want
unlike the usual paperwork there's some
useful stuff this time with a free
30-day code for PSN and Music Unlimited
along with the $10 code for the
PlayStation Store which is awesome to
get you started
beyond that everything is pretty
standard with the user guide and the
don't do really stupid stuff and SUEZ
disclaimer so there you go the unboxing
of the PlayStation 4 oh wait did you
actually want to see the console itself
I mean I guess we really want to see it
one look at the ps4 and you'll see it's
a major departure from the last
generation gone are the huge curved
lines in favor of a much more angular
and flat design which personally I think
looks great set it alongside the rest of
the PlayStation family and you'll see it
actually blends in fairly well and most
impressively isn't all that big up front
you'll find a pair of USB 3.0 ports for
charging the controller or connecting a
USB Drive into the left are the cleverly
hidden power and eject buttons in the
seam along with the slot-loading blu-ray
drive around back are the rest of the
ports with the same power cable from the
ps3 meaning no giant external power
brick Xbox optical audio HDMI Ethernet
and a proprietary port for the optional
PlayStation camera so what do you guys
think of the ps4 are you picking one up
let me know in the comments below and
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel as well I have lots more ps4
videos headed your way including a
tutorial on how to crack it open so

subscribe button so you don't miss it
anyway thanks for watching and I will
catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
