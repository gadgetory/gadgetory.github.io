sketchy looking box could very well be
the world's smallest smartphone so this
just hit Kickstarter last week in shared
universe for actually holding this up
with the phone a little bit early but
this this is the jelly so these actually
won't start shipping until August or so
so this isn't fully final packaging but
so tiny so inside the box looks like we
get a little bit of paperwork about the
phone as well as the jelly itself which
is okay so that's that's pretty small
it's hard to kind of get your mind
around this is a full-fledged smartphone
because it is now like this is run
Android it actually runs Android 7.0
nougat now as you might imagine this
doesn't have the biggest battery in the
world but because it actually has such a
tiny screen it might actually not be too
bad pop off the back and now I do have a
spot to install the battery but we also
have a slot for a micro SD card as well
as to sin so when I phones at this small
you're actually really not giving up a
lot so for comparison this still it
looks like next to a galaxy s 8 the
jelly is walking a 2.4 inch screen look
at this so what's cool is those full
Android so not only do we have pretty
much all the normal Google apps but we
actually do have the Play Store as well
it can literally look at like three
characters of a name of an app how am I
going to do the keyboard are you serious
right now can I like rotate it you know
what though I actually can kind of type
on that I have to go slow but it works
I'm actually really impressed with how
usable the keyboard is I mean seriously
this is by far the smallest keyboard
I've ever used period and yet it works
it's not great but honestly I actually
don't feel like I'm really losing much
inside the jelly is a full-fledged
smartphone so it's walking a quad-core
processor 1 gigabyte of memory a
gigabytes of storage as well as of
course that micro SD card slot really
the biggest bond like with the jelly is
that 2.4 inch 240p display and the
repair actually doesn't look terrible in
person yes it could be a little bit
brighter and the resolution is well
below but it does make a lot of apps
kind of usable now with a quad-core
processor this actually isn't too far
off from a lot of budget phones that you
would normally use and because it's a
little bit thicker it actually probably
won't run too slowly
no actually isn't bad so of course 175
on the single core
and 1298 on the multi-core that's I see
not that far off from a bigger slightly
older phone like a moto g3 the jelly
kind of feels like a bit of an older
phone I don't really mean that
necessarily a bad way so the plastic
build reminds me a lot of the galaxy s4
sure made me add the great smartphone in
the world it was also like $700 when it
came out so you've got a decent
processor you've got LTE got Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and something that even
the iPhone doesn't have is a headphone
jack one quirk of the jelly are the
buttons so down below the screen you
have a home button as well as back and
menu keys so to get to multitasking you
actually have to tap and hold on the
home button very much like an old-school
Android phone okay so YouTube works it
was that tiny 240p screen it is
definitely not the crispiest experience
in the world but it actually does work
ok so the speaker is maybe not amazing
but to be fair if you're getting the
jelly to listen to the N built speaker
and watch video on the display you
should probably look elsewhere the jelly
also has a 5 megapixel rear facing
camera as well as a 2 megapixel front
facing camera get some close-up action
that's not actually the HDR worked it
pulled a lot out of that oh wait okay so
it means HDR actually taking multiple
photos and stitching them together
there's some serious ghosting on Ken's
face here get some non HDR action yeah
Jimmy looking striking a pose here and
it's really hard to judge the pictures
on this tiny screen from here it
actually doesn't look that bad but
actually wants to see we can do it video
alright we are now recording on the
jelly Jimmy
thoughts on this wonderful video quality
that you cannot see I can't see it but
I'm sure it's mediocre from what I'm
seeing on the screen this isn't that bad
I mean it's probably not going to look
great once you actually blow it up on a
PC but the key to making any camera look
good is a 240p screen something tells me
this front-facing camera not going to be
too hot yeah that picture totally sums
up my feeling of how bright the Sun is
man we look like a happy bunch but again
kind of missing the point of the jelly
this is not the best camera
not the best screen this is one of these
small storms in the world and it isn't
like the small smartphone with LTE for
like $80 the jelly is not the most
practical phone in the world but as a
backup phone or maybe something for
workouts it's actually not bad so what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
