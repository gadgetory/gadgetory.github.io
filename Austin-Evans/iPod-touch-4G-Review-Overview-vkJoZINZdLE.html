sum up everything about the iPod touch
what I like but I don't like everything
really just really condensed so let's
going to start with what I like I really
do like the hardware I think it's really
solid looking I love the look the screen
is actually darker than on the iPod
Touch 2nd generation going to pull that
in you see here is much much darker than
it kind of looks like grey there and so
it really gives it a very sleek look a
very very cool if it almost looks like
there's no screen at all unless you're
looking at it head on another thing I
did you like the FaceTime camera really
impressed with the quality actually that
was one of the most surprising thing
because I've seen FaceTime cameras
before really it wasn't impressed with
it on iphone 4 and apparently I suppose
the iPod Touch is supposed to have the
same camera so maybe I just wasn't
looking at you maybe some of the quality
samples I saw weren't right whatever but
very very impressed with the FaceTime
camera on iPod Touch 4th generation
looks very very good almost as good as
the rear-facing camera speaking of the
rear-facing camera um I'm not I wouldn't
say I'm not impressed with it but I do
think that it's pretty decent as far as
video goes I don't just flip it open you
guys then take a look here as long as
the video goes it's it's it's good uh I
wouldn't say it's uh it's not as good as
the maybe like a flap or any sort of you
know dedicated and sort of dedicated
camcorder so maybe you know if you're if
you're gonna go on vacation or something
like that you probably ought to take a
real like maybe I could an SLR or a real
camera but for everyday for you know if
you see something cool so you want to
take a quick picture with your friends
whatever it's not a bad camera at all
it's just you know it's just not super
high quality I guess I'm trying to say
um microphone and sound quality pretty
impressed with that I'm actually I'm
quite impressed with that just because
you see that's a tiny little microphone
but that's pick up sound very well
including if you're on facing the front
or the back so no issues whatsoever with
the sound quality rather than microphone
quality now the sound quality as far as
the speaker I like the speaker pretty
good not not perfect but I think it's
pretty good and they're off the
headphone quality is actually really
quite good so I'm impressed whatever
Apple did you know to increase that they
did a good job
so Retina display can't
stick love it love it love it could not
be more pleased with the Retina display
it really just looks fantastic text
especially just pops out of the screen
but evening icons everything I really do
recommend take a look at the retina
display for yourself the camera really
just doesn't do it justice so you go to
your Apple Store maybe go to wherever
whoo that sells iPod Touches or iPhone
and get yourself a hands-on to really
understand or make me borrow your
friends whatever a Retina display is
fantastic and as far as the speed on the
iPod touch I am impressed to an extent
now if you use an iPad I do think I
don't have one here to kind of benchmark
against each other but I didn't the iPad
is a little bit faster just as far as
opening and closing stuff everything and
iPod touch though is definitely nothing
to you know kind of laugh at especially
compared to you know previous iPods and
iPhones it's very very snappy everything
loads fairly quickly so no real no real
complaints there webpages load nicely
games run well everything like that so
no real complaints they're just not
really really impressed compared to the
iPad so moving on the software it does
run iOS 4.1 it does of course have
FaceTime FaceTime is great really
impressed with FaceTime as far as the
quality and also it really wasn't laggy
glitchy anything like that I mean the
the you really did feel like you were
actually talking to a person when you
use FaceTime the camera application
pretty solid you know it's pretty much
the same as on the iPhone 4 although it
does like the HDR photos but not a big
deal so the only thing that I do
actually have to say iOS I'm not even
gonna get into that I'm sure most of you
guys have used an iPhone or an iPod
Touch before so you know about it
one thing but iOS 4.1 on the iPod Touch
4th generation though is that I actually
was a little bit glitchy I was actually
able to crash Safari several times as
far as doing the pinching and zooming so
there are a few bugs here and there in
4.1 I'm sure the more I use it before I
find more but of course that software
stuff that will be easily fixed Apple is
really known for supporting their
devices for several years in the future
so really not that doesn't really worry
me I wouldn't really worry about not
buying it because of
because you know any glitches and stuff
will be fixed fairly soon I'm so that's
pretty much my wrap-up of the iPod Touch
4th generation as far as all the
features I'm out the last thing I do
want to talk about is the price and
comparisons and just a little bit about
this so I need you to bear with me so as
far as the price goes now in the United
States you can go ahead and buy the iPod
Touch 4th generation 8 gigabytes for
$230
go ahead by 32 gigabytes for $300 didn't
buy 64 gigabytes for $400 now actually I
those partitions are very competitive
with other things such as maybe the Zune
HD but really guys the iPod Touch is in
a league of its own if you're looking
for something you know a media player
you know it fits a gaming system it can
be a camera I mean there are so many
different niches that the iPod Touch
fills there really is just no comparison
I'm you know I mean yeah you could take
a look at it compared to a PSP but the
iPod Touch is you know it does internet
way better than the PSP cameras and
everything you can almost go in pair to
maybe like a flip minnow or something
like that which it's not the camel
quality isn't as good good luck trying
to get on the internet with your flip so
guys there's a lot of pros and cons but
on the whole I'm very impressed with
iPod touch as far as the price goes and
in case I had a couple questions
unlike the third generation all four do
I mean all three devices are the same so
the 8 gigabyte 32 64 they all have the
cameras they're all or identical as far
as just the memory so no worries about
that now as far as which one if you're
interested in getting one I recommend
the 32 so actually the 8 gigabyte even
though it is 8 gigabytes once you get it
all set up without without any hacks at
all it only actually has six point five
gigabytes of space and trust me guys I
get stole a very very fast
so between apps even with just a little
bit of music I've only got maybe like 40
or 50 songs and just a few apps I'm
already down to about 4 gigabytes of
space so that's a little bit worrying
and of course you know high-definition
video the iPod Touch without anything on
it would be filled up with a couple
hours of high-definition videos so 32 is
the sweet spot in my opinion if you're
really going to be using it if you're
just getting it kind of just to test it
out or whatever they is okay but I
definitely do
32 I'm so glad that is pretty much it
for my wrap-up of the iPod Touch 4th
generation
I'm overall very very impressed with it
everything is pretty good there are a
few little problems I have a couple
issues but on the whole of it guys you
just can't beat it as far as you know
the price the features everything
about this just is fantastic and Apple
did an amazing job so really I do have
to hand it to them and I am extremely
pleased with iPod Touch 4th generations
so guys if you're interested definitely
I don't I don't hesitate to recommend it
whatsoever
it's a really solid device and I'm
definitely going to enjoy using it for
quite some time anyway guys thanks for
watching
