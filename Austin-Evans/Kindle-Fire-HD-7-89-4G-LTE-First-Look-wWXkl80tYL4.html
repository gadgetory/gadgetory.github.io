here with an overview of the brand new
Amazon Kindle Fire HD the Kindle Fire 2
the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch and the Kindle
Fire HD LTE yeah we've got a lot to go
over so let's start with the new
flagship the Amazon Kindle Fire HD so
this is the new top-of-the-line Kindle
Fire and it's got an 8.9 inch display
with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 so if
you're keeping track that's basically
the same kind of pixel density from the
iPad it's a bit smaller of a screen but
as far as the overall pixel density it
should be right up there with the iPad 3
powering it is a TI OMAP 44 70 dual-core
processor so tech specs aside it should
be very fast and apparently it's
actually going to be faster than the
quad-core Tegra 3 want to see about that
but definitely does look pretty good on
paper amazon also threw in a few cool
features so it's got stereo speakers
which is a big thumbs up in my bulk
probably my biggest complaint with my
Nexus 7 is the fact that the speakers
just really aren't that great now on top
of that it's also got NEMA Wi-Fi or
multiple-input multiple-output
tech jargon SI basically what that means
is that you're going to get much better
Wi-Fi reception with the Kindle Fire HD
they've also seriously improved the
Kindle Fire operating system so that was
one of my biggest complaints when I took
a look at the original Kindle Fire last
year was that the operating system was
kind of slow and laggy and it wasn't
particularly great looking if they've
done away with a lot of the Chrome and
they made it a lot more simple and clean
it is still based on the carousel
interface but that's really not all that
bad as long as it you know follows your
finger instead of like you swipe in it
waits five ten seconds goes oh you
wanted to swipe left okay
there's also quite a few new apps so for
example there's a brand new scan iPad
which takes advantage of the
front-facing HD camera there's an
all-new design Facebook as well as a new
email app and of course on top of that
you still have access to the Amazon App
Store with over 50,000 apps available
the Kindle Fire HD will also get a 4G
counterpart so this other version will
have support for the AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE network
as well as have 32 gigabytes of storage
as opposed to 16 gigabytes on the
standard Kindle Fire HD the data plans
are actually really reasonable so they
start at $50 a year not $50 a month $50
a year for that you get 250 megabytes of
data every month 22 i'ts of Amazon Cloud
storage as well as a $10 Amazon App
Store credit there's also going to be a
7 inch version of the Kindle Fire HD I
know this is getting really confusing
but let me try to explain so it's just
going to be the same thing as the 8.9
version
with a seven-inch screen so it's not
going to be any LTE and obviously the
screen is going to be considerably
smaller but beyond that should have all
the same features so it has that really
cool Wi-Fi HDMI al front-facing camera
same specs same 16 Q bytes of storage
and if that was enough there's also
going to be a nether Kindle Fire so this
is basically known as the Kindle Fire to
the new Kindle Fire it actually don't
think they've come up with a proper name
for it yet but basically the gist of it
is that's going to be very similar to
the current Kindle Fire so it's going to
have more RAM better battery life a few
little tweaks here and there but the big
thing is it's going to be cheaper
alright so let's recap so the Kindle
Fire 2 will be coming in at $159 and
he's available for pre-order today and
in fact all of these are it'll be
shipping on September 14th moving on to
the 7 inch Kindle Fire HD it's going to
have several improvements like the new
Wi-Fi it's going to have a front facing
camera HDMI a few different things like
that and it will run $200 and again
available for pre-order today and it
will be shipping on September 14th as
far as the 8.9 inch Kindle Fire HD it's
going to run you 299 dollars and be
available on November 14th send goes for
the Kindle Fire HD LTE if you want that
extra storage as well as the LTE
goodness that's going to run you $4.99
so it's about $200 more but that will
also be shipping on November 20th
anyway I will have links to all the
Kindle Fires in the description of this
video as well as the other Kindles that
Amazon announced that I didn't have time
to go over today if you enjoyed
