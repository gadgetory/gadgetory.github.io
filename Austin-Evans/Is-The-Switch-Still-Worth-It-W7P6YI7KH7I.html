nearly two years old at this point and
while has absolutely smashed sales
records and give a Nintendo a very
important win after the disaster that
was the Wii U it's not going on sale for
the holidays which of course begs the
question is now the time to buy you
can't talk about the switch without
being impressed with the flexibility of
the hardware drop it in the dock and you
have a proper dedicated console it's
kind of even better as a portable
especially when you compare this to the
3ds it is a way better experience detach
the joy cons and you can see one of the
many many ways of playing the switch so
now that you have a stand that you can
play it in tabletop mode but you can
also sync other controllers including
the pro controller or even if you're
docked you can use a USB controller
there's a lot of different options of
playing the switch this is clearly what
Nintendo wanted the Wii U to be a tablet
sized console that's actually portable
the Wii U is a good comparison here a
lot of titles from it have been ported
over to the switch including Mario Cart
splatoon toad and of course the
outcoming Super Smash Brothers ultimate
there's a great selection of indie games
as well so just over cooked to as well
as dead cells and this is a little bit
of a trend for the console lots of games
have found their home on the switch
especially the ones that aren't super
graphically intensive that run really
really nicely here this is also the
spiritual successor to the 3ds which
means that we're finally getting games
such as Pokemon moving over to a full
proper Nintendo console for a portable
it's also got some serious power take
one look at the game such as Wolfenstein
2 and it is hard not to be impressed
measure its way lower resolution than
the ps4 Xbox one but it does look
reasonably close and it is incredibly
impressive that this is running on a
handheld console
four-night is a great example this is a
game that runs on basically every device
out there but this is the best mobile
version on the switch mostly thanks to
the physical controls the thing is
though the switch really doesn't make
sense if it's your only dedicated
console most big triple-a games take
months to make it to the switch and
that's what they make it at all and on
top of that they generally don't perform
as well as other consoles and they cost
full price this is totally fine if you
want to play the excellent Nintendo
exclusives but you want to play other
games such as call of duty Assassin's
Creed 2 Gran Turismo this is not the
console for you the thing is both the
base ps4 and Xbox one are cheaper than
the switch and with those consoles you
are getting a better dedicated gaming
experience if you don't care about the
portable stuff they make a lot of sense
you also don't have any kind of
backwards compatibility or virtual
console here this is bizarre considering
that it was
who kind of pioneered the whole idea of
doing a Virtual Console both the Wii and
the way you could play a lot of older
games via the Virtual Console and on top
of that they could also you know work
with a disc that you just pop in from
your last generation system instead on
the switch I'm buying Mario Kart for the
third time on the second different
platform in the last couple years is
that just me I guess an appendage just
has to keep selling those mini consoles
right sure you've got access to some NES
games if you pay for Nintendo's online
service but well let's get into that
both PSN and Xbox Live include current
generation games for free every month as
opposed to a couple of old NES titles
and on top of that you actually don't
even need to necessarily pay for the
switch online service to play online
they yes if you want to play smash for
example online you have to pay but if
you want to play something like
fortnight you actually don't have to pay
anything because that makes sense
there's also no proper party system you
can't do voice chat on the console
itself well it does support cloud saves
it doesn't work for all games the entire
online system just does feel a little
bit half-baked I will give them credit
at $20 a year at least the Nintendo
switch online service is less expensive
than PSN or Xbox Live but well that
makes sense because it's not as good
probably the biggest reason to hold off
on buying a Nintendo switch right now
are the rumors that there's an upcoming
switch pro 2 out next year supposedly
the switch will have an upgraded screen
as well as potentially a little bit more
power now that's all fine and good if
you take one look at the 3ds you'll know
that there is very little chance that
the switch is going anywhere anytime
soon even though there are upgrade
versions of the 3ds available pretty
much all games do support the older
version I expect that to be the exact
same case for the switch I really do
enjoy the switch it feels like a glint
of the future or where consoles are
headed over the next few years now of
course with an upgraded version on the
horizon it might not be a crazy idea to
hold off and wait but you could also
just not do that by a switch right now
and come play pokemon and smash but the
rest of us your call
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
