you the ipod touch 4th generations
Retina display now I'm going to just
start this by saying that my camera or
well any camera really can't pick it up
on it is way too high resolution but I
can't at least show you how clear stuff
is um so just on the screen here you
know it looks much much better
especially you can see it in the text on
the icons with a lot richer again gets
really hard to display or show you
through the camera I'm really to get the
full effect of the retina display and
see how high resolution how crisp and
clear everything is I do recommend guys
go ahead maybe go to your apple store or
something like that and find either an
iphone 4 and ipod touch um as far as
just looking at them straight up they do
look pretty much the same there's slight
differences but honestly not a big deal
you will get the effect so it's
definitely a big step up especially from
like the old ipod touch and iphone so
here you go guys this is about the best
i can show you as far as the retina
display and as you can kind of see
hopefully the text is tiny tiny tiny I
mean this is look that's the size of my
finger okay my fingers cover that up so
hopefully you can get a sense of just
how small this text is however with the
retina display is entirely readable
which is really really impressive as on
the ipod touch 2nd generation it's all
just blurry it's all you can't read
anything it's just you know maybe you
can make out what the stuff in bold but
as in that it's totally unusable where's
on the ipod touch I don't even need to
zoom in i can read all this straight
from the display it's really really
great so just kind of give you guys just
a sense of I mean let me go ahead and
just zoom out a little bit I mean that
is how that's just the three and a half
inch screen and basically this website's
meant to be viewed on maybe like you
know a 20 inch monitor or maybe a little
bit smaller than that but just kind of
just show you how clear it is I'm very
very impressed with the retina display I
will say the viewing angles aren't
perfect as you can see it guys can't get
washed out when you kind of do get it to
tilt it to the side and stuff there you
guys can see it pretty well there that
is because the ipod touch does not have
the IPS technology that's an iphone 4 so
as far as viewing angles goat is a
little bit it's a little bit less than
the iphone 4 but really ninety nine
percent
you're not really going to be paying
attention to it you're going to be
looking at it fairly close to straight
on as you can see here I mean you do
have decent view ingles so guys on the
whole very very impressed with Retina
display one of my favorite things in the
iphone I mean it rather the ipod touch
4th generation
