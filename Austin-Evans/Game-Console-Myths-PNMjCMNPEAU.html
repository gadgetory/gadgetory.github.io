video was brought to you by boost mobile
do you want to say some cash on your
phone bill as well as get $50 off the
new phone boost offers unlimited talk
text and data and you don't even need a
contract check out the link in the
description or annotation and if you
switch to boost by March 31st
you'll get $50 off your new phone
seriously check it out I bet you'll be
surprised at how much you save so you've
seen me take a look at some gaming pc
myths however this time let's change
gears and look at some of the most
common gaming console modes one common
myth is that companies make a ton of
money selling you the consoles now when
you look at the price of a new console
like the PlayStation 4 Xbox one 4 or 500
dollars seems like a lot however when
you actually break it down the companies
really aren't making a whole lot of
money on that for example when the
PlayStation 3 launched it costs $500
however the actual cost to make it was
over $800 so every single time that you
bought a PlayStation 3 in the first
couple years sunny was losing a lot of
money companies like Microsoft Sony and
Nintendo makes some money selling you
things like accessories as well as
subscriptions to services such as Xbox
Live however the majority of the money
they make comes to the games so let's
say you want to go out and buy a new
copy of titanfall well as a brand new
game that's going to cost you $60
however when you pay $60 10% of that
roughly about six or seven dollars or so
actually goes over to Microsoft another
myth is that the new consoles run all
their games at full 1080p HD while
consoles like the Xbox one ps4 and we
you are capable of running at 1080p that
actually does it mean that all of their
games are running at full HD for example
Call of Duty ghosts runs at only 720p on
the Xbox one
rise set of erm runs at 900 P and the
multiplayer for Killzone Shadowfall on
the ps4 is only running at 1080i which
is roughly about half of what you would
normally expect out of a full 1080p game
since consoles have a set amount of
power and means games have to try to
thin line between image quality
resolution and frame rate and if
developers choose to push any of these a
little bit too far it's going to
definitely hurt the others that's why
some games really don't even run at full
HD even on a brand-new $500 Xbox a big
myth is that all console gamers are
teenage guys
everyone knows the stereotype of the
Xbox Live gamer that 14 year-old kid who
lives in his parents basement and
all day trash-talking people and call
duty well you'll definitely run into
kids like that over half of Americans
actually play video games and the
average age is actually 30 years old and
girls like to play video games - in fact
45% of dangers are actually women on top
of that girls under 18 are only slightly
less likely to play video games than
their male counterparts
so it's really not just all Fortune old
kids on Xbox Live one big myth is that
consoles are faster than PCs now with
this latest generation of consoles if
you open them up what you'll find is
that they're actually very similar to
PCs as an example let's take a look at
the ps4 which is the most powerful
current console so inside the graphics
roughly equivalent to an AMD r9 270
about a 200 our PC graphics card there
are definitely other advantages that you
have to factor into playing on a console
however performance wise a high-end PC
is always going to win one big myth is
that consoles are only for gaming well
there's no denying the gaming consoles
are called gaming consoles for a reason
all it takes is one look it's something
such as we fit to see that there's a lot
more that you can do with these take the
Xbox one it actually makes a
surprisingly solid media box as not only
does it have HDMI n so you can run your
cable through it but of course it has
basically every video app Under the Sun
and people watch a lot of video on the
consoles
not only is the ps3 one of the most
popular devices on Netflix but over half
of people actually watch Netflix from
their Dane consoles so what are some
gaming console myths that you like me to
go over next time let me know in the
comments below anyway thank you guys for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
