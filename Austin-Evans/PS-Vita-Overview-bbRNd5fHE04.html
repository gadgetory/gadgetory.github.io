Louise McIntosh doing a guest appearance
on Duncan three three three oh three
let's see you guys a hardware and os
tour of the PlayStation Vita so first
off gonna be talking about the hardware
the place he should be the sports a
5-inch o le d-- display which looks
amazing it's also a competitive touch
screen as well as it's powered by an AR
M cortex quad-core processor so this
thing is a beast so taking a look at the
right front of the place in beta you'll
find the right analog stick the start
and select button as well as the
original PlayStation button combination
with a front-facing camera right next to
that on the left side you'll find the
directional pad as long as the left
analog stick and the PlayStation Home
button now taking a look at the back of
the PlayStation Vita you'll find one of
the most unique features which is the
competitive touch back which you could
use to play certain games also on the
back are two grips that help support you
when you're playing games on the
PlayStation Vita as well as you'll find
the rear facing camera all the way at
the top of the back now at the top of
the Vita you'll find you power button
the PlayStation Vita game cartridge slot
as well as an accessory slot for future
accessories and your volume rockers and
at the bottom you'll find your memory
card slot your headphone jack and your
proprietary USB in charging slot now
what is the purpose of having great
Hardware without having any software to
back it up the place you shouldn't be
the ditch is the old cross media OS that
is known for being on the preseason
three and the PSP and it replaces it
with this new bubble u wine that works
really great with touchscreens the new
operating system feels just like a smart
phone only a little bit more advanced
including some features of iOS and some
features from Android notifications all
your media games and applications are
found on the home screen as bubble icons
you can rearrange these icons any way
you like just like in iOS by holding
down on the icon and rearranging them
any way you want and just like iOS you
can click the corner of the icon to
delete it right from your home screen
also on the side of that page you'll
find an option to change the background
of the main menu as well as adding more
pages to support more icons and
applications at the top of the main menu
you'll find your taskbar which shows
your utilities are running in the
background like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as
well as your running applications and to
the right of that you'll find the time
and battery life as
or notifications now when you launch an
application you'll be greeted with your
live area which shows different features
of the application like hotkeys and
shortcuts but you could also just start
off the application right from the
original main menu when you're in an
application you can press the places and
home button to access the live area
which is kind of like the multitasking
area as well where you could access
different applications running in a
background as well as accessing your
main menu so far this is my favorite way
I've seen the device perform on-site a
scene and it's probably one of the best
ways I can easily go look on the web for
some cheat codes and then come back to
my game or go buy a game on the PSN and
come back to my old game and start
playing it again another thing you can
do in the library is scroll underneath
the live area and see your recent
activity for that certain application
gives you access to how long you play
that application as well as when you
launched it so I hope you guys enjoyed
that quick tour of the hardware and
software of the PlayStation Vita I
actually imported this console from
Japan since it hasn't launched here in
the US it won't launch until late
February so hope you guys enjoyed this
early sneak peek if you guys would like
to see more places and beena coverage
