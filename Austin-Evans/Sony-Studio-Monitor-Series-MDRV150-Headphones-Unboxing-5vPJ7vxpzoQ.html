today I'm here with an unboxing of the
new Sony studio monitor MDR V 150
headphones you know I looked round and
these look to be some really solid
headphones and definitely gonna
hopefully enjoy them you can see the
over the ear style
but okay wow these are actually okay so
these are pretty solid that actually
surprisingly lightweight they don't you
don't really seem to weigh a whole lot
at all
um you see here it's got the sunny logo
and everything
actually these are really light weight
I'm surprised these probably be very
comfortable for a long period of time
listening um see here there imagine that
adjustable swim home later hmm I think
that these twist them they go backwards
maybe I'm not sure I there's this I
always gotta figure it out at the
beginning
okay no not gonna be a whole lot to this
unboxing guys just a pretty quick thing
see here not really anything box except
we have this which we have the normal
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and then
we also have a larger end for plugging
into something like a guitar amp or
something like that and it just slides
right over it works like that
alright guys these are the sony MDR v
150 headphones and they look pretty
solid very soft very very cool
tonight definitely stay tuned I'll be
doing a full review on these yeah you
ain't thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
