edition of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about the next generation
of iphone and to help kind of give you
guys some ideas and some insight into it
I have two special guests so why didn't
introduce yourself guys hey guys I'm
Adam I have a youtube channel where I
review technology at youtube.com slash
tech tech man TV hi I'm cyber Stevie and
I also make technology videos 11 years
and years and all that such so the three
of us will go ahead and you give you
guys some insight and can't give you
guys what we are thinking about for the
next iPhone whether they call it you
know an iphone 5 or whatever um so the
first thing I want to just go ahead and
definitely talk about is you know just
what really to expect as far as the
hardware wise personally I don't really
expect a huge upgrade i think that the
iphone 4 is a very very advanced phone I
don't really it's not like you know
where the 3gs where it was miles behind
I don't see a huge upgraded feature i
think it'll probably be confined you
know smaller upgrades like that what do
you guys think yeah i agree i pursued
on't think there's going to be too much
for change between the current iphone 4
and iphone 5 probably something along
the lines of the iphone 3g to 3gs that
go great yeah definitely agree we just
added you cameras and stuff like
everybody see the matting anything major
in the near future yeah I'm total
agreement with you guys I think there's
always gonna be room for small things I
definitely think they will probably fix
the antenna or they'll at least tweak
the design you then probably do some
smallest things that won't be surprised
that they we see a new upgraded process
or maybe like an apple a5 but I think
it's mostly going to be smaller
improvements you know yeah it simply
agree yes okay so this isn't something a
lot of people have been asking me about
what do you guys think about the
possibility of a verizon iphone when do
you think you get when you guys think
we'll see it I definitely think there
will be a verizon iphone in the near
future there's been a lot of rivers
pointing to it January launch date and
this report com publish an article last
month earlier this month saying that
apple was in the last stage of testing
it so it's definitely very possible yeah
doesn't have to agree there's a lot of
evidence that goes that it's very
possible i think we'll definitely come c
1 over the next year I agree I'm the
only really question I my mind is are we
going to see it in january maybe it's
CES or we go ahead and just see it you
know maybe june july somewhere where
they Apple usually releases and that's
my only question I mean I almost can see
if they decide to do it in january i
almost could see them doing maybe the
verizon iphone could be just a standard
iphone 4 but if they go ahead and wait
till june yo instead of breaking their
schedule so it kind of depends that's
that's my main question i mean i'm not
really sure about one will actually see
it i guess CES would be a good place to
go ahead and sit as far as you know
january that's what a lot of the things
we've heard the only thing though that I
just kind of breaks apple's tradition
i'm not sure if they do that just to you
know just to announce verizon what do
you guys think firstly i don't think
we're gonna be seeing of rice and iphone
at CES 2011 but who knows yeah yeah
absolutely yeah I would definitely say
probably closer to june because having
analyzes it's kind of big thing so i
think the way to go not kind of here
when they usually announce like the
major updates the iphone 4 now six of my
bed mmm yeah and that's what that one
thing is that you know once we do see it
on verizon that's going to open up
Madeline just for verizon but it's going
to allow it obviously on all kinds of
cdma carriers around the world so it's
going to be a bigger deal than just in
the United States so that definitely
should be something interesting to watch
yeah I agree so one of the really
interesting things about the iphone is
obviously every year after year is these
software updates you know so every year
apple continues to chip away they
continue to add new features all that
kind of stuff what are you guys really
thinking about what we're going to see
an iOS 5.0 well i definitely think we're
going to be seeing a lot of stuff and I
West nine-point-oh I definitely think
there
some sort of a wicked system like on
Android I really hope that's coming may
be improved push notifications as well
that's what a lot of people in the
morning yeah I expected to be pretty
well I really like Iowa spore though
there were some things that could have
used changes nope they like smooth up
the multitasking a little bit so I mean
close an app he likes case open the
multi tasking out like that and I
definitely think that I always thought
would be pretty good at other than I was
for yeah and about the multitasking
there I definitely think that needs a
lot of improvement not just the way it's
multitasking but the interface is just
really the way you could close more than
one app at a time I think a lot of the
the whole the perceived lag has to do
with just you it's all has to do with
the home button so you know double tap
the home button a thing like that and a
lot of times because it's you know it's
the double press and instead of near the
single press it's the algorithm cut has
to wait a certain amount of time to see
how you're doing a single press or
double press so I think a lot of that
just kind of comes down to fine-tuning
as far as mean they have to get it
exactly right yeah definitely i agree
yeah uh-uh i really i really would like
to see a widget system I mean you know
you look at the springboard on the ipod
and the iPhone the iPad you know it's a
solid interface you know it gets you
asked very quickly especially with the
addition of folders you know becomes
outdated compared to you know what you
see on you know Android which the other
widgets especially if you look at the
live tiles on windows phone 7 you know
the other phones they're really you know
moving forward to making you the home
screen filled with all kinds of
different things whereas you know on the
iphone you look at you see icons i mean
it's kind of a kind of as an end
necessary step in my opinion yeah agree
definitely with the windows phone 7 the
live tiles look amazing and i think
that's definitely a great new feature of
Windows Phone 7 now on to the next one
other thing that I really want to come
to iOS 5 or the next hour work day would
be something on the lock screen we
really don't have too much on the lock
screen yeah we can
slide1 long again like text messages and
bass calls but I really think Apple
should be putting something there and
the next update mmm I would definitely
like to see it approved home screen on
the iOS devices as well mmhmm yeah I
asked so I think we're all agree with
yet that's definitely probably one of
the main things that Apple is going to
work on now one other thing that you
know I've bought and come back and forth
on this for a while is whether Apple is
ever going to let you sideload
applications so actually the lie you not
not like jailbreak your phone or
anything like that but allow you to get
applications that aren't from the app
store and you know like take them
through itunes you know they wouldn't
have full access like in jail brake
application but what do you guys think
about the possibility of actually allow
Apple allowing you to sideload drum apps
onto your iPod or your iPhone yeah I'm
not sure that's ever gonna really happen
I can't really see that happening with
Apple in the near future they're really
gets jailbreaking in cydia and all that
so I'm not I'm just not sure about that
mmhmm yeah the same apples always very
secure with their app store and
something I don't worry know if they
would let you use other apps or not I
know the answer does that but it can be
very hectic because you never know
what's on the applications that's a good
point yeah I just only was the main
reason I've thought about this because
obviously they've you know Apple's been
trying to stop jailbreaking in obviously
they've never been able to do it you
know the jailbreak jailbreak teams have
always been able to you know get back
into it and you'll find new holes but
the main reason I said that was
obviously they they're they're putting
in the new mac app store but of course
on the Mac you can use the app store or
you can go ahead and just download your
own applications and the main reason say
that was actually they would somebody I
believe its engage was talking to Steve
Jobs and they actually asked well would
you ever allow side loading and he says
well not at this time which for Steve
Jobs you know usually he's like no or
yes so I thought that was kind of an
interesting thing he would say but you
know of course we will just have to say
okay so for the second segment e3 live
will be taking live questions from
everybody so as always every episode of
d3 live is filmed in front of blog TV
and we have well over 40 people in the
room right now let's go and just take
some questions so what is siloed
actually that's a pretty good question
what site loading is
mostly taken from Android it's the way
to go ahead and get applications not
from the app store so of course android
has the android market however there's
nothing stopping you in most phones a
couple of them do lock it down but most
owns life go ahead just you know take
any application that you want you know
you can download and side load it so I
don't know if we'll actually see that
but I think that wouldn't you know that
definitely would you know be an
interesting feature who would kind of
cut down a lot of the jailbreaking apps
that we would like do you think apple
will make lockscreen have more features
such as weather yeah that's what we were
talking about a little bit whether it
would be great what do you guys think
what would be some other cool features
that they could put on the lock screen I
personally want able to have an object
for example reply to emails or your text
messages and weather would be awesome to
have on the long chain as well I just
want a better notification system mainly
there yeah I don't be nice to see like
weather and email something good yeah i
agree with you guys i actually like to
students take the step further and
actually allow your apps so if you
download an app like let's say you a
download a twitter client we could
actually go ahead and put the twitter
climb on your locks brain actually allow
the applications themselves to go ahead
and you know customized i think that
would be pretty cool yeah that would be
great as well yes they'll be pretty
sweet be able to do it mm-hmm what do
you think the iphone 5 camera will can
get better actually yeah i think they
will I think the cameras you know
they're constantly especially in these
phones are constantly getting better you
know you know these used to be three
megapixels great now is five now eight
megapixel even starting to look a little
bit outdated you know I probably think I
mean it could I think it won't be a
massive upgrade I think I mean
personally don't you guys agree the
iphone four cameras pretty decent for a
cell phone yes mmm but but yeah that's
the thing I think that they will get a
lot better as far as you know every year
though you know maybe you might be an 8
megapixel camera maybe you might shoot
taking video so I definitely would to
see life Sydney Oh increase but I don't
think it'll be you know a a massive
overall I guess will the iphone 5 drop
calls now that's actually something that
we kind of touched down a little bit
I think that apples are really going to
need to at least partially redesign the
antenna on the next iPhone now of course
when they first did it they were very
excited about it you know they were
saying how it allows them to have more
space by integrating the antenna on the
outside I think actually it could very
well work as a no a pretty decent design
the only thing you know is that you know
I think they're just going to have to
tweak it a little bit make it where if
not that if they don't scrap the whole
thing they might just need to tweak it
so that you know there's not one place
where you touch it and it kills the
reception you know um great you know the
problem I'm an iphone 4 user I don't
believe either you have one but for me
when I travel with it they're just some
areas that it's worse than others for
example where I live if you touch the
antenna gate problem area on your phone
it's not too bad but I've traveled
places where it just drops immediately
completely yeah I think a lot of that
has to do with is that you know just
just lowers your reception so if you
were in a good area it might not really
make it a you know a big thing but if
you're on one of those fringe areas you
touch it you know you might lose the
signal all together so yeah I can
definitely see how that would make sense
is the iphone 5 wins refers to the
iphone 4gs actually that we were talking
about this a little bit before the show
started honestly I have no idea what do
you guys think the knicks iphones gonna
be called the iphone 5 the iphone 4gs i
honestly actually don't know yeah I
don't know either oh that's way we can
go with the iphone 4gs but you know has
a name for GN it so and it might not be
4g by that time so maybe something like
the 4s which doesn't sound like a great
name yeah maybe a what there's something
along the lines of a anniversary iphone
since its a 50 year oh yeah well i would
say that possibly 4gs if somehow they do
get it on at 40 network but if not then
i agree i don't know what it would be
called yeah I I entirely agree i can see
if they fit somehow was forgy capable
which i don't really see but if it was
i'd absolutely no expect them to just
toss the iphone 4g no but i don't think
it is so I mean I guess iphone body
would be my best guess but
honestly I don't really know I think
we'll just have to wait till we get a
little bit closer until they actually
announce it the will the iphone 5 have a
better graphic system yeah I would think
so i think that you know every year
after year apple you know updates the
you know these specs as far as you know
how fast it is i'm sure the graphics
will be improved you know I'm really
expecting to see is you know the next
Apple processor so I imagine they would
call it may be the 85 or whatever but i
would expect knew it would probably have
better graphics although the iphone 4
definitely is no slouch as far as
traffic's are concerned I mean there are
some really really good looking games on
the iphone 4 out was it called epic
circle that's that's the one yeah yeah
that looks amazing it's actually got the
Unreal Engine so um i would i would
expect them to go ahead and improve it a
little bit but to be honest I don't
really think it's all that necessary I
think the iphone 4 of course the ipad
ipod touch 4th generation included
aren't pretty solid graphics wise will
it'll be more act included in the iphone
5 that's actually they're probably
usually you know when they update with
the new OS the probably might have you
know like they had the compass app and a
game center stuff like that I would be
surprised if they come up with some
other sort of you know pre-built
application um to be honest I'm really
know what it would be but yeah they're
always adding more and more stuff
actually a lot of people in the chin are
talking that they think that the iphone
the next iphone will be the iphone x I
don't know that you got them an
interesting name what do you guys think
the iphone eggs does that sound good to
you yeah that really sounds like an
interesting name but i don't know if i
can see apple just going from something
like iphone four to iphone x the back to
a number again mmm yeah i don't know
what that really would relate to so
sounds cool but I don't add more use it
yeah I agree um will they be a
homescreen and lockscreen rotation on
the iphone 5 that's a great question um
you know i would love to see that I
think I've never actually really seen
early phone platforms actually allow you
to do that but I think that if any was
going to anybody was going to do it
would be Apple I mean you can obviously
do it on the ipad by rotating it I think
that would be a really interesting and
useful feature to go ahead and be able
to obviously neither for about a lot to
you keep it from doing it unnecessarily
but what do you think would that be kind
of interesting to go ahead and allow you
to use it and you know different
orientations on your on your iPhone spin
specific yeah definitely that's one of
the cool new features in cydia well I
should say do but yeah like a rotator
and you can do the same thing yes it
would definitely be interesting so yeah
absolutely i don't i don't know how well
as far as usability it might you might
not be perfect all the time but i think
it would be kinda interested when
especially is especially if apps but all
apps were you know had some way of
rotating as well what the way it is now
most apps don't a few of them do but if
they really made it where everything you
know if you rotate your phone everything
would go over that'll be really cool my
opinion so we have got that's it for
this episode of d3 live again i like to
give a special thanks to my guests tech
tech man TV as well as site race TV so
doesn't go ahead and check out their
