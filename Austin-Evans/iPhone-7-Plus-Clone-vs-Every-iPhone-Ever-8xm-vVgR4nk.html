video last week where I took a look at
the iPhone 7 clone
however today we've got something just a
little bit bigger so this is a clone of
the iPhone 7 plus and again I got to
give a big shout out to P sound for
holding this up with the mock-up the
first thing you'll probably noticed are
the cameras so while the iPhone 7 does
have a larger rear camera the plus slash
pro whatever they decide to call it is
actually rocking two rear facing cameras
this is by no means the first phone with
dual cameras so I recently checked out
some other phones that implement dual
cameras and interesting ways the cameras
can have different vocal ranges which
would give you some actual real zooming
capability on the iPhone and you could
also be able to take a photo with both
cameras at the same time which could
give you more detail and less noise one
thing to share with the normal iPhone 7
is the lack of a headphone jack so if
you take a look at the bottom of the
phones you'll see that there are dual
speakers on both now that's nice however
there's no headphone jack to be seen
which means that you're either going to
have to buy some Lightning headphones or
switch to bluetooth so to put all this
in perspective I have one of every
single iphone design yet so starting out
with the OG the original iPhone the
first thing that jumps out to me is how
much bigger this phone has gotten that
is crazy
and the thing was this was considered to
be a pretty big phone back in the day so
we take a look at the thickness of the
iPhone 7 plus we get 6.8 millimeters if
we compare that to the original iPhone
to have a pretty big difference this guy
was eleven point four millimeters thick
with all the talk about the iPhone 7
dropping the headphone jack it's easy to
forget the original iPhone also had
headphone jack issues so the port here
is very recessed some pairs of
headphones would fit but a lot of them
did need an adapter just to be able to
plug in your headphones something that
really hasn't changed that much in the
ears is the design so we're still
looking at aluminum builds and both
these phones feel nice I honestly feel
like the giant plastic window aside the
original iPhone design actually still
holds up pretty well today moving on we
have the iPhone 3G and 3GS so it was
still the same tiny sized iPhone
compared to the plus it was the first
iPhone that went to an entirely plastic
build it's not terrible but compared to
the original iPhone and especially the
following models it just feels a little
cheap a little plastic e next up we have
what is probably my favorite iPhone
design ever the iPhone 4 and 4s it's
just a really simple classy design so
you have two sheets of
sandwich by a band of metal that goes
around which includes the antennas now
this was definitely not perfect
especially the original iPhone 4s would
suffer from antenna gate which if you
grabbed them from the wrong way would
kind of keep the antenna from actually
giving you any service but besides that
the design itself still absolutely holds
up today they did still stick with a
three and a half inch screen though
which is tiny compared to today's
standards I mean seriously this entire
phone fits inside the iPhone 7 plus
screen moving on we have the iPhone 5
and 5s this is very much a continuation
of the four design so it did feature a
larger display or for the most part it
was very similar with the addition of a
metal back the iPhone 5c was a little
bit of an odd one out so essentially the
same internals from the iPhone 5 however
it was in a new plastic shell so if we
compare the iPhone 7 clones to the 6 and
6s you'll see that they look very
similar so there are some differences
the cameras are different both on the 7
as well as the 7 plus and the antenna
lines are much less noticeable another
possible change is with the home button
so well the 6 and 6s have the same
physical buttons that have been here
forever
the 7 likely will have a touch sensitive
button so we think of this like 3d touch
or force touch on the Mac so essentially
when you press it it will give you a
little bit of a sensation of feedback
however there's no actual physical
button press there it might not be the
most exciting upgrade what do you guys
think about the iPhone 7 let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
