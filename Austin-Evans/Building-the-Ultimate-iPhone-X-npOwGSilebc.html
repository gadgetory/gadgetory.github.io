hey guys this is Austin here on the
channel we've built some pretty
questionable stuff but today it's time
to give the IFO antenna shots so a - you
look challenged us to do something a
little creative with their new mod case
I felt like you know it seemed like the
natural choice so if you guys aren't
familiar with Rhino shield what I use on
my phone every day now the idea here is
that it is a bumper that will protect
your phone while still leaving the front
and back exposed however with their new
mod case you actually can do a lot more
than that I like using the black frame
with the white buttons but you can also
add a backplate now not only will this
help protect your phone but also allow
you to add lenses to the iPhone so you
have a few different lenses to choose
from but my favorite is the HD
wide-angle now the idea here is
especially when you're using the iPhone
10 only do you have the telephoto camera
and the normal wide-angle we put this
guy on it gives you an even wider field
of view the lenses just screw right on
and once you get them in place you just
take off the lens cap and if the camera
boom well a lot of lenses can be fairly
soft this actually looks really nice and
sharp and especially when you put it
side-by-side with the normal iPhone
camera it makes a big difference
the laud case can also protect against
some pretty serious abuse and I found
that out the hard way as well as on
purpose Rhino shield claims that this
will protect up to an 11 foot drop test
and this looks like a little bit more
than that so here goes nothing this is
my iPhone so I really hope it doesn't
break okay three two one oh three two
one
oh I don't want to look I don't want to
look I'm gonna look Oh see the still
recording hi Ken
okay oh yeah totally fine I wasn't
worried or anything so any good vlogger
should know that you need the casein ice
that's special so now I do we have a
gorilla pod but we also have a tripod
mount for a smartphone now there are a
ton of different versions of these I
like this metal one which I've actually
seen under a bunch of different brand
names but I'll make sure to link this
one in the description also a little pro
tip even though this has rubber it
actually does make sense to use
something like a rhino shield because it
will scratch your phone so now this is
looking a lot better but good video is
nothing without good audio that's where
this comes in so this is the shirt MV 88
and it is that whitening microphone so
the should and theory sound a lot better
than the built-in microphone on the
iPhone but the only problem is is that
the lightning port on this guy is tiny
which means that uh we had to improvise
this and by improvised I mean can cut up
a lightning dock to make it actually fit
on her phone because he's talented and
dedicated and hates money I mean come on
you clicked on building the ultimate
iPhone 10 did you not think we were
going to get to this point so I think
the wider angle camera definitely helps
for vlogging but the microphone sounds
so much better than the built-in iPhone
and I mean yes there are probably
slightly more practical ways of vlogging
from your iPhone but for something that
if you want to carry this around this
your puck I can't say it with a straight
face
no one's gonna walk around with this but
it works kind of alright so I am now
flogging from my supercool iPhone 10
vlog ray so you guys can be the judge
for yourself with the quality but with
the wider angle camera or you're getting
a little bit more in the shot and
hopefully the mic sounds pretty good as
well but say vlogging is your thing but
you still want to build the ultimate
iPhone oh we're not done yet
this is the wireless universal foldable
keyboard and okay well that's a little
bit of a dirty pouch whatever
oh wait oh wait wait that's actually
wait that's a full-sized keyboard my
geology 101 report is can is a really
handsome guy okay no we don't have to
talk about that at all Ken because I
have a monitor hey alright let's do this
let's start tweeting hi my name is
Austin and I make bad decisions so much
fun I love doing dumb stuff with tech
it's the best if all that wasn't enough
you can also add a blue truth game
controller such as this SteelSeries
Nimbus because you know when you have an
HDMI display you gotta play some games
and I'm playing Minecraft on an iPhone
using a game controller and a monitor
also why is nothing loading oh how did I
break minecraft that's it that should be
a thing oh there we go
I actually got to say this does feel
like playing Minecraft on anything else
the controller feels good pretty much
just like something like an Xbox
controller and well for some reason the
iPhone is displaying in a smaller window
it does work should anyone ever actually
play games like this probably not is it
fun
absolutely so well some might say this
isn't the most practical setup in the
world but I'm actually pretty impressed
with some of it most notably the video
rate now no you shouldn't probably use a
Bluetooth keyboard and a controller an
HDMI display with your iPhone but if
you're shooting video this is actually
not a bad way of going just add a
microphone and something that these
lenses that go with the Rhino shield mod
case can make a big difference so what
would you guys put in your ultimate
iPhone 10 and no you can't just say an
Android phone let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
