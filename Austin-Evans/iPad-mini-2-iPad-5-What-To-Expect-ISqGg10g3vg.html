here with what to expect with the iPad
Mini 2 and I've had five before we get
started though I've teamed up with my
friends over at Wynn to do a giveaway of
a brand new iPod Touch 5th generation F
Wynn is a brand new channel that gives
you prizes for checking out apps now
they're also doing an iPod giveaway so
be sure to go check them out as well so
if you guys are interested in winning
this brand-new iPod touch
all you had to do is go subscribe to app
win here on YouTube as well as like them
on Facebook and I'll have both those
links in the description of this video
and then just drop a comment on this
video saying whatever you want
now this giveaway is totally
international so it's open to pretty
much everybody and it'll be going for
exactly one week starting today so good
luck moving on to the new iPads let's
start with the iPad Mini 2 now I am a
huge fan of the current iPad Mini in
fact I've got one right here and I've
got all my notes on it for this video so
there's a lot that this tablet does
right the form factor in my opinion is
practically perfect iOS is of course
pretty good for tablets if you guys
didn't know but one of my major
complaints is the screen now really the
screen isn't actually all that bad but
what does kind of suck on it is the
resolution which is definitely way way
WAY inferior to the current Retina
displays on the iPad 3 the iPad 4 they
just absolutely blow this thing out of
the water however it looks like Apple
will be including the Retina display in
the next iPad Mini now of course this is
great news a better screen is always
better however it does leave a couple of
questions unanswered so for starters
what's going to happen to the design of
the iPad Mini like I said I love the
design I love the thinness and all that
kind of stuff but when the iPad 3 got a
Retina display it actually got quite a
bit thicker so hopefully that does not
happen with the next iPad Mini the next
minute should also be more powerful so
the current model is basically just an
iPad 2 internally however with the
Retina display it's definitely need some
more horsepower so it expects something
like an Apple a6x processor which would
of course be a lot better for gaming but
more importantly just being able to
drive all those pixels on that display
moving on to the full-sized iPad 5
expect to see a major redesign so if you
look at the iPad Mini compared to a
current iPad you'll see one big
difference that is the iPad Mini has
very small bezels on the left and the
right of the screen whereas the iPad 4
has pretty much the same size bezel all
the way around the screen according to
these leaked pictures the next iPad
should be very similar to the mini in
this
regarde with very small bezels on the
left and the right meaning that the next
iPad will actually be slightly smaller
taking a look at the back of the iPad 5
you can't say it is a bit more narrow
and on top of that it also has a lot of
the same design cues from the current
iPad Mini with a flat back along with a
very very thin design so of course the
iPad Mini is quite a bit cheaper so it
definitely makes sense for Apple to make
the full-size iPad as fast as possible
so I expect to see an Apple a7 X
processor most likely with 4 cores which
give you tons and tons of power to
handle all kinds of games and just all
kinds of crazy stuff it really should be
a very very powerful machine as far as
remember going to see these new iPads I
would expect to see a launch around
September or October of this year for a
price pretty much exactly the same as
the current models so there you have it
what to expect with the iPad Mini 2 and
the iPad 5 of course if you want to get
in on the giveaway of the iPod Touch 5th
generation be sure to go check out at
