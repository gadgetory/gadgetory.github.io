for the iPhone and iPod Touch Garage
Band has been around for a while on the
iPad and even longer on the Mac go over
today Apple released the full version of
it on the iPhone iPod Touch so swing
give you guys a quick demo so there's a
couple of differences between this and
the iPad version most notably it's just
a lot smaller you'll still find a lot of
the really cool features that does make
rajv an awesome so I'll go ahead and go
over some of them so the first thing I
do is show you guys just your recording
some different sound effects and whatnot
so there are a lot of different
instruments and the first thing I start
with is drums because I'll be honest I
think the drums are that's my favorite
day so as you guys can see here if we
want me to go just mess around with it
and do whatever you want there also are
several different types of drums so my
favorite is a live rock kit so we can
see here you know you know you can just
mess around with it and of course as you
guys may have been able to guess from
that I'm not very good at this however I
can still have a lot of fun with it it
is a lot of fun you know to mess with
and everything so there are a lot of
other things I want to go through them
fairly briefly so I can demo them all
first of all you have guitar amp so if
you'd like you can plug in your guitar
and you actually use your iPhone you
know record GarageBand all that kind of
stuff I don't have a guitar and I don't
know how to play so can't let demo that
for you but of course it is there now
the second thing is the audio recorder
so for example if we want to record a
bit so I'm just open it up real quick
I just want to record something right
here so really that's
actually that's my song I don't why I
should do that but I
you can record you guys and see it's
picking up my voice and you can just
record some vocals or whatever although
to be honest if you really being serious
you'd probably want to get like some
kind of external mic but no big deal now
here is the sampler so for example we
could record a sound and then play it
using the on-screen music keyboards so
so the text on the bottom over here we
have smart drums this is a little bit
different from the other kind of drums
so instead of you know just tapping on
it whatever we can actually bring the
beats in so we have loud simple whatnot
so you can move things around you just
kinda mess around with that and we also
can decide which instruments we want and
all that kind of stuff over here we have
smart bass this might be a little bit
hard to listen to so turn the volume up
but and if you're a giant new gluck i am
you can turn on autoplay and then kind
of play a little beat for us here now
that's nothing too special but like I
said if you're a giant noob like I am
it's pretty nice and handy to have
here's another thing smart keyboard so
if we want we just and once again crank
up that autoplay this amazing
and as always you have plenty of
different options electric piano rock
organ and all that kind of good stuff so
I think that's going to be about it we
also do have the guitar which works
pretty much the same as the bass as well
as the keyboard but I'll go out to the
drums because that's the only thing I'm
sort of decent at so let's say you just
record some awesome beats or whatever
all you do is click on this button and
it'll take you to your full track so you
Jason see here I did some drums as well
as I did some automatic guitar whoops
don't want to actually move that so what
we can do is just scroll back
it and of course this is just something
pretty simple I put together we can of
course add all kinds of other
instruments we can add extra drum tracks
and if we double tap on this we can loop
delete cut copy all that kind of good
stuff
speaking of the iPad and the Mac this is
a universal application so let's say you
bought you've already bought it for your
iPad all you need to do is just download
it for your iPhone or iPod touch and
you're good to go
likewise if you'd like to share your
clips around or you know move your
transitions and your projects and all
that kind of stuff over to the Mac
version of GarageBand you can do that
easily if you want to back up to my
songs I'll show you guys and also just
simply export so if I click on here we
can export it to iTunes I'm fortunate
we're not going to sell it on iTunes but
you can bring it over to your iTunes
library or you can email somebody else
or yourself if you feel like it so
anyway guys it's going to be about it
for my video on GarageBand this is going
to be a $4 $0.99 application and of
course like I said it is universal for
both the Mac as well as the iPhone iPod
Touch so you guys are interested
definitely recommend it I've had a lot
of fun with it and I definitely think
I'll be playing it quite a bit more
