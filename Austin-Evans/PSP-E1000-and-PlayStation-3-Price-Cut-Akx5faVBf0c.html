the brand-new PSP e1000 along with the
PlayStation 3 price cut to start with
let's talk a little bit about the e 1000
this is going to be the fifth major
iteration of the PlayStation Portable
and what this brings is a budget model
to the mix now of course the PlayStation
Vita will be coming very soon and
obviously it's going to be replacing the
PSP it looks like sony expects that the
PSP should still be able to hang around
for a little while as a budget model so
some of the things that you'll see in
the e 1000 is that it's going to have an
all matte black finish and a fairly
nice-looking redesigned personally I
actually like this better than the
current PSP design that we have today
now one of the major reasons why it is
going to be cheaper is it actually lacks
Wi-Fi which is definitely kind of
interesting of course they came out with
the PSP go which light UMD drive from
was totally based on downloads now
they're going to go the opposite
direction
forget downloads and only go um DS what
really sets us apart from other PSP
models is the price so be available a
little bit later on this year for 99
euros yeah you heard me right euros that
I should going to be a European
exclusive release a little bit of a
disappointment actually I would not mind
picking one of these up I sold by
psp-1000 a long time ago
Lili regretted it and I actually would
not mind picking one of these up for
myself
next a news that applies to everyone the
PlayStation 3 is getting a rather nice
price cut so as of today the PlayStation
3 is going to be available for $50 or 52
euros less so that means for the hundred
60 gig model it will be 250 dollars or
euros and for the 320 gig model it will
be available for $300 or 340 liking this
I think $50 off is just going to get
right up closer to the we into the Xbox
360 and of course going to help the
sales during the holiday so there you
have it a new PSP model and a
PlayStation 3 price cut what do you guys
think are you going to finally take the
plunge on a new Playstation 3 now that's
a little bit cheaper or you can go ahead
and jump on the bandwagon with the PSP
