with the tutorial showing you how you
can jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch or
iPad and the latest iOS 5.1.1 firmware
and we're going to be using today is
absinthe and this is available for Mac
Windows and Linux now before we begin
there's a couple things I do want to go
over for starters this does support most
but not all devices on iOS 5.1.1 what
this does support is the iPhone 3GS the
iPhone 4 the iPhone 4s the iPod Touch
third and fourth generation the iPad one
iPad 2 iPad 3 as well as the Apple TV
second generation the only device on iOS
5.1.1 that this does not support is
going to be the Apple TV 3rd generation
on top of that this is a fully
untethered jailbreak which if you guys
don't know the difference basically this
is the correct time jailbreak this is
the one that you want it doesn't require
you to have to read jailbreak any time
you need to reboot or anything like that
everything works just as you would
expect before we begin there are a
couple of things we need to do to get
ready so for starters wooden grab your
device so in this case I'm using an iPad
3 I'm go ahead and plug it in via USB to
your Mac or your PC now come over to
your Mac or PC open up iTunes and then
come over to devices now here we need to
actually make a backup now this is
optional but I do really recommend it as
it could take several hours if you do
not do this as absence will have to
jailbreak in do all this kind of backing
up by itself but if we go ahead and just
back up the data and wipe our iPad
iPhone or iPod Touch it will make it
much much quicker so you need to do is
just right click on your device and
click on backup now if you have an
iCloud backup it doesn't really matter
the best way to do it is via iTunes now
if you have a lot of stuff it will take
a long time I'm using a fresh restore
right now so it didn't really take all
that long but just be sure the banks up
all of your data to iTunes
once you're done backing up come over to
your device and open up settings come
over to general and scroll all the way
down to reset what we're going to do is
delete all the data on our device and
now of course we'll make absents much
much quicker again this is optional but
since we just matched it all up it's not
a big deal so go ahead click on erase
all content and settings click erase and
click erase one more time now this point
your device is going to need to reboot
and all that kind of stuff so I'll be
right back as soon as it's done once
your device is done rebooting you need
to come over to your computer and then
we'll ask you to either setup or a store
you can do either these
I recommend go hanging ahead and setting
up as a new iPad is of course there's no
reason to remove all of your data right
makeover since we just cleared it out so
go ahead click on set up as a new iPad
you can go ahead just give it a name so
we'll just say null it doesn't really
matter too much right now and make sure
that you're not automatically syncing
anything so once your device is fully
set up we can come back over to our
computer and open up absinthe
so absent the super easy all you do is
of course if your device still plugged
in via USB you see it says it's detected
so in my case iPad free Wi-Fi with iOS
5.1.1 detected so once you see that go
ahead and click jailbreak now at this
point it will take quite a while so just
be patient and I'll be back as soon as
it's done once the absinthe is done go
ahead and open up your device and then
scroll over to your last page you should
now see city installed however we're not
quite done yet now what we need to do is
restore from our backup in iTunes so to
do this all you do is come over to
iTunes and you can just right click on
your device and restore from backup now
this is gonna be super easy now instead
of doing the null or whatever name that
we created what you do is come up to our
most recent one which would have been
right about here I believe and then go
ahead and click on restore and in this
case just hit and use older backup
because of course we did the newer one
it's not going to actually work so this
point just give it some time to restore
and we'll be right back as soon as it's
done alright so once you open up city
you are officially fully jailbroken
congratulations now at this point all
you need to do is go download all the
cool themes and tweaks and mods that you
would like anyway guys if you enjoyed
