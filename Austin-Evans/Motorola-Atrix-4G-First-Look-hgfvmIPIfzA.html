Mobility a first smartphone technology
the world
most powerful smartphone it's running a
dual-core processor it has one gigabyte
of RAM
it has dual mics whose cancellation so
you can be heard and here just like a
phone should do and of course it comes
with 16 gigs of internal memory
expandable up to 32 gigs of RAM
mandible memory so
for a total of 48 gigabytes or memory on
your phone
it's running Android 2.2 that's from
facing camera 1.3 five megapixel camera
it also shoots 720p high-def video so
I'm going to show you what kind of video
looks like in this
it's the dock for this this is not an
epic this laptop dog this is the true
convergence of a smartphone with PC
likability
so this is what we shot outside
like
so that was shot with the phone
okay
and then of course you have other video
content on it
so just like the Droid actually using
this as an Android dog
to power HD live video and then when I
take it out of here I get up in the
morning I do my brows and I check
facebook my check FML and then I want to
go because I'm going to work I put my
phone into the dock back here and now on
the laptop dock this becomes my laptop
so anything I can do on a lot phones
this is it
it's full PC browsing it's not like it's
not similar in his full HTML web
browsing and then I could continue
through the mobile window of my phone to
take phone calls take tags to a text
another kind of cool feature if there's
a phone number on here I'll just
right-click on it and then I can make a
call it goes right through the phone
this weighs 2.4 pounds it's an 11 inch
screen so when I get home I just drop it
into my peripherals
yeah and it opens up the web pop
application like it did there so now you
notice how quickly it loaded I mean
we're not when we have to pull home when
you turn on a computer or PC I'm in a
laptop it takes within a couple minutes
but then five to seven seconds it's up
and running and I'm working again so if
I want to choose to do something on my
phone while I'm reading if I have a call
the tag or I want to check my email
through my phone however want to do it
and I just copied and pasted from the
webpage into my phone to send a text
message so this is true convergence up
to your products to make the world's
first most powerful phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
