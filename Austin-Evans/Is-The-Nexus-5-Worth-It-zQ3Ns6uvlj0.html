of leaks and hype we finally have the
new Google Nexus 5 but the question is
is it worth it take a look around the
phone and it's a fairly unassuming
looking device even though it's entirely
plastic it has a good feel in the hands
with sharply cut edges and tight build
quality on the black version the back
and sides are coated in a soft touch
rubbery material which makes the phone a
bit grippy and reminds me a lot of the
HTC One X there are also ceramic buttons
which add a bit of character to the
otherwise forgettable phone one big area
of disappointment is in the speaker not
only is it easy to cover with a finger
accidentally but it's just way too quiet
fire the Nexus up and you'll be greeted
by a 5-inch 1920 by 1080 display it's a
good-looking screen with great viewing
angles thanks to the IPS design and it
gets reasonably bright
unfortunately college is slightly less
saturated than I like but overall it's
solid
the main reason the Nexus 5 exists
however is to show off Google's vision
of Android and you won't be disappointed
here as it's running Android 4.4 KitKat
most of the changes here are cleaning up
and simplifying the UI for example the
on-screen buttons and status bar are now
transparent there's a new font as well
as bigger icon sizes and lots of subtle
tweaks like removing the holo blue in
favour of a planar looking white I
really like all of the visual changes it
gives Android a much more grown-up look
and feel the hangouts app has now been
upgraded with SMS support which works
although it would be nice to have better
integration and Google now is just a
quick swipe from the left on your home
screen like the Moto X you can say okay
Google to launch a voice search although
I quickly turn this off hey Google and
that is probably the biggest problem
with how Google now works on the Nexus 5
it is very easy to accidentally trip it
by saying hey Google or sup Google or
okay Google and it will pretty much pick
it up inside you'll find the Nexus 5 is
stacked with a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 800 2 gigabytes of RAM and
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of storage
it delivers absolutely awesome
performance and normal use making the
Nexus one of the most responsive phones
you can buy the benchmarks back this up
putting it right on par with phones like
the note 3 and the iPhone 5s for a
camera you'll find an 8 megapixel
shooter with optical image stabilization
the results are pretty decent there's a
good amount of detail and the colors are
accurate the image stabilization makes a
big difference for low-light shooting as
well unfortunately images are also
washed out sometimes and it has real
trouble focusing a lot of the time my
biggest problem with the camera is
definitely the awful stock Android
camera app it's slow in the interface
drives me crazy any time I need to go
grab a manual setting on the other hand
video on the Nexus 5 is pretty solid
so the microphones do a good job with
audio and with that optical image
stabilization it helps you get
nice and smooth shots by far my biggest
problem with the Nexus 5 is battery life
as by the end of the day I was usually
scrambling to find a charger most times
it would give out with less than three
hours of screen on time which is just
unacceptable for smartphone in 2013
hopefully we can see some kind of update
to improve the battery life as Android
4.4 is new there's may be a chance that
some optimization needs to be done but
right now it's a pretty major issue so
overall what's the verdict is the Nexus
5 worth it
it's got a few flaws like a very quiet
speaker and if you battery life but it's
also one of the fastest phones you can
buy as well obviously going to be the
most up-to-date Android phone on the
market so for $350 it's hard to pass up
the Nexus 5 as long as you keep a
charger handy so what do you think is
the Nexus 5 the phone for you definitely
be sure to let me know what you think in
