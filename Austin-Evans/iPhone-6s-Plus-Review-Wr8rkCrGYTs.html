here with my review of the iPhone 6s
plus what's the new iPhone 6s plus
side-by-side with the 6 plus and not
much has changed it's a tiny bit thicker
which is no big deal but it is
noticeably heavier this is mostly due to
the new 3d touch display but Apple also
switched to 7000 series aluminum this
generation thanks to bendgate unbox
therapy put the 6s to the test and
surprise surprise it holds up much
better than the 6 plus another change is
the addition of a new rose gold color
which joins the same space grey silver
and gold options from the last gen along
with a shiny new S badge which is the
best way to tell the new model apart it
is a little bit heavier I think that's
the only noticeable difference when I
pick up the phone and hold in the hand
so it's a little bit of a heavier phone
especially because I use a 6s plus but
otherwise it's a pretty simple
understated clean familiar design it's a
nice design but beside phones like the
galaxy note 5 it's not too impressive it
does have a nice feel in the hand with a
seamless curve but that also makes it a
little slippery I talked to my six plus
a few times and if anything the extra
heft makes the 6s plus even easier to
get away from you with a 5.5 inch 1080p
screen the plus Dwarfs the normal
success if you're willing to give up
some one hand ability you're getting a
nice screen it can't match the terrific
AMOLED display on the note 5 but it's
got nice color great viewing angles and
plenty of resolution one of the big new
features of the success is the addition
of 3d touch I was a little bit on the
gimmick train with 3d touch at first but
the more I use it the more I find myself
liking it especially when you get into
apps like Instagram or Safari I've just
been able to preview a link or profile
it's something that I found really
useful unlike a normal long press this
allows you to use varying levels of
force to pull up different options this
is useful in a few places 3d touch to
the side of the screen and you'll open
the multitasking and by 3d touching the
keyboard you'll pull up a cursor the
touch ID fingerprint scanner is also
seen improvements it's now so fast
that's hard to get to your lockscreen
but I guess I can live with such a
horrible problem iOS 9 is largely the
same as on other iPhones but it runs
noticeably faster here which leads me to
one of the best features of the 6s
performance on paper the Apple a9 looks
fairly tame with a dual-core 1.8
gigahertz processor paired with 2 gigs
of DDR 4 memory but this is one
seriously fast phone I went in depth in
a video recently which you guys can
check
but the success is approaching laptops
when it comes to performance you should
have no problem playing any game out
there for the foreseeable future
performance wise is what you would
expect it's snappy it's quick it handles
whatever you throw at it all this power
means the 6s plus does get a bit warm
under gaming though nothing too crazy
but it's noticeable next to a phone like
the note 5 in real use you'll notice the
speed but the biggest difference is the
extra memory older iPhones had to reload
apps all the time where the 6s does a
far better job of keeping things in
memory where Apple didn't improve is
with storage the base iPhone still comes
with 16 gigs which just isn't enough
it's almost like the base model purely
exists to get people to spend the extra
$100 to upgrade to 64 gigabytes at least
it is fast storage though a non tech dug
into the hardware and found the 6s is
using what's essentially a full SSD like
in the 12-inch MacBook
one of the biggest improvements are the
new cameras the rear shooter has been
bumped up to 12 megapixels and while
it's not a huge leap it's still a
rock-solid performer there's extra
resolution which is helpful for cropping
and the color remains nice and natural
Apple's camera app doesn't give as much
manual controls a lot of Android cameras
but it's quick and reliably take solid
shots the 10 frames per second burst is
still here which is great for capturing
action and it has a smart time-lapse
mode that can make for some very cool
shots the 6s plus has optical image
stabilization which is helpful for
low-light where it really makes a
difference is in video I mean it's
almost revolutionary in terms of what
they able to do I mean footage almost
looks like it's on a Steadicam like it
looks really great
alright so 4k in my opinion on an iPhone
has been a long time coming this entire
video has been shot on a success and as
you can see it holds up really nicely
with a mix of digital and optical
stabilization the footage looks nice
especially as it's now capable of 4k
you've also got solid slow-motion
options you can shoot at 120 frames per
second or even 240 FPS if you don't mind
bumping the resolution down to 720p the
new front-facing camera has also been
bumped up majorly in quality it now has
five megapixels pair with Apple's new
live photos which records a bit of video
before and after you snap a picture it's
a solid upgrade it's a far better
looking camera through the last
generation and it can use the screen as
a surprisingly usable flash one of the
biggest advantages of the 6s plus over
the normal success is battery life
there's just no comparison where I
struggle to get through a full day of
heavy use with the 6s the plus hasn't
let me down yet
even with using navigation and shooting
4k video the 6s plus holds up really
well on the battery front well it's not
a massive upgrade the + improves on a
lot of the smaller issues with the last
generation it might be pricey but the
iPhone 6s plus has definitely earned its
spot is my new daily driver
just kissed your camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
