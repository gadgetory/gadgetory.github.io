Boston and today we're doing a video on
how to waste money on Amazon at $200
although this this my friends is
definitely not going to be wasting any
money at all so if for some reason you
guys are not familiar the Sony Walkman
was essentially the iPod of its day
although actually kids know what I
thought that rate you think a job on
this I'm already excited and we've just
gotten to the video 1984 so we used a
visa and this cost a hundred and five
dollars and forty seven cents I have not
listened to a cassette since I was
probably like 10 years old I know our
our car when I was growing up oh we had
a cassette player in it and my mom used
to play all kinds of cassettes so it's
kinda interesting about this is if I
actually open it up very gently from the
side here and then I do we have our
cassette player but if you actually see
here on the door this guy's actually
going to have a full FM radio and all
the electronics built into the door
because of course it does close it up
and then if I plug the headphones in oh
I mean
alright so all we should turn on the
tape and then we need to pick out normal
tape type and then does this have any
Dolby I don't think it does right I
don't even think they make tapes with
Dolby noise reduction anymore you know
percocet pet sounds really good I'm
really loud aren't I look at this thing
I mean this thing is ten years older
than I am she's more than oh it's almost
ten years older than I am and yet it
looks basically flawless and you pair a
decent pair of headphones with it it
really does not sound bad oh wait wait
wait hold on hold on hold on so the
porter pros ive taking a look at what
i've not seen are the wireless edition
and then a new walkman you really plan
this out well good job sir so first of
all how much are these because i know
the old porter pros are fairly
inexpensive right eighty dollars okay if
you guys are not familiar the cost
porter pros are legitimately retro
headphones i mean they've been selling
them for years and years and years and
this is essentially the same headphones
that they've just added bluetooth to
what I'm not familiar with is the Sony
in W 845 Walkman so unlike our cassette
walkman this is going to be able to play
mp3 files flax AAC and it's all going to
be running off of a micro SD card and it
does support bluetooth as well so we've
got full app decks which I'm guessing
this supports apdex right oh wow yeah
Walkmans have definitely changed this
actually does look a lot like an iPod
it's pretty to sort of talk about iPods
because Apple doesn't make them anymore
and is that a proprietary connector of
course it is of course Sony can't ship
micro USB or USB see they have to use
some weird PSP looking connector these
guys open and we see oh it actually
comes in a carrying case these are our
porta pros now when you're talking about
80s looking headphones it's hard to
imagine something that looks is that
much more retro than this and this is
really well built it feels nice I'm
really just surprised that they still
make walkman boom okay we are connected
via app deck and Bluetooth alright let's
go straight to the retro zone go to our
tracklist folders SD card Hotel
California get a try I will say that the
base is going to be a little bit heavy
on these guys so it's not going to be a
super neutral sound you're definitely
gonna hear a lot of the punch especially
with a song like this I can hear there's
a little bit of a lack of sort of
clarity on the high end but you'd have
to keep in mind that we are using
bluetooth you know stop to keep in mind
this is sort of a more retro style sound
I will say that this is goofy these
headphones are great when you have them
wired the wireless option it just feels
like an afterthought I mean yeah sure
they didn't want to ruin the look of
them so I'm sure they didn't want to
like integrated somewhere else but maybe
I feel like these could been like put
inside here or something like this just
feels I don't know rock form beyond
protection rock boys that name sounds
familiar
what this is a bumper wait the predator
case all right we just went from being
super cool and like having some really
awesome stuff towards I'm almost
positive a waste of our money
how much is this 120 ollars I'm guessing
this is an iPhone case back to reality
how was a $120 iPhone case ever actually
going to be worth it so with that we
have a protective case for my phone so I
don't get I mean it's magnetic but it
keeps the size of the phone completely
unprotected I mean all right all right
let me be real here it's metal it will
probably protect your phone it will not
protect your phone from scratches but
maybe a drop it looks kind of cool
you're definitely showing off a lot of
the phone Wow
mysterious a totally black box 10.1 inch
portable blu-ray player what wait
they make these Wow that oh okay that
looks super high quality how much is
this one hundred and eighty dollars dude
wait hold on okay so the idea with the
portable DVD player is that it's going
to be something that you can watch like
sort of on a crappy screen when you're
like in the car or something but a
blu-ray looks much nicer and if you're
paying this much more this had better
have a nice screen there we go that's
yep 1024 by 600 high resolution you know
barely above what you can get on a DVD
cool great this is gonna be terrible
whoa whoa wait
oh man that's what my favorite thing is
cheap glossy plastic what's why why are
you oh yeah I mean like okay I kind of
get it if you're watching the video
you're gonna like swivel it but that
that feels really wrong I mean I will
say one thing
speakers are actually not terrible this
sounds okay this looks like a super
cheap tablet like a $100 tablet or
something I mean the screen is not
unusable I mean I wouldn't mind sitting
and watching a movie on this especially
with the speakers but it's not gonna be
super impressive I'm also really curious
about the battery life I think with a
blu-ray drive it's probably not gonna
last that long I'm afraid
what's coming up behind me right now oh
it sounds heavy what is it oh okay this
is much more confusing cuz this is what
I first saw what is this now I'm not
actually asking what is this
solar-powered Tiki why did you get this
I'm gonna say that because you got the
Walkman
this is forgiving but this is kind of up
there with like the ball bearing and the
Robo dinosaur for some of the dumbest
stuff that we've ever taken a look at on
mystery Tech okay another mysterious
looking box okay there's some Fuji
Instax film okay I think I know where
this is going oh it's a printer oh I
don't know where this is going at all so
last time we had Instax on a mystery
tech it was for that weird like phone
scanner thing when you put your phone on
top of it and like basically took a
picture of your phone screen but this
this is a printer but on instant film so
the setup on this guy is pretty
straightforward you just need to turn it
on and connect it over Wi-Fi to the app
and in theory we just need to add this
film and it will be good to go and you
can also zoom in you can set filters but
I just want to print it like that
alright so we have our printed film
actually I didn't know how to describe
that I'm really kind of curious how
something like this works typically with
a lot of these mobile printers it's just
going to be something like Zee
but this is printing on actual film so
I'm curious if maybe there's like a
screen inside or something to expose the
film what I mean you can see it's
obviously gonna need a little bit of
time to finish processing but it
actually looks pretty good it doesn't
look anything like that last printer we
looked at which was literally just
taking a photo of your phone screen this
looks to be a little bit more high
quality that's um that's pretty nice and
I like the square film too there's gonna
be a lot bigger than normal
Instax so it's been some little pricey
but this is actually pretty legit that's
a good job oh you got a slab oh dude I
think for the first time this is
actually going to be a rain check I
really do feel like Lapo deserves its
own video as opposed to a quick little
look on mystery tech anyway as always if
you guys want you got any of this stuff
links will be in the description and if
you really want to see a lava video
tweet at ken bolito
please make a lab a video he'll really
love that and he'll definitely encourage
me to do a whole video on it ASAP so
yeah just tweet Kent well let I'm here
with know your full thoughts and
everything you think about about life
and stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
