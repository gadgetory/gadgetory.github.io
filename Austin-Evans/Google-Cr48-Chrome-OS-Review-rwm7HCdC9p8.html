specifically for Chrome OS and as such
is a great first look at what you can
expect to see when the first Chrome OS
notebooks start shipping later this year
the first thing you'll notice about the
cr-48
is the very basic yet solid design there
isn't a single bit of branding on the
entire laptop which is a refreshing
change compared to the majority of
netbooks and laptops you'll find today
the overall package is just under an
inch thin and the entire body is coated
in a soft touch plastic which while
feels great in use is nearly impossible
to keep clean it's a bit on the heavy
side though but certainly well within
reason it is like me imports compared to
a Windows laptop with only VGA out a
power connector a single USB 2.0 port
which is only useful for a mouse right
now a headphone jack and an SD card slot
the cr-48 sports a matte 12.1 inch
display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
which has solid viewing angles and the
matte coating keeps the screen nicely
legible even in sunlight above the
screen you'll find a webcam and
microphone the webcam is only of okay
quality but the microphone is are
presently solid the keyboard is where
you'll find the biggest change from a
standard netbook or laptop the layout
has been changed with the removal of the
function and Windows key instead you'll
find an extended control + Alt key to my
great satisfaction the caps lock key has
been removed with a search key that
opens a new tab along the top row you'll
find that the function keys have been
replaced with a row of helpful browser
buttons including back forward refresh
full screen as well as controls for
brightness volume and a power button the
key is very nicely spaced out in the
increasingly popular chiclet style and
after using it for two weeks I've got to
say it is one of the better laptop
keyboards I've ever used the trackpad
however leaves a lot to be desired it's
a nice size but likes any physical
buttons which makes it difficult to use
often times make me rely on a two finger
tap for right clicking which more often
than not does not register personally I
just used a mouse as often as I could
with a cr-48
you also find some very nice battery
life of around 7 hours in my testing
along with of course Wi-Fi and support
for 3G which helps make sure you always
be
to connect to the internet now let's
move on to the most important part of
the review Chrome OS put simply Chrome
OS is a stripped-down Linux distribution
and boots straight into the Chrome
browser you can't download applications
or anything else's the sword everything
you do is inside the browser this is a
major issue for a lot of people however
the most important thing to realize is
that this is not a replacement for a
laptop or desktop rather it's competing
to be your secondary browsing machine
alongside a netbook or perhaps a tablet
however I've got to say I was a bit
surprised how this wasn't a big issue as
I thought it would be in the Chrome Web
Store there are a lot of web apps such
as brute shark and tweak day they do a
solid job of taking the places of
standalone applications on that front
I've got to say there are some definite
advantages to Chrome OS the first of
which is the quick boot up and loading
times because all you need to do is load
the Chrome browser the computer boots in
around 10 seconds even better is the
time to wake up from sleep mode which is
nearly instant close the lid and the
computer immediately goes to sleep open
it up and by the time you finish raising
the screen you're back in business when
you get into the browsing itself it's
good overall while browsing the web and
a tablet is certainly usable having a
trackpad or Mouse along with the
keyboard is still what the web is
designed for and the cr-48 handles it no
problem the biggest thing that holds it
back is a single core Intel Atom in 455
processor which can be into check a bit
when doing anything more than loading a
single web page however accompanied by 2
gigabytes of RAM and a 16 gigabyte solid
state drive it certainly gets the job
done
the biggest issue is with flash which
crashes fairly often and has a lot of
trouble with 480p video this isn't a big
deal however as flash should be updated
by the time Chrome OS is released
overall I've come away impressed with
the cr-48 in chroma OS in general while
I doubt the future of two of Wes's at
Google that are as similar as Chrome OS
and Android I certainly do see where
Chrome OS could do quite well as it's
based on Linux and has some outstanding
security it should be great for keeping
virus free and due to the quick boot up
and loading times it's great for pulling
out and spending 30 seconds or three
hours surfing the internet if they can
keep the price in the 2 to 4 hundred
dollar range and undercut
the majority of tablets I think the
Chrome OS could work out quite well for
a lot of people just not everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
