another very special edition of mystery
tech this time taking a look at some
very special items that Ken has gotten
us that cost under 200 dollars
protection case for in three wait a
minute wait a minute is this
legitimately just like an iPod okay I
have so many questions
why would someone want to buy something
like this when smartphones are getting
better and better audio stuff like the
LGB 30 has an amazing headphone app and
you know it does more than just listen
to music now let me let you in on a
little secret
because ken picks the products for these
videos I'm almost positive that he gets
stuff that he wants to take after the
video all of the instructions are in
Chinese this is not helpful so I guess
this must be reasonably popular if they
actually sell dedicated accessories for
it and I've gotta say this leather case
that's a lot nicer than the little
silicone one that it comes with never be
the same again
what no oh it's all in Chinese but how
do you even that's what you mean is it
no okay this thing pushes some serious
power Wow okay it sounds good with the
actual headphone jack but honestly it's
not a huge difference versus using aptX
or bluetooth alright Ken I think you
actually did a good job
dia Pro what is this Google glass all
right let's see what get here oh wow
those are for context this is what
normal human people glasses look like
and this this even has plastic lenses
for no reason oh is that a camera on
your face no wait what camera these are
my normal everyday glasses oh wait but
it so it folds it folds that's a look
right there that that's a look oh wait
wait wait hold on there's even more so
because this is just literally a giant
chunk of plastic that sits on the side
of your face they hopefully include a
tiny little cushion so that it doesn't
rub your skin off so take a picture I
need to double short press alright let's
try the amazing image quality I've no
idea if it's doing anything
just take a picture are you ready so I'm
gonna alright did a flash a bunch
oh it did okay we're recording so this
is what the quality looks like on the
beta pro or sorry FEA Pro apparently
it's supposed to give you a whole new
all of point of view recording devices
so yeah if you can if you tell me that
this device was two hundred dollars
seventy eight dollars okay I feel
slightly less terrible that you wasted
all of our money on on this it is we
wanted only Jitterbugs smart oh man all
new easy to use smartphone with an all
new larger screen that actually has a
kind of big phone bite I will say a
little cheap feeling it might be a
decent way of putting this because of a
SIM card in at least Oh interesting this
is an Alcatel OneTouch phone oh there we
go powered by Android
there we go it finally did something
welcome to your new jitterbug smart tap
here to get started all right oh do we
want to use advanced Android or easy to
use jitterbug we're clearly not good
enough for advanced Android give me some
easy to use jitterbug action there are
two ways to activate your phone call us
activate or you can activate online
thank you very much it just charged me
twice for that all right so we just been
a doll of the activation things we're
phone that's going to be activated two
hours I hope you're happy dad I hope
you're really excited about your new
phone that's going to charge me $80 plus
another $30 a month oh it's not
activated well they're not kidding you
actually do need to wait two hours to
activate it so because apparently it
takes 12 hours to charge my brand-new
phone and wait for it to activate the
full jitterbug touch experience and
might just have to wait for another
video all right next item digital home
karaoke whoa okay then uh I think it's
time for some karaoke so what do you
guys think about the $200 tech video let
us know in the comments below if you
hate everything you can blame Ken
because it's all his fault didn't a
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'm gonna go play some karaoke now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
