was episode three of tech I like now of
course if you guys are new to the show
this is my weekly series where I go over
all the different kinds of technology I
like and today we're going to be talking
about one of my personal favorites of
all time which is the Gameboy Advance SP
now I love Gameboy since I was about 5
or 6 years old and the Game Boy Advance
SP is by far my favorite now to kind of
give you guys a little history lesson
here when the Gameboy Advance SP first
came out it was one of the next-to-last
Gameboy that Nintendo made so and of
course does play Game Boy Advance games
just like the standard Game Boy Advance
but it came with a lot of major new
features the first difference was design
well the Game Boy advances in design
somewhat similar to the PSP and the
video today Nintendo took a very
different approach with the ESPE so they
gave it a folding clamshell design and
in fact they still use that today in the
DS as well as the 3ds the second major
change was that the SP had a
rechargeable battery now we take that
for granted today it's actually
something pretty nice to have on a Game
Boy pretty much all the previous
versions had double A's or of course the
Gameboy pocket didn't use triple-a
batteries but on the whole of it they
absolutely just ate up packs and packs
of batteries there's a great addition
that they did have rechargeable in the
SP the last major feature was a front
lit display and well again this is
something that most of us take for
granted today however this was something
that was really cool this is the first
Gameboy with exception of the Gameboy
light that actually had a display now
what this means is you actually play it
in the dark so of course before you had
a Game Boy you had to be near a lamp or
sunlight or something to be able to see
the screen but with the Game Boy Advance
SP turn the backlight and you were good
to go
beyond that it was all game boy bands
Senate had backwards compatibility with
the original Game Boy games as well as
Game Boy Color and since it was a Game
Boy Advance of course a quick blade Game
Boy Advance games now as far as the
graphics and gameplay went they were
actually fairly similar to what you
would find on the Super Nintendo so as
far as like sprite based and pixel based
and however you want to say it because
old-school games this thing absolutely
with awesome so there are a lot of
really nice games such as pokemon ruby
and sapphire golden sun f-zero and the
list goes on and on and on the Game Boy
Advance and my pain had probably one of
the best game libraries of any console
handheld or otherwise now I have to say
personally the Gameboy Advance SP is by
far my most play console of all time I
absolutely loved that thing
considering this 9 years old now it's
actually held up fairly well if you take
a look at mine
I got lots of scratches I've dropped it
more times I can count and I was in my
pocket for a couple years every single
day I went anywhere I kept in my pocket
but hey man if things still works it
still rains great in fact it's actually
on the original battery after not even
exaggerating probably thousands of hours
of gameplay nine years old yet the
battery still holds a 45 minute to an
hour charge pretty awesome anyway guys
it's going to be about it for this
week's episode of tech I like you guys
enjoy these videos always leave them a
thumbs up really appreciate that it
helps me out and of course if you're
