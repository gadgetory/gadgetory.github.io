here with a review of the BlackBerry z10
now BlackBerry's pretty much started
from scratch here not only is it's a
brand new phone but it's also a brand
new operating system so is it any good
to start with let's take a look at the
design the z10 is quite similar in size
to the iPhone 5 which while much smaller
than most Android phones is a nice size
for a lot of people the front looks a
bit awkward with large bezels on top and
bottom of the screen however it's a
good-looking phone and the backing is
made out of a very nice feeling soft
touch textured finish it's also
removable giving you access to the
battery along with the SIM card and
microSD card slots while it's mostly
made of plastic the z10 feels solid and
well built in the hand with the volume
rocker and mute button placed on the
right side and the lock button and
headphone jack up top the 4.2 inch
screen also looks fantastic with
incredibly sharp detail although it is
lacking a bit in brightness specs are
also decent with a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor and 2 gigabytes of
RAM along with 16 gigabytes of storage
it's definitely not going to be winning
any style awards but it ended up quite
liking the simple understated design of
the phone now you're getting a look at
what the video looks like from the front
facing camera on the z10 as well as what
the audio sounds like in video mode so
this also has another camera it's an 8
megapixel shooter around back
and while the pictures don't imply
anything all that's special they're a
decent and they do match up pretty well
with other high-end smartphones on the
market right now the video is also good
nothing spectacular overall it's got
good Christmas clarity motion all that
kind of fun stuff where things get
interesting is when you start the phone
up gone is the old BlackBerry OS
replaced by BlackBerry 10 which is a
massive change the interface takes some
getting used to but it's fairly well
laid out you have your most recent apps
listed on the main screen the rest of
your apps over on the other pages and
the BlackBerry hub behind it swipe from
the left these are your notifications
along with email and texts rolled into
one it's an interesting idea that allows
you to get to your important stuff
quickly however it can get cluttered if
you've got a lot of emails tweets etc
instead of having a home button bb10
relies on gestures to get around which
is actually a very natural way of doing
it swipe up from the bottom to close an
app and a swipe from the top will pull
up a quick settings menu or specific app
settings depending on where you are you
can also unlock the phone quickly by
swiping all the way up even when the
screen is off which is something I
really loved that's not to say it's
perfect
however as with any brand new OS there
are glitches and rough edges around the
phone rebooted randomly a couple times
and the browser locked up occasionally
needing a force close
most of the OS relies on a swipe from
the left gesture to go back however
sometimes you have to use a button which
just doesn't make sense to the user
nothing ever amounted to a deal-breaker
and I'm willing to bet most things will
be sorted soon but overall it does leave
an impression of being not quite fully
baked on the other hand sometimes bb10
absolutely nails it the browser is
easily among the best on any platform
with snappy loading times quick
scrolling and even flash built-in it's
definitely nice to see this although I
should warn you the viewing Flash
content trains the battery laughably
fast the keyboard is also excellent the
autocomplete is very smart and you can
even flick words up if it predicts
correctly for you most of the default
apps are solid including the
surprisingly great story maker which
will take your images and video and
create a custom video for you that's
actually very nicely done unfortunately
app support is probably the biggest
problem here there are quite a few apps
in blackberry world but most are just
plain bad there's also a lot missing
such as Skype Netflix Instagram and
Spotify just to name a few as it's a
brand new ecosystem I'm sure more apps
will be coming but right now the
selection is really limiting you can
side load some Android apps but they're
really not a good solution the battery
life is also seriously lacking with
moderate use it would just make it
through a normal day for me but if this
were my main phone I would always keep a
spare battery on me the BlackBerry z10
is a surprisingly good phone a lot of
what it does it does very well and while
the hardware isn't anything all that
special it does get the job done
unfortunately where it runs into issues
is with the BlackBerry 10 operating
system but simply there are a lot of
rough edges here and for the most part
the app support is just very very
disappointing while the z10 is
definitely an interesting phone
unfortunately there's just not a whole
lot here that will make me want to
recommend it over something running iOS
or Android I'm curious to know what do
you guys think is this something that
you would ever switch to or do you think
it's just not quite fully baked yet
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below if
you're interested more feel free to

hands on of the brand new Samsung Galaxy
s4 if you enjoyed definitely be sure to
