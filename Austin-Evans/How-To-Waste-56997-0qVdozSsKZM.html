episode of mystery tech now featuring
Robo Raptors bigger brother so as you
can see this episode of mystery tech is
a little different it is the holiday
extravaganza we decorated just for this
video the fireplace is a little
unnecessary but you know so unlike usual
mystery Tech where it can waste all the
money instead everyone in the office got
a single pick so let me guess who we've
gotten Robo Raptor 2.0 Matt did you pick
this item no ken did you pick this item
josh Josh pick this item Wes man Jimmy
picked it how much was it - we already
have one Robo actor then we got Robo
Raptors weird cousin now we have
megaraptor which is whoa okay it just
came alive you hear this
okay okay this one's like scary the
Gruber Raptors like a friendly dinosaur
he's died her haha and this was just
like blinking at you and like it looks
like it's a bus like do that yeah yeah
that's a good idea
xbase supersonic four band radio and
cassette player well this doesn't look
very good
wait wait hang on now that I've said
that who chose the four band radio and
cassette player yeah what Josh okay
thanks Josh literally heart I've no idea
who who has what Oh Oh add the logic
cassette oh yes all right all right Josh
josh has got me on this one that's a
good call
very good call so not only does this
have a cassette player with a four band
radio but we also have USB input and an
SD card slot 500 watts um I don't think
that's accurate you know what it smells
like 1985 mmm
I've been seeing Intel like this a long
time I remember my dad used to yell at
me because I would do this with my radio
he's like oh you're gonna break it you
have to bring it in like from the side
otherwise you're putting too much
pressure on it I feel old
okay main break back she sounds
surprisingly good you want to give
Jessie this 60 dollars 35 $35 no
actually I mean it's not like the
greatest tape player in the world is a
great radio you're considering at how it
looks retro it deals retro it doesn't
sound that bad 35 bucks
especially might be one of the better
deals on mystery tech wow I feel so
loved
wait actually Josh didn't waste money
okay so this is a mysterious box who got
shoes oh please
oh okay all right this this is not I'm
never gonna get this right I'm just
gonna guess you every time ah is this
Wes yes okay excellent second try I'll
be real I've never owned a pair of
Healy's in my life so I should probably
lace these up but it's fine right
whoa so you can walk normally all right
but if I want I can be like whoa well
wait a minute
how do you do it wait I need instruction
how to he'll find the balance point find
a rail counter or friends you can hold
on to in order to keep your balance hard
I do Healey
Matt Matt hope hope not it's been a long
fun ride that lot of great mystery tech
episodes but I see the Festivus pole and
I just have the strength to continue a
pole cabal speaker
I'm going to guess that the person who
picked this is Ken out of all the things
that you got this is the one I'm
assuming this was not all that expensive
$30 all right 30 all Bluetooth speaker
and get behind that
wait am i making a cake top right now
what hold on a second hold on second is
this the original pokedex you know I
used to have one of these wait is this
sure trace this is still sealed - I just
realized oh I can't open this 150
dollars on eBay right now it's okay
never listen to mom
all right
here we go the Pokedex this thing is 20
years old I'm old do you think these 20
old batteries are gonna work no way all
right
what what's 20 year-old batteries work
are you serious who did we look up start
you error are you have to type it in
exactly was this like a spelling tool as
well hey look it's a start you it's 2
foot 7 inches 76 pounds while it's
denser it nose tackle
water gun you're a Pokemon master in the
field you have to be a little patient
here's the test what happens when I try
to put in you
error error
this is factually incorrect professor
oak get on it and then what are you
doing do you know the first term 51
Pokemon how are you ever supposed to
keep up with the poker rap huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
