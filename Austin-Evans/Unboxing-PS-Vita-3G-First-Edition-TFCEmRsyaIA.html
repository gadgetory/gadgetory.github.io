and unboxing of the PlayStation Vita
first edition bundle so this is the
first model that is available in the
United States the standard 3G and Wi-Fi
miles will be available next week let's
just go ahead and take a look and see
what all we get in the box
so around on the side it goes over
pretty much everything we get which of
course is the 3G and Wi-Fi model of the
Vita a 4 gigabyte memory card a case
which will say if it's in the guide and
the game little deviants
alright so that's enough of the box so
let's go ahead and just cut a little
seal here and see what all we get inside
so opening the box at first we're going
to get the PS Vita itself I know this is
going to be the standard retail
packaging so from this part will just be
a normal 3 GM boxing but we'll go ahead
and set this off to the side because we
do get some extra little goodies so the
first thing is a little bit of
information so I'll kind of take a look
at this so change the way you play AT&amp;amp;T
now of course the Vita if you do buy in
the United States it does use AT&amp;amp;T 3G so
any little information
AHA free game when you activate an AT&amp;amp;T
data connect pass so apparently you get
a free PSN gain if you activate some
servers so I've useful a little bit of
information about some of the games are
coming out no one cares
playstation protection plan definitely
no one cares a are play cards I haven't
even heard about this so looks like
maybe some augmented reality games
definitely take a look at that there
also is a 4 gigabyte memory card here
and if you guys don't know these are
pretty much mandatory there's no
internal storage that games can use on
the Vita so if you want to save games or
all kinds of stuff the most part you are
going to need a PS Vita memory card so
you definitely want to keep in mind that
you want to pick one of these up four
gigabytes is probably gonna be a little
bit small so I'll have to see how many
games whatnot will fit on there but of
course we get something that will get it
started we also do have a copy of the
gain little deviants
so we'll see about this one I haven't
heard anything created as things on it
but a kind of course going to take a
look and see how it is also the box is
very small so I can miniature ps3 games
so we'll open that up here in just a
minute but go ahead and continue on with
us inside the box it looks like we have
a PS Vita carrying case so get out here
so you can see here it's kinda like a
fake leather there's a net to bed so
open it up see what
well looks like inside so looks like we
have some room for maybe some games or
accessories maybe cables and that kind
of thing if we actually know this looks
like where you put games or traps in
memory cards love to see and you put
your feet in there actually I didn't
have high hopes for this case look kind
of junk but actually it's reasonably
nice and get room for your Vita there
gain memory cards cables all that kind
of stuff and here we have the PS Vita
itself so like I said earlier if you
don't get the first edition bundle if
you just pick it up with the 3G model
this would be exactly what you get so
just flip it over here nothing really
all that interesting just little bit
information it does have a sim card
since it is 3G and its installed but uh
you know on that nothing all that
exciting so but pull the knife out here
and cut another use the right side
alright so after we butchered that up
we've got the tab open it's actually a
lot harder than I expected but enough of
that let's go ahead and take a look at
what week it inside the Vita so okay so
it's not gonna flap down there we go
alright welcome to the world of
PlayStation looks like we have some
accessories here so just go through
these really quickly so it looks like a
standard wall adapter so it looks like
exactly what I had on my playstation one
just Connie I guess over here we looks
like we have a USB cable so this is
going to be normal USB to a proprietary
PlayStation so if you lose one of these
probably have to pay a bunch of money to
Sony you get another one alright for
that and we also like we have the
battery your NAS it wouldn't be the
battery would it not sure what this is
this is okay so this is the USB wall
adapter so we I guess we plugged this
USB in here plug the other end and here
and we have a very convoluted charger so
I'll guess I'm glad that we can charge
it now alright so it looks like it's
gonna be enough for there we also do
have some leaflets and whatnot Quick
Start Guide we're totally amazed lots
actually here this is enormous alright
that's not very quick start guide but we
are professionals with this so you don't
need that we will figure it out on our
own and I think that's about it so is
anything else in the box
nope so go ahead just toss rest this
stuff aside it pretty good Messier and
we have the Vita it's so
so go ahead and just unwrap it from its
little bit of packaging here all right
so let's give you guys the quick little
tour around the Vita so over here we
have our d-pad it's all one single
rocker so you guys can see there so
maybe not quite the best I prefer you
know the kind of old PSP style but it's
alright and over here we have our dual
thumb sticks and if you guys can see
actually raised up quite a bit but just
on the first glance these are really
really nice feeling much better than the
old PSP stick you have a PlayStation
button down here you have a PS Vita
which there is no no buttons below it
pretty small still I can start but
whatever we have a front-facing camera
and we have our normal PlayStation
buttons actually I'm kind of surprised
even though the PS Vita is pretty large
all the buttons seem to be kind of small
either up top here and I have our
shoulder button so as you guys can see
here they're transparent just like the
old PSP in fact this does look very much
like the PSP except bigger but we flip
it over here you'll see here we have a
couple volume buttons I should want to
kind of point this out the whole console
is ringed with this I believe this is
probably Lumina more some kind of metal
on I'm awful picking that out but it's
definitely kind of cool almost looks
like the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 4s the
way they've done this but got a couple
of volume buttons actually not entirely
sure what's behind this slot cops take a
look at that beneath here we've got a
slot for the PS Vita memory card I bet
so go ahead toss that in there later and
we have a power button so nothing on
either side actually there looks to be
something perhaps s the SIM card whap to
do some investigating down here we do
have the headphone jack as well as the
connector to you know sync it and charge
it alright so before I go I just want to
do a quick little size comparison so
here it is next to a 3ds you guys should
be able to say and of course I will do a
more thorough comparison why not you
guys can see it's a pretty massive
console in fact I just take my iPhone
you know say the iPhone is only about
the size of the screen hunter Vita so a
very large console but of course it's
gonna be a nice big 5-inch screen should
be good for gaming anyway guys it's
going to be about it for my unboxing of
