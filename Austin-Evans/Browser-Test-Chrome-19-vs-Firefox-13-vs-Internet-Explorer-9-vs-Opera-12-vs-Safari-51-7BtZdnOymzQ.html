my latest browser test comparing chrome
19 Firefox 13 Internet Explorer 9 opera
12 and Safari 5.1 before we begin let me
go over how I test all five browsers
were updated to the latest non-beta
release tested on the same Windows 7 PC
with a core i7 and sixteen-year bytes of
RAM and each test was run multiple times
with the results averaged to make
everything as fair as possible to start
we have the v8 benchmark which measures
the JavaScript performance for sites
such as Gmail as always chrome dominates
here with Firefox coming in second in
Opera Safari and Internet Explorer all
considerably farther behind next up we
have peacekeeper which is one of my
favorite benchmarks as it covers most of
the important aspects of a browser
chrome wins again here with opera quite
close and the other browsers like behind
next we have the html5 test taking a
look at how well each browser supports
the latest web standards chrome opera
Firefox and Safari all do very well here
and handling most anything you'll come
across today with Internet Explorer
falling way behind Internet Explorer 10
is coming soon with much better html5
support however so this is likely the
last time I include this benchmark we
have a new test this time how long each
browser takes to open from a cold start
impressively Internet Explorer opens in
less than a second and a half an opera
and Firefox are nearly tied at two point
two seconds piece Chrome and Safari
lagged behind and is still reasonable
three point three seconds one thing to
keep in mind is that this test was run
on a computer with an SSD so if you're
still rockin an old-school hard drive
the differences will be a lot larger
lastly I test to see how much memory
each browser eats up with five tabs open
with popular sites such as Yahoo and
Hulu impressively Safari continues to
win here which is over 125 megabytes of
RAM used less than chrome does with a
single tab Firefox also does quite well
Opera puts in a respectable showing and
Internet Explorer and chrome fall quite
far behind since doing my first browser
test over three years ago chrome is one
most and always done well this time is
no different but it's not the only
stellar choice Firefox boots quickly is
fairly speedy and as well with memory
opera is the best all-around browser
with good performance everywhere and
chrome remains the overall
but it's held back a bit by its memory
usage and start times I would happily
use and recommend any of the three but
the numbers don't lie as long as you
have a modern computer Chrome is clearly
the fastest browser out there if you
