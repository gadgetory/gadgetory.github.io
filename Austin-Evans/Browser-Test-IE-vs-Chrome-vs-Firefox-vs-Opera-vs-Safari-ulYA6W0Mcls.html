today I'm going to be doing browser
tests of each of the five main browsers
Internet Explorer opera Firefox Safari
and Chrome I'll be checking the speed
and I'll also be looking at different
features as well as memory usage and
general usability of the browsers so
let's get this one started
okay so today I will be taking a deeper
look at each browser to give my opinion
on it I don't know that this is
certainly far from definitive as this is
less of a test on outright numbers more
of a test on each browser how it works
and how it doesn't first step we have
Internet Explorer eight IE 8 has a lot
of detractors about it but it also has
some good things going for it
introduced in IE 8 was a nice add-on
called accelerators sliders allow you to
do different things with highlighted
text so just instantly map it search it
translate it and more in general these
features are very robust and handy in my
opinion and often times I wish I had
them in other browsers ie8 also has a
good anti phishing filter called smart
screen which official tests show does a
good job at blocking you from
potentially harmful sites
lastly ie8 did decently well my memory
tests doing a bit better than Chrome
with three tabs open however there's a
lot wrong with IE 8 while it is much
faster than IE 7 it still trails far
behind the other four browsers here by a
decent margin and it's the only one that
actually feels slower which is a big
downside another is the security aspect
as it's the number one browser viruses
and malicious code is often written for
it more often than other browsers so
while it's not bad browser at all I ate
still has a ways to go
or can turn the tide of dissenters
headed to Firefox Chrome and Safari next
we have operatin Opera is one of the
rarer browsers but don't let that fool
you it's quite good for starters it has
some decent speed it did lag behind the
frontrunners Chrome and Safari but not
by a huge margin and is probably not
going to be something you notice unless
you happen to have both browsers up
Opera is an innovative browser with its
speed-dial page which works similarly to
the new tab pages in Chrome Safari
however it must be said the Opera did
come up with the idea first as well as
it's offered turbo which supposedly
speeds up loading on dial-up connections
by 3 or 4 times the interface has some
good things about it and it certainly
looks nothing like the other browsers
however that isn't necessarily a good
thing compared to the minimalist
interface of problem opera looks
somewhat bloated and complicated in
reality it's not much bigger but there
are quite a few buttons here and there
that can be confusing at first one of
the biggest complaints I have is this
just simply average opera really doesn't
stand out in any one great feature like
many of the others browsers do it's
definitely not a bad way to go however
so why not go test it out Firefox is the
only browser that really stands a chance
in the short term of dethroning Internet
Explorer as the most used browser it's
easy to see why the biggest pros of
Firefox is certainly its support for a
huge variety of add-ons they range from
everything from YouTube video
downloaders to JavaScript blockers to
themes to much much more add-ons are
easy to find at the official Mozilla
website and they are a snap to install
and use along with the great add-ons
Firefox uses the least ram out of all
five browsers so it seems a good
candidate for an older computer as well
on all Firefox is certainly a very good
overall bathroom you don't really have
any compromises however it is not
perfect even with the latest 3.5 release
still gets smoked by both Chrome and
Safari and the majority of speed tests
although it does beat opera 10 by a
small margin
however it's considerably faster than
3.0 and for most people it would be
perfectly fast Firefox also does look
very boring without add-ons and in
general the browser likes any kind of
real foyer that most of the others
possess don't let that put you off
though 5ox is over double the market
share of opera Chrome and Safari
combined and while it's not twice as
good there's certainly reason for it
Safari 4 is really a browser made by
Apple it's very polished and good
looking throughout whether it's the
menus history search or the new tab page
it looks fantastic throughout speaking
of that tab page it really is a great
piece of eye candy it looks the same as
the page on Chrome and opera showing
your most viewed site with an option to
delete sites or add whichever ones you
like
Landers each site in great looking cover
flow it also updates each pane to
reflect what the website looks like
right then and it makes the other most
viewed sites look positively boring and
it's fast very fast different tests give
the edge to both it and chrome but make
no mistake these are the fastest
browsers around and it will be easily
apparent as soon as you begin using it
perhaps because of the couple flow those
great looks could be one of safar as
biggest weaknesses memory usage in my
admittedly unscientific but still
reasonably accurate tests Safari used up
twice as much RAM compared to Chrome and
three times more than Firefox if you
have a modern computer with gigabytes of
RAM this won't be a problem
you will want to be careful however
running Safari 4 on an older computer
but when needing quite a bit of RAM the
nice-looking cover flow effects won't
work on some older computers so that's
something to consider altogether though
Safari is one of the best browsers
around assuming you have a decent
computer you will likely be very pleased
with it
chrome is very minimalist very fast
browser the speed is really what strikes
you first when using it javascript heavy
pages such as Gmail load almost
instantly and other pages open almost as
fast as your connection will go it has
some really nice features such as the
omni bar where you can not only enter
URLs but also search google or contrary
to what some may think any other search
engine as well without bothering with a
separate entry box it doesn't seem like
something useful but as soon as you
start using it you wonder why you ever
used a separate bar for search the tab
handling is also excellent the slick
design the last four tabs to be placed
up top think valuable room screen real
estate in addition it's very simple to
drag tabs out to make a new window and
it's just as easy to drag a tab back
into the main window on the other hand
if you really value privacy then Chrome
isn't the best choice but it felt allows
all cookies including advertisement
tracking cookies and allows Google to
save the searches you entered into the
omni bar even if you don't actually
search something however you can remedy
this by limiting the cookies
accepts and shutting off to Google
statistics compared to Firefox it's also
somewhat sparse when it comes to
features vanilla spider release adds
support for themes which is very welcome
but there is still a long ways to go
before it comes close to matching
Firefox that aside don't let that put
you off chrome is a very nice browser
and I recommend it the least checking it
out thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
