of d3 live so today I'm going to be
talking about the next generation
Nintendo console whether it's called the
Wii to the Wii HD or something entirely
different there's a lot to know about it
and there's a lot to expect so the first
thing is the release date which is
obviously a pretty big deal unlike the
Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 I really
strongly think that the Wii is not going
to have anywhere near that lifespan I
think that the we will probably be
replaced sometime next year would be
surprised maybe about a year or so from
now that the next week does come out I
mean assuming that there's a lot of easy
you know guesses that we can make to see
what we'll be expecting
so the first thing are the graphics now
it's not a really a big surprise that
the Wii really is not was not a big
upgrade from the GameCube in fact very
very similar graphics as far as the you
know the power and all that nice stuff
I expect this to change I just can't see
how Nintendo would sit still for two
generations in a row I just don't think
that would happen now whether the Wii is
going to make a huge jump and you know
given better graphics than the ps3 and
xbox360 I don't know but I do think it
will least has some high-definition
graphics it should look quite a bit
better than the current generation of
way I mean I just really just find it
hard to believe that Nintendo will just
go okay we're just gonna add you know a
little bit of motion or this with that I
think that they're really they're gonna
go ahead and upgrade the Wii with some
better graphics and you know just just
give it better online capabilities
they're gonna really go ahead and step
it up a little bit however I also don't
expect that they will make a bunch of
huge changes either the we had been
while it's not doing so great right now
Louise has sold so many consoles it's
been such a huge hit from Nintendo I
really don't think that they're just
gonna go okay that was nice but you know
let's just throw it away and start from
scratch I think it will retain a lot of
the same things I think that it's gonna
be a very simple console as far as you
know no complicated menus anything
that's gonna be you know pop your disc
in play the game get to whatever you're
doing just like the currently is but I
also think that it's going to be a very
small console so that was one of the big
things with the Wii is that they wanted
to make it as small as possible which
obviously makes sense especially for the
market that they were targeting someone
like the Xbox for the PlayStation 3
which
you know pretty large for game consoles
I think the ways gonna be remain very
fairly small I should add some new
things such as you know like HDMI out
obviously high-definition TVs some
different things like that but overall I
think that we should remain fairly
similar in size I have one thing that I
actually would improve here I'm really
hoping for is that the we will actually
gain blu-ray support so while a lot of
people are saying you know it's about
time that we get into digital downloads
all I have to say is look at the PSP Co
I don't think we're there yet I think
eventually we will go into you know now
use mean discs anymore and just using
digital downloads but for the current
future I don't see that happening
certainly not by next year now well I
think that we could probably get away
with using DVDs again just like the Xbox
does I think it would make a lot of
sense if they are able to get a blu-ray
blu-ray disc drive into it now that
certainly would raise the price however
I think it would be worth it especially
because you know it would give the Wii
another you know another nice feature
about it too the chips go ahead and play
your blu-ray discs and it would give a
lot more data and a lot more room for
all the different week two games so
that's about it the only other major
thing that I'm you know that think that
we will see is a redesigned controller
while the when the wheel remote first
came out that was you know is pretty
great volution area is very very good
Motion Plus helped some however now when
you look at you know the PlayStation
Move and the Xbox Kinect it's kind of
looking a little bit outdated so I think
that we mint in has going to go ahead
and upgrade some just like what the way
- I don't think they're going to be a
radical upgrade I don't think it'll go
move to like you know like using
something like Kinect
I think it will probably remain just
controller could be wrong but I do think
they will be public just a more accurate
Wii Remote maybe you know some kind of
cool gimmicks then you know there's
always coming up with new stuff but on
the whole of it I don't see a ton of
huge upgrades for the way - I think it
have high definition probably will be
you know a blu-ray player should have a
lot better graphics however on the whole
that I think that it will remain a very
similar console just with some
much-needed improvements okay so for the
second segment of t3 live I'll be taking
live questions as always every episode
of d3 light is filmed in front of block
TV
quite a few people in here today so glad
just take some questions will the be
will the we get bigger or smaller um I
think it will probably get a little bit
bigger you know after looking at you
know the we is that's a pretty good very
small console I think it will get a
little bit bigger but I don't think it
will get you know drastically big I
don't think I'll be anywhere near as
large you know kids through Xbox 360
what games do I think the we two will
have you know I think you'll be similar
I don't think this is the Nintendo is
just going to break away from doing you
know the kind of family games you know
like Mario and all that kind of stuff I
think they're gonna mostly stick with
that and whatever I would be surprised
with the increased graphical capability
that it will probably get some better
games such as you know since as you
might find the xbox and ps3 let me
spread it the way is that you know you
when big brand new game comes out you'll
see it for the Xbox the ps3
well it'll be surprised to be now set
for the Wii to as well I would
definitely be something I would be
looking forward to so I think it'll
probably remain mostly the same but
there will be some more mature games
more first-person shooters a lotta stuff
will they change the remote yeah I do
think they will change the remote now as
far as that I have no idea how they will
first I think I'll probably just be you
know more accurate they'll probably you
know they might even go for a normal
controller they might go for the same
kind where you just can plug in a
secondary controller in might be all
Wireless I don't know as far as that
goes you know all that motion control
stuff and how they you know come up with
all these innovative ideas way beyond me
I'm gonna do you think they will change
and they will improve hopefully for the
better will they bring Netflix etc yeah
I definitely think so I'm in fact it let
me surprise when we actually get
something similar to apps I know it
actually would have been some rumors
that the Xbox 360 will be getting some
sort of app support maybe like an app
store or some something like that
imma be surprised to see the same thing
on the week I mean people would really
like apps you know obviously it's on the
iPhone I'm gonna start a sprout in two
different ways and let me surprise the
week it's something kind of similar to
that but you know you can get download
netflix you can also go ahead and do
other things maybe you know what web
browsers except etc do I think that we
two will overcome the ps3 or the Xbox
360
that's kind of a hard question I think
it's really going to come down to how
well Nintendo was able to execute the
way to now if it comes across as just a
minor upgrade if the graphics er just
so-so you know it doesn't do a whole lot
more it doesn't move the needle very far
then no I don't think so however
Nintendo I just have to say this I mean
for the first few years they sold so
many weeds I'm sure a lot of you guys
remember you know if you ever tried to
buy a way you know they for the first
two years or so they were sold out
non-stop I think that Nintendo
absolutely does have the capability to
do that kind of thing again to just sell
just just ridiculous amounts of weeds
however it really good is just going to
come down to what all features they do
and how they execute the week too so
yeah that's kinda hard to say do I think
it will be a Wii for well I don't know
I'm actually kind of comeback to the
name as far as if they called the Wii -
I honestly don't know firstly I don't
actually think it will be called the Wii
- I we've kind of expected them to call
it something something else it could be
like the Wii HD or something but I'm I
would think that Nintendo will probably
come up with new a brand new name but
honestly like I said I really don't know
it's mostly just speculation and what
what everyone thinks it will be call
right now and help Spencer there will be
probably more expensive than it is
currently I'll definitely give me that
the reason one of the major reasons that
the Wii is quite a bit less expensive
than the Xbox and the ps3 is just
because it has very very old hardware I
mean a lot of people don't realize but
the week basically for all intents and
purposes has gank you and put the
components with you know we with Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth I mean so that's obviously
very cheap to make I think it will
definitely have to be increased probably
similar maybe even a little bit more
expensive than the Xbox and the
PlayStation 3 but yeah I do think it
will be considerably more expensive not
I don't think it'd be anything crazy
like you know when the Xbox and the ps3
first came out you know I think it's
like six and seven dollars I don't think
it'll be that expensive it'll probably
look for three maybe even four hundred
dollars for the starting price of course
do I think the way to is worth it you
know that's that's not a hard question
again I think that the Wii - definitely
has a lot of potential like I said
earlier as far as what the price would
be while the features
on all the specifics Collard to see but
I do you think there's like I said a lot
of potential I think it very well could
be a very great gaming console do I
think there will be more than one caller
I would hope so um you know the we took
forever when they first came out it's
called the revolution on that lotta
different colors I believe there are
five or six pretty cool colors of course
the we came out is only in white it was
only white for a long time then just now
I had a couple of new colors so
hopefully they do you know kind of spice
up the week to just a little bit hey
