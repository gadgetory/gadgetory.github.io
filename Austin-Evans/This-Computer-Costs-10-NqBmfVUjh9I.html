much but this is a full-fledged computer
that cost $10 so this is the Raspberry
Pi 0w now that wonderful name means that
not only is this one of these super
cheap Raspberry Pi computers which you
guys been telling in two videos on
forever but this is the 0w version which
means it is incredibly cheap but it
comes with both Wi-Fi and bluetooth as
you can imagine pretend hours you don't
exactly get a lot in the bag so this is
the Raspberry Pi 0 itself so right in
the middle is where we have our memory
and our CPU you have a couple of micro
USB ports one of which is for power n
you have in many HDMI L micro sd the
little series of tens along the top you
can use to expand with all kinds of
things the sky really is the limit with
this little guy to give you an idea of
just how tiny the Raspberry Pi 0 is this
is what it looks like next to an iPhone
7 plus as you can see this is a very
very tiny little computer there's
nothing stopping you from using the PI 0
W just like this however you may want to
consider picking up a case to help
protect it now since this is pretty much
brand-new there are a lot of cases there
specifically made for the W variant
however you can't pick up cases for the
original Raspberry Pi 0 which hopefully
should work with this guy one of the
cool parts about the Raspberry Pi
ecosystem is there are tons of different
accessories in cases to choose from so
this is a nice little acrylic case for a
Raspberry Pi and also comes with a heat
sink this is really really tiny this
isn't strictly necessary but it will
kind of help keep this guy cool so with
all of our pieces preps now it's time to
see if I can build a Raspberry Pi case
without reading the instruction should
be easy enough so after a little bit of
fiddling we have our case assembled now
the only problem is that the heatsink
doesn't quite line up since this isn't
made for the W but it's still making a
pretty solid connection it should help a
little bit something you're going to
need is a USB power adapter so the
Raspberry Pi runs on microUSB power so
as long as you have an adapter that can
supply at least 5 volts to the PI you
should be good this is a power supply
specifically meant for the Raspberry Pi
but really this should work with pretty
much any micro USB power adapter if you
have something laying around for your
old phone for example you should be able
to just plug it in and have it work
something else you might want is a micro
USB adapter so not only does it have
micro USB for power but also adds a full
beta port so for the most part you're
probably going to want to pick up one of
these
which is just a simple microUSB to
standard USB but if you want more ports
than that you can also pick up a little
hub that actually has four full-size USB
ports on it something else you might
want is a mini HDMI adapter now this
isn't strictly necessary if you already
have a mini HDMI cable or another
adapter but essentially this just plugs
right into the port on the Raspberry Pi
and will give you a full HDMI out for
something like a TV or a monitor last
but not least you're going to need a
microwave D card now you consider this
to be essentially your hard drive for
your Raspberry Pi so right now I have an
8 gig card basicially this is where
you're going to have your operating
system all your files live response
where we're installing raspbian now this
is a lightweight linux distribution
that's specifically meant for the
Raspberry Pi and I'll have a link to
nolle download it but also full set of
tutorial in the description but it's
pretty straightforward just load up on
an SD card and we should be good to go
so if you're using a higher-end
Raspberry Pi there actually is a version
of Windows that's available how much
pretty stripped-down honestly you're
probably going to get more use out of
some sort of Linux for this guy 2 l's
later so we are now up and running with
the PI 0w so this version of Linux is
fairly basic but we still do have a lot
of stuff that you would expect including
sums up like a web browser
come on little guy you got it go go go
go go go go that single core power is
also funny you see up here a little
neater for CPU usage as soon as you go
to even think about opening a page it
immediately goes to 100% so as you can
see we're putting on up and running so
we can scroll a little slowly but this
is a proper web browser now comes the
real challenge can I actually watch a
YouTube video on this guy
time for 144p boys oh whoa what has it
now it can almost do it it's so close I
wonder if there's a way of maybe getting
like some sort of plugin or something to
kind of help optimize this it's just
asking a lot of course you're not going
to buy a Raspberry Pi as a YouTube
machine so there are a fair few apps
pre-installed on the PI so now what do
you have a lot of options if you wanna
learn how to code but you also have some
basic office ads you have chrome have an
email client but what's interesting is
if there's actually a burst of minecraft
for this obviously minecraft is not the
most graphically demanding game in the
world but still for something that's
this tiny I actually will be really
did it work wait a minute wait a minute
Mellie did it work it works smoothly
like sure the graphics have been turned
down to pretty much as the basic levels
but it's Minecraft it's not like exactly
a super graphically demanding game not
only does it work with Minecraft my god
comes pre-installed on this guy
we're obviously asking a lot trying to
play Minecraft at 1080p on this guy but
the fact that minecraft works at all is
cool oh yo it works we're playing
Minecraft at 1080p right now Wow
all right you know what this is awesome
this is worth it almost just if you want
to use it as a Minecraft machine for ten
dollars this thing is really cool these
guys are kind of hard to find right now
but I will do my best to find a link to
check this guy out in the description
I'm curious what do you guys think about
this little tiny computer let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
