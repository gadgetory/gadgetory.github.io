here with what to expect with the
Samsung Galaxy s4 so only a couple
months away from the release date and
already we have quite a bit of
information on what could very well be
the best phone of the year so let's take
a look when I reviewed the HTC Droid DNA
recently I was a big fan of the screen
which was also a 5-inch 1080p display so
on the galaxy s4 this means a couple
things for starters it's going to be a
little bit bigger than the galaxy s3
also keeping much much smaller than note
2 which means that while you get a
little bit more screen real estate it's
not gonna be anywhere near as big so you
can still fit in your pocket and all
that kind of stuff but more important
than that is that 1080p resolution which
looks absolutely fantastic now sometimes
it's not going to be extremely
noticeable 720p screens are still very
good but overall that 1080p gives you a
lot more crispness and clarity and text
especially in pictures and video you get
a lot more pixels and a lot more
definition in that screen powering the
phone should be the new Samsung Exynos
octave processor and then recently I'd
Nexus at CES and the gist of it is is
that it is an 8 core CPU for a phone so
I'll just actually just let that sink in
for a second 8 cores which is more than
probably your laptop or desktop has in
your phone I'm ok with this this works a
little bit differently than a normal CPU
so instead of being an 8 core processor
imagine that it's a pair of quad-core
CPUs built into the same phone so on one
hand you have a quad-core CPU which is
still gonna be plenty fast but it's
gonna be a lot easier on your battery so
for example when you're doing normal
tasks like checking Twitter email
Facebook that kind of thing the phone
will be using this more power efficient
processor but when you need more heavy
lifting for example gaming or anything
that's gonna be some really intense kind
of you know where it needs some
graphical horsepower it will switch over
to the second part of the CPU which is
gonna be a lot more powerful but it's
also gonna take up a lot more battery so
basically this is kind of a best of both
worlds approach on one hand you have
this half of the CPU I guess you could
say it's gonna be more for like normal
kind of use where it's not gonna be
really heavy on your battery but when
you need that extra power it is there
for you
software wise I fully expect Android 4.2
jellybean to be on board now jelly bean
has been now for about three or four
months now and by the time that the
Galaxy s4 does launch I do expect the
Samsung will have enough time to add all
the awesome new features like the new
camera app the new lockscreen that kind
of thing now beyond that there are also
some more miscellaneous things that
we've heard including wireless charging
support right out of the box which
definitely should be cool
we should see some upgrades to the
camera as well so the galaxy s3 has an 8
megapixel sensor or what me surprise
to see this up to 10 to 12 on the Galaxy
s4 and more than likely it will stick
with 1080p video although who knows they
actually may be able to figure out a way
to get 4k on to the phone now that will
be awesome of course with that eight
core CPU you've got a lot of horsepower
but it's kind of a long shot we'll see
well I love how the galaxy s3 fits in
the hand and how lightweight it is it is
definitely made out of plastic pretty
much through and through and well it's
great to be able to remove the back
panel to swap your battery your SIM card
your SD card that kind of thing it would
be nice if they were able to make it
just a little bit more premium feeling
so either make the place a little bit
thicker maybe get a little bit of a
different finish who knows maybe we put
some metal in there as far as when you
can get your hands on the galaxy s4 it's
rumored that it will be announced
somewhere in late March or early April
for a mid to late April release so of
course that is going to vary depending
on where you live in the world for the
galaxy s3 it was announced and it took
about two or three months before it
actually hit the United States and
everywhere else in the world but
regardless we were actually not that far
from seeing the galaxy s4 in person so
that leads me to a question what do you
guys think about the galaxy s4 I used to
use the s3 and now use the note 2 so I'm
very very interested to see exactly what
Samsung has been able to cook up for the
Galaxy s4 so definite let me know in the
comments what do you guys think about
the galaxy s4 and what do you guys want
to see in the next version of the
Samsung flagship if you guys are
interested in more feel free to check
out the playlist of all kinds of great
phones that I've been reviewing recently
so I can close the HTC Droid DNA the
Galaxy Note 2 and all kinds of really
high-end awesome phones that you guys
may want to take a look at anyway if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway I will catch
you guys next time you'll also find the
5.5 inch Super AMOLED display which
sports a resolution of 1280 by 720 the
rest of the phone is fairly standard
with a micro USB port on bottom and
volume rockers and a sleep/wake button
on either side</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
