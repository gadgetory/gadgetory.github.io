with the video going over a gaming PC
for $3,000 now this is a request I got
the other day and I definitely could not
pass it up however before we begin I
want to be super clear on one thing this
is massive overkill for most people if
you just want to play battlefield 3 on a
single 1080p monitor through $1,000 game
PC will do just fine if you want to go
ahead and add some more bells and
whistles and get a little bit better
frame rates the $1,500 bill will also do
a really great job however if you want
the absolute best you won't play on two
maybe even three monitors and have
absolutely ridiculous frame rates and
everything you throw at it then this is
the build you want to go for to kick our
build off we're going to be using an
Intel Core i7 3930k CPU now this thing
is an absolute powerhouse not only does
it have six cores but it also has
hyper-threading which means that Windows
will see it as a 12 core CPU it's
clocked at three point two gigahertz
although since it's a K series part you
can definitely overclock it and 4.5
gigahertz is not something unreasonable
to get on the CPU and since it's based
on the X 79 platform you get all the
great benefits of that platform
including quad channel memory as well as
tons and tons of PCI bandwidth for all
kinds of awesome crossfire and SLI
setups for $590 is deathly expensive but
it's the heart of our buildings going to
an absolutely awesome job to get the
best performance out of our CPU we're
going to be going with the corsair hae
liquid cooler now in general I'm more of
a fan of air cooling most of my builds
however this one is definitely going to
be an exception the H ad is going to do
a great job of keeping our CPU cool
especially when overclocking of course
when you do overclock that does produce
more heat and of course all that heats
got to go somewhere
however the H 80 does a great job of
dissipating out of your case now it is
liquid cooled however you don't really
have to worry about having a reservoir
or anything like that it's also
contained nice and easy to set up for
about $90 this is a great addition to
our build for a motherboard we're going
to be going with the ax Sue's Pinay n--
x79 board now this has all the benefits
that you would expect within x79 board
including quad-channel memory support so
basically what this means is you can put
four different dims of memory inside and
they will all work in conjunction to
make your build even faster on top of
that it has all the kind of modern
things you would expect including SATA 3
as well as USB 3 it has plenty of power
to handle all kinds of overclocking on
your CPU it's a great deal for about 320
dollars for graphics cards we're going
to be going with a pair of gigabyte
Radeon HD 7970 overclocked edition
cards now this is going to give you some
absolutely awesome performance and this
is what's going to allow you to run
pretty much any game you'd want on to
and sometimes even three monitors so the
7970 is the latest in the greatest as
far as the AMD single GPU cards and when
you put a pair of them together in
crossfire expect some absolutely crazy
performance each card is equipped with
three gigabytes of gddr5 memory which is
going to be perfect for powering
multiple monitors on top of that these
are of course the overall condition of
these cards so that means that not only
do they have a factory overclock but you
can also push them much farther as they
each have three separate fans on the PCB
beyond that H have two mini display
ports a DVI port as well as HDMI if you
want to go and video on this one you can
instead pick up a pair of gtx 680 s
however these are pretty much impossible
to track down as is much less if you
want to actually pay anywhere near the
normal price otherwise if you just want
to go up to 79 70 s so pretty much in
stock everywhere it's going to run you
about $1000 for the pair for memory
we're going to be using 16 gigabytes of
Patriot gamer 2 Series Division 4
Edition so terrible name aside this
stuff is going to be exactly what we
need in our system so this consists of 4
dims of 4 gigabytes apiece so 4 8 12 16
please you can do the map there so the
main reason that we want to do this is
mostly to take advantage of the quad
channel memory on our x79 board which of
course will just kind of speed
everything up a little bit but on top of
that each of these DIMMs are clocked at
1866 megahertz which is going to be
perfect for our bill for about 95
dollars another great way to go for
storage we're going to be using a 128
gigabyte samsung 830 series drive so I
like these for a couple of reasons for
one they're fast so they may not be
quite as fast as some of the absolute
screeners on the market right now but in
return for that you get some really
really great reliability which is
definitely not something you can say
about all SSDs so in my opinion these
samsung drives really do kind of hit
that sweet spot now I did choose a 128
gigabyte drive for this
however there's absolutely nothing
stopping you from bumping this up to 256
or even buying a pair of these and
putting them in raid otherwise though it
will cost you about $130 to go along
with the SSD we're going to be using a 2
terabyte Western Digital caviar black
drive so this is pretty much the
standard on the market right now it's
fast it's reliable and pretty much the
way to go as far as the spinning
mechanical hard drive is concerned with
2 terabytes you can have plenty of room
for your music for your photos media for
games all that kind of stuff although if
you did want to you think that's a
little bit over
I definitely could step it back down to
a one terabyte otherwise this will run
you about $200 to power the bill we're
going to be using a corsair HX 1050
watts apply now of course we have a lot
of high-end hardware in this bill nighy
do we have a pair of 79 70s we also have
a highly overclockable cpu hard drives
all kinds of stuff which is going to
really just suck all kinds of power and
that's what you're really going to want
something like this which of course has
1050 watts of capacity which would be
plenty to go ahead and power this build
as well as extra hard drives and all
that kind of stuff now it is of course
modular so you can simply just plug
whichever cables you need in and make
sure that you get all your cable
management nice and neat for about two
hundred dollars it's a great way to go
for a case we're going to be using the
corsair obsidian 650d this is a very
popular case and for good reason it's an
all-around great performer
Helder before we go into it I definitely
do want to mention that if you want
customize anything as far as the
aesthetics of this build go the case is
definitely where you should start
so the 650d and my opinion looks great
it's very clean it's very understated
but it still says hey look this is an
awesome gaming computer you got out side
window and all that kind of stuff
or if you want something with more you
know over the top it nests are the top
and this is a work by the way just does
roll with me here if you want to go with
something that's a little bit more has
more Flair or whatever you want to say
you can definitely feel free to do that
just make sure that it has enough room
for all your parts which of course the
650d does and also it has enough airflow
which again the 650d does so anyway this
one is going to run you by $150 although
of course if you want to customize and
go with a different case by all means
feel free for an optical drive we're
going to be using a Samsung blu-ray
drive so this is actually kind of
optional so if you want to have comic
the ultimate set up you won't be able to
read blu-rays and this is a great way to
go however if you never really deal with
blu-rays you can definitely step down to
a standard DVD drive and save yourself
about $50 that's what actually I have in
my system I don't really ever use
blu-rays but of course if you want to go
ahead and have that blu-ray capability
it's definitely a great way to go on top
of that you can also just shove the DVD
or the blu-ray or the optical drive you
just get rid of that altogether and that
works fine but in general I do at least
recommend to pick up a DVD drive so that
you can you know install Windows and
kind of get your programs everything on
there nice and easy anyway if you want
to go with the blu-ray drive it's going
to run you about seventy-five dollars
last but not least we have a copy of
Windows 7 Professional so this is
actually kind of the optional part of
the build
if you are
have a version of windows or you want to
use windows 8 you can absolutely feel
free to skip this so I should really
don't like including windows in my
builds a lot of people usually have
windows already or they're going to use
Windows 8 or whatever however I thought
it would be kind of weird to do a three
thousand dollar bill without including
windows a thought maybe a couple
complaints might be had so if you guys
want to go ahead you're on I already
have a version of Windows you can feel
free to skip this or of course if you
want step down to Windows Home Premium
you'll save about $40 but otherwise this
will run you about one hundred and forty
dollars so what's the damage the grand
total is going to be two thousand nine
hundred and eighty nine dollars and ten
cents now I'll have links to all the
parts I mentioned in the description of
this video anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave
it a thumbs up I really appreciate that
