here lets you customize everything on
the phone wallpapers some new things
that we have here like skins so you can
actually change the look and feel of
your phone right now not just like the
wallpaper you can also go down here to
sound sets and you can change that you
can have different sound sets to change
everything all once your email your
messages notifications all different
sounds so you have different sounds for
everything in one theme if you will also
got a really cool feature called fast
food so if you turn the phone off it'll
turn off and it will power up within a
matter of seconds so if you're on a
plane you turn the phone off then you
and you get ready turn it back on just

the CES normally would not do this video
when it would already be booted from

pagers convince bloopers oh yeah so now
it's up and running so the fastboot
makes it where it goes right back to
where
what's battery life I oh it's a fourteen
hundred million batteries of course

but it also has the
this a Qualcomm 8655 chips so it's
really efficient and really really fast
