fair share of fortnight videos but today
we're taking a look at what might just
be the best cheap laptop for fortnight
the $450 Lenovo IdeaPad 330 s take a
look around and this is a surprisingly
solidly built laptop so lenovo did opted
to go with aluminum for the build and
while for the most part it's sturdy
there's going to be a little bit of
screen flex as well as a little bit in
the chassis
it does feel nicely sturdy there's also
a reasonable selection of ports so
Lenovo loaded it up with a USB C port
there's also going to be a USB 3.0 which
can charge your device even the laptops
closed in HDMI and if we flip the laptop
to the other side there's one more USB
3.0 port as well as an SD card reader
open the IdeaPad up and there's a full
size keyboard with a number oh it's also
backlit which is especially nice to see
at this kind of price point usually when
it comes to budget laptops there's a lot
of blue air I'm bored well there's going
to be a little bit on the Lenovo I've
got to say it's actually not going to be
that bad and of course it's going to be
easily removable unlike some other
laptops that you spend hours trying to
uninstall the xviii trial of McAfee on
you know what I'm talking about 18 with
a sometimes look ok I feel there's like
three different McAfee things they load
on laptops these days there's like
security there's like the internet
security and there's like some totally
something-something uni any of that just
to hit uninstall with the SSD it's nice
and fast ok 18 is an exaggeration I'm
sorry it's 3 open up the IdeaPad you're
actually going to find a few interesting
things at least if you're a nerd like me
first of all we have our processor now
this guy is rocking the Core i5 a 250
you as well as the new 8th gen Intel
chips that means that we're going to be
getting a full quad core design which is
really nice and I 450 dollar laptop
there's a lot of interesting stuff
inside here though first of all it seems
like there's almost definitely some
version of this maybe not this laptop at
least this board that does take
advantage of an MX 150 graphics card
that looks to be about the right size
for the GPU as well as where the gddr5
would go but there's some other
interesting stuff here including the
Intel AC Wi-Fi card it's going to be
dual band should be plenty powerful
plenty fast and on top of that we also
do have a few good bytes of RAM this
we're going to be 4 gigs here as well as
4 gigs on the back side running a dual
channel and that is going to be very
important to keep those you HD 620
graphics on the core i5 nice and fed
that enough specs for you cuz I've got
even more you should be wary of which
model of this laptop you pick up most
are going to be rocking a 1 terabyte
hard drive some do take advantage of the
m2 slot give you some octane support but
what we've got here is instead a 128
gigabyte two and a half inch SATA drive
I say that because of course that's
going to give you the best performance
out of the box this one performs pretty
reasonable but if you ever want to
upgrade this guy as opposed to just
throwing in an extra hard drive you're
pretty much limited to adding a second
SSD in that m2 slot last but certainly
at least on Austin's tour of the inside
of a laptop we have the 30 watt hour
battery now that looks like a pretty
large cell however 30 watt hours is not
a lot for a laptop part of that is
because this is actually partially
hollow it looks bigger than it really is
31 hours is going to be not to get
somewhere between 5 to 6 hours of use
but it's not going to be a lot and it is
a very easy way to tell that lenovo was
cutting some costs when they designed
this laptop put all this together and
what you've got is a pretty decent a
little laptop but of course the real
question is can it play fortnight's jump
into the game and what we're getting is
an incredibly playable 30 frames per
second because you know that's what all
games should run at right real talk
though for for $50 laptop is I've run
into a tree this is actually going to be
very very playable so I didn't have to
turn down some of the settings we are
running at 768 P I'll get into a little
bit of that later but we were running on
mostly low settings but the view
distance bumped up we've got motion blur
on and importantly we have not like
vsync on but also the 30 frames per
second cap so this can run a little bit
higher than 30 if you want Capet we're
running around like 40 but it gets a
little bit erratic and when we turn on
vsync it actually smooths out the action
quite a bit it's not going to be as
smooth as a full 60 FPS experience but
this is a $450 laptop and it's going to
be completely playable with Fortnight
with the core i5 inside it's actually
going to stay reasonably cool it doesn't
get above 65 degrees for the most part
on the actual processor and because we
aren't going to be completely taxing it
with that 30 FPS cap it means that the
system itself doesn't get all that warm
either sure it's going to be a little
bit warm where that fan is underneath
the screen but to the touch the laptop
is nice and cool Tovar you might be
asking yourself why exactly am i playing
at 1366 by 768 on the resolution and
that my friends is the biggest issue
with the Lenovo IdeaPad 3
is the screen not great this is a 15.6
inch 1366 by 768 screen and not only is
that not going to be all that impressive
to begin with but it's also a really
cheap TN panel so the viewing angles as
you can see here are well pretty
terrible the colors is not going to be
accurate whatsoever there's just a lot
of issues with this screen and that
doesn't even get into the idea this is a
pretty large display with almost no
screen real estate now to be fair when
it comes to fortnight the screen is
actually going to be totally fine in
fact it's almost a slight advantage
because we can't play as a full native
screen reza
for almost everything else though it's
just not going to be all that great so
there is a 1080p option that you can
upgrade this laptop with but the problem
there is that once you start upgrading
the screen the price of the laptop will
quickly get above $500 and for that kind
of money actually I do kind of prefer
the isuzu both better recently took a
look at it then there's the issue of
what this thing actually costs so I was
able to pick it up for 450 dollars and
that price it's solid unfortunately when
I took a look at it this morning a lot
of these were running for a little bit
closer to 530 and again at that price it
gets to be a little bit of a harder sell
if you're able to pick this up for $450
it's a pretty solid package with the
core i5 eight gigs of ram as well as
standard SSD but that screen is a big
big issue so if you're looking for an
entry-level for night experience by all
means pick it up other than that though
you may want to look at slightly higher
