unboxing of the iRobot Roomba 560 and
now of course you all of you should know
what a Roomba is basically it is a robot
vacuum cleaner which in my opinion is
probably one of the coolest things ever
mented so I'm gonna go ahead and giving
them boxing for you guys I of course
will use this for a week or so and now
going to give you guys my full review so
let's go ahead jump right on into this
okay so while I cut the tape on this and
get this out I would definitely like to
give a big thanks to the folks over at
iRobot who were very very nice and send
this out to me for free to review for a
couple of weeks here so let's go ahead
and see what all we get in the Box okay
so we push this back and we get this
nice little iRobot cut out and if we put
this aside we've got a little bit of
information which I will read F initely
read later we've got it looks like a
manual so definitely want to read up on
this Quick Start Guide registered today
Quick Start another Quick Start Guide so
all the kind of paperwork and
information that you'll need and so here
we've got the Roomba itself it's going
to pick it up it's fairly big but I will
course we'll get into that in just a
second
and it looks like this would be the
power cables so if we go ahead and lock
the out right here you just plug it into
the wall if I can find the right cable
and you just plug that right in and we
move in here and this looks like the dot
that the Roomba will go ahead and be
stationed on if we go ahead and take a
look here we have not one but two of
these which look like they are just
going to be you know the sensors for it
so kind of help it navigate around now
let's take a quick tour around the
Roomba so I don't pick this up for you
guys here as you can see here it's
actually a little bit bigger than I
thought it would be it's actually fairly
heavy but of course since it's gonna be
pushing itself around not a big deal
so of course we do have up here which it
looks like the sensor which we'll go
ahead and see the other sensors we do
have the day the hour and the minute we
have a schedule and a clock button as
well as a spot-clean as soon as this pot
plane we have docked and then we had the
clean button does
like in doubles of the power button and
we also do have a button here that also
might be a foul but now I have to take a
look I'm surrounded not a whole lot just
it's a nice looking robot you know but
it's not gonna be too big and bulky and
I should be a lot of fun go ahead and
get started up so anyway guys that's it
for the unboxing our force we'll go
ahead and get this fired up get it all
charged up I'm sure it's probably dead
already
go ahead and get it all fired up start
testing it and I will be back with my
full review here in about a week or so</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
