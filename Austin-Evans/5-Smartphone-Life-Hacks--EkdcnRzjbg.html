smartphone life hacks basically every
phone out there comes with a charger but
they're not all created equal a generic
one amp power brick can take hours and
hours to recharge your phone which can
feel like forever we've only got a few
minutes to plug it in most new Android
phones though support quick charging
which can cut this time down massively
it comes in a few different flavors but
the most common is a 2.1 amp alpha this
also goes for the iPhone newer models
will charge way faster when you swap the
stock adapter with an iPad charger
speaking of the battery there's a lot
you can do to keep from hitting the
outlet before the end of the day most
phones have a low-power mode which can
be helpful when you get low on battery
but something you should absolutely do
is dive into settings and check what's
draining your phone if you see an app
killing your charge you can try
disabling the location or background app
refresh and see how that helps while
we're in settings we can also speed up
your phone while animations make things
look nice they can actually slow your
phone down
it might seem minor to wait an extra
second but considering just how many
times you open apps and unlock your
phone every day it actually adds up in
Android you can change this by rapidly
tapping the build number and about phone
to unlock developer settings and then
change the animation speed to something
a little faster on iOS jump into the
accessibility menu and turn on the
reduced motion option there are also a
lot of ways of stepping up your photo
game basic things like enabling the
three by three grid help a ton for
properly composing your shots and lots
of smart phones have pro modes that
allow you to fully tweak the settings on
your camera to get the shot just right
one little tip on the iPhone is to tap
and hold where you want to focus this
will lock both focus and exposure you
can change it by dragging up and down
giving you a way of locking down the
shot the best way to lock things down
though is with a physical tripod you can
buy an adapter to mount your phone and
with clip-on lenses you can totally
change the look of your photos and
videos to transform your smartphone into
a serious tool screenshots have been
around forever but sometimes you just
need to record video from your screen
most phones have an HDMI adapter you can
use to get video out to a TV which you
can record with something like the
awesome Elgato Game Capture HD but
there's a simpler way of doing it
phones like the galaxy s7 have a
built-in recorder the works surprisingly
well for gameplay but an option like AZ
screen recorder works well on basically
any Android device if you have a Mac the
iPhone also has a neat way of doing this
plug it in via lightning and inside
QuickTime you should see the iPhone
listed as a camera
new movie recording this should mirror
your screen on the Mac and lets you
easily record whatever you like so what
are some life hacks you guys have found
useful let me know in the comments below
