the video showing you hidden features in
Firefox so of course Firefox has been
around for a while
and the bay had lots of little you know
Easter eggs and whatnot so let's go
ahead just take a look at some of them
so the first thing that you need to do
is you need to go to your address bar
and type in about colon about and indeed
that link will change depending on which
page I show but this one is just a list
of all the different pages that you have
for Firefox so there are a bunch of them
so I will show you guys some of my
favorites but there are also some kind
of cool Easter eggs so for example is
about Mozilla there's about robots just
kind of tell you a little bit about
robots which is pretty neat but you guys
can definitely take a look at this I was
just going to show you guys some of the
more interesting ones so the first one
is going to be about config now if you
guys have been using Firefox for any
length of time
more than likely you've pulled this up
this is able to customize Firefox to a
ridiculous level and I want to be very
clear though this is not something that
you can just go in here and just you
know start editing and you know messing
around with it you can definitely really
crash Firefox however if you know what
you're doing if you know you looked up a
specific tweak what not generally you're
going to use it in about config so you
guys can see here there are just tons
and tons of different things but let's
say for example I need to come over here
I could edit it you know maybe you can
change the times that something takes to
load there's a bunch of bunch of bunch
of different things that you can do so
about config is probably one of the best
ways to customize the browser to how you
like and there's a great things about
crashes now what this is is obviously I
don't have any crash reports Firefox's
you know it doesn't crash all that often
but if you've had any crash reports or
you know have any major issues it will
list all the different crash reports you
can't get a little information on it
it's very helpful if you you know you're
having a problem you can kind of help
diagnose it and the other thing is going
to be permissions manager so what this
allows you to do is take a look at your
permissions for individual websites or
indeed all sites so it says if you want
to allow passwords to be stored so you
know if you want your login information
you can share your location cookies pop
up windows and offline storage so let's
say for example I want to always allow
pop-up windows on a particular site I
can do that here or indeed you can just
do it globally with all sites so another
really little helpful thing if you use
Firefox now another thing is about
memory now this is similar to what
you'll be able to find
Oh Chrome it's not quite as pretty but
what you can see here is what's taking
up all your RAM so if you're having some
issues with Firefox it's you know being
slow laggy what-have-you you can take a
look and see what's going on here so
let's just take for example I found some
one of these things that showed you know
it had like 4 gigabytes of RAM used it's
just something ridiculous we can kind of
get a good idea of what's going on and
perhaps if you can you know understand
like some of these are kind of little
hard but you know see we can see staged
jailbreak com2 open up in one of the
tabs you want to see that we can close
it and see if that helps anything so
just a little good idea of seeing how
much RAM Firefox is using and last but
not least we have about plugins now this
is basically very simple as the name
implies it allows you to take a look at
any plugins that are installed and used
by Firefox so we can see you know on
live game client flash Silverlight Java
QuickTime and what this allows you to do
is take a look at the version what kind
of files are here now there's not a
whole lot you can do with it it's just
kind of nice to be able to see what
plugins are enabled for example if you
ever see something that you don't want
so sometimes it's kind of rare but it's
happened to me before if you have some
kind of program that actually installed
a plug-in that you don't want and it's
happened a couple of times you can
actually look here and see if there's
anything that you don't like or don't
want or whatever and see what exactly
what is running in Firefox
anyway that's gonna be about it if you
guys want to see a video going over
hidden features in Google Chrome feel
free to hit the annotation on screen
right now but otherwise if you enjoyed
definitely be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and if you want to be notified
