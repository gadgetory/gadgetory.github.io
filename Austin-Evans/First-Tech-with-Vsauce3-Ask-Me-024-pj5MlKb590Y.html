filling with the potato I want you at
home to close your eyes right now and
just imagine who this is hi guys I'm Ann
Woolf filming with the c100 cuz it does
1080p but has a great polite sensor if
we're using right now it is dark in this
boardroom and we are using the high ISO
performance and the incredible image
quality of the wonderful camera which I
will not name
I'm not upgrading to 4k just yet just
because there's no camera that really
can got completely replace the camera
I'm using right now besides the c300
Mark 2 which is like 15,000 17,000 just
preface by saying that this isn't the
usual lens that I film on that's the
thing here yo guys I don't just don't be
offended by the lens which actually is
the lens I'm using right now so it's
even worse thanks thanks Dean oh yeah
this is what I usually film on 6k 6 game
soon to be 8k if you want ups if anyone
does if you want if you want to sell a
kidney you can have 8 k I would say I
like it a lot I like shooting at higher
resolutions because I finished ok so I
shoot everything at 6 K I finish from 4k
and allows me to reframe which is
wonderfully that's awesome yeah cuz a
lot of times you know we got a running
gun we don't have time to like okay
we're gonna do a close-up now we're
gonna do wide if you just watch it
yeah medium shot that you can punch into
a close-up punch out do your why and
also just when you do shoot with this
and you do like scale it down to 4k of
1080 and it's a lot sharper what was the
first computer you ever owned my first
computer and I think I've told this
story before it was in a machines t 1440
so I'll never forget what happened was
up and tell us about 10 or so we didn't
have a computer in the house at all and
I had one on one for a while and so my
my parents took me I found like a
surprise trip on my birthday and we were
going
