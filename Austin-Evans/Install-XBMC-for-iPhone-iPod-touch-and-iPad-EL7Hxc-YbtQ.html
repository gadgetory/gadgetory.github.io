tutorial show you how to install and run
XBMC on your iPad iPhone 4 or ipod touch
4th generation now before we gotta do
wanna note that only those three devices
are supported at the current time now I
do know that there are possible ways to
get on earlier devices however I'm not
going to be covered in anything like
that just go ahead and show you how to
install a little bit about how it works
the first step is to open cydia on your
jailbroken device once you've done this
open up manage the manage tab and then
sources now we're going to need to add a
custom source here that's how ever it's
not too difficult well the source you're
going to add now of course I have it in
the description of this video as well is
mirrors XBMC dot-org back / apt back /
iOS and again I will have that in the
description of this video the way to add
is hit edit click add and then all you
will do is just punch in the source name
just like I showed you so very simple
let it go ahead and sink through and
you'll be good to go and then open it up
once it is all added up so once you have
it added you will find these two
applications in the source all you need
to do is press on the XBMC dash iOS
isn't up here you will just go ahead and
install it now the servers are kind of
getting crashed right or not crash put
overloaded right now so if it takes a
little while and just be patient you
don't give your iPod or whatever you
device you have give it a little bit of
time and it's done you'll be ready to go
now let me give you a very brief tour of
what XBMC looks like on an iPhone or an
iPod touch do keep in mind it should
look a little bit better on the bigger
display of the ipad so the interface is
fairly simple although there are some
definite cons with it did I get into
that just a moment so the way to
navigate through this is just tap and
then just kind of hold down so if we
want to look at whether pictures video
programs whatever we want so let's go
ahead and take a look at programs so
we'll just tap on that as you can see
the XBMC interface is very nice looking
as you would expect although a lot of
the well it's pretty much a basic poor
there's not a whole lot of changes have
been made for iOS so while this is good
for perhaps the Apple TV and as I said
the iPad it doesn't translate
as well to the very small display of the
iphone the ipod touch Rajesh go ahead
show you a great example that so let's
go ahead and just download or rather
let's just look at one of these so we
can just scroll through that one that
one good arm will go to this one um so
as you can see it's very very small it's
kind of hard to I can read it okay but
as far as trying to do I mean if you
guys can see that little tiny eggs right
there it is almost impossible mean yeah
press it there we go finally worked well
that's the first time I mean it's it's
really difficult to go ahead and
navigate around this it's not a deal
breaker by any means this is certainly
something that I recommend that you guys
check out at least just solely for the
fact that it you can go ahead and
download and use a lot of different
videos that you might not be able to do
earlier and indeed it also works with
for full hardware acceleration stools
back out here and it's gonna be a little
bit laggy but not a big deal so anyway
guys that's it for XBMC for the iphone
ipod touch and ipad while it's not
perfect and it definitely could use some
optimizations for these platforms it
absolutely is worth let's go ahead and
download if you have a device is
jailbroken I know the only other thing i
do want to mention is that you need to
be on 4.0 or later this should be
problem if you have an iPhone or an iPod
touch however if you have an iPad it
hasn't been updated to the latest
firmware that might be a little bit of
an issue for you so just do keep that in
mind before you try to install this
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
