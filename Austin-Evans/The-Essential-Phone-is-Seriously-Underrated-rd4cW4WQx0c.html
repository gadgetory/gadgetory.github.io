one of the most hyped phones and years
was announced the essential phone
promised top-notch build quality a clean
build of Android and some seriously
great cameras however things weren't all
that they were cracked up to be when we
went on sale there were some serious
issues the camera was a borderline
deal-breaker it was lacking both water
resistance as well as a headphone jack
and with a 700 our price tag the foam
really just didn't get off the ground
nothing shows this off better than these
sales figures which were reportedly less
than ninety thousand over the first year
of the essential phone's life that my
friends that's not good however it's
2018 and the essential phone has
actually gotten a lot better the first
and biggest change is the price you can
pick up the essential phone on Amazon
right now all for only $450 and then
include some other colors that weren't
available at launch including this pure
white no sure when you look at this as a
$700 phone there are some issues but at
less than $500 and I think even comes
close to touching the build quality here
I'll even go farther than that this is
one of the nicest builds on any phone
period so with that ceramic back
especially when you put it side-by-side
with a glass back to phone like the
iPhone 10 it really makes it look dull
in comparison you do wireless charging
but in return you're getting not only
that look and feel but you're also going
to be getting the extra durability of
having that ceramic it's not going to be
for everyone but personally I absolutely
love the way this looks and feels come
around to the side of the phone and
you'll see that it is made out of
titanium now that's also something you
don't really exactly see on phones these
days and it gives it a nice feel in the
hand now what's interesting is is that
while a lot of flagships these days are
going for a very rounded sort of curved
design this is much more chunky which I
kind of like you're making the best use
of space inside the phone that same
solid feel comes around to the buttons
which have a nice tactile click as well
as the machining on things like the USB
C port as well as the speaker grille no
it does not have stereo speakers and no
it doesn't have the headphone jack but
there's a lot to really like about the
hardware of this phone that's not even
getting into the screen come around
front and you'll find that 5.7 inch
display with some of the thinnest bezels
that we've seen yet now keep in mind if
this phone has been out for a while even
phones like the iPhone 10 as well as the
Galaxy S 9 can't quite match that super
thin bezel but they also can't match the
naj yes my friends the essential phone
was actually first when it comes to the
knotch and personally I actually like
the way they do it here better than on
the iPhone 10 it's just barely big
enough to fit that front-facing camera
and everything else has been cramped
into the tiny little bar above it
including the status LED as well as your
earpiece to be fair the IPS panel on the
essential phone can't quite match up to
the awesome AMOLED displays on both the
galaxy s 9 as well as the s 8 and the
iPhone 10 however I'm really nitpicking
at this point this is a very very good
display especially when you consider the
price sure there are some minor things I
can nitpick so the plastic that
surrounds the front glass on my unit is
slightly imperfect there are a couple
places where it's not totally smooth and
on the actual pixels themselves that
come around not only the knotch but as
well as the rounded edges on the top of
the display you can actually see that
there are individual pixels that you can
barely make out this is really
nitpicking when you consider that this
is a 4 in 50 dollar phone there's
nothing to complain about
unless of course you want a headphone
jack in which case sorry inside you're
getting pretty standard flagship specs a
snapdragon 835 processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM as well as 128 gigs of storage which
is definitely helpful considering that
there's no micro SD card slot as you'd
expect everything is super snappy now a
lot of this is thanks to essential
constantly updating the phone so I was
pretty good when it first came out
they've consistently added updates to be
able to smooth out things like the touch
responsiveness as well as the scrolling
speed but as you would expect it's just
as fast as pretty much any other Android
flagship at this point now as far as the
software side of things go it's good but
not perfect the biggest issue is that it
is still running Android 7.1 newgate now
yes essential has said they're working
on an Oreo update and hopefully that
comes out soon as of right now is a very
clean build of a slightly older version
of Android the good thing though is that
when I say a clean build of Android I
mean it there is exactly zero bloatware
of any kind now there are some minor
tweaks the essential is done mostly to
actually support the knotch
which is actually one of the more
impressive parts it actually kind of
works pretty well here supported apps
like Google Maps will flow around the
front-facing camera essentially giving
you that full screen experience and even
other apps that aren't fully supported
by the knotch are still going to give
you access to your notifications as well
as the system info without really
getting in the way kind of like using a
normal phone like that it's not an oled
display so while the blacks are good it
isn't quite
blendin over there she does a pretty
good job and it's not that far off from
something like the iPhone 10 as far as
using an app that is not supported now
one thing that's actually been very
impressive the essential is done is
update the camera this thing is so much
better than it used to be with a pair of
12 megapixel cameras around back the
hardware seems to be there but it
launched the essential camera with
straight garbage towel now don't get me
wrong it's not exactly going to rival
the pixel but it has gotten so much
better than before now pretty much all
that is thanks to essential constantly
releasing updates to improve the camera
in fact literally the day we're shooting
this it got another update which not
only improved a little bit of the
performance but also added some
additional options in the camera app
provided that you have some decent light
the photos really aren't too bad
now the autofocus is still a little bit
on the slow side and one of the things I
did notice is that while the image might
not look that great on the preview once
you actually take a shot in its process
it typically does look a lot better
which is nice except that will be better
to know exactly what your shots going to
look like before you hit the shutter
button the portrait mode is also pretty
decent now I will say that the blur can
be a little bit strong sometimes and
like all these systems it's not going to
be perfectly cutting you out from the
background but it's not that far behind
something like the galaxy s 9 or the
iPhone 10 and again it is going to be
much much less expensive and that's
really where I come down on the
essential phone when it first launched
its $700 there are some legitimately
really big problems the lack of
waterproofing the battery life which is
only okay in the camera or big problems
but now that a lot of these things have
been addressed and it's got a huge price
cut I think a lot of people would be
really happy with the essential phone so
if you want to join 90,000 other people
who have a phone that no one else has
ever heard of the essential phone really
is worth a look some curious what do you
guys think about the phone especially in
2018 he's gotten a lot better but let me
know what you think in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
