something a little different
I've just been going through some my
older things and I found some pretty
cool technology some of my favorite
things I used to just absolutely love so
you know what I figured might as well
share them with you so she'd write into
this first thing except then everybody
should have and it is an old game boy
this is gameboy color or a bleep line
brain was the color sure man this was
this is my very first portable handheld
I never ended up getting a Game Boy Game
Boy pocket but when this came on I just
knew I had to have it
I remember I remember trying to eat up
the money for I think has a lot of
hundred dollars and I have a lot of
money for me back then I was I was
trying to figure out how to
Hagee the money where I could but yeah
this thing actually got bet it's doors
oh I don't know betters yeah I actually
once I want you to see if I can think I
might have some betters are here haha
Xbox gotta love it yes I'm teaching it
by a a rechargable Peck the litter
battery looks quite and just pop it in
right here
I know this thing's the works usually
not too long ago I my luck I break it
back here Pokemon game I love that okay
let's try this out there we go
yes that's flexing I mean I I pee I just
I supply this game so much oh man brings
back memories oh man well this one of my
favorite things this along with my
original PlayStation sadly I do not have
right now but yeah Game Boy Color
awesome and well I found a huge stack of
games for it and there's a lot more No
so yeah you can see all kinds of them
mostly what we have here a uu a bunch of
Pokemon fungible uh-huh Tarak um Harry
Potter game I don't have lots more than
this but that's just all I had right
here let's go on to another Game Boy
because I used to love these and gain or
advanced something most people should
have had if you're a bit younger you
might not have had one of these um I
need you see there most of my stuff
still works but he's stupid battery door
broke off along this broke off like
within we keep eyeing this but this was
another one you can see it's got that
well let's see here if I can show you
you can see it's see-through so you can
see all the guts in Game Boy Advance I
remember this was this was awesome um
this is basically well just awesome and
go over here I have a cool accessory for
it called the e-reader if you never
heard of an e-reader what this was is
just plug this in you see that this goes
into the Game Boy link cable just push
that in what you did was you ran special
cards through this and then it would
give you special things on the on the
Gameboy such as like what just all kinds
of stuff it was very cool what that was
was did you could buy trading cards I
think it was different trading cards it
came with cards you scanned them and you
get mini games I remember there's Donkey
Kong stuff like that that was pretty
cool I'm
I remember this was like this used to be
all kinds of money I found so like ten
dollars after they stopped making them
so I knew I had to buy it definitely
very cool okay and lastly but definitely
definitely not least we have a Game Boy
Advance SP Lux it used to be big into
these so see here we got some games over
there and Game Boy itself this was well
this is one of my absolute favorites I
actually bought a DES light what a few
years ago and I got rid of it it was
this so much better as you can see it's
actually camera doesn't pick a bit maybe
you see a little bit right there and
there it's pretty scratched up got the
silver but I still it is seriously
awesome much game if I have any actually
you you a long time ago yeah this thing
actually still works perfectly as he was
it five six years old or so she's got
the only problem is the battery is
doesn't take whole lot charge and I've
left about an hour show see here it's
kind of big so chucked it in the whole
thing see here it's actually had the
backlit this is basically like push the
Gameboy but he had the folding design
which about compare it to this although
they plug the same games and say that
about the same thickness but much
smaller and when you opened it up very
cool and main thing was that this was
just it had the backlit screen I can
show you that in a second and
rechargeable battery boy I used to hate
like with this this thing burnt up oh
man I went through few bad four or five
well I went through at least four four
double A batteries a week he was crazy
you know that's quite an despite us up
its doors perfectly and you can see the
backlit screen which that was kind of
sometimes hard to see but with that man
you go just bet anywhere this thing I
use this for years I still occasionally
I hadn't used it in about a years
but it's still but seriously this one of
my absolute favorites so listen I just
put this back in here let's get away
from game boys and good something most
people should have and it is Cu quiet
this is not really that special or
anything but I had just found this and
um I first got this I never really used
to listen to music and I got my first CD
I was like wow this is so cool and both
I was just yeah it was funny but I don't
just I just I just found this I thought
it was really cool but yeah um this one
actually was not mine
this was my dad's but I still used to
use it all time it is well these old
Nokia cell phone I'm sure most people
had this is like one of them I mean this
is this was the cell phone when cell
phones really got big and you see here
is the massive battery take it off I
mean doesn't what might not look that
big but it's it's I mean look this is my
hand I mean this weighs almost as much
in my touch um this one you know I don't
know how old this is sorry 8 9 years old
I couldn't tell you but yeah this game
is this was so much fun I always used to
play snake on it which controls with 2 4
6 and 8 man we always used to have
competitions who could get the highest
score and snake with this I absolutely
love this thing
it was crazy expensive probably like
what $200 and the the minutes for like
pays you go is like 75 cents minute it
was crazy
but this was really cool anything here
if you push this down you can take off
the faceplate mm-hmm I know you can do
that and just don't break it yeah
awesome and last but certainly not least
now this is actually not an old dad you
by any means but I don't know it's it's
I don't know it's iPod Nano
you mean everybody have one of these you
sit here
well not everybody had one of these but
this is my very first iPod and I used to
use that CD player I've got a boombox
and I was like mansu's you're awesome
and then all of a sudden I get this like
wow look how small it's been this is the
2gig model I don't actually you know
this one I actually still use this one
quick oops
yeah that is on but yeah I actually
still use this one because I don't like
to take my high touch everywhere so you
know that nice click wheel and of course
the screen is too bright for the camera
to pick up but uh yeah this actually is
the 2gig but man I actually still carry
this around quite often I'm so paranoid
about my eye touching stuff I don't take
stuff with me this is you know I can
take this around for wireless and music
you see it's got that good stuff but
yeah so this was this one's not all this
was what two thousand four or five
thousand five I think got this one and
but you know pretty cool I always used
hate it never worked
the I would just what I had a power
switch it's got the can't really like
focus but you got the whole twitch but
it's nothing like the whole switch and I
and I touch an iPhone just because that
actually should stop but that's kind of
our lows now whatever so let's just bend
it I've got more stuff but I thought I'd
be here for an hour going through all
these old stuff but yeah I just wanted
to share that with you guys beside us
here because it's awesome so yeah that's
just about it well what do you guys
think what what's your kind of favorite
old technology if your hat ever had any
