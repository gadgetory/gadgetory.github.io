episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about the next generation
ipad the ipad to the ipad 2 g whatever
you on call is going to be the next ipad
and apples lineup so there is a lot of
speculation going on about this right
now and there are a lot from why is
Apple could go and now of course it's
several months out so we don't have
anything concrete however we didn't know
quite a bit about it i'll go ahead and
give you guys some of my opinions and
some of what I think we should expect
here so the first and probably the most
obvious thing is going to be cameras so
I absolutely have no doubt whatsoever
that there will be a front facing camera
for use with facetime on the iPad to you
know this just makes sense obviously
there is a FaceTime camera in the iphone
4 as well as a FaceTime camera in the
ipod touch so i see no reason i would be
very very shocked if through is not a
front-facing camera in the ipad second
generation another very well also could
be a rear-facing camera so if you take a
look at a lot of the recent tablets that
are coming out a lot of them do have a
front and a rear facing camera
personally with something the size of
the ipad i think you'd be a little
awkward to wet and hold it in try to
film however cameras are really getting
so cheap these days and are being so
ubiquitous that you know they're just on
all kinds of your electronic devices let
me surprised we do see rear-facing
camera however I definitely do expect a
front-facing camera at least now also i
think that the iPads design will be
tweaked a little bit now obviously the
ipad for size is very thin and it's a
very good looking device however as
Apple always tends to do they'll
probably get a little tweaked here I'm
sure it will not get a little bit
thinner the bezel might shrink the
screen might change little size i would
expect a lot of you know smaller
improvements because the way Apple likes
to do is you know the first generation
and then the second generation all the
times it'll just instead of you know
like totally overhauling it so for
example take a look at you know the
original ipod touch and the ipod touch
2nd generation mostly the same thing but
them surely make some small tweaks maybe
make it thinner etc etc but overall do
you think we will be looking at a very
similar-looking ipad just you know with
a few minor improvements now i'm moving
on to some of what
the device I do think that we will be
getting a much upgrade specs in the ipad
2 and now of course ipad was the first
device to launch with the apple a4
processor however it's almost already
outdated and indeed it will be here next
year once the ipad is released so expect
we will see the next generation of apple
a4 processor maybe the a5 or whatever
they want to do now as far as will have
what kind of specs will have I think
it's a little still a little bit up in
the air right now however if you look at
one of the major competitors for next
year the blackberry the new blackberry
tablet which has a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor definitely do not think it
would be a stretch to see a dual-core
processor in the new next iPad so again
not really a little bit of speculation
we don't know exactly what we're going
to see and very well could stick with
the same processor however I think that
apple would do would be pretty smart to
go ahead and bump up the power to keep
on top of all its competition I'm
speaking of that I also do expect to see
a lot more ram the ipad actually has
quite a bit less rammed in the iphone so
i definitely think for multitasking if
they do more ram and they go ahead and
put a bit of a more powerful processor
think that would definitely go quite a
ways so those are the pretty safe bet I
don't think that we're going to see a
radically new iPad I don't really expect
to see you know a smaller version of the
ipad I think it's possible that we can
see a 7-inch for variety but I wouldn't
exactly bet on it so that's why pretty
much what I expect to see however there
are quite a few other rumors that are
going around that very well could be you
know could be true so including in these
are the 7-inch display on so I don't
think this would be a bad idea to have
maybe like the standard iPad and you
know like a mini iPad or whatever you
want to call it I think this could
happen especially considering that
pretty much all the tablets that are
coming out seem to be about 7 inches or
so so that wouldn't be a bad idea
another thing is that they actually
might get rid of the 30-pin dock
connector so actually a lot of people
are kind of moving forward towards the
micro USB format and indeed the iphone
looks like it probably will go to micro
USB next year I would be surprised if
they go ahead and change that in the eye
too and indeed what would be really cool
that they actually added a regular USB
port so you can go ahead you know plug
in all of your flash drives everything
like that but again a lot of these
predictions are kind of a little bit out
there and I don't fully expect to see
all of them we might see one or two but
really not you know we're not going to
go ahead and see the you know everything
that we are just dreaming about on the
next iPad so guys let's pretty much it
for my rundown of what to expect in the
ipad 2 again overall I don't think it's
gonna be a huge change if you already
have the current generation iPad you
know it's not going to be something
totally revolutionary I don't see you
know Retina display I think that's kind
of a bit ridiculous because you know if
it was a Retina display on the size of
the ipad screen it would be the
resolution would be more than what apple
charges a thousand dollars for on their
30 inch display so i don't think that's
going to happen at all so a lot of you
know the kind of crazy things that
aren't expect that i do expect they will
be a pretty modest and pretty nice
upgrade okay so for the second segment
of d3 life I'll be taking live questions
so of course as always every episode of
d3 live is filmed in front of a live
audience on blog TV we have a lot of
people in here and now so we'll go ahead
just take some questions you know just
about iPads and you Apple and general do
that I think the ipad 2 will have flash
uh no and no i don't well i don't think
it will have flash on the device itself
i really doubt that now there might be a
camera flash i'm not sure that if that's
what you meant but as far as you know
the adobe flashes and actually in the
browser i highly doubt it i don't think
that's ever going to come i just don't
see it happening and the ipod 4th
generation worth it absolutely i really
enjoy my ipod touch 4th generation i
like because it's just got so much more
than previous versions i mean the
cameras are really pretty high quality
as far as I'm concerned it's very fast
retina display looks great personally I
have no problems whatsoever i highly
recommend if you're in the market for
something like an ipod touch you will
not be too disappointed with the fourth
generation don't think the ipad 2 will
have airplay left Apple TV absolutely in
fact airplay is actually going to be
coming to the standard iPad but yeah I
think airplay again just like with all
the apple stuff they're going to slowly
start working it out into everything i
expected yeah probably here in the next
few months to year so we'll have airplay
pretty much all the Apple devices
hopefully you know itunes all just about
everything the ipad will have a Retina
display but will have an HD resolution
now yeah that's the thing people say the
retina display like in the ipod touch
4th generation it's kind of a people
just like to say the word retina display
the word retina display basically the
way it works is a retina display is just
counting like how many pixels cal
high-resolution d screen is now the
thing with the ipad though is that it
really is not a high very high
resolution screen in fact I mean it's
about the same resolution as you know an
old you know 10 year old monitors not
it's not that great now i'm not sure
what will exactly see at ipad i do
expect that probably will be bumped up a
little bit in resolution I don't think
it will be you know like you know 1920 x
1080 I don't think it's gonna be a 1080p
screen I mean that would just be
unbelievably expensive for you know and
iPad that doesn't mean the screen by
itself would cost several hundred
dollars so I don't expect to see a
Retina display I might they might bump
it up a little bit i don't think it will
be a very very high resolution screen do
I think the iPad will have about USB
yeah like I was saying earlier I would
be surprised but i really wouldn't
expect i think it's one of those
possibilities where it'd be nice but i'm
not really sure apple's actually ready
to make that next step of actually
having you know having allowing you to
be actually connect your devices to the
ipad because really they're kind of idea
is that everything is kind of connects
to the computer you know so you take
your ipad and it syncs with the computer
so it's not like it's a standalone
device you have to go ahead and have a
computer to do it so i'm not i'm not
really sure if they're going to put a
USB i think it's possible but i really
wouldn't expect it using the ipad 2 will
be cheaper actually that's a great
question yeah i do think it will be
cheaper now well but five hundred
dollars is not all that bad for the base
model ipad i'm a definitely thing they
could do a lot better and especially
with a lot of the new tablets they'll be
actually coming out on contract so i'm
sure a lot of them will be about it the
same price as a phone on contract with
you know to whatever cellular provider
you have so i really think that the ipad
needs to that Apple needs to step it up
with the next iPad you know cut the
price probably i would probably guess
they cut it
not a lot but you need to cut down some
to get into you know the realm of you
know more affordable affordability so I
think they will sell a lot more they can
cut the price some other currently apps
to only work with the iPad yeah yeah
there are the thing is the way the ipad
works if you don't have one of you can
never used one before is that the ipad
can run any iphone and ipod touch app as
well as any ipad app and the iPhone iPod
Touch apps they basically just urge and
blown up on the screen they don't they
basically just run straight up and then
there are custom apps for the iPad that
will only run on ipad so yeah it will
pretty much do any sort of bad do I
think they will release the 7 inch
version of the ipad 2 again my kind of
talked about this a little bit in the
video I think it's a possibility I just
really wouldn't expect it because Apple
it really wouldn't help Apple that much
I mean there are some iPad they have an
itch well I mean I obviously think they
could do it now I really think it would
be you know I would hurt the normal
sales or whatever but I just really
don't see a big benefit for Apple I mean
you think we probably have to cut the
price some and you know obviously apple
hates near the cut price they want you
to sell and want to sell you as much as
it expensive the devices i can so
possible I just again I just really
don't expect it do you think will be an
SD card slot / microSD card slot on the
ipad 2 probably not I Apple makes a lot
of money selling you the upgrades as
part of the internal storage so take for
example you know the ipad comes in 16 32
and 64 gigabytes now the sixth now yet
obviously you have to jump up and pay a
lot more money now the memory itself
does not cost that much money when you
go if the Apple makes way way more money
on a 64 gigabyte ipod i mean an ipad
rather than as 16 gigabytes so i really
doubt that they will give you an option
to go ahead and use your own storage and
not have to pay their exorbitant prices
for memory really guys that's about it
