of what the Metro UI looks like on
Windows 8 and of course Windows 8 has
been a pretty major overhaul and
probably the biggest new feature is the
new UI it's very similar to what you
would find in Windows Phone 7 of course
blowing up for the big screen let me
give you guys a quick little demo of
some of the new features in Metro so the
first thing is that there's this new
lock screen it's very similar to what
you might find on a phone or a tablet
doesn't see here there's not a whole lot
on here you'll see that you have your
time your date does have any little
indicators or icons that you need so for
example there's my network but if I had
other things other notifications
whatever it would pop up there so to
unlock it would you simply drag it off
the screen and now we need to go ahead
and put in our password slash unlock and
there's a couple of ways to do this the
first of which is to just punch in your
password
now in Windows 8 it does automatically
want to connect to your Windows Live
account so you would just put in you
know the password for your hotmail or
whatever and you can log in that way
that's one way but if you don't wanna do
a password you also have the option to
putting in a pin number so you know just
like on you know pretty much any tablet
or ever you can just you know punch in
whatever you know series of numbers but
the last one is kind of unique and it is
allows you to use a photo to unlock so
the way this works is really simple
you're able to pick out a photo so it
can be a picture I just took a random
photo here but if you need to have a
picture whatever you can use whatever
you want
and the way it works is that you simply
need to go ahead and make a pattern so
you know you can take you know draw like
things like lines and I can stuff I'm
gonna start over but you can also do
clicks and all kinds of different things
to you know kind of make it unique so
mine is I have need to click here click
over here and click up on top of here
and it will unlock so um I will say one
thing it's not quite ideal sometimes it
gets a little a little screwy doesn't
really quite recognize it perfectly but
it is early software and that is just
one option so it's certainly no big deal
alright so now that we're in the Metro
UI yes and see here and of course if you
didn't know already I am using just a
standard computer with no mouse and
keyboard so I can just scroll with the
mouse wheel scroll along here can also
use my directional buttons to go through
here and type in whatever I want so the
first thing I want to show you guys is
just the live tiles you're gonna see
here some of these right
moving and showing you know new
information so for example this one is
just you know about build this is stocks
font click line gonna blow up the stock
application keep up with all my kind of
stuff I can just hit the Windows key to
back up this thing goes from my RSS feed
I can you know add more drag all kinds
of good stuff and again back it right
out and I will be able to keep an eye on
it now if I want to do some
customization whatever I can will
right-click it and then a couple of
things so I can unpin it so I don't want
it on this I can just get rid of it I
can just uninstall it altogether just
delete off my computer or I can make it
smaller so you can see that there are
different sized applications and I do
kind of like this a little bit larger so
I'll leave it double-wide I know some
applications don't allow you do this so
for example control panel it doesn't
have anything to do other than just
click on it so that's you know it's one
thing but it's certainly no big deal and
now of course you do have the option to
go back to your standard Windows desktop
so one of the nice things in Windows 8
is you can freely change between them
using the Windows key so yeah very fluid
very smooth and all that kind of stuff
see here my RSS feed is a little bit
messed up right now but again early
software no big deal you can also go
ahead and move stuff around so by
clicking on it and holding it we can you
know drag and drop it wherever we want
it works pretty well but yeah nothing
that you guys probably never seen before
so I go ahead and show you guys a couple
of apps that how they run on you know
Metro and Windows 8 and everything so
this is a new app so if I right-click
that's kind of like well on a computer
that pulls up kinda like the options so
for example I can make a new text say
hello YouTube I can of course do that
also you know do some different things
like fonts and all that kind of good
stuff and I'm getting right-click I can
capture pull properties it's kind of
like just the whole let's just kind of
the whole guide for using a standard
application so yeah well you just
right-click to kind of pull stuff up and
you get on the tablet it will be
different but I don't have a tablet
right here so go ahead and show you guys
how it works on a normal computer
alright so let's go ahead show you guys
another kind of application which is
going to be a game well that take
another good game so let's go ahead and
open up the piano app and as you can see
here it's a piano app now one of the
things about this that makes a little
bit different from something you know
like a normal kind of app that you would
do is that these are all very
customizable to all kinds of different
computers you know they're all work for
touch
work with the mouse and keyboard and
work on you a 7-inch tablet or a 40 inch
display you know whatever you want now
there's only a couple of other things
that do want to show you guys for one if
you want to scroll of course like I said
you can use a mouse wheel but if you
don't feel like doing that there is a
little bar they'll appear here that
appears pretty much in any application
that you need to scroll from left to
right it really isn't
unlike most windows it really isn't a
whole lot of up and down spoiling a lot
of it is just from side to side as you
scroll back and forth in addition there
also if you come over to the bottom left
a couple things you know I can search so
if I want to search for oh I don't know
paint I can spell right I can search for
paint open it up and no problems at all
the only other thing I do want you guys
is just really quickly here up top you
can change your users dialogue lock log
off all that kind of stuff and also the
user tiles and all your data does kind
of carry with you across different
Windows 8 computers just because it all
is logged into the same you know use
live ID so everybody keep everything
nice and synced hey look guys it's gonna
be about it for my tour of the Metro UI
in Windows 8 now there is a lot more
than I wasn't able to show you but as
you go ahead and take a look at Windows
8 for yourself you will notice a lot of
these really cool little features if you
guys enjoyed the video definitely be
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
