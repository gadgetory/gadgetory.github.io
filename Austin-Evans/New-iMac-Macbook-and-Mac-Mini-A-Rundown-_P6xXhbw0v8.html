products including a new iMac Mac Mini
and a new plastic macbook let's sort
through what all has been upgraded and
see what's really brand new let's get
this one started
first let's start with the new iMacs the
iMac has been given a substantial
makeover growing in size from 20 inch
and 24 inches sizes to respectively a 21
and a half inch and a 27 inch along with
the much larger screens they already
sleek all in ones and have gotten all
aluminum enclosures one of the biggest
changes to come to the resolutions the
standard 21 and a half inch model comes
with a huge 1920 by 1080 resolution
while the 27 inch model comes with a
ridiculous 2560 by 1440 resolution
pricing hasn't changed much but the
specs have been bumped up nicely the
entry-level 21 and a half inch model is
1199 dollars with a three gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Duo processor nvidia 9400 m
graphics four gigabytes of ram and 500
gigabytes of hard drive storage from
there you can go to the $1,499 model
which includes the terabyte of storage
and some impressive ATI Radeon graphics
the base 27 inch model is $1,699 with
the same specs
lastly cons what could be a real
powerhouse the 27-inch model with a
quad-core 2.6 gigahertz Intel Core i5
processor for just shy of $2,000 for an
additional $200 on top of that you can
get it with the new core i7 2.8
gigahertz processor which should
certainly give even the mac pro run
first money not too bad considering it's
a very sleek and thin all-in-one
computer the IMAX has received a
substantial upgrade without a
substantial rise in price which is
always a good thing I'm not entirely
convinced the 27-inch display is really
needed nor such a massive resolution
which will invariably make windows look
far too small but I'm going to wait and
see before passing judgment one thing I
can say for certain is that the new IMAX
were going to be fast no matter what
model you get and the fact that for
$2,200 you can get an iMac that is like
faster than a much more expensive MacPro
should definitely raise some eyebrows
next is the new plastic MacBook it has
been neglected from Apple's lineup for a
while now but it has finally gotten a
decent refresh while rumours that price
would drop weren't true it has remained
at 999 dollars it has got a nice spec
bomb and a redesign it now has an LED
backlit display which isn't saying that
much as that can be found in Windows
laptops less than $500 it gains a new
glass multi-touch trackpad as well as a
built in battery just like the MacBook
Pro with supposedly 7 hours of battery
life
inside you'll find a 2.2 6 gigahertz
Core 2 Duo processor with 2 gigabytes of
RAM an NVIDIA GeForce graphics processor
250 gigabyte hard drive and the tried
and tested super drive the outside of
the new MacBook has been redesigned with
a different polycarbonate as well as a
rubberized bottom however it looks very
much like the previous model and it's
still easily traceable back quite a few
years to the original iBook which isn't
necessarily a good thing when paying
$1000 for a new computer however it was
at ease an upgrade and it should keep
the MacBook alive for at least in
another year or two before a major
refresh lastly but certainly not least
we had the refreshed Mac Mini no price
cuts on it either but it has gotten a
spec bump as well as a new dedicated
server model the cheapest model at $599
has new 2.2 6 gigahertz core 2 duo 2
gigabytes of RAM and a 160 gigabyte hard
drive up from a miserly to 120 gigabyte
hard drive bump up to paying seven
hundred and ninety nine dollars and you
could add a 2.53 gigahertz core 2 duo
four gigabytes of RAM and a 320 gigabyte
hard drive however the most exciting
thing has nothing to do with the
standard models it's about the new Mac
Mini server the biggest difference
between the normal Mac Mini and the
server model is the lack of an optical
drive in the server model instead there
is an extra hard drive Bay allowing it
to ship with two 500 GB
drives it also ships with snow leopard
server and keeps with the rest of the
specs as the upgraded $799 Mac Mini not
entirely unreasonable for $1000 so
that's it the major refreshed of the
iMac MacBook and Mac Mini there was also
a new Apple remote in Magic Mouse
unveiled as well but for the most part
it was all about the new iMac personally
I'm really liking the 21 inch iMac
myself it's nice to see a refresh for
the Mac Mini in macbook as well so what
do you guys think planning on buying any
of the new models or had your eye on
something else be sure to post in the
comments what you think about all this
anyway thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
