episode of d3 live so today I'm gonna go
ahead and talk about something that a
lot of you guys have been really asking
about is that what are some really good
cydia applications and now of course
there's been a lot of recent jailbreaks
right now a lot of you guys are new
first-time geo writers and of course a
lot of you guys are even older deal
breakers so for everybody and then go
ahead and go over my five top favorite
City applications and I do keep in mind
there are a lot more than just five good
city apps and there I mean there are
just tons of them by the way just go
over five of them so that she gives you
a good start with Cydia so the first one
is going to be s to be settings and as
this one is totally free to go ahead and
just search it arms you go open up city
in search of SP settings but basically
what it allows you to do is you swipe
your home up swipe your status bar and
will pull down a dialog that will let
you go ahead and do all kinds of stuff
you know maybe shut off your Wi-Fi
toggle on and off 3G adjust your
brightness and they even gives you some
more options such as giving you maybe
like you're turning your battery into
numbers you know it gives you a lot of
really different really interesting
options so s be sitting that's always
the first thing I do when I do break my
iPod or whatever that's always the first
app I install because just so helpful so
definitely guys go and check it out in
Cydia SP settings indeed just go ahead
and check out the description of this
video I will just put all of them all
the excellent about to talk about there
Steven wise go ahead and see exactly how
they're spelt like hot stuff
so the fourth favorite app is definitely
going to be winter board now wonderboard
is an app that allows you to go ahead
and customize your device to your liking
it does all kinds of stuff as far as
basically allow you to download themes
off of Cydia as well as make your own if
you like on the toilet customize
practically every little bit and piece
of the UI so you can go ahead and do
simple things like change the icons
I mean you changed your lockscreen but
you can go deeper than that and actually
change the UI elements themselves now
winterboard if you're into that now of
course a lot of you guys and myself to
include sometimes you really don't want
a really in-depth custom theme and so
you might not always need went aboard
whoever it's definitely a really nice
app to have
and you know really just customized
every little bit and piece of your
device
so the third app and of course do keep
mine these aren't in any particular
order this is just five of them that I
like so the third act is going to be
cycling now one thing about cydia apps
is that they're not quite as easy to
delete so one thing is is that instead
of you know if you have an app store app
you just hold it and you press the
little X however with city actually need
to go ahead and open up cydia find it
and yours your packages and then
manually date and wait to race bring a
lot of my stuff however which if you
download the application side to leave
you go ahead and just skip all that and
they basically turn just and to App
Store applications so you can go ahead
and hold it and then just press the
little X well it'll be believed it and
you'll be have no problems so side
elites definitely another one of those
apps I always have to download
immediately it really does very very
helpful so the next one we'll go ahead
and talk about is a little bit more
open-ended
I'm gonna go ahead and talk about
emulators our emulators are really
really great on the iPhone the iPod
Touch as well as the iPad so there are a
lot of them available you know
everything from the original Nintendo
Super Nintendo there's a Sega Genesis
game boy pretty much any Gameboy
PlayStation one Nintendo 64 and several
others so basically any kind of older
video game console that you maybe like
you know you like have a lot of games on
it you can go ahead download an emulator
to your iPhone your iPod or your iPad
now the thing is a lot of these
emulators do cost some money as audit is
actually the best place to get them I
think that's it but that's the best
place to get them for the most part
because they have a lot of the emulators
but it's definitely really pretty handy
I love being able to go ahead and you
know emulate all my favorite games on my
iPhone or whatever I'm in addition a lot
of times you can go ahead and actually
use a Wii mote so if you have a Nintendo
Wii yes you go ahead take the Wii mote
pair it with bluetooth to your iPod or
whatever thing when I should control the
games through that which in my opinion
is a lot better actually using real
buttons then you know just using the
touchscreen but at any rate there are a
lot of really great emulators available
in Cydia
and yes some of the first things I
always tell it are the emulators I'm so
the last thing them go ahead and talk
about is going to be I file now I file
is a little bit of a it's more of a
utility than you know great you know
flashy app whatever but basically I file
allows you to go ahead and go through
your device actually go ahead and look
through the file system itself and maybe
delete stuff change stuff you can do all
kinds of stuff without having to bother
with using an SSH tool in your computer
you can do it all from your device so
again this is a little bit of a more of
a technical lab you know a lot of you
guys probably won't use it very often
whoever it definitely does pay off to go
ahead and download it because you never
know when you might need to change a
little bit of a file or delete something
or if you're having a problem there's
all kinds of reasons why you would might
need I file I'm in the last thing I
guess is kind of a little bit of an
extra is just a general SSH client so if
as long as you went ahead and installed
on your iPod you can go ahead and use it
through your computer and this works
pretty much the same way as ifile does
and it allows you to go ahead and you
know maybe drop themes and maybe you can
make a custom winterboard thing go ahead
and drop that on your device as well as
you can go ahead and add your custom
roms to whatever emulator I'm so there
you go guys those are my top
applications for you know it's your
first time jailbreaking my you know my
favorite city apps and of course there
are a lot of theater just way way more
however those should be enough to go
ahead and get you started okay so for
the second segment of t3 live I'm going
to be taking live questions so as always
every episode of d3 live is filmed in
front of blog TV and we have a ton of
people on here now so what and just take
some questions and you know just kind of
hang out a little bit what is better
city ever I see
definitely city in my opinion especially
concerning that I see has been kind of
discontinued for a while in fact really
there's not a whole lot else as far as
you know different sorts of application
jailbreak ko installers pretty much oh
the view really can get right now
City at which I don't know I like city a
lot but I think there's always room for
competition and so I would really like
to say something else
especially since Rock is gone now that
since Cydia bought it when is you're
becoming for the ipod touch 2g on 4.1
great question I get that in your dozens
of times a day
the answer is soon now jihad has
previously said that it would be coming
out in lime rain but I I don't think it
will be but I do know that for a fact
that green poison and the chronic dev
team they will have it in green poison
so if you have an iPod Touch second
generation on four point one or you have
an iPod Touch 3rd generation that's an 8
gigabyte model do you know that a
jailbreak is coming for you it's coming
soon I don't have an exact date but I
will make a video on this is done so
hopefully that answered a lot of you
have these questions is there any
possibility of an unlock on the latest
baseband yes now of course if a lot of
you guys update about you guys but a lot
of people updated on 4.1 than jailbreak
without realizing that there wasn't an
unlock as well well they are working on
it a couple people who are working on it
the latest I've heard is it probably
expected sometime next month
but of course an unlock is a lot of work
just like the jailbreak is so again I
don't know exactly when it'll be most
likely a month some sometime next month
assuming nothing goes wrong but yeah so
I would guess probably like maybe a
month month and a half now no green put
is green poison already fixed on the is
the green poison already fixed for the
iPod Touch 2nd generation
no it's not there are jail breaks for
the second generation namely snow breeze
and red snow however they don't um snow
breeze sometimes work than you need to
go ahead and in these babies played me
an MB model and red snow it should work
on the MC model however I've had a lot
of problems with it and most people have
so really if you have and I thought that
circuit generation that's an MC model or
you have an iPod Touch 3rd generation
it's the model which they're the same
thing then you're going to go ahead and
need to wait for green boys to be
updated what do i what from where am i
on I'm currently on 4.1 I bet I've
bounced around a lot on my iPod it's
mostly just to do videos on you know
when there's a new firmware out I'll go
up to it and make a video on that I
might go down and stuff so I'm always
constantly moving but right now I am on
4.1 firmware what's the difference
between the line rain and green poison
good question
base
they're very very very very close a lot
of people ask me which ones better and
really I have a hard time answering that
because they both do practical things
that same thing so they're both based
off the exact same exploits so they both
work on these same devices now there are
a couple of key differences namely green
poison does not currently work on the
Mac and lime rain does not currently
work on Linux so depending on what
computer you have you know you might
need to pick one however if you have a
Windows computer that you know you want
just want people one of them I'm
probably leaning toward using green
poison just because the DFU mode
instructions are just a little bit
easier but to be honest there's really
almost no difference they both will
jailbreak you just fine the only reason
to use one instead of the others maybe
if you're having problems five icon row
or five icon doc um you know it depends
on kind of actually using pop icon doc
it really just kind of depends on how
you want to set up your device basically
I with my ipod I just like to have
there's five apps that you know I'm
always going to so I just like to have
them all on my dock but the of course
that's the beauty of your break you can
even customize it however you want
right never a AMOLED screen um you know
it's kind of hard to say I mean there
are a lot of really really nice-looking
screens coming out in the market today I
know unless you say from personal
experience that I love the Retina
display is so crisp it's so clear you
can really tell that when you're reading
text like you know in iBooks have
actually I've been doing a lot of
reading and eyebolts on my ipod touch um
you know the crisp the the text is very
very crisp and clear however these
AMOLED and the Super AMOLED displays on
devices such as you know the Samsung
Galaxy S lineup
um they're very very nice-looking while
they're not quite as good as far as the
resolution the colors and the general
just look at the screen is very very
impressive there are all kinds of
different screens available today you
know it's kind of hard to pick a winner
but I will say from personal experience
because it's the device I have that I'm
very very impressed with the Retina
display so guys that's it for this
