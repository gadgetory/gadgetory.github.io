of the coolest gaming laptops I've ever
seen so this might not look like
anything all that special rights just
like a fairly chunky big gaming laptop
but I flip it over this was just a
little bit different and by a little I
mean a lot different this is the rog
mothership if you saw a video we did
last year on the rog g7o 3 you know that
was hands-down the most ridiculous
overkill gaming laptop we've ever taken
a look at we'll take a lot of what I
said about that and put it into this
form factor we've got some fun stuff so
this is a bit thinner than the G 703
what's interesting about it is that
they've really rearranged all the
components so I flip it around what
you'll see is that all the main stuff
like the CPU and the GPU they're all
around back so as opposed to a normal
laptop where you pretty much have the
keyboard that's blocking it instead we
have full airflow here as well as on the
top and this has some serious specs when
you're talking like a core i9r checks
2080 I mean this has got a lot of stuff
and it's able to keep cool with a
slightly unusual design there's even RGB
underneath the kickstand so that
everyone can see just how cool you are
now I get that this is not a standard
laptop form factor but honestly that's
kind of ok right you're talking about a
very high-end gaming laptop which is a
little bit more portable but it
definitely does not stop there so if you
want you can use the keyboard and
touchpad like a standard laptop or you
can actually detach the entire panel and
then it will flip over to wireless mode
so what's cool about this is that you
still have your keyboard you still have
your touchpad and of course if you want
to you can just put this away and you
know use another set of peripherals or
you can even use this wire because it
does have a USB C port to charge as well
as to use a wirelessly or wired lis
wired plea wired wired this is a really
good example of why this design actually
makes some sense right I mean of course
you could do a standard laptop and have
all the components on the bottom but
because of this I mean it's kind of like
the most overkill - and one ever this is
a big laptop it has a 17.3 inch panel
that is a full 144 Hertz with a three
millisecond response time and on top of
that what's kind of cool about the
keyboard design is that we actually have
a ton of room for the speakers so I
start praying this up it's super loud so
it has four four watt speakers that are
all blasting directly at you and it even
does have RGB
because of course it does of course it
does surprisingly exactly no one this
thing has ridiculous specs so it has an
overclocked core I nine processor 64
gigs of ram three one terabyte SSDs in
raid because obviously that's important
and we of course do have that brand new
Archie X 20 80 GPU but this is as good
as it gets for laptop GPUs right now but
unfortunately I'm not at liberty to show
you gaming on this particular system so
you just have to take my word that it
can definitely definitely play for
tonight and like Crysis I guess or
whatever the kids play can we just all
just just pause for one second this
thing is ridiculous like straight up
I've seen a lot of 201 designs and
usually it's much more on the
ultraportable side which is great right
I mean it's nice to have something
that's super thin super light but this
is so like it's cool right I mean look
at this so we have the kickstand you
also have all the ports I've even gone
over that yet so we have not only 2.5
gigabit ethernet we also have Wi-Fi 6
you've got Thunderbolt you've got USB a
you've got HDMI I mean this thing is
loaded with cool specs but I really
appreciate that that's all loaded into a
chassis which is legitimately different
right I mean of course I won't actually
get my hands on and spend some proper
time to see how well it thermal
throttles or anything like that but you
can look at just how much space you've
got we were able to do a little bit of
our once once over on some of the
components that are on the outside to
see kind of like the CNC aluminum and
the heat sinks and stuff but I just
really appreciate that this is a gaming
laptop which is obviously very powerful
but it's actually really cool you might
be familiar with the rog Zephyrus s
which came out a few months ago well
this is a super cool 15 inch design they
now have an updated 17 inch version so
with it closed it's incredibly thin at
only eighteen point seven millimeters
but with the active aerodynamic system
which is a very a Seuss name we do get a
little bit of extra cooling thanks to
the bottom panel opening up and this is
similar to the last generation model
however it has even more power inside
with a full r-tx 2080 max-q inside like
the other Zephyrus models it is a fairly
understated design and that's something
I appreciate in a gaming laptop
I'm sure you've got all the RGB you want
you've got perky RGB lighting on the
keyboard
you've got the logo the under glow but
if you want you can turn all that stuff
off and you get yourself what's actually
a fairly subdued laptop especially
considering that it does have that full
17 inch screen as a laptop with the core
i7 and an RT X 2080 inside it does come
with a fairly beefy power brick what's
cool is it does also support USB see
charging and mind you you won't be able
to use a brick like this for say gaming
but if you wanna get a little bit of
juice on the go if you're not doing
anything all that intensive this does
work what's interesting about the
Zephyrs is that it does come with an
external webcam as opposed to cramming a
very small camera and the bezel instead
this is something that is at full 1080p
60fps which you can not only mount to
the laptop itself or if you wanted to
you can use the included stand and put
it off to the side now our G was tell me
a little bit about the idea that
obviously a lot of people are buying
this for something like say twitch
streaming or whatever so the idea that
you have a better webcam that you could
place off to the side and it still comes
the laptop is a nice touch
although I don't know those cameras are
cool right
the 17-inch version of the Zephyrus will
be going on sale later this month and
they refreshed 15 and will go on sale
just a little bit after that I don't
have a price for you as you might
imagine art CX is not going to be
particularly cheap anyway hope you guys
enjoyed definitely be sure to stay tuned
to the channel for lots more other CES
