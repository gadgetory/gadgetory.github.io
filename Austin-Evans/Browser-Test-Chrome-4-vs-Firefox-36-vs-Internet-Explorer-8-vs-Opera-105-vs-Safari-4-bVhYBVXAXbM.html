today I'm here in the third installment
of my browser test videos previously we
went over the latest versions of all
five main browsers Internet Explorer
Firefox Chrome Opera and Safari in that
test
Google Chrome came out on top but with
two major asterisks namely privacy and
the lack of add-ons or more than even a
few handful of themes since then opera
has undergone a major overhaul Firefox
has moved to version 3.6 and chrome has
jumped to version 4 so let's revisit the
browser comparison test to see what all
has changed let's get this one started
before we begin let me quickly tell you
a little about the tests I used a good
deal of my time was spent testing the
speed of the browser and I used quite a
few tests ranging from SunSpider
to dromio I also ran the Peacekeeper
benchmark as well as timing the launch
time for the browsers in addition to the
memory usage because of the large amount
of testing I did instead of watching
this review and a single video I've
split it up into five one for each
browser in a moment the president logos
will appear under stream with
annotations that would lead you to each
review of the browsers pick whichever
browser you wants to know more about and
watch the video to see how it placed
then when you're done
follow the annotation back to this main
video and watch the next browser in the
series feel free to check out whichever
browser you want right now if you don't
see links around the logos make sure
that annotations are turned on you're on
an iPhone or don't see the annotations
for some other reason you can check the
description where I'll have links to
watch each video
so that's it guys personally I was very
surprised about the outcome but
nonetheless I highly recommend you at
least take a look at the winner you
won't be disappointed so what browser or
browsers do you can use on daily basis
be sure to leave your favorites in the
comments anyway I hope you enjoyed
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
