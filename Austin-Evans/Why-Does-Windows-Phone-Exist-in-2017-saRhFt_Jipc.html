seven years ago
however today it's on life support why
does it still exist in 2017 first of all
we have the Alcatel Idol 4s what's
interesting about this phone is that not
only can you get the Windows version but
there's also an Android Edition which is
essentially the same hardware even
though there's a little bit more of a
mid-range phone we actually take a look
at it it looks really nice so what
you're getting here is a large 5.5 inch
display and some nice features like a
fingerprint reader as well as a glass
back and a metal chassis and because
we've got the Windows Phone version here
we also have a VR headset which comes in
a block so it looks very much like
something like gear VR and omission
curious I've never tried a Windows Phone
that actually has any kind of VR support
Wow this is actually really nice
packaging what you're getting here
especially for 200 bucks is pretty solid
it should be the full continuum
experience what I will say the hardware
of this guy definitely is not on par
with idle is very much plasticy and the
bezels are pretty giant but again 230
bucks including all of this stuff one of
the most promising features of Windows
10 mobile is continuum so paired with
this dock which gives you not only USB 3
and HDMI visible as a couple of USB 2
ports is that you could take your phone
dock it and once you have a mouse
keyboard monitor essentially this single
device can do double duty as your phone
as well as your desktop at least in
theory the last point I took a look at
that ran continuum was the HP elite x3
maybe fear that was a very premium phone
but also came with a premium price tag
of about $700 the Acer in theory
supports all of the same continuum
features and there's a lot of potential
here however it feels like it really
isn't fully baked so you take a look at
it once you're actually plugged into the
dock and monitor this looks very much
like standard Windows however once you
actually get into it you realize that
this is definitely not a full copy one
of the big problems here is that
everything is just really slow now
saying we're an edge and yes we can kind
of scroll but it's very jerky not
particularly smooth and it's annoying I
mean sure this is phone hardware so you
shouldn't expect to be as fast as a
laptop but this is a lot slower on top
of that there's just not that much that
you can actually do so to refigure the
Microsoft edge browser is fairly
full-featured but once you actually open
up the windows main
you'll see that beyond these standard
apps that come with Windows Phone
there's not a lot of extra support this
guy does not run full Windows
application it's really disappointing
because continuum feels way ahead of its
time in phones like the galaxy s 8 have
actually supported a very similar sort
of setup and honestly done a lot better
which just sucks I mean come on this is
Microsoft if anyone is going to pull off
running Windows on a phone and a desktop
it's going to be done with the idol 4s
the big feature is the VR headset that
comes in the box and I'm actually kind
of curious to see how this is going to
work I'm actually I'm totally sure how
this is connected since it actually
doesn't connect via USB see but I do
have some buttons here I will say it is
a 1080p screen which makes it a little
bit uh get you looking but let's just
see oh man a 360 video right now and I
mean the traffic looks ok
I mean it's VR it works I guess
I mean the 360 effect looks okay but if
nowhere near as polished is something
like gear VR I honestly don't think
anyone would spend some serious time in
this gaming sucide what I'm curious
about is how usable Windows Phone is
today so the big downside to basically
all Windows Phones beside this and a
couple of the more recent ones such as
the HP is that they are no longer
supported so Windows Phone 7 Windows
Phone 8.1 none of these are going to be
getting any updates and if the rumors
are true Windows 10 is actually not
going to be that much farther behind can
be fear there are some apps that are
still supported on Windows Phone mostly
because a lot of the apps that are meant
for the Windows 10 store will run here
when you look through the top category
the the apps are pretty slim once you
get past a few of the main one there's
not a lot that's actually still going to
run on this phone it is very clear that
the software is what's holding back
these phones as the hardware actually
isn't too bad so with the Acer not only
are you getting a 1080p AMOLED display
which looks pretty nice but it also has
a Snapdragon 808 maybe not the newest
thing in the world but totally decent
and yet not a lot actually works the
idol 4s even bump that up to a
Snapdragon 820 you're still getting the
nice glass and metal build there are a
lot of nice little features like having
the fingerprint sensor as well as the
dual front firing speakers something
that does hold it pretty well on both
phones however are the cameras well
especially not bud so i o4s actually
does a lot with HDR to pull
everything in here and now with the Acer
and the cameras are not bad on these
phones but it is really really slow to
take an HDR photo these look pretty
similar but I should have to give it to
the Acer here especially when you look
really up and close there's a little bit
less compression you can see a lot more
detail on the tile to me it's pretty
obvious that Windows Phone is on its way
out
now again so you can get pretty good
deals on phones that are still
technically supported but don't expect
much of a future here unless you are a
hardcore Windows fanboy it is really
difficult to recommend picking up one of
these in 2017 but what do you guys think
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
