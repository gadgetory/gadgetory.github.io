I've got some pretty exciting news a
bunch of information has just come out
just literally like 30 minutes ago about
the next generation iPhone and there's
some surprising things in it the name is
likely going to be the iPhone HD for a
couple different reasons which I'll
explain in a minute as well as it is
going to be an iPhone version for
Verizon so I'm gonna go through the run
you guys do everything we know including
on release date all kinds of great stuff
anyway let's get this one started
okay guys so let's just go ahead and
begin with what this all started with
the Wall Street Journal of course now
they're they're pretty reputable no it's
a high percent right but I would I would
trust them somewhat they just put up a
thing just not long ago at all basically
explaining that there's going to be a
next generation iPhone obviously well on
to that but it's going to be coming out
they say June 22nd and that does fit
they Apple tends to do their products on
Tuesdays so it makes sense so June 22nd
and then they say it is going to be the
iPhone HD now the iPhone HD part that's
actually something been hearing a lot
lately you know of course the first one
was just an iPhone iPhone 3G 3GS a lot
of people thought maybe the iPhone 4G
but I think iPhone HD fits a lot better
in addition there's a couple of reasons
why I think it is too HD and I just go
over them really quickly for one did you
look at the iPhone in the past year
seriously guys I mean Android and other
phones have religious overtaking it I
mean it used to be the iPhone was
hands-down the best phone around well
that's definitely not the case anymore
and honestly if I was buying a new phone
ignoring the next generation iPhone but
I was going to buy a new phone right now
it wouldn't be an iPhone it's just not
anywhere near as good as a lot of other
phones like the Nexus One so I really
think one of the main things is is that
the iPhone has a pretty small
solution screen compared to a lot of new
ones so I expect that they will go ahead
and make it a high-definition screen or
at least close his 320 by 480 right now
it would probably more likely be like
you know 800 maybe it might even be full
HD screen another reason why I think
they're going to call the HD is because
the camera on the back I believe is
going to upgrade to a 720p
high-definition video scene now we don't
know this for sure but I think it makes
a lot of sense a couple of cell phones
recently have come out with 720 video
shooting and I think it really really
helped the iPhone actually say hey this
shoots real high-definition video not
just you know cell phone video and
thirdly a lot of people have actually
been talking about that i phone HD now
there's a really cool I'm pretty sure
it's fake but it's a really cool
commercial going around you guys can
check it out I'll have a link over there
a really cool commercial showing iPhone
HD I don't really think it's definitely
not real and it doesn't look I think I
don't believe Epson believe well that's
what's going to look like but it's still
pretty interesting so guys that's the
first bit now the second bit is that
they're going to make a Verizon version
now of course the iPhones been on AT&amp;amp;T
for the past several years and a lot of
people like hey we want it on Verizon
and you know on or at least on different
carriers well you know we've heard this
rumor we've heard this rumor we've heard
this rumor but this one actually sounds
pretty promising no I thought that they
were going to do this for a while and it
looks like they will go ahead they're
going to make two different versions one
for AT&amp;amp;T and cell phone carriers like
that they use the same technology
there's also going to be a Verizon
version there will be two different
models but it will be a different
Verizon version that would be were able
to work on Verizon those and likely
Sprint in several other carriers so now
we don't know exactly even though it
might work for a bunch of different
carriers we don't know if they're
actually going to carry it because you
know just like the way that the iPhone
current iPhone can work somewhat on
t-mobile of course I yeah
Apple doesn't sell it on t-mobile so
what do you have to what you see so yeah
guys that's bad
right now like I said they expected to
go ahead and they will have the event in
June 22nd now they weren't exactly sure
when the Verizon version will come out
they said maybe September but I don't
really know I'm making sense to me if
they didn't go ahead and come out with a
Verizon version I don't really see why
they wouldn't go ahead and have it come
out with the 18 t but you know we'll
just have to see anyway guys be sure to
subscribe to my channel I will
definitely keep you covered with all
kinds of iPhone HD or G whatever you
call it all iPhone news cell phone
technology staff anyway guys what do you
think about all this I'm personally I'm
pretty excited I really like to see an
iPhone HD you know i mean i was a big
i've been a big supporter of the iphone
for a while but it kind of you know it
kind of hurts that it's fallen so
far this year so you know we should have
to take a look and see they had a lot of
really cool stuff so just be sure to
leave me in the comments what you guys
think anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
