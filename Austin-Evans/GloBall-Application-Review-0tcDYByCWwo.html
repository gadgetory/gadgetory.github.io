today I'm here with the colossal acacia
nerves you on a very interesting very
very well polished application called
global something you guys may have seen
it it was towards the top of the
leaderboards man not that long ago at
all and yet so I'm here to do a review
on it um first thing to notice in this
game is that the graphics are great but
the polish is even better
um I mean even through the menu the
loading screen seamlessly flows into
this on you'll see when you be level it
just punch pulls right into the mean you
just almost immediately um it's kinda
hard to explain so let's just go ahead
and get right into this so I'm just go
ahead and you see I'm sure to go ahead
and try it now this this game does use
the accelerometer which is kind of one
of my slight on about flaws but because
I'm just gonna try to explain this as I
go basically what you do is you or this
little glow ball and you see I'm
collecting these little coins basically
I do is you see how you see these two
boxes I just blew up based basically my
objectives and then you see I'm just
I've got a powerup that was what I first
did so I'm just blowing through these
like crazy but as you see this powerup
will leave okay now you got X Paul now
you see these coins and picking up these
basically well the more I get the I'll
get extra balls and when I died and I
won't die for that
okay so trying to I'm gonna come kind of
going slow cuz I don't want to don't
forget anything about the game but uh
basically as you can see here blue and
and you can see here if you hit one of
those little black ball things now I'll
get another powerup so then you see I'm
just a fan of stuff you see the graphics
are really quite good I mean and you
can't blow into this and as you see now
I might say another x ball so now I just
have to crush these and now game over
you can see it just goes right into the
menu that's something I really like
about this just because it's very cool
it just goes straight in
nothing into it at all now what it does
next is to do that but basically what it
does is it goes on to speak world which
i think is very cool because you can
look around and see who has high scores
and then light up so you can see like
nuts here nuts they're pretty cool I
like these location kind of things um
but yeah so let's just go ahead and just
show you guys another one you know
there's not a whole lot to globe all I
will tell you that it's a cool game you
see I just got a powerup so and I do it
just go up to the top grab another
powerup but glow ball is a it's a pretty
cool game but there's some things I
think they could try to change about it
as you can see here probably the camera
kinda hard to constrain this and the
camera oops
so my angles probably all bad so sorry
about that guys
but one thing I wish they had some kind
of way well you could well you could
like use the use the touch screen
something because you can't always and
it calibrates and for this review
because normally it's calibrated on like
as if the iPod was flat so oh but uh
only calibrate sister iPods flat thanks
yep come on Anita applies it but it
calibrates is if it's flat and when it's
not flat it's kind it's really hard to
control so you basically just have to go
through and calibrate yourself so that's
one thing I wish maybe they could
incorporate the touchscreen some um
nothing that not there's anything really
that wrong with the accelerometer
control they can give the little touchy
as you can see here me I'm barely moving
it and they're don't get me on the
sensitivity everything is about perfect
but just sometimes you just don't really
want to use use the accelerometer all
the time pretty simple though not a big
complaint and it last time I checked
this was only $0.99 so I definitely
recommend guys for nonsense this is a
definite definitely buy they've added
some stuff in that they just not that
long ago and it's really quite good
come on mer I think say but yes that's
globe all
um I recommend you guys check it out
it's a lot of fun can get a little
repetitive but uh you know it's not bad
and for 99 cents it's pretty cool anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
