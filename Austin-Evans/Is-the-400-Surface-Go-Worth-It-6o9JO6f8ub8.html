This is the brand new, smaller,
and cheaper Surface Go.
But at $400 the question is,
is it worth it?
So Microsoft just sent this over.
Today is the launch of the Surface Go,
so you can pre-order it
and all that kind of stuff.
But the general idea here is that
this feels much more like a competitor
to the iPad than a lot of the
higher end Surface models.
So there are only going
to be a couple models
of the Surface Go.
So this is the higher end
config with the Pentium Gold,
which is standard across the board.
But with the upgrade, eight gigs of RAM
and 128 gigs of storage.
And this one is going to cost $550.
Alright, so inside we get
the actual tablet itself.
That feels like an iPad.
That is much, much smaller than
any of the normal Surfaces,
but we're still going to be getting a lot
of the nice features including,
when I get the plastic wrap off,
we've got the nice, fully
adjustable kickstand.
Dude, this is really light, wow.
It's funny, I mean the normal Surfaces
are hardly heavy or huge,
but this just feels so much more portable.
I mean, that is nothing.
While phones are going
completely away from bezels,
I actually don't mind the slightly larger
bezels on the Surface Go.
It gives you a nice sort of
place to set your fingers
and use it without accidentally touching
the screen all the time.
So we've got a power cable,
so this one's going to be,
oh I have to do math.
23 watts, right?
24 watts, damn I was close.
My math skills, super sharp.
But we've got the
standard Surface charger.
And this is going to be
using the Surface connector.
So something that's going
to be a little bit different
with this, as opposed to something like
the actual bigger Surface Pro,
is the port situation.
So we still do have the Surface connector,
but this guy's also going
to have a full USB-C port.
Beyond that, it looks like
we're just going to be
getting a little bit of
paperwork in the box.
So, like its bigger
brothers, you can pick it up
with the keyboard, as well as a stylus,
but both of those are going to cost extra.
So this is the Alcantara type cover.
Now that's going to actually
run you a full $130.
You can pick up the
non-Alcantara version for 100.
But don't be fooled by that $400 price tag
on the Surface Go.
It can get much more
expensive very quickly.
The Surface Go is in an
interesting position.
So it slots right in
between the $330 base iPad,
as well as the $650 iPad Pro.
Now it is going to be both thicker,
as well as have a smaller
screen than the Pro.
But you're also going to be getting
some much more PC-focused features.
Like, you know, an actual USB-C port,
and the ability to use a trackpad,
which is kinda helpful for the thing
that tries to replace your laptop.
Now the keyboards are actually going to be
a pretty similar size.
So both on the iPad as
well as the Surface,
they're going to be about 85%
of a standard laptop keyboard.
But the Surface definitely
does have the advantage
with not only that touchpad,
but it also has a much
nicer chiclet design
with some full backlighting.
Then there's the kickstand.
So this is a bit of a Surface
signature at this point.
And the good thing is the Go does have
a fully flexible kickstand that's going
to be just like its bigger brothers.
You can adjust it up, down,
and pretty much stop at
anywhere along the way.
Now it isn't out yet, but there will be
a little bit later this year,
a version of the Surface
Go available with LTE.
Maybe not the most important
thing in the world,
but just like an iPad,
it can be very helpful
to have built into the device.
The iPad has made some
major strides recently
to be much closer to a full
laptop replacement device.
However, if you take one
look at the Surface Go,
you're going to find a lot here
that's going to make
your life a lot easier
if you actually do want
to use it as a laptop.
And if you do want to take advantage of it
as an actual laptop,
you're probably going to want
to use the microSD card slot.
With only 64 or 128 gigs of storage,
it's going to run out quick as soon
as you start doing
anything more intensive.
And at least being able to
throw in a 64 or 128 gig card
can make a big difference
for only a few bucks.
Beyond just the difference in capacity,
there's also going to be
a big difference in speed.
So while the 64 gigabyte version
of the Surface Go has slower eMMC flash,
this guy, with the 128 gigs
of storage, has a full SSD.
While it's not going to be crazy fast,
it's really right on par with
a lot of lower end laptops,
and especially pretty
impressive for less than $600.
Where the Surface Go is kind of far off
is in pure performance.
Inside that Pentium Gold processor, well,
it's just not going to be that fast.
Now don't get me wrong.
It's still going to be faster than
the Atom-based cores inside the Surface 3,
but what you're getting here is a pair
of Skylake-based cores, which do
at least have hyperthreading,
but they're going to be kinda similar
to a last-gen core i3, except
clocked much, much slower.
Mind you, we are looking
at a fanless 10-inch tablet
with a 6 watt TDP,
and a max clock speed
of only 1.6 gigahertz.
Now without any kind of boost, it does mean
it's going to suffer in the benchmarks.
But in real world use,
the Surface Go actually isn't too bad.
With 8 gigs of RAM, and
that pretty speedy SSD,
it does hold up pretty well in normal use.
Now of course you have to
temper your expectations,
you're probably not going to want
to edit 4K video on this guy,
but that Skylake-based
core processor does make
a big difference to day-to-day use.
You're also getting decent
graphics performance.
The Intel HD 615 inside
is going to be fine
for some very light gaming,
although you really shouldn't
turn this into a gaming PC,
but importantly it is going to allow you
to, say, run a couple of 1080p monitors,
or even a 4K display off of it.
Even without the keyboard,
you're also getting some
other nice features.
So this is going to be
full Windows Hello support,
so all you need to do is turn it on,
and very quickly it will
recognize you and log in.
This is something that will be coming
to iPad soon with Face ID,
but Microsoft already has
a great implementation,
and it's here on a $400 tablet today.
The screen isn't too bad.
So you're getting a 10-inch,
1800 by 1200 display,
which of course does support touch.
And while it's not going to be
the highest quality panel in the world,
it gets pretty bright,
but the color accuracy
is going to be a little bit off,
and it's not going to be the most
contrasty thing in the world.
But generally speaking, for a $400 tablet,
I'm definitely not complaining.
So you are going to be
getting front-firing speakers,
but they just don't really
sound all that impressive.
They're a little bit on the tinny side,
and while they do get pretty loud,
the issue is there's no real bass
and they just kinda sound whatever.
I guess it's a $400 laptop, tablet, thing.
(Hit That Jive Jack by Gramatik plays)
Yeah, that's so much better.
So with the iPad, what you're getting
is something that is going to
have not only quad speakers,
there's going to be one
on all four corners,
but just sounds much richer, much deeper.
To be fair, the iPad Pro is also going
to be a fair bit more
expensive, but no-brainer.
It's way, way better.
The cameras on the Surface
Go are surprisingly good.
Not only is the webcam nicely
detailed and very rich,
but even the rear-facing
camera doesn't look too bad.
So, is the Surface Go worth it?
Well they've hit a good price point,
and a lot of the compromises
from the bigger Surface Pro
are very understandable.
Now for most people,
especially if you just want it
for basic use, I think
the standard $400 version
is going to be fine.
However, if you want to actually use this
as a laptop replacement,
I would really say that you should upgrade
to the higher-end model
and pick up a keyboard.
It is going to make a big difference.
Now all that being said, I'm curious.
Would you want to pick up a Surface Go,
or would you rather prefer to
use something like an iPad?
Let me know in the comments below,
and I will catch you in the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
