here at the tutorial on how to set up
and activate the iPhone 5 the first step
is to get yourself a nano SIM not a
micro sim like previous iPhones have
used your iPhone may have come with this
but if not get one from your carrier
depending on the model you might get a
sim eject tool but if not a bent
paperclip will work just fine push it
into the slot on the right side and the
tray should pop out all you need to do
is drop your nano SIM in the tray and
slot it back into the iPhone now it's
time to set it up and activate hold the
power button on top of the phone for a
few seconds until it boots up first step
is to pick the language which is pretty
straightforward same goes for your
country to activate you'll either need
to connect to Wi-Fi or use the cellular
connection but it's best to use Wi-Fi
connect to your network and then the
phone will activate itself this can take
anything from a few seconds to a few
minutes next up we have location
services which uses GPS to tag photos
and let apps find you so enable this
unless you would prefer it off it will
ask you to set up as a new phone or
restore from a backup if you're
upgrading from an older iPhone
feel free to restore but if not just set
up as new moving on it will ask you to
create an Apple ID this is the account
used with iPods iPads and iTunes odds
are you already have one so log in or
create a new Apple ID if not agree to
the fine print and it will get
everything set up now you have the
option to use iCloud this will backup
data like photos contacts and more and
can be quite useful but of course you
can skip it if you like if you enable
iCloud you can back up your phone to
iCloud automatically or just use iTunes
on your computer next we have Find My
iPhone which will help you find your
phone if it's lost or stolen the iPhone
5 uses email addresses to allow people
to contact you with I messages and
FaceTime so here you can choose what you
want to use it will also ask you if you
want to use Siri or not so go ahead and
turn it on as it can be quite helpful
lastly we have Diagnostics which will
send usage data to Apple nicely done you
have your iPhone 5 set up try making a
test call it should work however if it
doesn't your carrier might have
additional steps such as calling a
number to finish activating if you found
this helpful don't forget to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
