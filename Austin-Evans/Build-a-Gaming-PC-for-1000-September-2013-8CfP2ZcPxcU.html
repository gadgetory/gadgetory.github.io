was a gaming PC bill for a thousand
dollars so for this money we're getting
a very well-rounded computer this is of
course easily capable of playing even
the newest titles on full Ultra settings
but we're also getting some nice
additional stuff including an SSD to
demo the performance we've got a few
games starting with battlefield 3 this
is absolutely no problem for the PC as
it's easily able to run it at Ultra
settings at 1080p Crysis 3 which in my
opinion is the best looking game out
right now is absolutely no problem as
well as they're able to play here on
very high settings with BioShock
Infinite plots not quite a computer
crusher like Crysis 3 it is still a very
nice looking game and it can be quite
demanding however here we are able to
run on full Ultra settings lastly we
have Metro last light
apart from being a lot of fun it's also
a very demanding title even on high-end
hardware however here we can't play the
game on very high settings to kick the
build off we have the new Intel Core i5
46 70 K now is one of the new Intel
Haswell CPUs this is among the best
choices for gaming period it's got a
quad core design clocked at three point
four gigahertz and since it is a K
series part that means that we can feel
free to overclock it so getting full
gigahertz on the CPU should be
absolutely no big deal all for about two
hundred and forty dollars for a CPU
cooler we're using the cooler master
hyper 212 Evo now when you begin
overclocking on your CPU it really does
pay to have an aftermarket heatsink as
opposed to the stock cooler as it really
does allow you to get a lot more
performance so with the hyper 212 Evo
you should be able to get four gigahertz
on the CPU no problem and on top of that
since it's only going to be $40.00 it's
not going to break the bank for a
motherboard we're going to be using the
MSI z87 g43
now this motherboard of course does
support overclocking like I've been
talking about the last few minutes
thanks to the z87 chipset and that also
does mean that it does have USB 3
support as well as SATA 3 support so
we're gonna get our full speed out of
that SSD on top of that you are going to
be able to support up to 32 gigabytes of
memory as well as it's going to be a
nice robust board all for about 120
dollars for a graphics card we're going
to be using a three go by Sapphire
Radeon 79 and when you consider price
performance the 7950 is practically
impossible to beat right now as it
delivers tons intensive performance as
you guys saw earlier and yep to max out
a lot of even brand-new games however it
comes in at a very reasonable price of
well under $250 so thanks to that 3
gigabytes of gddr5 memory and that very
powerful GPU core this is gonna be a
great choice for this build all for
about two hundred and twenty dollars for
memory we're going to be using 8
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
now if you guys watch these videos often
you know that I really like to use this
stuff in most of my builds and that's
for a good reason so for one it's fairly
quick clocked at 1600 megahertz which in
my opinion is still the sweet spot for
gaming and with 8 gigs of the staff it's
going to be plenty of memory for all the
gaming and multitasking and whatever
else you want to be doing on your PC and
it's all gonna come in at 70 dollars for
an SSD we're going to be using a 120
gigabyte Samsung 840 Evo drive now I am
a huge fan of SSDs in my opinion they're
one of the best upgrades you can do to a
PC and for a high-end build like this
we've got to include one so that's where
the 840 Evo comes in so this is a new
drive from Samsung that delivers
absolutely awesome performance so a
solid-state drive is always going to be
better than a hard drive and even though
it only does come with 120 gigs of
storage I'll show you guys in a minute
how we're gonna take care of that over
for the SSD it's going to run you about
$110 so they're gonna be worth every
penny of it for a hard drive we're going
to be using a one terabyte Western
Digital caviar plaque now while an SSD
is great for installing windows and
programs and games and that sort of
thing
the problem is they're just simply not
going to be very big so the best way to
do it is to also have an additional hard
drive such as the caviar black so if one
terabyte of storage there's going to be
plenty of room for all the rest of your
stuff including pictures music video and
that sort of thing you can even throw
some games on there if you want as it is
a fairly fast 7200 rpm hard drive anyway
this is gonna run you about $90 for the
power supply we're going to be using a
600 watt corsair CX 600 now power supply
is the literal heart of your build so
this is not a place where you want to
cheap at at all so I'm a big fan of
these Corsair CX series power supplies
as they are very reliable which of
course is incredibly important but they
also do give you plenty of wattage for a
fairly reasonable price so 6
watch should be more than that for this
build as is as well as some additional
upgrades like hard drives fans LEDs all
that kind of stuff it's only gonna run
you about 70 dollars for a case we're
going to be using the Corsair 200 R now
this is a mid tower ATX case that is
very easy to work in so there's plenty
of room to install the motherboard CPU
cooler graphics card all that kind of
fun stuff and it is going to give you
good cooling performance thanks to the
dual included 120 millimeter fans as
well as the USB 3.0 support on the front
panel so all this for $60 is a great
choice for this build so there you go an
awesome $1000 gaming PC build
now if quarters prices are always
changing so I will have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video and I'll also
add some additional links so for example
if you want to do some upgrades like
adding a DVD Drive Wi-Fi adapter more
powerful graphics card that sort of
thing all that will also be in the
description of this video thank you guys
so much for watching if you enjoyed and
you want to see more gaming PC videos
like this I do one every month be sure
to subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date on the latest and
greatest anyway guys I will catch you
