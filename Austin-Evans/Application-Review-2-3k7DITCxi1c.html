watching my second full application
review this one's gonna be a little
different the last one kind of focused
on first-person shooters this one's
gonna be more of just random which is
probably what I'll be doing from now on
okay the first app I'll be reviewing
today is called I love fireworks light
this app is pretty cool I've gotta admit
I've never really checked out a whole
lot of the fireworks applications and
gotta say I'm impressed basically it's
it's real simple
there are about I don't know a cup at
least two more on the app store on that
I know of and I haven't tried those yet
but from what I can see from this one
it's it's pretty impressive basically
what you do is you take your fingers on
the screen and just just drag them up
and let go and basically you get
fireworks it sounds kind of simple it's
pretty simple to do but it's really nice
um you've got some nice graphics
it really pops off the screen you get
some decent music too which is kind of
kind of some oh okay I'm sorry not music
sound effects like fireworks music it's
pretty cool you can there's all kinds of
ways you just take your finger at the
bottom of screen whatever dragged up and
let go and it blows up and you can draw
circles go round and round around do
whatever you want you can use more than
one finger you can use pretty much as
many fingers you can fit on the screen I
like take them on the bottom and drag
them up the top and let go and have a
big bunch if you take if you just tap
you'll have to succumb smaller ones
there's a lot of different features um
especially for a light version it's it's
really cool now I will say in the full
version which is $2 at the moment it's
basically the same thing except there
are more they're more what do you call I
guess the firework animations I'm not
really sure but uh it does it does get
slightly repetitive in the light version
because they're probably only about two
or three and you really don't pick them
I mean all the fires mostly look the
same I mean some of them some one blow
up differently it doesn't look bad or
anything but after a while you have the
same thing I'm like so
full version has a few more animations
and I guess it has I'm not sure has
described it recording um it's hard to
explain basically you just hit record
before you do it and you can record your
entire show and then play as long as you
want then stop it and then you can play
it over again everything and there are
two pre-recorded shows or whatever in
the lite version to kind of show you
what it's like and it's pretty
impressive I mean I was just messing
around with it and I went over there and
looked at those pre-recorded shows them
it's some pretty impressive stuff but
anyway um I love fireworks light is it's
a pretty good app it's it's obviously
it's free it's a light version um I
really don't think the paid versions
that's probably not for me but this
light version is definitely it's fun to
pick up and play it for a little while
um it's got some pretty nice graphics
overall it's a pretty nice package um I
definitely recommend go pick it up check
it out see what you think and if you
like it go for it go for the full
version the second app I'll be reviewing
is it's gonna be a really really simple
basic kind of a kind of a really cool
calming kind of app it's towards the top
of the free app leaderboard right now
it's number 2 or something I'm not
really sure and it's called fluid now
there have been a couple of other apps
they're kind of kind of like this
basically what you do is it's like I
don't know I guess the it's like a pond
or whatever and basically you touch you
touch with you touch the screen and it's
like ripples and everything I think it's
on a koi pond
yeah has i I think it's a boy pond the
really cool thing about this is is that
I mean it's totally basic I mean there's
no menu there's no options basically you
open it up and it's just this I mean
that said it's not I mean it's it's an
entertainment app and in my experience
most of most entertainment apps are
pretty much play it a little while than
you get bored and this one definitely is
the same way it's definitely pretty cool
because you the touch when you
and everything it's pretty realistic the
way the waves and everything move but
it's kind of a little not delayed but it
can kind of get a little off and little
seem just a little weird but it's
definitely pretty cool because you can
take multiple fingers you can tap you
can push and it's kind of weird because
some of the waves kind of go like off
the screen almost as if like you're like
looking at a small part of it and to
come off the screen you can do it and
also admit later some random waves
I guess they come back it's kind of
that's kind of weird part of it but in
general fluid is really just a really
kind of a basic kind of thing but it is
free and I like it
it's fun to try at least couple times I
mean there's no harm and picking it up
real quick it's a small download and
everything I mean it's really simple I
mean you've got all kinds of touch
options and it does look like water and
everything I mean it can be sometimes a
little odd but in general it looks
really really good
I mean I would at least try it I mean I
usually usually any kind of free app I'm
not I'm not I'm not gonna be a big deal
to try it but it's pretty cool um I'd
say go for it try it would you like it
you know keep it if not delete it and no
harm done my last step that I'll be
reviewing today is called trapped undead
infection trap is definitely really cool
game I like it a lot it's a lot like um
a Game Boy dance game which what do you
think it's a dollar and I mean this is
the kind of game that I would probably
gone out just a few years ago and paid
thirty dollars for I think it's pretty
cool um it's kind of like a Resident
Evil style game you've got a lot of uh a
lot of like zombies and there's a virus
that apparently makes them it's it's
it's not really that clear but I mean
they're zombies who cares you're a
you're a scientist your memories wiped
out I don't want to be too spoilers I
mean get into spoilers whatever but
basically you're trying to you end up
trying to figure out what's going on and
that's it like that it's pretty cool
game trap is a nice change in pace from
the majority Python games especially in
the horror genre while it lacks a lot of
the pickup and play style of those other
games it really more than makes up for
it with an actual plot and a really nice
amount of polish that elevated to the
level of a console game easily I mean
like I said the graphics they really do
remind me of a Game Boy dance title
which is nothing to be ashamed of had a
$0.99 I mean that's that's pretty cool
the controls are also kind of similar to
the Game Boy Advance I mean even down to
the on-screen d-pad
and the buttons on the side however was
all nearly well if every single a d-pad
I've tried for the iPhone they just
don't feel right I mean when I feel
honestly d-pad I think you know a
gameboy with real buttons obviously
that's not gonna happen on the iPhone or
iPod Touch but uh still still where as
far as deep ads go I mean there's no
problem I mean you should be able to
walk around just fine the difficulty of
game is actually quite a bit higher than
the average game for iPhone with some
challenging puzzles and some actually
pretty difficult battles with some
zombies that literally sing to me
everywhere um however once you begin
playing you generally will be able to
dance and when you do get stuck and
believe me you will get stuck no big
deal to save there's lots of different
save points no big deal to save shut off
try it later because it does get
complicated there's some really obscure
things you mean you got really really
look everywhere and I mean it's so
definitely very different from the
average iPhone game I mean it but
believe me though when you do get stuck
it's generally something really you know
hiking something you never would have
really thought of but I mean once you
get through it it's usually pretty
smooth sailing for a while until you
find the next hard thing one liner
problems a game and I I'm not gonna
touch on this too much but one minor
problem is a game in my opinion is the
fact that the the play area which I
guess it's kind of hard to see
I guess you just have to really look at
screenshots but the play area there's
like a black border around it now I can
kind of see I mean it looking looking at
it at first when you start playing it
really actually you might not even
notice but uh where the buttons
everything are it's kind of like there's
like a lot of the screen that was just
not used almost now I don't know if they
did not want to do it widescreen I don't
I don't know what the deal was but it
just almost seems a little cheap I mean
I don't know it might just be me but
it's certainly not a deal-breaker um
problems with the difficulty and the
small size of screen they slightly hurt
the game but really it's not that bad I
mean the fact it looks great really nice
man you've got a looks like a flashlight
it's pretty creepy and some really good
some good sound effects and some really
creepy music it's perfect it provides
you with many many hours of play time an
actual plot it makes for a lot of fun
considering for a dollar you have five
six seven eight hour game maybe not
quite that long depending on how long it
takes you to figure everything out
that's pretty impressive for a dollar I
think and there's also a light version
if you think you might like it go ahead
and check it out in the App Store if you
enjoy games like resident evil or just
merely looking for a good console game
for the iPhone this is probably it good
I definitely recommend please check out
the lite version
