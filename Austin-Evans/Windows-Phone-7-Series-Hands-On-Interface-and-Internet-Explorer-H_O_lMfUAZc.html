today I'm here with a hands-on of
Windows Phone 7 Series recently they put
out a ton of new information and
included in that is the full developer's
kit as well as the emulator so today
I'll go ahead and give you guys a quick
walkthrough of the emulator or more
specifically the only app that's
included which is an Internet Explorer
but still though you guys can tell a lot
of really cool features that will be
included in Windows Phone 7 so I'll go
ahead and walk you guys through it and
show you guys what to expect anyway
let's get started ok so to begin with go
ahead and just show you guys a quick
walkthrough so if you look down here on
the left button is the back button it's
pretty much exactly as you think it
functions as a back button for a variety
of different apps it'll exit out of an
app or it coming back up or whatever
pretty much however you want to use it
in the middle you have the windows or
the start button this functions
similarly to a basically to the home
button and an iPhone really basic you
know nothing exciting and on the right
is the search button now the search
button isn't working in this right now
obviously because there's not a whole
lot to search for but when you get the
Windows Phone it will actually go ahead
and allow you to pull up a full search
and allow you to go ahead and search
through your phone and search through
all the kinds of dating app on so look
up here we have Internet Explorer so
let's go ahead and open it up so you see
here it's got a very cool interface
everything flips and turns and it's
pretty cool looking so now that we're
ends at the interface we'll go ahead and
go ahead and show you guys real quick
I'm just three four buttons either on
the bottom but I'll get to those in just
a second let's just go ahead and give
you guys a quick demo of the browser so
we click on it and then we pull up this
keyboard so we know that any website we
want let's go to Google so we just type
it out and of course this is an emulator
so it's not exactly how it will run but
just from what we know from the emulator
really well so go ahead and
autocompletes it so we just go and click
it and open it up you see here the load
is very very snappy and of course if we
want to go ahead and type something on
webpage we just click on the specific
thing so there we go so and as you guys
can see it auto zooms in so now we can
search anything we want so we can search
in gadget so when you punch it in and of
course if you see here right here you
see it actually try to autocomplete your
text old slide to autocomplete slash
spell check which is really really handy
and of course it very nice where it
allows you actually to pick it
everywhere as on iphone and actually go
ahead and just does it for you
so we'll go ahead and just Corsa doesn't
know any gadget so let's go ahead and
click search so just give it just a
second and now go ahead and pulls it up
so let's go ahead and go to any cache
you can show you guys what it looks like
on a full browser or rather a full
website so it does take just a moment to
load but it's really quite snappy
definitely I mean just from my limited
hands-on with this and or just an
emulator but it seems just about as fast
as Internet Explorer 8 on the computer
so I got to be thinking they're doing
something here so it's real simple we go
ahead and scroll by just clicking and
dragging along we can double click go
ahead and zoom in and of course it is
still loading or now so it's just a
little bit slow but you see here guys
there's a lot of it's pretty cool here
there we go so yes you can kind of see
the the web browsing is it's pretty
decent I mean not something hugely ahead
of iPhone obviously we don't have any
kind of multi-touch gestures being that
this is obviously not a full thing is
just the emulator but from what I can
tell so far it looks really solid you
know it looks the browser looks to be
bad on par with the 3GS so let's go
ahead and show you guys some more that
just one just get it to stop loading
real quick so a couple more of the
features are go ahead and open up the
new tab page so now you can load up a
lot of new tabs go ahead and kill them
or you can go ahead and add a new one so
let's go ahead and add a new one now we
just bring us up a new page and of
course we can do every one if we want go
back to the new pad tab page we can
continue to load new tabs that color
however long we like and there's also a
favorites button so it pulled up a
really really cool looking thing
favorites history so we can go through
here and pick whatever we want so you
know you've got Amazon or whatever so
let's go ahead just go ahead and click
on it so right there you might have seen
a little bit of the interface and you
can see how it's very very similar to
the Zune HD and it's a really really
solid interface I like it a lot and you
can see here actually close up really
nice looking back out just like with any
of the other tabs you go ahead so let's
just jump over to our Gibbs motive tab
I'm sorry
Engadget tab time so let's go ahead and
pull up our little drop down menu where
it gives us a few things looking forward
I suppose that's not working right now
I'm guessing that you're going to need
to wait what's the email that you go
ahead and forward it and share fine on
page 10 to start settings split and
click on settings and see what that's
about
so swing the load they've not okay well
it doesn't look like that's working
right now and I don't think Candice
starts going to work either oh wait yes
okay cool I didn't know that so you can
see here guys this would be the home
page obviously that's very very bare
right now but if we want we can go ahead
and pin a website to the home page so if
you want to click on it it will head and
load it up in the browser we have a
bunch of tabs up right now let's go
ahead and kill some of them you see here
it's very very slick looking interface I
mean everything to do has an animation
or something but yeah guys that is a
quick hands-on of the Windows Phone 7
Series
hate the name of the web browser
obviously Internet Explorer now force
isn't an emulator so we haven't actually
tried it out on a real device but from
what we can tell it's very very solid so
I know from what I've seen here in all
the videos Windows Phone 7 Series looks
really really solved
and I can't wait to get a real hands on
actually use it on phone with the full
abs everything built into it hey guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
