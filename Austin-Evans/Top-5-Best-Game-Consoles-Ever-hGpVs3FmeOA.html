last 30 years there have been thousands
of great consoles but today I'm going to
count down the best of the best starting
at number 5 we have the Microsoft Xbox
360 it's easy to forget but the 360
brought a huge change to the way we game
it was the first console to really get
online gaming right with Xbox Live
bringing features like achievements and
a robust friends and matchmaking system
that has since been copied almost
everywhere being able to download games
was also a big plus for the 360 allowing
you to skip buying discs altogether and
play a huge variety of download-only
titles that normally wouldn't have made
it to consoles while most consoles had a
minimal interface or not at all the Xbox
360 allows you to do a lot more than
just throw in a disc and play a game we
take it for granted today but having a
decent UI is a big deal for consoles
since most 360s are connected online
Microsoft was able to completely
overhaul the software several times
adding new features like avatars a web
browser and even apps like Netflix Hulu
and YouTube the early hardware did run
into issues with the red ring of death
caused by overheating but this will sort
it with later versions of the console
which got smaller quieter and added
features like built-in Wi-Fi you also
have to appreciate the controller which
is one of the best ever made and is
still the standard for PCs today if you
compare the graphics to a new console or
PC it might not seem too impressive but
it's easy to forget that the Xbox came
out nearly nine years ago to put it in
perspective both YouTube and the Xbox
360 came out in November of 2005 which
considering that new games are still
being released for the console easily
makes the Xbox 360 one of the best
consoles of all time coming in at number
four is the Nintendo Game Boy back in
1989 Nintendo had the home console
market lockdown with the NES so they
turned their sights on the handheld
console market with the Game Boy
sporting a two and a half inch screen
with a whopping four shades of gray it
might not look too impressive today but
the Game Boy was an enormous success
with well over 100 million sales
worldwide the original Gameboy was
massive but in 1996 they released the
Gameboy pocket a much slimmer and
lighter version that could actually fit
in a pocket
considering how revolutionary the Game
Boy was it's interesting at just how
many compromises the war
since the screen was in fact lit you
pretty much had to find either a bright
window or some kind of light to play
with otherwise you wouldn't be able to
see the screen at all
it was also powered by double-a and
triple-a batteries depending on the
model which gave you anywhere from ten
to thirty hours of gameplay the Gameboy
might not have been the most powerful
but that didn't stop Nintendo from
absolutely dominating handheld gaming
for over 15 years and a big reason why
was the huge game library there were
portable versions of mini console games
like Donkey Kong kirby Zelda Megaman oil
Kombat and of course Mario having Tetris
packed in was a major help to the system
as well however by far the biggest
seller of the entire Gameboy line was
Pokemon launched in 1995 the first
generation of Pokemon games sold over 23
million copies hoping to give the
Gameboy and have longevity to last
nearly 10 years before being replaced
cementing it is the greatest handheld
console of all time number three is the
Sega Genesis the Genesis also known as
the Mega Drive is by far Sega's most
popular console ever competing mainly
with the Super Nintendo this really
helped to start the very first console
war with a 16-bit processor and
high-definition graphics the Genesis
actually did prove to be a fairly
powerful console excellent games like
Sonic showed that the Genesis had enough
power to easily keep up with the SNES
and titles like afterburner weren't too
far off from their arcade releases there
were a variety of add-ons available
including the Sega CD 32x and Nomad
which was a handheld version of the
console none of these were particularly
popular but they all helped to give the
genesis of life well into the next
generation of consoles the controllers
also held up quite well its larger
curved design always felt more
comfortable to me than the Super
Nintendo and later versions added three
more buttons making it even better
one of the most ahead of its time
features was the sega channel the
genesis was among the first consoles to
support downloading titles allow you to
play an entire selection of games for
$15 a month twenty years later even
modern consoles haven't figured this out
making the Sega Genesis truly one of the
best consoles ever for number two we
have the Nintendo Entertainment System
the
is the grandfather of modern video
gaming as the first home console by
Nintendo back in 1985 the video game
industry was almost completely dead with
the market shrinking by 97% in just two
years Nintendo was an enormous part of
bran consoles back to life
the packin game with the NES was Super
Mario and duck hunt introducing Mario is
one of the best platformers and most
influential games of all time Mario
wasn't the only major franchise that got
its consoles start on the NES though
huge series like The Legend of Zelda
Metroid and Mega Man all launched first
on the NES the controller was also a big
improvement while it might not be quite
as organic as an Xbox gamepad compared
with some of the other controllers of
the time this was a major step forward
when you step back and consider that the
video game industry nearly died in the
80s a huge reason why we still have
consoles today is thanks to the NES and
finally number one we have the Sony
Playstation 2 155 million that's how
many ps2 Sony sold making it easily the
most popular console of all time ending
its production run just last year a few
months before the ps4 launched the
PlayStation 2 had one of the longest
lifespans of any console at 13 years one
thing that's easy to overlook is just
how many things the ps2 did right it
brought full backwards compatibility
with the original PlayStation even
including the memory cards and
controllers and played a huge part in
helping to popularize DVDs how long you
do more than just game on your console
it also had USB ports which made games
like Guitar Hero possible you could
install a hard drive and then even had
to output for some games years before
the Xbox 360 and ps3 introduced HD
gaming the original fat ps2 was
succeeded by a much slimmer option in
2004 which remains to this day one of
the smallest consoles ever and brought
upgrades like a built-in Ethernet port
with games like grand theft auto san
andreas God of War and Shadow of the
Colossus the ps2 might not have been as
powerful as the Xbox but the library was
nothing short of excellent sailing the
ps2 is one of the best consoles of all
time so what's your favorite video game
