a cydia tweak called gridlock so
gridlock is a very simple tweak and
basically what allows you to do is
rearrange your home screen however you
like you put icons literally wherever
you want so before let's say I'm
creating or setting up one of those
really complicated things winterboard
themes so let's say I need to have an
icon here and here and I need to have
two blank spaces here well ordinarily
you just take you have to go down with I
blanks go ahead and make two I blanks
put them in there and then go ahead and
do it however using gridlock you don't
you can totally skip that so let's say
I'm go ahead and grab maps I want maps
oops I want maps here I want itunes here
photos here and I want probes I want
productivity here there we go so guys
that's pretty much the entire tweak and
in that she'll it allows you to take
your icons put them anywhere you want
you make as many blank spaces as you
want so maybe I want a home screen with
four in the middle and nothing else
whatever you want to do you can do it
very simply without having messing with
I blanks not kind of stuff anyway guys
so if you're interested you can go ahead
and pick this up in cydia for 99 cents I
can definitely see a lot of uses for
this in the future as far as setting up
themes creating really just customizing
the look without having to mess with I
blanks for a couple hours anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
