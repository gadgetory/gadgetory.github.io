walking for new products now the first
of which is the amazon kindle fire now
this is the long-awaited amazon tablet
and as you would expect it is a proper
tablet so no more egg displays like on
the previous Kendall's so of course you
will find a 7-inch full-color full
touchscreen display but as far as the
hardware goes it's actually really quite
similar to the blackberry playbook and
that similar T goes more than skin-deep
as of course inside internal you will
find some similar specs including a
dual-core processor I know I'm a big fan
of dual core processor all I think that
it's pretty much a necessity for tablets
you really need that extra power to be
able to handle all the video and
multitasking all the kinds of stuff that
you do want to do on a tablet and as far
as the software it goes it is running a
heavily customized version of Android so
all I didn't really name a particular
build of android most likely 2.1 or 2.2
it's been totally redesigned from the
ground up for the kindle so don't expect
to be able to pull up your standard
android menus or anything like that
whoever it will be able to use android
applications via the amp amazon appstore
on top of that it will also be able to
use all the other amazon services of
course the kindle ereader you'll be able
to use Amazon Cloud music and the list
goes on and on on but it's going to be a
full tablet the real kicker though is
the price the Amazon Kindle Fire will be
available from only 199 dollars well
sure it's going to be missing out a
couple of features for example cameras
microphones that kind of thing however
on the whole of it all the major specs
you know the process of the screen all
the real stuff that you're going to be
interacting with on a day-to-day basis
all that stuff is top-notch and for 199
dollars this thing I don't you have to
say to you guys it's going to just sell
like crazy you guys interested you can
pre-order it starting today and will be
available sometime later November moving
on to the slightly less exciting
announcements amazon did unveil the
kindle touch and the kindle touch 3g now
over all these aren't entirely change
they still do have an e-ink display over
they do ditch the keyboard in favor of a
new touchscreen now of course overall
they're not going to be something
revolutionary thing if you want really a
tablet whatever the kindle fire is going
to be the way to go over if you are
interested in kendall you really like
the e-ink display the kindle touch as
well as the kindle touch 3g you're going
to be pretty solid so as part of the
pricing which is really where these pick
up the kindle touch will be available
for ninety-nine dollars
pretty good price for tablet or rather a
ereader at all these tablets on the
brain I hope that will be with their
special offers aka the ads on the home
screen and that kind of thing so the
final price for if you don't want the
ads probably a little bit more however I
don't think it'll be too bad the kindle
touch 3g of course the same model with
the 3g capabilities we available for a
one hundred fifty dollars i know where
this really picks up is with the 3g data
it does come with of course full
unlimited access to 3g and that is going
to be worldwide as well for the entire
lifetime of the kendall now that's not
bad so if you do a lot of traveling and
that kind of stuff for an extra fifty
dollars to get unlimited data I think
that's not too bad both of these tablets
are of course going to be available for
pre-order today i'll be shipping again
the late november lastly we have the
cheapest kindle ever now this one is
going to be available for seventy nine
dollars and it's going to be kind of a
hybrid between these Kindle Touch and
the kindle three that we have today so
it does not have a touchscreen however
it does have a few extra buttons
although no keyboard now this one is not
going to be quite as powerful it won't
have some of the cool features from the
kindle touch however if you're just
looking for a bare-bones ereader for $79
it's going to be out real steel i know
this one is also available for pre-order
today however it's going to be shipping
today as well so if you want one of
these you can get your hands on one
probably in the next couple days anyway
guys it's going to be about it for the
amazon announcements of this morning
overall the amazon kindle just the
standard one is okay i think what it's
really going to be is a kindle touch i
think that's going to be great if you're
looking for an e display which is does
have a lot of benefits for reading
however i think the big announcement
today was the kindle fire this is going
to be revolutionary tablet i know you
hear that a lot but that price point is
really what does it I mean there's five
hundred dollar tablet the ipad and four
hundred dollars everything that's great
but all i need to do is look at the HP
TouchPad it went it was just absolutely
insane when it hit a hundred dollars
people were just going over like crazy
now of course 200 hours is more
expensive however i think it's going to
be a huge huge seller so if you guys are
interested in one i would highly
recommend pre order yours today soon as
a pre-order page will be available I'll
put it in link in the description I'm
definitely going to be pre-ordering 9 so
yeah anyway guys it's going to be about
it if you enjoyed the video definitely
be sure to leave a thumbs up and if
you're interested in full reviews of the
