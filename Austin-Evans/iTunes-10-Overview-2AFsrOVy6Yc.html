overview of itunes 10 so in itunes 10
that would there's a lot of talk about
it today at the apple conference they
were talking a lot about paying as well
as some other improvements the way give
you guys an overview but before we begin
anything I just really just sometimes
really quickly it's pretty much the same
itunes now as you guys can see they use
a different font which looks really
quite nice um it's a little bit
different as you see here at the bottom
is a little bit more streamlined so as
the top so they've made a few minor
changes but all in all I'd say it's 93%
93 I don't that's kind of in but i would
say it was very very similar to how it
is how it was itunes nine was i'ma go
ahead and to show you some of the new
features as well as ping so obviously as
you can see here there's a new view so
you know you can click through all these
different views this one's actually a
hybrid view so actually you can see
album artwork and it looks much better
as you can see here like some of the
here some of these other songs that does
not have album artwork you can see it
doesn't look quite so nice so as you can
see here the with albemarle road kind of
thing it looks really quite nice you
know but still just pretty much like
itunes and we can go ahead and go
through movies not cut stuff like for
example apps one thing is that you guys
can see here it really finally works now
i'm sure most of you guys know that
itunes used to be really laggy as far as
looking at this you had to wait for each
individual image well no longer it
actually is really pretty snappy and now
pretty much that's all the main things
like I said guys there's not a whole lot
knew what the main thing new is ping so
ping is well it's really similar to
Facebook and what I said I mean it's
very very similar to a focus down
version of Facebook I'm so basically
here it is all right once you do it you
can go ahead and set up everything it's
not that big a deal to go ahead and set
up basically you can go ahead and just
you know tell a little about yourself
etc and basically can go ahead and
follow people and really right now
there's not there's really nothing here
basically they will say as you see here
on the bottom right there's like people
that they recommend that you follow
normal people stuff like that so you see
here there's a lot of celebrities such
as you know Lady Gaga etc etc so I just
pick somebody random cold pledges to
show you it looks like so we can go
ahead and not take a look at pictures so
we won't go ahead and just take a look
at this so you can see actually opens up
kind of nicely you can go ahead and do
video
as well and just opens up in a little
window and pretty much it's you know
it's pretty decent now of course like if
you want go ahead and put a comment so
we like yeah you know use whatever I
mean you can post whatever comments you
like it's pretty simple now one thing I
will mention about ping is it like i
said it's really it's kind of
underwhelming right now because there's
not a whole lot to do and there's it
would be nice they had a tutorial to
kind of explain because really it's it's
not it's just kind of confusing right
now I mean you just look around here and
you just there's not a whole lot to do
okay guys that's pretty much it for my
itunes 10 review or on our review but
it's just an overview there's really not
a whole lot new basically the summed up
it's a little bit faster it doesn't seem
to be working a little bit better and
this new music view I like it I mean you
know it's nothing amazing but it works
pretty well and well I think itunes 10
is finally taking a little bit step
towards you know being a little bit more
usable not so laggy and so glitchy know
I've got stuff but anyway guys if you're
interested you can go ahead and check it
out i have a link in the description to
go ahead and download it and now would
you say really quickly at the time of
this recording there's a few server
issues so if you're not able to download
just refresh the page a couple times and
it should pop up so you know just kind
of just a little bit of warning there
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
