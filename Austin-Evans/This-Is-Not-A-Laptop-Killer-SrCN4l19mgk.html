big upgrade but as much as Apple Mike
claims this is a full computer it is not
ready to replace my laptop just yet this
is a question I took a look at a couple
years ago when the very first iPad pro
came out and it actually came pretty
close to replacing a laptop for me but
inevitably I ran into the limitations of
running iOS on a nine point seven inch
tablet first of all this is coming from
the perspective of someone who spends a
lot of time with some fairly high-grade
video the iPad it just can't handle it
it's not even the hardware that's the
problem
it really is iOS sure there are some
decent editing apps such as I movie
premiere rush and luma fusion for the
iPad but the issue is that none of them
are as powerful as the full desktop
versions of premiere as well as final
kinds to produce videos like this I need
access to fairly high level features
such as LUT support full pro codecs such
as Pro res and red code raw it would be
really helpful if I had a full finder
set up where I can you know access the
file system and import things using that
handy USB C port instead well none of
this stuff really works unless I want to
do some very basic editing and iMovie
it's fine it's definitely capable of it
but I was just isn't there yet a lot of
what I do every day comes down to things
like writing an email and here the iPad
is absolutely terrific I've always
preferred the smaller iPad pro size but
that does mean you have to sacrifice it
on the actual keyboard it's a little bit
smaller than a standard layout but I'd
be using it for long enough that's not
really a big issue it is still a little
bit ridiculous this accessory that is
basically mandatory if I want to get any
work done on iPad cost a full 180
dollars but I mean I guess that's
everyone at this point I mean even
Microsoft doesn't include the keyboard
with the surface if you want to avoid
the Apple tax you can't pick up either a
Bluetooth keyboard or something that
plugs in via USB C or an adapter but at
the end of the day I want to have a
portable setup that is as close to a
laptop as possible which means them
stuck spending $180 on the Apple
keyboard which is just okay but not
really worth that kind of money
something I've been kind of surprised by
is the pencil updated this year with a
much less annoying design as opposed to
plugging it into the Lightning port to
charge instead all you need to do is
attach it to the top of the iPad and not
only does it attach here magnetically
but also wirelessly charges I will give
Apple this the iPad hardware is
incredibly nice this is seriously the
biggest update to the iPad since the
original thanks to the lack of a home
button the bezels are much smaller here
which means that
do we have a bunch of iPhone 10 like
gestures but importantly we get an 11
inch display in the same size chassis is
the old nine point seven inch iPad the
fingerprint sensor has been replaced
with face ID which has been crammed into
the top bezel along with the
front-facing camera it should be no
surprise that the screen is absolutely
excellent importantly we still pro
motion which means that the iPad pro has
a full 120 Hertz display this means that
the iPad screen is running at twice the
frame rate and twice the smoothness of
pretty much any other mobile display out
there the only thing that comes close or
some gaming laptops that do have high
refresh rate displays as well as on the
phone side the razor phone has a high
refresh rate panel but in the tablet
space nothing touches this and it does
make a big difference
things are so so smooth the screen is
absolutely terrific so not only is it
color accurate it gets fairly bright
there's really not a lot to complain
about and that goes double for the
speaker's it does have quad speakers
with one on each corner and this thing
sounds phenomenal as far as watching
video goes this is better than almost
any other laptop out there gone are the
days of lightening in is the glorious
future of the USBC port and this is
proper USB see it's 3.1 gen2 which means
that does support a full tanking a
better transfer speed as well as of
course any kind of video out you do all
the way up to a full 5k monitor it will
also charge up other devices just like a
laptop plug in your phone for example
and the ipad will give it a full charge
in classic ipad fashion however iOS does
hold you back somewhat with that USB C
port then you can't connect it to an
external display and for some apps such
as twitch and Netflix it will give you a
full screen video but for the most part
you're stuck mirroring the iPad display
kind of helpful but nowhere near as good
as it would be if I can you know put a
window on the display and another window
on my iPad you know like every other
laptop on earth it's so close but it's
so annoying I mean this is really close
to being able to fully serve as a laptop
right I mean for me I'll have a monitor
plugged into my laptop all the time when
I'm at home or at work I legitimately
like that extra screen real estate and
the hardware is absolutely capable of it
and even the software's to a degree I
mean I could put a video there but the
issue is that if I'm say watching
Netflix and wanting to work on something
at the same time Netflix will play on
the 4k display ripen to the point where
I alt add to another app in which the
entire thing closes it's like we're so
close we're so close if we take a quick
detour into garbage Tom for a sec I get
the
I'll remove the headphone jack on their
phones a couple years ago but this is a
device that's trying to replace my
laptop I really do like having a pair of
Wired headphones now sure Bluetooth
might be the future for some people but
for me I appreciate having a nice pair
of headphones that have no latency
something that can plug into say a
MacBook Air which coincidentally does
still have a headphone jack
now I get that this thing is completely
packed with technology it's like magnets
and batteries and stuff but having a
headphone jack doesn't seem like that
big of a sacrifice I mean sure I could
use a USBC dongle
but that's annoying I could plug in my
lightning headphones that I bought a
couple years ago oh wait no I can't do
that because it doesn't have lightning
anymore it's just a weird compromise I
mean it's not a deal breaker I can get
away with using other types of
headphones it would be so so nice if
they would have kept the headphone jack
on something that's trying to replace my
laptop I could run through our standard
suite of benchmarks which show that this
is hands-down Alli the fastest mobile
device we've ever tested but right up
there with a lot of proper laptops but
at the end of the day what good is power
if you can't use it which brings us
around to my main issue with the iPad
pro this is where things become very
dependent on what kind of work you do I
legitimately feel like I could edit some
proper 4k video on the iPad pro if I had
those software improvements such as a
full file manager as well as final kind
if you do a lot of work with graphics
for example it actually is a lot better
there great apps such as procreate and
full Photoshop is coming to the iPad but
still for a lot of people the story here
is less about what it can do right now
and more about the potential which is
kind of a bit of a shame because it's
been like that for several years at this
point that's just it though this
absolutely can replace a laptop for some
people and the iPad pro is legitimately
getting better and more powerful every
year but for me this is a great
secondary machine but it is not a laptop
killer at least not yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
