here with the tutorial on how to replace
the battery and a Game Boy or Game Boy
Color game Game Boy games use volatile
memory for saving your game which
requires a battery for power this works
fine for a long time over most Game Boy
games are over ten years old now and the
internal batteries have died causing you
to lose any save data and the ability to
save your games luckily it's an easy fix
that should only take you a few minutes
to get your game working again
you will need a few things to get
started to do it properly you'll need a
three point eight millimeter security
bit and driver a soldering iron a tad
cr2025 battery along with some fresh
solder some desoldering wick is also
helpful in removing the old solder there
are ways to cut a few corners but if you
spend a little money it's much easier
and quicker especially for fixing
multiple games so I'll have links to all
the items I used in the description of
this video to start grab your game and
flip it over using a driver with the
security bit unscrew the single screw on
the back and set it somewhere safe now
slide the front half of the cartridge
towards you and then lift it up and set
it aside then gently lift the board out
of the casing now grab your soldering
iron place it on stand and plug it into
the outlet it will take a few minutes to
heat up so be patient you also need to
be very careful soldering irons get
extremely hot and will easily burn if
knocked or used carelessly wearing
gloves and eye protection probably isn't
a bad idea as is working on a hard flat
surface like a workbench and being in a
well-ventilated area what you're going
to do is desolder the two connections
holding the battery to the board if you
have any disorder inguk use a small
amount over the solder and place the
flat of the iron on top depending on the
quality of your iron you may take a
minute but once the existing solder is
melted do the same for the other side
and then remove the old battery using
your iron to loosen any remaining solder
as needed now take your new battery and
align the tabs as you see here which
would be the same way the old battery
came out grab a small bit of fresh
solder and hold your iron over it until
it melts over the contact while I'm sure
a lot of you can do a better job at
soldering than I did the important thing
is to make sure you get enough solder to
completely cover the contact so the
battery doesn't go anywhere once one
side is done just do the same on the
other and you're good to go
by now the board is likely very hot so
unplug your iron and let both cool for a
few minutes then just slide the board
into the cartridge and screw back
together give your game a shot and enjoy
being able to save again if you enjoyed
