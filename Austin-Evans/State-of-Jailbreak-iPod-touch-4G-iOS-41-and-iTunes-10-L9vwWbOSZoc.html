another state of jailbreak video so
after yesterday's apple conference
there's a lot of new stuff and there's a
lot of new questions I'm sure you guys
are wondering about so let me go ahead
and do my best to clear you guys up so
gonna be talking about three things
today when you be talking about itunes
10 going to be talking about the
upcoming iOS 4.1 update for the iphone
and ipod touch as well as i'm going to
go ahead and talk about the ipod touch
4th generation and whether or not it
will be jailbreakable so first let's
widen start with the easiest itunes 10
I've had a ton of messages last night
since it came out everybody asking is it
safe for if you're a jailbreaker to go
ahead and update the answer is yes I'm
jailbroken it works no problem
everybody's tested it there's no
differences as far as you know it's not
going to mess you up if you go ahead and
update to itunes 10 with a jailbroken
device so if you're worrying about that
don't go ahead feel free to update to
itunes 10 it was not going to cause you
any problems at all now the next part
has to do with iOS 4.1 now this one's
actually a little bit more complicated
basically this kind of sum it up 4.1
will be out next week for the iphone and
ipod touch and as always with any update
do not update to it if you're jailbroken
because you will put out fail lose your
jailbreak now main question about 4.1
because there are some really nice
features there is whether or not you
actually will be able to going ahead and
jailbreak it anytime soon well I
actually cannot say there's not there's
no actual jailbreak that's ready for it
because it's not out yet however it does
seem like the jailbreak developers and
of course this is just from what I've
heard I don't know this for 100 in fact
but it does look like the jailbreak
developers do have an exploit all set of
4 4.1 so it probably will not be all
that long once it comes out ahead and
jailbreak but as always with any yet
they do not update it to it until you
know everyone gets all clear the new
version of water jailbreak maybe it's
jailbreakme redsnow snowbreeze whatever
it is like that whatever the name of the
new jailbreak is go ahead just wait
until it is updated 4 4.1 but it does
look like I don't as far as I know
there's nothing in 4.1 that will make it
really all that more difficult to
jailbreak it's just going to be looking
for another hole so it shouldn't be that
big a deal on lastly we'll go ahead and
really quickly talk about the ipod touch
4th generation again now tons of tons
and tons of
mensen questions asking what can I
jailbird ipod touch 4th generation guys
I'm just gonna say it straight up I see
no reason why you wouldn't be able to
now obviously it's not out yet so we
don't know for sure you know there
always there's a chance that I you know
Apple might you know change something
that would cause jailbreaking to be a
more difficult however every single ipod
iphone and ipad has already been
jailbroken and i just have to really
repeat that the jailbreak developers are
fantastic they know what they're doing
and they find holes and pretty much
anything and they're able to crack it
now we'll say it might take a little
while for example the iphone forchick a
little while even ipod touch 2nd and 3rd
generation they did take a couple months
to jailbreak so you know it might not it
probably will not be out immediately but
i would really be surprised if we never
ever see a jailbreak for the ipod touch
4th generation so if that was a concern
of yours yes you might have to wait a
month to month sweater like that but it
should be coming eventually saw it's
just not that big a deal I don't think
anyway guys hopefully that cleared up
some of your questions about
jailbreaking and as always if you're

date with all the new jailbreak so as
soon as the new job or it comes out it
