taking a look at budget graphics cards
are they even worth it to test I rounded
up six cards under $120 and ran them
through a few games and benchmarks to
see how things stand at $70 we've got
the Nvidia GT 630 and AMD r7 240 both
sporting two gigabytes of slower ddr3
memory move up to the $90 bracket and
you're looking at an Nvidia GT 640 along
with the A&amp;amp;D r7 250 this time with 1
gigabyte of gddr5 each finally at $120
you're choosing between the nvidia gtx
750 and A&amp;amp;D r7 260x with the 750 only
sporting one gig of ram where the 260x
has two for testing I use the Mays on
set up on a test bench you can check out
that video for the full details but the
basics include a core i3 4130 a
gigabytes of RAM and a 250 gigabyte
Samsung 840 Evo SSD to put things in
perspective I also include the
integrated HD 4400 graphics on the core
i3 so if you decide to completely skip
buying a graphics card altogether you
get a little bit of an idea of what you
can expect as far as the performance
goes first off we have the fire stripe
benchmark inside 3d Mart which can be
punishing even on high-end hardware
immediately you'll be able to see that
the extra $50 over the lower end cards
pays off as the 260 X is over three
times as powerful here next we've got
battlefield 4 a game that looks
impressive across everything from
consoles to $3,000 pcs as the title it's
very nice 2 cards that happen to be red
you'll see the AAB side wins easily here
although again there's a massive
difference as you spend just a little
bit more Codemasters is one of the few
companies who do racing games right and
grid 2 is a great example here the
Maxwell base GTX 750 does much better
delivering over 90 FPS and soundly
beating the rest of the group while it
might be a little while before we see a
new Bioshock game infinite really
delivered easily being one of the best
games of last year here we see the 260 X
and 750 much closer with none of the
cards really playable on this setting in
the integrate HD 4400 graphics didn't
even want to run one of the best stealth
games I've played in a while
Metro last light definitely doesn't
skimp in the graphics department either
again
750 barely edges out the 260x and the r7
250 is the only other card able to keep
above 30 frames per second with the rest
way back in the teens and 20s while
gaming performance is very important
when you go out to buy a new graphics
card the amount of power requires can
also be sometimes a big factor here the
Intel HD 4400 in the core i3 easily wins
with the rest keeping things between 70
and 100 watts or so as the only graphics
card that needs external power the
system with a 260x pulls in a still
reasonable 133 watts under load so if
you're putting together a budget gaming
PC what should you go with
now while the integrated Intel graphics
are fine for most things when it comes
to gaming they'd really just don't cut
it if you want to get a dedicated card
as cheaply as possible the r7 240 isn't
a bad choice as it doesn't require much
power and can play most games fine as
long as you bump the settings down a bit
as far as the GT 640 and r7 250 go it's
a bit of a harder sell sure they're a
bit faster however for just a little bit
more you can get much more performance
this graph sums it up well I think the
difference between paying 70 and 120
dollars means you'll be getting nearly
three times as much performance letting
you play games at 1080p at reasonable
settings between the 260x
and the 750 however is a much harder
choice the r7 260x gives you twice as
much memory which is only going to get
more important as time goes on and you
also get support for both mantle and
true audio built-in on the other hand
with the GTX 750 you're getting a slight
bit more performance and significantly
less power which is nice especially if
you don't have a spare 6 pin lead from
your power supply the final choice is up
to your particular build however I think
the biggest thing to take away from this
video is to try to avoid super cheap
graphics cards if you spend just a bit
more you're going to be getting a lot
more for your money so what do you guys
think if you were building a budget
gaming PC what would you use let me know
in the comments below anyway I won't let
you guys know that actually recently
switched over to a new Facebook page so
it's now facebook.com slash Austin not
Duncan so of course they do lots of
behind the scenes stuff post videos that
kind of stuff so you guys might check it
out the link will be in the description
of this video anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
