edition of d3 live so the apple
conference the back to mac event just
finished up an apple did announce quite
a few new things so let's go ahead just
jump straight on into it so the first
thing they announced was i live 2011 so
this newest I life is a pretty
substantial upgrade from the previous
version so one of the major things that
it does bring is a new iphoto app so I
photo of course it was no slouch before
however it definitely does look quite a
bit improved with several new features
including really nice-looking slideshows
I mean very very slight very very
impressive something you'd expect out of
apple from iPhoto I'm also alleged go
ahead and email your photos just
straight from inside I photo I'm go
ahead and put it up on facebook as well
as it also go ahead and allows you to go
ahead and put them into books so
basically an iphone you take your
pictures you almost make virtual
scrapbooks and go ahead and put them all
up in iPhoto so it's definitely a pretty
cool feature I'm moving on which is
something I kind of was impressed about
was I movie now I movie is also a bit
update somewhat there's some interesting
things about the sound you can now edit
sound a little bit better however the
definitely the start of the show in my
opinion was the movie trailer mode so
now in iMovie can go ahead and make
movie trailers it basically go ahead has
a lot of really cool music specifically
for the movie trailer mode then
basically will say is just ask you some
basic information about you know who's
in the trailer what kind of trailer you
want and they'll basically say okay get
a clip of this person that person this
person ask person it will do really cool
effects and everything and make it look
like a trailer um so I was really
impressed with that so the last thing
new in I life was definitely going to be
grojband so again GarageBand wasn't a
huge update however there were a few
things such as new tutorials for
beginners so I actually go ahead and
they will teach you you know how to play
different instruments and after you play
them it will go ahead and analyze your
performance say hey you messed up here
messed up there they'll also win and
sync your music a little bit better so
you know if you're if you're in a band
playing and you know your little add a
sink it will go ahead and actually put
together for you I'm staying two guys
that's my first look on my life
will be available very good actually
today for snow leopard for fifty dollars
and of course all new mex will get it
for free so I life pretty nice update so
now the biggest thing of course is going
to be OS 10.7 lion so of course this was
also announced today and really it i
think the enticing boils down to it is
now 00 s10 is really merging with iOS so
some of the new things in line are
included it's going to have an app store
so you actually can go ahead actually I
believe it's within about 90 days or so
on you'll be able to download an
application called app store or whatever
they're going to exactly call it but
basically you will be able to download
the mac app store on to your snow
leopard device and of course it will
come pre-installed in lion on the whole
life's go ahead and buy apps in a very
similar settings it actually looks a lot
like iTunes as far as how you buy the
apps I mean go ahead and just download
them to your computer pretty much the
same way you do it with an iOS you know
you can go ahead and update them all
that kind of stuff and they are of
course going to be specific applications
but of course it goes farther than that
a lot of the improvements in line have
to do with iOS so there's actually a new
several different new mode that very
pretty much just emulating of the ipad
on your Mac so there's a mode that
allows you to go ahead and put all your
icons up there's even folders you can
now put all your icons and folders
identical to iOS it's really like
basically lying in my opinion looks like
they're pretty much putting an iOS skin
over it I know a lot of these apps are
multi touch however they're not they're
not talking about multi touches and on
your screen so you're not going to reach
over to your laptop start pinching and
zooming and stuff like that well they
mean for these apps is more of like you
know using you either your magic mouse
or your magic trackpad I think it
remains to be seen how exactly well
that's going to work you know with some
of these more in-depth applications
whatever definitely line does look
pretty decent and it should be out
sometime summer 2011 so doesn't look
forward to a lot more new things between
now and then so the last thing I want to
talk about is definitely the thing that
I was most excited about and of course
everybody that check was pretty excited
about it as well which is the new
macbook air so the new macbook air is
very very nice looking so to start out
with it is extremely thin
even thinner than its predecessor and
thickness is about point six or point
seven inches i don't remember exactly
how much it is but it's very extended
its thickest point and it goes all the
way down to 0 point 11 inches as this
point so of course these are very very
very thin laptops I know some of the
other things is that they're actually
going to be coming in two varieties so
it's going to be an 11.6 inch variety as
well as a 13.3 inch all right now so
this is really cool um you know you
actually go ahead and get two different
sizes now the one thing I wasn't really
all that impressed about was the
processors they both come with core two
duos and the 11 inch has a 1.4 well as I
believe they want with a 13-inch Friday
has a 1.6 so they're really neither
processor is going to be you know a real
powerhouse however and they do have a
fairly capable nvidia GPU would you like
to do for some mild so you know maybe
sort of decent graphics as far as gaming
is concerned now these netbooks are
available today and they start at nine
hundred ninety nine dollars which of
course that makes it the new cheapest
macbook tied with these standard macbook
so personally I am very very impressed
with the new MacBook Airs the design is
second to none I think it's probably the
best-looking laptop I've ever seen my
entire life they're so thin they're so
beautiful and of course you know the
fact that they're actually pretty decent
first Mexico think is really great news
so you can go ahead and pick yours out
of course the 11.6 inch one is the one
that starts on 999 on the duo hot flash
memory so depending on how much more
memory you want and whether which
decides you want I will go ahead and go
up to considerably so you go ahead and
just mix and match whatever you want so
guys that's it for my wrap-up of the
back to mac event overall is pretty
impressed you know my life looks pretty
decent um lion is okay i'm not really a
huge fan of how they're porting over a
lot of the iOS stuff but i think is
pretty decent but i really was impressed
with the macbook air i think it looks
really great inspecting here you can go
ahead and buy one today it's definitely
really cool so anyway guys thanks for
