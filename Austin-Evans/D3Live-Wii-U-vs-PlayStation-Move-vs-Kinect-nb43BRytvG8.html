episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about how it's hard to
think and talk at the same time I'm just
kidding you're just talking about some
of the bloopers of course we're going to
be talking about the Nintendo Wii U
against the Xbox 360 Kinect as well as
the PlayStation Move all these new
next-generation motion and non Xbox
Playstation controllers all the kind of
new stuff so of course or if you guys
missed it earlier this week at e3
Nintendo rather unveiled their brand-new
Wii U um they really didn't talk about
the console much pretty much it was all
based on the controller and of course
Nintendo that's what the Wii was all
about was that new controller that
motion control you get to go and Bowl
and do all kinds of fun stuff so of
course everyone was really keeping their
hopes up for the Wii U and I'm gonna say
it's innovative I don't think anybody
can you know knock Nintendo for not
being innovative it's a really
interesting looking controller it's got
some pros and cons so go ahead go over
some of those and again I could try to
get you guys at least a little bit of a
comparison between the other all three
rather so the first thing about the Wii
U is of course gotta be the screen now
it's a pretty large screen um in my
opinion I think they probably could have
made the screen a little bit smaller
without it being a big deal but you know
that's kind of it besides the point of
course you do have a screen and one of
the really cool things about that is
that you can play games on the
controller rather than using your TV now
that's probably the number one thing
about the we view that's really gonna
set it apart from other people so of
course you know you know like if you
guys saw they had a commercial or like a
like a demo of it they're chewing like
somebody comes in like steals the TV
from you of course you know if you're
playing video games people always do
that and of course all you need to do is
just continue playing on the controller
TV that you don't even need to have a TV
on or you might not even ever need a TV
in general so that's one of the big
things about the Wii U's of course you
can have that screen or it's got also
gonna be nice for inventory and whatnot
of course it does have some other things
such as it allows you to do video chat
there's some pretty cool things as far
as like sending content over to your TV
but on the other hand though one of the
big things about it that I'm not really
hugely excited for is the fact that
there are basically abandoning motion
control so if you think about it of
course it does have some motion controls
but there's a very different thing
between being
able to do games with two separate
motion controls you know where it's an
attraction everything as opposed to one
really large one you can't use one hand
you can't hold that huge thing up with
one hand that just be awkward so
basically you're limited from being able
to do stuff like this to being able to
like this and well I'm not saying that's
necessarily gonna be bad I think that
it's definitely taking a kind of a
reverse angle from where the Wii was so
how that's gonna relate I've definitely
remains to be seen but there are
definitely some pros and cons about the
Wii U controller then moving on to the
stuff that we've actually used since
supports that we use pretty new not a
whole lot of people got their hands on
it but of course since the PlayStation
Move in Kinect already I can go ahead
and talk a little bit more freely and
you guys some of my hands-on impressions
of that so first thing is is the move
now I'll be honest when the move came
out I thought that was just gonna be the
Wii Remote I mean it looks and works
very similarly and in fact it does have
a lot of the same characteristics of
course there's a main controller and
there's a sub controller you can use you
know all that kind of stuff hopefully
you guys know about the PlayStation Move
but where the move really separates
itself from everywhere else is in the
hard core game so when I again when I
first saw it I was really afraid - all
we're gonna be doing is just seeing the
Wii HD we're gonna see some kind of fun
cool looking games but nothing really
you know for the hardcore audience that
loves the PlayStation 3 well if you guys
take a look at some of the cool games
that have come out for example the
number one thing that I love is Killzone
3 there are some really innovative stuff
so and on top of the 3d which looks
pretty decent
of course you do have the the
sharpshooter I mean I totally forget the
name of course there's a gun attachment
where you can just slide the move in
there and kind of use it and that's
something that's really innovative and
really unique now it's not going to work
perfectly I've definitely tried to add a
lot of time with that CES and I loved it
but it doesn't work perfectly but it
just really gives something innovative
is you can't actually use a real like
light gun style you know really
accessory on the other platforms as well
and so that's one of the number one
things about the moves that I liked now
moving away from that you of course we
do have the Kinect and the Kinect is
kind of the wild card you know the
Kinect there's no controller and that's
one of their big tag lines you are the
controller and there's a lot of good
stuff about that but again there are
some stuff that I'm not super excited
about so of course with the Kinect you
know there's all kinds of cool stuff
since a trex your body in real time
so you know you can like push the balls
on the screen and that yeah you can do
all kinds of stuff and use your body as
a controller and all kinds of stuff like
that and there's some cool stuff however
one of the biggest things they were
Microsoft's was pushing an e3 this year
was the voice commands so of course you
know you can talk into it and say Xbox
play next song things like that but
they're also expanding that into games
so for example they showed Mass Effect
where you can go tell your squad to go
this way or that way where and use voice
commands well I really like that and I
think that's interesting I kind of
questioned the need to buy $130 camera
basically to use audio controls when we
shouldn't the Xbox be able to do that in
general so kind of not sure about how
that's gonna work but I definitely say
that there's no doubt that all three of
these are unique they do have all of
their own and you know strengths and
weaknesses about them ok guys so for the
second segment of d3 live I will be
taking live questions from everyone in
the chat as always every episode of d3
life is filmed in front of a live
audience we've got quite a few people in
here who are going through some
technical difficulties so go ahead and
try to answer a few questions alright um
so do I think the PS Vita will have a
terrible launch in terms of games like
the 3ds well if you guys are not don't
know about the PS Vita I'm absolutely
loving it I love the power I love the
price I love a lot about it and while
it's definitely a possibility I don't
think that Sony's gonna make that same
mistake I mean the 3ds I would have
bought one day one if they would have
had some good games but honestly like I
was like gonna go get one I look over
like there's literally not one game I
want to buy so I didn't get one I just
don't have one and I think that's a big
problem I mean if you launch a big new
system it had better to have some good
games so well I don't know I don't know
of any games they're actually gonna be
out they haven't announced it yet I
would certainly hope that Sony's not
gonna make that same mistake
well the Wii U have apps for the
controller yes see that's one thing that
I think a lot of people don't understand
is that while Nintendo did show off the
Wii U at e3 they shut off the controller
they didn't show off much of anything
for the console and say how powerful it
was really they showed some tech demos
but most of those weren't even from the
Wii U and then a lot of stuff was just
like we don't know how the interface is
gonna be we don't know if it's gonna
have like apps like Netflix and stuff
you know
it's gonna have you know like some kind
of xbox live equivalent so there's a lot
that we don't know about the Wii U so as
far as apps especially for the
controller I would certainly hope so
like they showed that checkers
little thing that was running on the
controller I would hope so but honestly
we really just do not know they just
have not said much of anything yet the
Zelda Wii U was a proper tech demo yes
that was about the only real tech demo I
mean they show a couple of them that
were running on the Wii U supposedly I
mean you never know but you know that
did show off some graphics the graphics
do look pretty decent but again like I
said we don't know a lot of beyond just
a rough idea of the graphics and some
about the controller do I think the PS
Vita price and the specs what do I think
about the PS Vita price and specs for
that price some question a little bit
oddly worded yeah I'm really really
excited about the PS Vita I think that
for the price for $250 when you can
directly compare it to the Nintendo 3ds
the Vita comes way out ahead I mean it's
got a really nice 5-inch LED display
with a high resolution um you've got a
rear touch panel you've got force the
front is a touch you've got motion
controls you've got dual thumb sticks
you have all the standard buttons from
the PSP or at least all the other
shoulder buttons all kind of stuff now
let's happen that you have a quad-core
processor which is way way way more
powerful than what you'll find in the
3ds so yeah for the price I mean
especially for 50 dollars more you can
get 3G which and that helps it sure how
many people want 3G on their console
mean it might be nice for some people I
haven't decided if I really want that on
mine yet but um for the price I'm
actually satisfied with PS Vita I think
they did a great job minecraft on the
Wii U now I tell you what minecraft on
the we would actually be pretty cool I
mean you're being able to have your
inventory on the one screen you're being
able to play but you know coming back in
kind of circling around something I
talked about a little bit earlier with
the Wii U most of what we've seen was
just have to do with like putting like
menus and inventory on the secondary
controller screen well that's great
that'll work I think a lot of it is
going to come down to what the
developers can come up with what new and
innovative things that we can see like
for example like I say were doing like
throwing shuriken you know from the
controller at the screen that's
something really interesting and
if that we you can do a lot of really
cool interesting things like that I
think will be fantastic
I believe Sonia is actually innovated
with this in the 3ds how do you think
the rear touch panel can be used well
you see I think a lot of the rear touch
panel is more of so he's like well hey
we're gonna add this and just see what
our developers think I don't think they
actually have any specific ideas I mean
I've seen a couple of things where like
ModNation racers where like the front
I'm like you're building a track and you
can kind of like adjust the land and so
if you touch on the front panel like
it'll push the land down if you push
from the back it'll push the land up so
you know very similar to if you were
actually you put you your fingers in
like on adjusting stuff but as far as
we're touch panel goes I mean I can see
it maybe like kind of like if you had
like a trackpad on your computer like
you being able to control the characters
be able to press buttons from behind I
mean there's a lot of ideas so I don't
think it's gonna be as a most useful
feature in the world but again I think
it's nice that it has and I'm think it's
a big deal it's not like it really hurts
anything by adding that so you know guys
