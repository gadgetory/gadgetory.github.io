an interesting application to review
it's called Metal Gear Solid touch light
now as most of you will know the the
main the paid version of this has been
out for a few weeks now but uh between
the price and I just I just decided to
hold out for a while just to see maybe
the price to go down or something
but today this morning they a light
version came out for it and I've got to
say I'm I'm pretty impressed light
version features some first of all
fantastic gameplay I really at first I
was really iffy about oh why isn't it
you know real third-person shooter a
first-person shooter or whatever but
while it would be nice to move around
and everything basically it's almost
like I mean just in theory it's like
just tapping on people and shooting I
mean that doesn't sound like much fun
but between the graphics and and the way
that you do actually slightly move
around a little bit and the way you're
tapping you're not really paying
attention you're basically just calling
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam the game it the
Leiper is I'll say really quite short I
mean you only have a couple levels and
each level only lasts maybe a minute or
two but that being said it still gives
you enough time to figure out how it
works how you figure out how everything
works it gives you it gives you a good
tutorial at the beginning and I've got
to say it's it's it's quite a bit of fun
I mean I I blew through it it parked
along her to download then it did play
through but uh I know I've gotta say it
was pretty good as soon as you fire it
up you'll just notice that it has just
great great great music just a really
epic score I don't I don't know it's
probably I would imagine it probably
from the
console games because I don't think they
would do such good music just for this
but you you as soon as you fire it up
you we got Wow's is this is this is
really cool
the thing is now one of my main
downsides with it is that it's it's got
a story it definitely does have a story
now
I'll be the first admit I've never
really played any of the Metal Gear
games for Xbox or Playstation or
anything so I don't really know much
about it behind the behind the story but
it's got a story and what it is is it
shows the it shows the not cutscenes it
would just be like a picture of whatever
and then it just you just scan through
and just like a little some text just
says you know this happens this happens
and it's nice it has a story but
basically all it is that you you shooted
a bunch of people in the level then it
goes and tells you just just tells you a
little bit about what could what's
happening I mean it's really basic and
then back to fighting so hey I don't
there's nothing wrong with having a
story obviously and there's nothing
wrong we're just doing some shooting
just you know just some random just
shooting gameplay but when you try to
mix the two and it doesn't work that
great it just kind of seems a little I
don't know just not that great I mean I
would have preferred almost they would
just let the story out or or something
because it's just it's basically just a
little bit you're reading something that
you that doesn't really matter and then
you go fire some more I gotta say the
gameplay is really actually really quite
good the when I was reading through the
tutorial I was like getting a little
nervous is like pinch here zoom here tap
here look the screws finger off all the
stuff I'm like okay this is gonna
complicate it but a little I mean it was
so easy I mean I got I got it pretty
much down in 15 20 seconds I mean it's
real simple you just all you have to do
is just drag your finger over to where
you want to shoot and there's a little
on-screen cursor just tap it just fire a
couple times whatever you need to do and
then later on you'll get a sniper
rifle and it's even simply you just
pinch real quick and you also you go
into a scope mode just tap fire and you
have to do that for the farther off
enemies it's definitely uh you
definitely it's and it seems complicated
reading through the tutorial really
complicated but it's really intuitive
simple and you just boom and it's taken
care of the Metal Gear Solid Touch is
it's a it's a good game
Lyons right it's a good game a you if
you haven't if you've thought that you
might like the paid version
go ahead definitely pick this up it's a
bit it's a big file I think it's it's it
took it took me I've got a decent
connection it took me about 15 minutes
to download it it's it's it's a fun way
to try it definitely if you're if you're
considering buying the paid version
definitely pick this up try it as for me
I don't think the papers I believed
right now it's eight dollars I don't
think the light version didn't impress
me enough to spend eight dollars on it
but uh I don't know it definitely got me
thinking because it has some really just
fantastic graphics it's a good game play
and it looks like not knowing of course
the full version it looks like it could
have some some some pretty good replay
value I mean I'm already played through
the lite version three times already so
but uh yeah so I would go ahead go ahead
and have to give this application a
solid seven and a half out of ten it's a
it's fun really short but it's it's long
enough to let you know how how the game
