of me for speed hot pursuit for the
iPhone and iPod Touch so this is one of
the many many EA apps that are on sale
this week and I have been really having
a lot of fun with it so let's play new
gen straight on into it and now there
are a couple different modes there is a
local multiplayer I know I have played
this it's a lot of fun go ahead and you
can go ahead and race up with one of
your friends with an iPhone or iPod
Touch works pretty good but for this
review and go ahead and take a look at
the career mode go ahead and jump in
here now I have played through a decent
amount of it so let's go ahead and jump
straight on into this so what I'm gonna
be showing you guys today is the cop
mode where you know you're the police
and everything so let's go ahead and
pick
let's pick let's see which is this one
yeah so we can go ahead and scroll
through our cars so I'll go ahead and
before we do this there are several
different cars I haven't unlocked
through them all but as you see here I
have this one I have a Nissan I do have
a well you can see there are a few cars
and one cool thing is you actually go
ahead and tap on this and go into like
free mode so we can go ahead and scroll
through look at the cars and you'll see
they look quite nice they are at this
this game is optimized for the Retina
display so if you have an iPhone 4 or
iPod Touch you'll be better so I'll go
ahead and do that and let's go ahead and
jump straight on into the race ok so we
basically we have to go ahead and stop
the sky so the control is pretty simple
you on the right side you go ahead and
hold it there's the gas go ahead and hit
this that's the brake and then by doing
swiping up we actually hit our nitrous
so go ahead and catch this guy here now
there is traffic I'm throw not gonna do
- well no it's kinda hard to do in front
of camera but merio um so basically
there are a couple of different things
we can go ahead and hit this to call in
a roadblock now we do have you know help
from our friend here whoa this is kind
of hard to do through the camera but try
to keep it all on in the shot but I do
my best here whoa now we need to go
ahead basically the way to do this is
just to wreck them and just
which is pretty simple all you gotta do
is just keep hitting them the opponent
we go ahead and call it an EMP but if we
get this hit yeah they will lose control
for a minute and recommend up to a
little bit
it's a nitrous and write a catch-up well
I'm not doing very good here I could
guide you I couldn't be this one earlier
I couldn't be very good with this one
anyway
another ah jamaran get him call it
roadblock night you have to be careful
with the roadblocks where swing out oh
hey I think I've got him just keep yeah
we got it
no no got it nitrous oh they got it
morning I'll call another roadblock but
you guys can see here the game is a lot
of fun go ahead and we got another
minute to finish me off I think we'll be
able to do that a little bit nitrous
here oh and right random own res
roadblock here me let's nail the nitrous
and all you do pretty much just hit him
one more time and we should win I know I
will take this opportunity to go ahead
and mention that there are several other
things you can do you can go ahead and
actually play as the car the cops or the
racers there we go got them so as you
can see there we went ahead and won
pretty simply there button tap continue
but they go guys that's it for me for
speed hot pursuit for the iPhone the
iPod Touch overall I was really
surprised with how really just right
this is the graphics are good controls
are actually really quite nice you know
you had the accelerometer controls which
are pretty good you know it's overall a
very very solid application and for a
dollar it's hard to pass up so you guys
are interested in a really great racing
game definitely go ahead and take a look
at Need for Speed hot pursuit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
