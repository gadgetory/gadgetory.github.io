worth it
so this is the Alienware alpha r2 and if
you remember the original alpha was
actually one of the first steam machines
oh wow okay
so first off we actually have an
alienware keyboard I mean this stuff is
fairly basic you'll probably want to
upgrade to something a little bit more
high-end but it's definitely nice as its
included we've also got the 180 watt
external power supply this is a little
bit unusual and a desktop however
considering how small this is it
actually makes sense this is just
hanging around back you'll find quite a
few ports including both HDMI in and out
so you could theoretically set this up
as part of a home theater setup but more
interestingly is the external PCI slot
so this is what you can use with the
Alienware graphics amplifier which is
essentially an external box you could
put in even more powerful graphics card
also if you flip this over what you'll
find beneath this little cover is a USB
port so it might seem weird to have a
hidden USB port however this actually
makes a lot of sense if you have say
like a wireless mouse or keyboard you
want to hide the dongle it goes
underneath here slide the cover on
it's totally hit one of the advantages
of having a computer that's so small is
that you can actually be portable with
it so they sell a specific bag that is
made for the Alpha so now that you have
enough room for the ALF itself but you
could also fit a couple controllers
maybe a mouse can also fit the power
adapter when you're ready just zip it up
and you've got yourself a nice portable
travel bag this is really where the
alpha r2 makes sense we could always go
for a gaming laptop there quite a bit
more expensive where this is more of a
proper desktop with an HDMI 2.0 port you
can hook it up to a 4k display or TV you
can get a PC that's way more powerful
than a console speaking up you've got a
fairly clean install of Windows 10 but
the biggest addition is alien where's
hive UI launcher the idea is that this
is an interface that's meant to be used
with a controller to launch games and do
some basic tasks but honestly it feels a
bit half-baked I prefer to use steam big
picture mode and keep a wireless
keyboard around for using Windows the
Alienware command center software can be
useful to handle the HDMI input along
with customizing the LED lighting that
lives around front of the computer the
model I have to test has an i7 and GTX
960 which is powerful enough to handle
basically any game out today the
this model has a core i3 gigabytes of
RAM and AMD r9 470 X but I'd recommend
upgrading to the model with the Core i5
and gtx 960 you're also dealing with the
one terabyte hard drive across the board
you can upgrade this from Dell site but
it's easy to remove the four screws on
the bottom of the Alpha and install your
own SSD for less than $100 why they're
titles like rocket League or absolutely
no problem to run a max of 1080p you
won't notice a huge difference in
graphics compared to consoles but rocket
League is hardly the most demanding
title step it up to The Witcher 3 and
the Alpha r2 is able to run at high
settings at 1080p 960 is a solid card
pushing things to 1440p is a bit much
shadow of Mordor is a great example of
this it runs really well at 1080p ultra
and has the added benefit of being able
to control the lights in the alpha two
metrics going on in the game it's also
seriously fun as you might be able to
tell the Alpha R 2 is an interesting PC
it's a bit expensive but the mid spec
model with an i-5 and 960 isn't too bad
you'll want to add an SSD but you're
really paying for portability it will be
really difficult to build a system too
small yourself so what do you guys think
about the Alpha R 2 definitely be sure
to let me know in the comments below and
I will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
