today I'm here with the next in my
long-running series of videos on must
had City applications I've gone through
so many throughout the past several
months but I think I found another
really really solid one and I think you
guys are like that a lot it is called in
phinney board now I'm sure a lot of you
guys know infinity doc which allows you
to scroll your doc but this one is a
little different it allows you to scroll
your icon the steps scrolling that's
right you get to scroll up and down I
think this is just really really cool so
I'll show you guys all about it and that
tell you guys how to get it and
everything like that anyway let's get
this one started ok guys so before we
begin let me go ahead and just be I'll
tell you guys right up front this is a
two dollar application but guys for two
dollars this is really really really
cool like I said it allows you to scroll
up and down with your springboard as
opposed to you know scrolling left and
right and having pages it does have a
few options as well which i will show
you guys in a minute so they ready to go
download it obviously just open up cydia
search infinite board it is in the
bigboss repo and like i said it will
cost a dollar i net so go ahead download
it and install it and you'll be good to
go so we give you guys a quick little
demo love it here now obviously normally
you know you have your pages where you
scroll left and right and everything and
of course that is still intact so if you
do want to have a couple different pages
and everything but for the purposes of
this I put all my apps on a single page
and it's really simple then you just
start scrolling down and it works really
nice and smooth you know you can it
flicks really nice and it really just
works I mean instead you know scrolling
back and forth I really like this I
really like this especially because you
know a lot like some android phones they
have the same way where you open up the
apps and it's in a list like this I
think it's kind of nice as you see it
does not actually auto snap so you can
kind of leave in the middle but that's
okay so let's go ahead and show you guys
a couple
the settings so you can get it all set
up right so just go ahead go ahead and
open up your settings scroll down here
and hit in phinney board now there's a
bunch of different settings here
vertical vertical scrolling obviously
you're going to want that I mean do
balance which is you know where it hits
the top but what you will probably want
to do is go ahead and come into the
scrollbar style and click disable
otherwise you'll have a scroll bar on
the side kind of looks a little odd and
you know not really niet necessary other
than that you can go it pretty much
leave all the stuff alone although you
might want to if you want you can
actually remove your doc take all the
icons off your doc and then flip this to
know and then your doc will basically
not be there anymore so you can have
another row of infinity board icons but
you guys is a very very simple tweak you
know general I don't like recommending
to pay for applications but this one I
got to make an exception for its really
really solid I just love the idea of
this i mean i could just do this all day
long so yeah guys this is infinity board
it is two dollars in the bigboss repo
press the first paid app I've ever put
must add to the applications but you
know it's so good it's really hard to
deny it anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
