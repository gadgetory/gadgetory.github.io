here's the video going over the brand
new steam application for iOS and
Android this is still in beta however
let's just go and give you guys a little
look at what you can expect so the first
and probably most important part of this
is that you have full access to the
Steam catalog of games so that means you
can take a look at any new games you can
take a look at and see if they're on
sale you can even buy them straight from
your phone so they give you guys a
little example here we'll pull up the
darkness - and when you take a look at
you'll see a few different things you
see a little image of it some
information on it you can add to your
wish list you also take a look at
screenshots as far as I can tell there
are no videos so like of course
ordinarily with Steam you can take a
look at the video and see what all is
new and stuff but but the most part you
can take a look at a couple of
screenshots but you know nothing all
that spectacular so if we want to back
up here there's some information on it
you can purchase it so pre-purchase off
or about the game but if you liking one
just add to your cart and it will add to
your cart you know the same cart that
you would use on your PC and if I wanted
to I go ahead just purchase the game
right now which is very cool of course
it's not going to play on your iPhone or
Android device but if you purchase it on
your phone it will be available in your
Steam library you also have access to
specials so when there's a major Steam
sale you can just pull your phone out
and you'll be able to take a look at any
of the games that are on sale which is
very very nice and of course since you
can purchase them from your phone no
reason to you know I've tried to find a
computer or login or anything like that
pull your phone out you see some awesome
deal buy it and you're good to go you
can also pull up the menu and take a
look at some more information so for
example if I want to pull up my profile
I can take a look at right here take a
look at some information some games
originally played and funnily enough you
can also pull up screenshots and like I
said this is still beta full
under-construction Giffen hall up you
can take a look at screenshots videos
and that kind of thing also if you want
to back out here we can take a look at
some friends now I won't do this just
because I don't think that my Steam
friends would be too happy if I showed
all their usernames and whatnot what
games they've been playing on YouTube
but you do have access to friends groups
friend activity and you can also pull up
chat so if you want you can go ahead and
chat with any of your friends who are
online
finally there's also steam news nothing
particularly amazing here you can take a
look at announcements press releases and
that kind of stuff and finally do have a
couple of settings down there steam for
iOS and Android is available right now
however it is
invite-only beta so you can go ahead and
download the app however with soon as
you try to log in it will say that you
need to be invited to the beta however
go ahead and do that anyway that does
add you to the list so that you may be
able to be invited a little bit later
