launch of the iPhone 10s and the 10s max
this is gonna be a fun one
so of course not only do we have the S
model update to the standard iPhone 10
but we also have the much larger max
edition and I think a lot of people were
kind of expecting this when the iPhone
10 first came out but what you're
getting here is something that is much
closer to the iPhone 7 plus 8 plus and
size open this guy up and what we're
going to find is well probably the exact
same thing as you find with every iPhone
since the dawn of time some paperwork
with our obligatory Apple stickers and
the max so there's actually first time
I've held the max it's big it's pretty
big on top of having a max edition
available there's also a new gold color
for the 10s as well as the 10s max I'm
usually not a fan of gold I had to say
though this doesn't look so bad a little
bit more of a what would you call this
like a taupe I call like a band-aid
color taupe it's like you know brownish
like like like beige even though it's a
much larger phone you know what else
we're gonna find in the box these same 5
watt charger that they've been shipping
since 2007 yes my friends even though
you've got a massive battery and a huge
display it's still going to take you
like what two three hours to charge the
phone for real it's totally ridiculous
that they ship such a tiny cheap adapter
in the box when they actually sell other
alternatives which will charge the
iPhone much faster if you want to shell
out $50 for the USBC adapter and another
20 for the USBC to lightning cable you
can get your phone charged much much
quicker but instead they put this in the
box so yeah what I like to see on my
thousand dollar plus phone the 10s also
does come with Apple earpods
so as a surprise to no one there's no
headphone jack here instead it does take
advantage of lightning I don't know why
that flop open like that what you're not
going to find here is a headphone jack
adapter yes my friends the thing that's
been included on I post last couple
years that's 35 cent part to manufacture
a little adapter that will make your
headphones work on your iPhone not
including the box that's gonna run you
know the 20 bucks or is it 15 is it 10
it's still $10 now they should include
it I don't mind the idea that they are
still
shipping a lightning cable with USB a
but I mean this is an expensive phone
why are they cutting out things why are
they removing things when they should be
making it better if we open up the
standard 10s we're going to find is
iPhone that is very very similar to the
10 when I'm mostly curious about though
is the actual size difference put the
tenets side-by-side with the max and you
do get a much much larger display
whereas this has a 5 point 8 inch panel
you're getting a full six and a half
inches do you remember the days where a
7 inch phone was called a tablet
difference min booth the original iPhone
versus the max I mean that's that's
ridiculous but you know what it kind of
works I feel like everyone's kind of
gotten on board with a large phone train
and a big reason we're here is because
of the good old galaxy note even though
we have such a larger display the actual
footprint of the iPhone 10's max isn't
really all that much larger than say an
iPhone 6 plus 7 plus what have you it is
going to be a little bit shorter than
the note but it's not as crazy as I was
anticipating it to be when it comes to
telling the iPhone 10 apart from the 10s
they're very similar except for one
major difference if you look on the
bottom of the phone where the 10 is
nicely symmetrical with the speaker and
the microphones the 10s has a little bit
of an antenna line which sort of cuts
that short the main reason for this is
that it should give you better reception
I'm actually going to test that a little
bit later supposedly we're going to be
getting more antennas for better Wi-Fi
as well as LTE reception but it looks a
little uh a little ugly not sure how
this past Johnny I've and the boys
there's also a slight difference in the
size of the camera bump so to illustrate
this I have a 10 s Max and a 10 s max
case you can see there goes pretty much
fully around the camera but if you'd put
an iPhone 10 and a 10 s case you can see
it's going to be a little bit misshapen
specifically on the bottom it doesn't
quite line up most iPhone 10 cases
should work with a 10 s and vice versa
but you might want to keep an eye on
that the camera bump is going to be just
a little bit bigger one of the big
upgrades this year is the a12 Bionic
chip so they've claimed some pretty
decent performance improvements but the
first thing I've noticed as soon as I
open up Geekbench is we have more memory
before we had three gigs of RAM on the
iPhone 10 but this year we have four
gigs on both the 10s as well as the Macs
interesting so whereas the 10 is a
little bit slower than the 10s and
as well as the 10s it's by a pretty
small difference the single core is a
little bit higher but the multi-core is
actually very similar the days of seeing
50% CPU performance every year might
just be over although to be fair these
are still like the fastest phones I've
ever tested so yeah one of the bigger
upgrades this year is with the camera so
the main shooter has been upgraded on
both the 10s as well as the Mac's with a
larger sensor and it also has smart HDR
functionality there's a big Wow look at
the difference in range so with the 10s
we're actually getting all of the detail
on your face whereas the max is blowing
out not only Matt's place in the
background but also like stuff like your
cheek the portrait mode also does look a
fair bit better so not only do we have
that better dynamic range but we're also
seeing it's a little bit more accurate
as far as cutting people out of the
photo and the ability to adjust the
depth of field after the fact is really
nice not perfect definitely has some
more work to do but it does look a lot
more natural than the ten as well as the
eight plus so is the iPhone 10s max
worth it where you have to stay tuned my
friends because we're going to be doing
an entire video all about that make sure
to subscribe and stay tuned otherwise
you have to spend $1,100 in the phone
