now I am a huge video game that I love
playing all kinds of games
I mean I've ever since I was just a
little kid I've bought consoles and just
you know played some games and play
games I love them and so guys I've
realized you might guess I have gotten a
pretty decent collection over the years
so go ahead and give you guys a quick
run-through and I am making a big long
deal I'm gonna give you guys a quick
run-through of all my games so yeah
let's go ahead get this one started
okay guys let's go ahead and start with
something that probably a lot of you
guys have the original Gameboy I had two
of them and I know guys you guys are
going to see I have two of quite a few
of these consoles um so guys if you want
to go ahead and take a look right here
will be a annotation I have I did a full
review on this and they're both
identical they both play at lab models
um a really cool game boyse um you know
I like them a lot so let's go ahead and
set them off to the side here let's go
ahead and pull up a couple more game
boys this time it is the Gameboy pocket
now again I do have a review so go ahead
just check out the annotation on the
screen if you're interested more this is
the review of I mean I'm sorry this is
the two Gameboy pockets there's a black
one and here's a green one these are
pretty cool little things guys I mean
this is one of my favorite game boys
ever they were really you know small and
you know they worked really well I
didn't like the triple-a batteries but
that's not that big a deal so moving
right on on here we have own two Gameboy
colors yeah guys I know I have two of
everything almost like when all this
stuff is so cheap guys this green one
right here is actually was like my very
very very first handheld console played
this thing to death for probably two or
three years till I got my gameboy dance
I love it it's great I don't say it's
for as much as I played this thing it's
crazy it's in like almost perfect
condition and you can see all the see
lots of play but yeah awesome awesome
consoles both of them now let's go ahead
and go a little bit farther along to the
Gameboy Advance
and I have two of these as well so on
the left here you can see that I have my
SP but wait and show you guys real
quickly the Game Boy Advance you know
this was a pretty decent thing of course
as with a lot of people this broke off
the battery door broke off like
immediately but that's not big deal you
just take it as you can see I had plenty
of tape on it so this is a pretty decent
console um I played a lot pretty good
but this guy's this is probably one of
my favorite consoles of all times this
is the Gameboy Advance SP and you see
it's a little bit worn and well it's a
lot worn credit that to keep keeping it
in my pocket for about three or four
years but I'd say it's not too bad
considering I'm sure here this one
supplied so much that I actually
literally sweated off all these labels
but guys it stores 100% perfect still on
the original battery actually of course
these have rechargeable batteries it is
still in the original one um doesn't
that last very long but guys one of the
best consoles ever I love it and moving
right along of course with the last so
this will be the last of the handhelds I
have which is my DSi this is actually I
did a review on this just a short while
ago you go ahead check out the
annotation on the screen if you want to
see the review of it I'm liking it so
far I've only had it for just a little
while but it's pretty good
I like how thin it is I mean it's even
thinner than my SP so yeah that's pretty
good
ok guys so now let's go ahead and move
just a little bit on to big consoles you
know I wanted to hook up to your TV you
know for all you kids with Xboxes yeah
well here Super Nintendo I got um
actually this one I bought really
recently um he's pretty cool Super
Nintendo actually starting to get a
little bit rarer these days and I know I
looked at one buying where these is like
a local video game store and they were
wanting a lot of money for it but I
found a kid I buy it from who's ready to
sell it and did you see guys it's not
perfect it's got a couple chips and
everything that works hard percent fine
yeah it's a pretty cool piece of tech
continuing on just a little bit here
guys we also have bumper bomb the Super
Nintendo slim well I guess not so
it's the second generation Super
Nintendo you guys might have seen this
from the Nintendo console wars I used
this guy's this one actually I bought
this brand new right when they were
phasing them out um I remember that I
went to go get it and it was so so cheap
this was like a couple years after the
Nintendo 64 was out they must have had
like a couple of these left they found
in the back room or something so I got
this super cheap I played like just a
few times but by then although I play my
playstation for a long time so I like
use just a few times I got put up and I
just recently found it so guys I mean
this thing probably has less than you
know 20 hours of gameplay on it is just
perfect I mean just perfect I love it
again these are these are pretty hard to
come by too but yeah so go ahead move
just a little bit farther on and I
actually have now I have two of these
which is the original PlayStation yes I
have two of them I'm actually got this
one from the same I got the Super
Nintendo and that PlayStation was thrown
in for free so I figure why not guys the
PlayStation was my actually my first a
big console I never actually had a Super
Nintendo before then or anything else
like that have a couple other consoles
but this was the first one that was
actually mine that I actually had I'm
guys played the PlayStation literally
guys probably six years I did not get a
Playstation 2 until very very late so I
played it and played and played and
played till literally the only thing
that could get me to stop playing my
PlayStation was when they quit making
games for it but yeah guys this is the
slim ps2 I'm sure quite a few of you
guys have them um like I said guys I did
never got
well I took me a long time to get at ps2
and guys like this is like this is
really cool I mean you know it might not
have the best graphics but this is still
not a bad console I mean there's still
some today I mean it's slim slim slim I
mean it's much smaller than you know I
mean you're just compare it to the you
know the original PlayStation you just
said I'm talking to see it's narrow near
is big of course it's got DVD online
multiplayer on some other stuff like
that so it's pretty cool console no
doubt okay guys so the next one is my
translucent nintendo64 guys I shouldn't
play this one that much you know I was
so big into the PlayStation that I
really just I mean that was just what I
play I spent all my money on getting
PlayStation games I mean that was just
what I loved and I have a huge amount of
ps1 games um so the new Nintendo 64 was
pretty cool though never really played
it that much like I said um so you know
I guess it's a good thing I mean you
consider my Playstations it's not in bad
shape it's in uh you see there's a few
dings and scratches but this this name
timber 64 is well and pretty much
perfect I is another case where you know
I kept it on top of my closet for a very
long time so so moving a little bit a
few years of the future I suppose we
have my Nintendo GameCube now what I'm
sure it doesn't even fit in the shutter
like well because I had the gameboy
player so yeah I got the Gamecube now
this one guys I'm happy to say this was
actually the successor to my ps1 I
played my ps1 forever and then I finally
went and got the Gamecube and guys I
played this for a lot I never got as
many games as I did ps1 but the Gamecube
was a really soft thing actually I've
got the Gameboy player disc in there so
yeah guys the game was the game the
Gamecube was pretty good I still play it
actually quite a bit I know something
about wanting to play the games on
GameCube instead upon the Wii but yeah
so seeing as I just mentioned it I guess
I might as well show you guys yes I do
in fact have a Wii um yeah that is the
Wii is pretty decent
I don't ever play it really um cameras
all messed up there I don't really ever
play it guys uh you know there's not a
whole lot of games I mean literally the
only game I ever play on it is Super
Smash Brothers Brawl which is actually a
great game but all my money I don't buy
gangster this anymore the console I buy
games for right now is you guys might
have guessed it
my xbox 360 now that really doesn't fit
the shop Wow
well see ya guys this is like my newest
console my favorite console it's the one
I cannot spend all my gaming hours on
lately and yeah it's maxbox um well
I've had a few problems with it lately I
want to get into it but I had a couple
of red rings in the past couple months
which is not fun but yeah um besides
that though guys Xbox is a fantastic
console I love it I play it very very
frequently so any of you guys that is my
full wrap-up of all the consoles I have
and by I have I mean these are mine
actually a couple more consoles but
actually they aren't mine right now so I
can't really give them maybe some other
time I might be able to go ahead and
steal them away and show you guys in a
video but yeah guys so this is my video
game collection so guys I have a quick
question for you I love all these and I
plan on doing group reviews at them as
you see I've started to get to do
reviews of some my game boys and working
through those actually got a couple more
game boy oh jeez come to you guys fairly
soon um but guys what consoles that
you've just seen would you like me to
review I'll probably review them all
eventually but if you want to see one yo
