a review of the blue Yeti USB desktop
microphone me gauge might already be
familiar with this microphone a lot of
people on YouTube use it as well as
doing podcasts and general audio work
but of course I'll be giving you guys my
full unboxing and review and now before
we get in usually just tear the box
right open but they want to kind of give
you guys a little a little overview of
the box actually did a pretty nice job
of kind of explaining what some of the
patterns are giving you guys a little
overview of what all the mic does of
course I do that myself and also some
more of these cool characters so I just
kind of appreciate when companies kind
of put a little bit of effort into the
boxes and kind of make it look a little
cool but now let's go ahead and pull it
open here without looking kind of silly
oh and of course there is a tab and I
didn't bring a knife so let me just pull
it out here there we go no problems and
let's go ahead and pull this microphone
out and see what all we get in the box
alright so we've liberated this from the
original box so I think it's go ahead
and take a look at what all we get so
for starters doesn't look we have a USB
cable and I believe that is a mini USB
cable so looks fairly long I would guess
probably 6 feet or so give you more than
enough room up top here we have blue
Yeti looks like an instruction manual or
some sort trying to probably tell you a
little bit about the microphone itself
and looks like we next do have the
microphone itself maybe a guy that's
about gonna be about it for the unboxing
portion stay tuned I'm gonna go ahead
and spend the next couple of weeks on
this testing it out saying what I think
so I will be right back with my full
review all right so I've now been using
the blue Yeti for a couple of weeks now
and I guess a yeah it's pretty solid so
some of the things I've been doing with
it as I've been using it to report
pretty much all the audio from my videos
this one and of course not included I've
been pretty much using it to do all
kinds of audio recording I've also used
it for my live strains and the audio is
pretty solid but there are some other
things I do want to talk about before I
get into the specifics of that so one of
the big things is is the size now when I
first got this I was like you know taken
out of the box and I look at it like wow
this is a really really big microphone
and it's kind of hard to get a good
sense of scale on the camera but I would
say it's at least a foot taller so it's
really quite large especially with the
stand chassis here it extends the height
quite a bit
now this actually works really quite
nicely when sitting on your desk it's at
about a nice height for you to speak
into it like you have to crouch down or
anything like that so I should probably
quite like that now speaking of the
stand it is really quite nice so as you
guys can see here of course this
microphone see you on here you can just
screw it into pretty much any microphone
adapter and you allow you to use it you
know boom arm or anything you like over
the stand that it comes with is really
quite nice it is made out of this let's
I don't know what time I'm awful at
telling what kind of metal it is but
it's definitely metal and very very
heavy I'm especially something really
surprised me when I first pick this up
is the stand and the microphone itself
are very heavy but it works well you
know it's on your desk you want to
actually get knocked down or something
easier since a year it's not really
going anywhere
so beyond that you guys can see the
microphone itself and it all is the
construction is very very top notch and
see here the entire the shroud around
the capsules is just fine you don't have
to worry about it you know getting
dented and all kind of stuff and the
overall build quality I found is
absolutely top-notch maybe the only
thing that I might have a slight
complain about is this volume switch
this is the volume for the headphones
which I'll talk about that in just
second um you guys can see here's a
little bit of a little bit of play in it
certainly not a big deal I don't really
think it's gonna be breaking or anything
but it is something I did want to
mention now let's go ahead and go
quickly over some of the features of the
microphone so up front here you guys
have a mute button so if you really want
to quickly mute it on the fly so if you
know you're doing something you just
want to have a hard button to mute it
you can certainly do that now this is to
control the volume for the headphones if
I flip it over here on the bottom guess
you'll see here you have the mini USB
cable which is where you plug it in
obviously to your computer I just keep
it plugged in for convenience sake and
we also do have a headphone adapter this
is for a 3.5 millimeter headset I know
this actually works really quite nice as
it allows you to monitor your audio on
the fly you don't need to worry about
you know any delay or lag or anything
like that and it's really really nice to
have on a microphone of this quality and
you know of course this price turning it
around to the bat
you guys will see here does have a game
control so again something that you will
not won't find on a lot of other desktop
microphones in this price range is a lot
of physical controls which I found is
very very helpful so like I said you
have your game control so you can a
manually adjust the audio and you'll
pair it up with listening to it on
headphones you can really get the
optimal audio performance and you're not
happen to you know
start and stop and look at your audio
and play it back kinda stops a little
bit messy so just being able to do that
is very very simple now on the back here
you guys will see his pattern now I did
mention this in a previous video but it
does have four patterns
now of course these are all suited to
different needs and because it has have
three capsules in there for recording on
all sides I mean does work really quite
nicely
now I'm gonna mostly talk about this
from the point of doing voiceovers and
that kind of stuff because that's mainly
what I use it for and when you have it
on cardioid pattern it works really well
but you guys don't have to take my word
for let me go ahead and give you a quick
sample alright so I'm now recording
using the blue yeti microphone so I am
using the cardioid pattern which is
optimal for voiceovers which I'm doing
right now kind of helps block out some
of the background noise and everything
kind of more focus on what exactly is in
front of a microphone I have a pretty
short distance between myself and the
microphone you know get the best thing I
also do have the gain turned down
somewhat about to that one-third or so
through a sooner guys this is a quick
test of the audio quality on the blue
Yeti microphone overall I'm quite
impressed with the blue Yeti microphone
the audio quality Magister exceeds a lot
of its competitors and where it really
shines is with the physical controls of
the course with the mute and being able
to monitor your audio all that really
makes this assault microphone so you
guys are looking for a microphone around
this price point I have no problems
recommending the blue Yeti I like to
give a big thanks to the folks over at
blue for providing this microphone to me
