taking a little bit of a look at the
Dell Streak sometimes also known as the
Dell Streak 5 or the dell mini 5 so guys
this is a really really unique product
if you've been following my channel for
any length of time you know I've made
quite a few videos on it
ever since we first heard about it and
I've actually made believe about three
videos on it so guys I've made love
videos on be cut for a reason it is a
very very unique product so guys it is
basically a 5 inch tablet that makes
phone calls did you fit in your pocket
and I know guys that's gonna sound like
it's just a big smart phone because you
can think of it as just a big smart
phone you're kind of missing the appeal
of it um so guys it is of course a 5
inch tablet you know in comparison you
know like an iPhone has a
three-and-a-half inch screen
even the Evo 4G has just a little bit
more than like a four inch screen and
you know the Nexus One oblique guys the
three point seven inch screen so guys
this is much larger than a neo a normal
smartphone now the draw of the the
streak is that it is not going to be
just a phone okay it's almost like a mix
between you know like an iPad and a cell
phone now he does a lot of things it
does run Android so you can go ahead and
you know all your Android apps you
multitask I mean also has bells custom
edit a custom value UI on it now we
haven't seen a ton about the UI it
doesn't look pretty sleek they've you
know it's a lot of it has to do with
just you know scaling up that's Android
to the 5 inch screen but it's a pretty
decent looking interface and of course
Android is a pretty good operating
system you know where you have all the
great you know it's open you had the
Android Market all that kind of good
stuff but what's kind of special about
the Dell Streak is that it's a phone as
well now I mean it will make phone calls
you can't hold up your face because it
does have you know speaker in the
microphone just where you expect them to
be but it's like that big I mean guys
this it looks a little bit odd no doubt
holding up to your face so that's why
they you know
I use bluetooth but the interesting
thing about the street five or the
streak whatever they're gonna call it
but interesting thing about the streak
is that you don't need to use it as a
phone at all and I expect a lot of
people myself included even perhaps
might buy it never use it as a phone
call ever so guys what this streak about
is it will be sold unlocked strike from
Dells website in the US early next month
well actually I shouldn't say that it
should be next month we hope is early
but they haven't said the exact date yet
so guys this will be unlocked it will be
in the US mainly for AT&amp;amp;T but like I
said it'll be unlocked so you can buy it
and never put a sim card in there and
you'll be a hundred percent fine we can
go ahead and you know do all kinds of
things go ahead and you know hook it up
with a SIM card you know because of
course is you're not on contract so you
don't let's not like you're having to
pay you know like a normal smartphone
plan you know $80 a month or whatever
now guys there are just a few feature
thing they write over really quickly
here guys
it has a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor which is probably about the
best processor around right now is in
the mobile space it has two cameras it
has a back facing camera and five
megapixels with dual LED flash and of
course it can take I believe it's 640 by
480 video so it's not high-definition
video but it'd still be pretty decent it
also has a fun front-facing VGA webcam
so you can go ahead and video chat
now that guys I actually haven't shown
any apps or anything like that that
might be pre-installed but guys the
hardware is there so I don't want to
think the software we have a big issue
along the line of course it does run
Android now guys we aren't actually sure
which version of Android it will run
when it launches the prototypes we've
seen Rand angeloid 1.5 and 1.6 if you
look at the Dell website there are
official thing what they are talking
about it they said that it will they
didn't say what it would be running when
you first get it they said it will be
updated to 2.2 Froyo and also we'll get
a flash 10.1 which of course comes with
Froyo
so guys not sure it might be actually
been running on 1.6 and up
you know month after its release me um
no but you know they did say it will be
updated pretty soon so we'll just have
to you know figure that out um guys now
there's a bit of a downside to all this
and that it is pretty pricey so when you
go ahead next month in July you want to
go ahead and buy it of course like I
said you can get it from the Dell
website and it will be $500 unlocked in
the US $500 guys that's that's where I
come back to this hole it's not a
smartphone it's a tablet if you think of
it as a smartphone you know I spend $500
you know on that but do you think this
is a tablet you know you think of it as
like an iPad you can fit in your pocket
it gets a little bit better you know the
5-inch screen isn't good is pretty good
I mean you know it's a lot bigger than
you know your iPhone screen or whatever
I mean you actually I got you see myself
watching a movie on that or really you
know getting a whole lot of web browsing
done because it's just so much nicer um
but you know you think about it as a
smartphone you know you'll think well I
can get at an HTC EVO I could get a you
know the next iPhone 4 I could get you
know a Nexus One so if you're thinking
of it as a phone your I got to say the
the streak is not going to be a great
option but if you think of it as a
tablet is a really unique tablet you
know you can put in your pocket but it's
gonna be much larger it's gonna be very
very thin you can video chat and of
course you can go ahead and hook it up
with a data plan I wouldn't be surprised
if some people go ahead and don't get
just get a straight data plan from you
know AT&amp;amp;T or whatever I'm not exactly
how the plans will work but I'm sure
you'll be able to just get and just get
a data plan so you wouldn't even make
phone calls at all maybe just over Skype
or something who knows but anyway guys
that's my rundown of the Dell Streak I'm
really excited about this guy I really
think I'll probably be going ahead and
getting one but yeah guys it doesn't
want let you guys know about this I'm
interested in more information go ahead
and check out the description I'll have
a link to the Dell website as well as I
post on Sidgwick I've written about it
telling you guys just a little bit more
information anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
