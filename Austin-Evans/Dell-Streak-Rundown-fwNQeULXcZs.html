taking a little bit of a look at the
dell streak sometimes also known as a
dell streak 5 or the dell mini 5 so guys
this is a really really unique product
if you've been following my channel for
any length of time you know I made quite
a few videos on it ever since we first
heard about it I've actually made
believe about three videos on it so guys
I'm in love videos on be kept for a
reason it is a very very unique product
so guys it is basically a 5 inch tablet
that makes phone calls did you fit in
your pocket I know guys that's going to
sound like it's just a big smartphone
but if you think of it as just a big
smartphone new kind of missing the
appeal of it um so guys it is of course
a 5 inch tablet you know in comparison
you know like an iPhone has a three and
a half inch screen even the evo 4g has
just a little bit more than like a
four-inch screen and you know the nexus
10 bleep as the 3.7 inch screen so guys
this is much larger than a neo a normal
smartphone now the draw of the the
streak is that it is not going to be
just a phone okay it's almost like a mix
between you like an ipad and a cell
phone now he does a lot of things it
does run Android so you can go ahead and
you know run all your Android apps you
multitask I mean also has bells custom
headed a custom value you I on it now we
haven't seen a ton about the UI it does
look pretty slave a few know it's a lot
of it has to do with just you know
scaling up there's Android to the 5-inch
screen but it's a pretty decent lookin
interface and of course android is a
pretty good operating system you know we
have all the great you know it's open
you had the android market all that kind
of good stuff but what's kind of special
about the dell streak is that it's a
phone as well now I mean it will make
phone calls you can't hold ups your face
because it does have you know speaker
and a microphone just where you expect
them to be but it's like that dick I
mean guys is it looks a little bit odd
no doubt holding up to your face so
that's why they you know
use bluetooth but the interstate
interesting thing about the street 5 or
the streak whatever they're going to
call it but an interesting thing about
the streak is that you don't need to use
it as a phone at all and I expect a lot
of people myself included even perhaps
my by never use it as a phone call ever
so guys what this drink about is it will
be sold unlocked strike from dell's
website in the US early next month well
actually I shouldn't say that it should
be next month we hope it's early but
they haven't said the exact date yet so
guys this will be unlocked it will be in
the US mainly for AT&amp;amp;T but like I said
it will be unlocked so you can buy it
and never put us in put in there and
you'll be a hundred fine we can go ahead
and you know do all kinds of things go
ahead and you know hook it up with the
sim card you know because of course is
you're not on contract so you don't want
not like you're having to pay you know
like a normal smartphone plan you know
eighty dollars a month or whatever now
guys but are just a few feature thing
they brought over really quickly here
guys it has a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor which is probably about the
best processor around right now is in
the mobile space it has two cameras it
has a back facing camera and 5
megapixels with dual LED flash and of
course it can take I believe it's 640 by
480 video so it's not high definition
video but it still be pretty decent it
also has a fun front-facing vga webcam
i'm super go ahead and video chat now
let guys actually haven't shown any apps
or anything like that that might be
pre-installed but guys the hardware is
there so i don't really think the
software we have a big issue along the
line of course it does run android now
guys we aren't actually sure which
version of android it will run when it
launches the prototype we've seen ram
android 1.5 and 1.6 if you look at the
dell website that our official thing
when they are talking about it they said
that it will they didn't say what it
would be running when you first get they
said it will be updated to 2.2 froyo and
also will get a flash 10.1 which of
course comes with froyo so guys not sure
it might be actually been running on 1.6
and up
a month after its release me um no but
you know they did say it will be updated
soon so we'll just have to you know
figure that out um guys now there's a
bit of a downside to all this and that
it is pretty pricey so when you go ahead
next month in july when you want to go
ahead and buy it of course like i said
you get it from dead the dell website
and it will be five hundred dollars
unlocked in the u.s. $500 guys that's
that's where I come back to this whole
it's not a smartphone into tablet you
think there's a smartphone you know I
spent five hundred dollars you know on
that when you think that's a tablet you
know you think of it as like an iPad you
can fit in your pocket it gets a little
bit better you know the 5-inch screen is
good pretty good I mean you know it's a
lot bigger than you know your iphone
screen or whatever I mean you actually
owe that I got you see myself watching a
movie on that or really you know getting
a whole lot of web browsing done because
it's just so much nicer um but you know
you think about it as a smartphone you
know you'll think well i can get at an
HTC evo i could get a you know the next
iphone 4 i could get you know a nexus
one it's so if you're thinking of it as
a phone your I gotta say the streak is
not going to be a great option but if
you think of it as a tablet is a really
unique tablet you know you can put in
your pocket but it's going to be much
larger it's going to be very very thin
you can video chat and of course you can
go ahead and hook it up with a data plan
I wouldn't be surprised if some people
go ahead don't get a just get a straight
data plan from you know AT&amp;amp;T or whatever
I'm not exactly how the plans will work
but I'm sure you'll be able to just get
and just get a data plan so you wouldn't
even make phone calls with all maybe
just over Skype or something who knows
but anyway guys that's my rundown of the
dell streak i'm really excited about
this guy I really think I'll probably
going ahead and getting one but yeah
guys doesn't want to let you guys know
about this I'm interested in more
information go ahead and check out the
description i'll have a link to the dell
website as well as I post on sidgwick
I've written about it tell you guys just
a little bit more information anyway
