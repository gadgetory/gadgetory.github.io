the gaming PC build from $500 so there
are a lot of different kind of price
points that you can build a game PC app
so the higher end I've done a $3,000
build before which is just ridiculous
it's overkill for most people but if you
want to get amount of ton of monitors
it's a great way to go likewise if you
want something a little bit more normal
you can go with a $1000 build which will
pretty much max out any kind of game you
throw at it however if you don't have
$1,000 to spend the 500 dollar bill that
I'm about to show you is actually an
excellent choice to kick our belt off
we're going to be using an Intel Core i3
2120 CPU now a lot of people give the
core i3 a bad rap however actually it is
a really great CPU if you're on a budget
and you want to build a really nice
gaming computer this features dual cores
clocked at 3.3 gear Hertz it also comes
with a hyper threading which allows
Windows to see it as a quad-core CPU
well sure some games can't actually
fully take advantage of a quad-core CPU
however you be surprised how many will
do just fine on the dual core Core i3
$422 this is an excellent start for our
build moving on we're going to be using
the gigabyte H 61 DS 2 motherboard now
while this motherboard is very cheap
that does not mean that it's lacking
performance you're still going to be
able to get all you can out of both your
graphics card and your CPU and that's
really the most important thing in a
budget build like this you'll find 4
SATA ports which can be used for hard
drives DVD drives and anything else you
want to plug in and also since it's a
gigabyte board it comes with dual BIOS
now BIOS is what runs the entire
motherboard so if this goes you're
pretty much of your entire motherboard
is ruined and believe me I've actually
killed a computer by flashing a bad BIOS
to it before so having a backup BIOS
that if anything goes wrong the
motherboard will automatically revert to
it is a great feature you are missing a
few bells and whistles including USB 3
as well as SATA 3
however for $50.00 this will absolutely
get the job done for a graphics card
we're going to be using a Sapphire
Radeon HD 7770
now that this has come down to price
it's absolutely excellent card for a
budget build not only is it fast quiet
and cool but also is not going to break
the bank this card comes with one
gigabyte of gddr5 memory and since it's
the gigahertz Edition that means that
the core clock is over one gigahertz now
while this is not going to go blow away
your GTX 680 it definitely means they
will deliver some really stellar
performance as one of the latest AMD
cards built on their new 28 nanometer
process this means that not only will it
be fast but it also is going to run
really quietly it's not going to suck up
a ton of power for 120 dollars after
mail and rebate the performance of
this card should be perfect for our
build for memory we're going to be using
four gigabytes of pee and wine optima
ram now four gigabytes while it's not a
ton it's going to be more than after a
handle pretty much any game that you
throw at it on top of that since it's
clocked at 13 33 megahertz which is
pretty much as fast as this motherboard
can handle that means it's going to be a
really good fit for our build best of
all it's only going to run is $25 for
the dual channel kit for a hard drive
we're going to be using a 500 go by
Western Digital caviar blue drive now
while I'm a big fan of SSDs for this
build our normal hard drive makes a lot
more sense with 500 gigabytes of
capacity to work with that's going to be
plenty of room for all your Steam games
pictures media photos all that kind of
stuff will fit on the drive no problem
and since it is a 7200 rpm drive that
means it's going to be pretty snappy
again not quite as fast as an SSD but
you have more like 500 gigabytes to work
with as opposed to 60 for $70 another a
great addition to our build or power
supply we're going to be using a 500
watt cooler master extreme power plus
with 500 watts of capacity this is going
to be more than that for our build now
on top of that there's plenty of
overhead where if you ever want to add
additional hard drives more fans LEDs
all that kind of stuff it can handle it
no problem $40 this will work great in
our build for a case we're going to be
using the antique 300 now this has been
my favorite budget case for quite a
while now for starters it's a full sized
case which means that there's plenty of
room for a full size motherboard full
size graphics cards lots of hard drives
all that kind of stuff will fit in the
case no problem but on top of that it
has very good airflow and while none of
our parts are particularly extreme so
nothing's going to be just pouring tons
and tons of heat out compared to
anything else the antique 300 can
absolutely handle everything we've got
to throw at and more for only $55 a
great way to go
the last partner build is a Sony DVD
burner now this part is optional if you
want to you can ditch it or you can
instead go with a blu-ray drive I
generally do recommend to grab a DVD
drive at least though as they're pretty
cheap and it makes installing windows
and various other programs easier of
course it's nice to sometimes watch a
DVD or you know use a CD if you're one
of those before of course like I said
though you can't skip this but otherwise
it will cost you about eighteen dollars
lastly you may want to consider picking
up a copy of Windows 7 home premium now
I'm not going to be doing this with this
build as instead I'm going to be doing a
copy of Windows 8 over they can come in
handy if you don't want to deal with a
beta or anything like that if you do
want to go with Windows 7 and will be in
addition to $100 but again you can't go
ahead and just use
and by that once it does come out so
what's the damage as a recording this
video this entire bill will cost you
four hundred ninety nine dollars and
thirty four cents see I told you the
five dollar bill
anyway definitely do keep in mind that
prices are constantly fluctuating
usually going down so I have links to
everything in the description of this
video anyway guys if you want to see the
full tutorial on how to put this
computer together I will have an
annotation right here on top of that
I'll also be giving this computer away
so actually will be a couple of weeks
from now but as soon as the videos live
the annotation will be right beside me
here anyway guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely get a thumbs up and if
