in your videos are you secretly part of
the Illuminati okay so I know I get a
lot of questions about how do you make
money on YouTube and all that kind of
stuff but the Illuminati is definitely
not real I know I'd like to joke around
sometimes but I mean it's definitely not
a a real thing I would not know of any
hypothetical organization called the
Illuminati and even if I did I mean to
imply that I would be a part of them is
just that's just irresponsible to be
honest with you that's not remotely
realistic after updates and improvements
over the years which is your favorite
next-gen console so we're coming up on a
year and a half since the Xbox one and
ps4 came out and I've got to say I've
been leaning a lot more towards the Xbox
side of things lately so for me I use
the console mostly as a home theater PC
so I watch a lot of YouTube on my TV
Twitch Netflix even Xbox video watching
shows like better call Saul which by the
way if you guys haven't seen that yet
you need to watch it because it is so
good like seriously there are also some
games on the Xbox one that I'd really
enjoy so Forza horizon 2 I have sunk a
lot of hours into so it's good like the
perfect storm of a game for me because
not only is it a ton of fun it's got
good driving its open-world it's got a
ton of cars that are easily customizable
I've sunk a lot of hours into that game
there are good games for the ps4 as well
like Grand Theft Auto 5 and the Last of
Us remastered but these are really just
updated versions of last gen console
games now it's definitely nice to be
able to play them in HD and especially
the Last of Us remastered looks awesome
on the ps4 but a lot of the newer titles
that I would normally play on consoles I
would just rather play on a PC anyway
what effect do you think the upcoming
DirectX 12 will have is regards to
gaming on the Xbox one
I think DirectX 12 is going to be a
pretty big deal on the PC side of things
however I'm not quite so convinced on
the Xbox so right now the Xbox one uses
a modified version of DirectX 11 and
while a lot of the things in DirectX 12
are going to be focused on being able to
better optimize for the hardware you've
got so for example taking better
advantage of multiple CPU cores which
the consoles have a lot of as well as
you know being able to tinker out with
memory and whatnot but one of the things
is is that
consoles live kind of always had that
ability so I don't see a massive
improvement to the Xbox one as far as
performance with DirectX 12 will it be a
little bit easier to get at that
performance by developers probably will
we see some minor performance games
probably but will it be able to catch up
with something like the ps4 with purely
a software update I doubt it has your
channel ever helped you in getting a
girlfriend do you think curved edges on
phones will be a thing in future
flagships or do you consider it a
gimmick
so the original curved phones like the
LG G flex and Samsung Galaxy round or a
very very dim icky so I remember the G
flex especially had a really cool curved
screen it looked nice but it wasn't
particularly practical and the quality
of the screen was not all that great
however with the Galaxy s6 edge all
those misconceptions I had about it as
far as trying that first generation are
completely gone so I think the big thing
is we've all been staring at flat
screens forever basically
now with just a little tiny taper on the
edge I mean the screen still functions
exactly like you would normally expect
just to be able to play with the galaxy
s6 edge hurdle up about an hour so I was
immediately sold on that and in fact in
my opinion it almost seems like
Samsung's playing it safe by even
bothering to make a normal galaxy s6 at
all big thumbs up for a curved displays
what are your thoughts on the new
MacBook 12-inch so the new MacBook looks
really really really cool now if that
was the only thing to consider then yeah
everyone should just go buy a MacBook
however it's not quite that simple so on
one hand we're talking about something
that's not tremendously powerful I mean
we're talking about a 5 watt 4 M
processor that's about what a lot of
like higher and tablets need as far as
what so it's not gonna be massively
powerful I think it should probably fall
a little bit behind like a current
MacBook Air which isn't terrible for a
lot of things it's going to be fine but
I think the biggest problem for me
though is the fact that it only has one
port I mean yeah sure USB see is if
you're gonna put one port on a laptop
that's the way to go when you're getting
power you can put like DisplayPort and
HDMI and USB there's all kinds of things
that you can adapt off of USB C but you
have to buy a ton of adapters to do
almost everything
just think about something like if I
want to edit a video on this I've got to
get an SD card reader to USB now I got
to get a USB to USB C adapter like I'm
gonna be carrying around a bag full of
adapters just to use this super thin
laptop so I don't think it's a really
good fit for me it might be better if
you're like maybe I can writer or
student or someone who really doesn't
need to use lots of like adapters and
stuff all the time but uh it looks cool
when I am looking forward to giving it a
try but I can't say I'm super excited
about it why haven't you done and asked
me for so long so what you used to do
these once a month and I felt like that
was a good balance however I started
having fun with them doing like skits
and stuff and I made them once a week
and it got difficult not only to be able
to kind of keep interesting questions
every week but just to be able to spend
that much time I mean it was fitting
like two days on a lot of ESPYs
before I stopped and that just kind of
kept me from making a lot of the videos
that I wanted to make so I am thinking
about bringing this back as a monthly
deal because it is nice to be able to
talk to you guys and do something that's
not gonna take me a week to make
something I can just sit down in a video
I can make in an afternoon just to kind
of answer some questions and talk about
some things that I would like to talk
about but I really aren't worth doing an
entire video about so if you guys want
to see these come back once a month
definitely be sure to let me know but I
think that's probably the way I want to
do it did you guys have any more
questions you'd like me to answer next
time on ask me feel free to hit me up on
Twitter and Facebook and those links
will be in the description of this video
hey guys thank you so much for watching
and I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
