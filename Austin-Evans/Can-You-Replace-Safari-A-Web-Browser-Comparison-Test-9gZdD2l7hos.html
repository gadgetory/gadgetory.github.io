a special review video review on some
different web browsers that are
available in the App Store now as most
of you will know obviously you have
Safari built into your I I device
whether it's iPhone or iPod Touch but if
you go in the App Store there are
definitely a lot the last last time I
checked over a hundred different at
different web browsers that you can
choose some of them are free most of
them are paid then basically I'm doing
is I picked four of the top ones at the
moment and I test them out and I'm gonna
see if any of them are good enough to
replace Safari okay so in first place is
what's called free browser
now I will say immediately this one is
this is one of the reasons why I stick
with Safari there's it's free just just
about the only reason I would want to
get it there are ads 30 that are on the
bottom if you've got it in landscape
mode I know it's on portrait mode there
on the bottom in landscape mode there in
between the Google and the website bar
now I do like that but I mean it's just
the ads are just so annoying I'll show
you later there's another web browsers
actually does ads really nicely the
interface on this it's there's just no
there's a little button that you can hit
that will make that everything disappear
and try to get you full screen but I
will be reviewing another one that's
full that does full screen it's much
better there's where you can take down
the search and everything
there's website bar this is gonna be
like the shortest of you ever but this
this app is just not there's just
nothing to it it's just a really chic
kind of browser and I definitely
recommend just stay away from it and
stick to one of the three I'm about to
review
in third place is definitely a big step
up
it's called private privately sorry
privately web-browser it's it's if
you're looking for a safari replacement
this is definitely not it it looks and
acts a lot like safari which i will say
right now Apple imposes restrictions on
any web browsers they all have to be
built off of Safari so I'll say this I
said this earlier all of them unless a
couple of them having a few special
features like they don't load pictures
and stuff but no generally every browser
will load the same speed and same same
everything like you won't have you won't
find flash or anything like that
basically they just all feature on just
different like fullscreen and different
things like that anyway so privately
it's uh it's a definitely a when you
fire it up it loads practically
instantly just as fast as Safari if not
maybe even a little faster um it's got a
really simple really minimalist
interface that I actually like it looks
just like Safari literally I mean you
have to mean you look at it is you do
like a couple double takes to make sure
you're not looking at Safari there
aren't ads on the very first screen when
you fire it up but it's no big deal
basically just there advertising the
developers or advertising a couple of
their other applications use a small
AdMob on the bottom but those go away as
soon as you go the next page and that's
that's not a big deal at all the bottom
bar my main problem with this is the
bottom bar where where normally Safari
would have all your different options on
has the forward the back button this is
a big waste to real screen real estate
just because it takes up the same out of
space and it's just that huge bar is
only for two little buttons which is
just just doesn't work well for me at
all it takes up just tons of space and
it just doesn't you can't go anywhere
that's a couple of the most of the other
browsers released you can make the stuff
disappear that stays there the whole
time which is a big downside it's really
basic browser it doesn't doesn't store
any history or whatever which is
obviously what the name is but in
general it is
free so if you want you go check it out
it's it's real it's real
minimalists real basic real sleek
personally there are better options in
my opinion but for free it's not bad so
you might want go check it out now we're
getting into some of the browsers that
actually stand a chance of replacing
Safari and coming in second place is
what's called full screen web browser
now I will say this one is $0.99
so that's a problem you know but I
actually bought this old several months
back and I actually do use pretty
frequently it's pretty cool the main
feature of it as you might've guessed is
full screen and when I say it they mean
this is the only one I've seen actually
this total full screen there's no
there's nothing left it's just I mean
the whole the whole screen is just
totally devoted to your webpage um
that's a really cool feature I think
basically what you do is when you want
to hit back or exit ergo different
website whatever audience to do is just
shake shake the device and everything
will reappear and no big deal that's
he's not perfect but that's that's just
about the only way I could think of they
would work now it's not a full-featured
web browser like something like Safari
it doesn't have tabs which is probably
the single biggest downfall I think but
besides that it's got just about
everything else
it's got bookmarks support where you can
do all your bookmarks it's it's private
web browsing like everything else
there's no option to turn on history
which I know sometimes you do want to
see history to you know to look back
though Oh where's that website went to
um but I mean that's not a big deal most
most of these web browsers are because
some of the only things that Apple let
them do then there's uh you can open
there's a small options page where you
can open open the pages you're looking
at in full screen you can open Safari
for whatever reason I'm not really I
guess if you wanted to use both because
I will say this full screen is set up
where it's not meant to take over for
Safari it's meant to complement Safari
and that's the way I use it too it's
basically if you just
on a bigger screen you want in it's I
mean it's it's really cool because I
mean there's no menu or anything you can
pull out obviously pop but I mean while
you're while you're reading and
everything it's pretty cool
there's no Google search bar but I mean
that's not a big deal I mean if you need
to go to Google whatever there's no big
deal to just go do it on your on Safari
um full screen web browser it's a good
app I've it is not in a sense like I
said I bought it a while ago and I'm not
unhappy with it at all
it's pretty good it like I said it's not
gonna replace Safari but it's with the
just the fact that it has real full
screen I'd say at least take a look at
it because it's pretty cool okay so the
number one app the number one web
browsers that I in my opinion if the
ones I've tried is quarry
stealth browser now this is free and
I've got to say it's it's pretty
impressive if any of these apps could
replace far as this will probably the
one why is basically a real
full-featured browser yes tab support
book Mars just literally every just
about everything that you would want in
Safari now that also has a really cool
feature I think is that when you first
open it up it asks for passcode now some
timing depending on you know what you
want to do with the browser that might
not be a big deal I know it's not to me
but the look one good thing is you can't
turn it off but you can whatever
passcode you you know you said it it's
it can be different from your iPod
iPhone one or not you can also just for
a guest just have them put one two three
four in and it'll clear all your history
and everything so that they can't access
it I mean if you're if that's if that's
important to you thing you know
it's nearly full screen it's not quite
as good as full screen the full screen
browser as full screen browsing it does
still leave the very top bar which is
okay I guess it would doesn't take up
much basically what it is is that it
does okay I'll just real quickly I will
say it does have
and add and that is whenever you open up
a new tab it'll automatically open a an
and it does change every one small but
it's mostly the same I don't really find
that that big of a deal
it does kind of slow down I noticed that
instead of opening up just a blank tab
when you when it's loading a web page it
does take a couple of seconds to load um
but I would rather deal with that then
have to pay a dollar for this and I mean
I don't think it's a big deal you can
clear your data but the good thing is
you can actually keep you keep - you
don't have to you can keep history and
everything like I said it has the full
tab support it's got a nice nice search
bar when you go to do it is you have web
address and you can google something and
then you can also do it off the shopping
comm my only problem really was the
quarry besides the ad and that's not bad
is the fact that it there's some
glitches it sometimes won't open a tab
right and there's just a few different
things it's just not that great
um so Corey's good just just not quite
perfect okay now of course the real
question that I set out to answer is can
any of these actually replace affari in
my opinion no they can't um a quarry
does come close because it has just
about everything you would want and some
nice extra features but like he come
back to his the glitches and that that
Safari really has gotten to the point
where it doesn't have any glitches now I
do recommend go out at least at least go
pick up a quarry because it's pretty
it's pretty slick yeah if short of those
glitches and the ad and it does is some
kind of slow but short of that those
minor things it could if they could work
that out I would probably change from
that to Safari be sure to check out
