smartphone worth it with a 7-inch
display the blue studio 7.0 might look
like a tablet but this is a full-fledged
smartphone crack open the box and inside
you'll find the studio itself along with
the screen protector get a little deeper
in the unboxing and you'll see the power
adapter tool for getting at the sim and
micro SD micro USB cable and a pair of
headphones take a quick look around and
you'll see the studio resembles the
Nexus 7 which isn't a bad thing at all
even though it's all plastic there's a
decent looking metal like finish on the
front and around back it's covered in a
soft touch dimpled rubber which gives it
a nice feel in the hand it's much more
manageable than a bigger tablet like an
iPad although compared to a normal-sized
smartphone not so much as if a 7 inch
smartphone wasn't crazy enough the
studio only runs $100 because of that
you aren't going to find cutting-edge
specs but there's not a ton to complain
about with a 7h 1024 by 600 screen it
doesn't sound like much on paper but the
panel itself really isn't bad it has
solid color and viewing angles unlike
most budget devices that resolution is
low though even for smaller phone
standards but it is usable what slightly
less usable is the size while this is
small for a tablet it is enormous for a
phone the studio will fit in my pocket
but it doesn't leave much room left you
really should keep this in a bag the
front firing speakers does double as a
speakerphone for taking calls on you
look totally ridiculous with this thing
against your face but it is there that
also means you've got HSPA for data it
might not be LTE but again for $100 it's
rare to find cellular data on a tablet
period to get at the SIM slot you'll
need to use the tool included with the
studio to unscrew a small panel around
back here you'll find the slots for the
sim and microSD but something important
to keep in mind is that it uses an
old-school mini sim which are pretty
rare these days you'll probably need an
adapter you'll also probably want to
take advantage of that micro SD card
slot - as the included 8 gigs of storage
won't get you that far inside it's got a
mediatek quad-core cortex a7 CPU along
with 1 gigabyte of RAM definitely
nothing too impressive but it's decent
enough in real use there's a bit of
hesitation in basic tasks like scrolling
through the UI compared to the latest
flagships but it's not a deal-breaker
just don't expect it to crush all the
latest games software wise we're looking
at Android 5.0 while this is going to be
pretty out of date these days on the
upside it's a clean install of Android
with just a few bundled apps most of
these are fairly useful like the Amazon
suite or easy enough to ignore and of
course you've got the Play Store to
download whatever you like
one area where you can definitely notice
the prices with the cameras they're
definitely not amazing the front-facing
shooter is passable for a quick video
chat and while the rear facing five
megapixel camera is better it really
isn't by much while budget phones have
come a long way in the last few years
the camera department has definitely
been lagging behind there are two ways
of looking at the blue studio seven on
one hand you've got one of the biggest
and weirdest smartphones I've ever come
across
on the other you're getting a $100
tablet that's not only competitive as a
cheap tablet but it also includes not
only data but voice and text as well
look at it from that perspective and the
studio really isn't half bad so what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
