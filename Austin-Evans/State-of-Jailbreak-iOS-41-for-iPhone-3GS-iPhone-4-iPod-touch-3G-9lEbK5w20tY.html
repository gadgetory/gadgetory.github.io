state of jailbreak video today I'm going
to be talking about iOS 4.1 and yeah I
know I just did a video just a couple
days ago but it's a lot of stuff has
changed today so make them anything was
is that 4.1 is now out for all devices
so if you're interested go you can go
ahead and plug it into itunes and
download it and update it now actually
if you just want to know more about 4.1
go ahead and take a look at the
annotation on the screen right now I
recently did a 4.1 overview video
talking about all the new changes and
all that stuff still is entirely valid
so go ahead check that after interested
in knowing more I now standard warning
if you do upgrade to 4.1 you will lose
your jailbreak there currently is no
jailbreak on iOS 4.1 so just kind of
just a warning there you go ahead and
test it out if you like but just know
that you're not gonna be able to be
jailbroken um now there actually is good
news as far as that goes there actually
was just very very recently a new
exploit found in 4.1 so it looks like
before too long there will be a full
jailbreak for 4.1 which is fantastic I'm
so actually what it is is that there is
an exploit which I'm sure most of you
guys know this but basically they have
an exploit but it's going to take a
little while for them to actually build
the jailbreak around that so really not
sure when it will be out I would guess
maybe three weeks two weeks maybe a
month I'll guess somewhere in that time
range but it could be less it could be
more it just kind of depends on how how
easy it is for the dev team to go ahead
and get it done but if you are on 4.1
and you really want to jailbreak like we
all do it will be coming soon so guys
that's pretty much it just last thing I
did want to mention it's not really news
or anything but I just want to give you
guys a quick reminder if you're
interested in going to 4.1 or even if
you're not whatever get your SHSH blobs
on 4.0 point2 right now so guys four
point well earlier versions are better
but if you can get it at least on
four-point-oh point2 definitely i
recommend it just you know i have a
video just go ahead check it out on the
on the annotation on the screen right
now go ahead take a look at that just
show you how to use firmware umbrellas
go ahead grab your SHSH blobs because
apple will quit signing that and if
there's a jailbreak or for whatever
reason it's always a great idea to have
as many SHSH blobs as you can so you can
at any time down great or whatever
firmware you want so guys let's not go
ahead check that video out if you
haven't get your firmware
9 44 point 0 point 2 4 point no point 1
or whatever you already have definitely
go ahead and get that done because it
really will help you in a later date you
never know what jailbreaks will be
compatible with what so it's always good
to have options so yeah guys that's
pretty much it for my update just want
to let you guys know that 4.1 is out and
that there will be a jailbreak before
too long they will allow you to go ahead
and do it so of course I will keep you
guys up to date anyway guys thanks for
