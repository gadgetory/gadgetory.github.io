of d3 live so today I'm going to be
talking about the ipod touch 4th
generation so of course every year Apple
likes to update their iphone and ipod
touch lineup and so i expect this will
continue this year when we will see a
brand new ipod touch this September but
what exactly it will contain your specs
features cameras all kind stuff is kind
of a little bit up in the air right now
but guys we have had a lot of rumors a
lot of speculation even some leaked
parts about this so let's go ahead and
tell you guys all what we know my
opinions are too kind of help you decide
what you might or might not want this
ipod touch so the first thing guys they
are the cameras and yes guys cameras as
in plural they're very well might be a
front-facing as well as a rear-facing
camera on the next ipod touch so of
course a front-facing camera was new to
the iphone for this year and i don't
think it would be a huge price to see
this come back over on ipod touch so of
course the front-facing camera really is
used for video chat or calls it FaceTime
I think it would make a lot of sensible
head to continue spreading out the
cameras to continue more people allow
them to you know to video chat I think
it would be a really cool thing for ipod
touch now that said i'm not so sure the
apple actually want to go ahead and put
it on later and for whatever reason they
might want to go ahead and hold it back
maybe for the next one as apple likes to
do whole pack features but still guys i
do think it's a pretty decent
possibility and we have seen a link to
part with an ipod touch frame with a
front-facing camera but that's that
doesn't really mean a whole lot that
stuff can be faithful it easily so guys
I put this in the maybe category now
what I'm quite a bit more sure about is
that there will be a rear-facing camera
so guys um now I take this with a grain
of salt because of course last year with
the ipod touch 3rd generation it was
looking I mean almost definitely like
there's going to be a camera I mean we
saw prototypes with cameras we saw cases
being made for the ipod touch with a
camera hole and then there wasn't a
camera so guys I'm not so sure if we
will actually say this year just because
we got burned so bad last year I mean I
one hundred percent convinced as well as
quite a few other people but guys it
does make sense that they will go ahead
and put our rear facing camera on there
if they do it's kind of up in the
between what kind of camera would be
some people say that it would be the
full 5 megapixel sensor from the iphone
for the poor shoots high definition
video but a lot of people are saying
it's probably going to be the same
camera module from the iphone 3gs which
is quite a bit a little quality and
doesn't shoot high definition video
firstly i think it probably would be the
lower resolution camera Apple like I
said guys always likes to you know hold
back features give you just enough to go
oh let's worth upgrading and then the
next year then they'll all bring
something better so it's probably going
to have a really high resolution camera
but it should be pretty decent so guys
moving along we have the specs so the
ipod touch and iphone generally stay
very close to the same specs every time
I phones update iPod touches and expect
that to continue this year so I think we
will see the apple a4 processor from the
iphone and ipad i think we will go ahead
and see a new redesign but i'll get to
that in just a minute I think we'll go
ahead and see the ipod touch go ahead
and get the retina display now i'm not
sure we'll get the retina display but it
does make sense that of course they keep
all the apps that can run on the other
third generation ipod touch and iphone
3gs what would be the same for iphone 4
and the 4th generation ipod touch on
battery life is another something that
might be considered I depending on how
they design and how big of a better they
want to put in it for example tape with
iphone 4 battery in it would be
fantastic battery life the iphone 4 with
of course you know it has a cellular
radio in and everything which takes up
in gps everything does take up quite a
bit of juice in it gets good battery
life so they put that same battery in
the ipod touch which doesn't have all
that extra stuff ipod touch with last
probably days on a single charge which
is fantastic of course you know they
might want to go ahead full go that for
maybe a little bit more room inside
there or get it a little bit thinner but
you never know I'm selects the guys
there is the redesign so you know the
ipod touch has stayed the same pretty
much since it was very first was
announced I'm you're the same generation
brought some decent changes and the
third generation just brought a few
technical changes but i think that the
iphone 4 just like how it was just
totally redesigned i think the ipod
touch will be totally redesigned as well
now as far as what it will look like
that's kind of hard to say i think some
of the
cues from the iphone fool be brought
over so for example it might have more
of a squared-off desiring is proposed to
really rounded you know kind of cool the
metal design that the current ipod touch
has but then guys believe me i say i do
not think this will be you know like
look just like an iphone 4 it will
probably be quite a bit different
probably thinner but you know if I
really doubt that they're going to want
to go ahead and make it very similar you
might have somewhat of a similar squirt
off design but I definitely do not see
Apple late they really want to keep a
pretty clear line between the ipod touch
iphone because obviously i phone does
not ameen I they sell it for way more
money they make way more money on it I
mean I voltage to apples pretty much
just like training wheels getting people
ready to buy a night them so I think
they will be redesigned some of course
there is a chance that could say the
exact same with just a couple of cameras
I do thinking we will see a decent
redesign so if any rate guys that the
next ipod touch 4th generation does look
like a really solid upgrade i highly
recommend don't buy an ipod touch today
don't buy it next week wait until sep
tember usually that they announced it
around the first part to the middle part
of September if you can wait that long
pick yourself up an ipod touch you
typically will not be disappointed they
do seem to have quite a few things
coming ok guys so for the second second
md3 live i'll be taking live questions
of course every episode of d3 live is
filmed in front of blog TV we have over
30 people in the room right now so I'm
go ahead and take a few questions ok Ali
190 ask will there be a 4.1 update for
all the devices because of the death
grip on that's actually a good question
yes the Apple has said there will be an
update it might be 4.1 I know probably
four-point-oh point one but they said
against their will be in that day that
should fix the death grip issues but the
thing is it really won't on the death
grip or you know if you don't know
whether it is iphone 4 if you hold it
with the corner in your hand and you
grip tightly you will lose signal or at
least the signal go down quite a bit
there will be an update and it will
basically help your help your signal
kind of you know very ate a little bit
more so you will be able to actually see
you know instead of having three bars
you might show you have to or whatever
it should be more accurate but still if
you do hold your hand your iphone in
your hand
that way this update won't help you at
all it is a hardware issue and basically
if you have an iphone 4 you're gonna
have to deal with that so you're just
going to have to buy a case or something
because no matter what they do software
or not you really will not be able to
fix that ok the 3ds or the ipod touch
4th generation is a great question um so
the Nintendo 3ds of quarters was
announced earlier and should be out
sometime at the end of this year the PM
next year is kind of unclear right now
but um you know this is a great question
the I the ipod touch has always been
really focused on doing a lot of stuff
and it does a lot of stuff really well I
mean internet browsing is fantastic you
can do your email you can do normal apps
you know not kind of games but you know
like calculators and that kind of stuff
and you also do have games um it does
all those things pretty well but the I
but I'm sorry that Nintendo 3ds does
pretty much one thing one thing only
it's games and it is going to do games
fantastically um now of course kind of
comes down to general you know a good
really high to your game like one of the
best ones out on my ipod touch is
usually around you know ten dollars and
a lot of times one bit less whereas you
know a nintendo DS i'm sure 3ds will be
the same is probably like thirty to
forty dollars so you know it's kind of
hard to say generally the 3ds and the DS
games are quite a bit higher quality you
know you tell they you know there's a
huge team working on it and so you know
it might not blood x it is worth you
know three or four times as much but on
the other hand you know you have to
actually go buy them where is the X
course there's a lot of really great
99-cent applications so it's really i
don't know i really just can't say you
know once better than the other it
depends on what you want personally I
want the book I think we're both going
to be great show for different things
but yeah it's just kind of a hard
question i can't answer it um when the
ipod touch 4th generation have a new
design yes i did talk about this just
look at earlier i think the ipod touch
next one will have a new design i'm not
sure if they might just add camera
camera or two cameras onto it you know
we don't know but i do think it's about
time that they refresh it and make it
look a look at more like the iphone 4
or just do something a little bit new um
well the ipod touch fortuner should be a
battery hog probably not I mean Apple
Linda products pretty much every single
update it's got better battery life five
twenty percent by fifty percent blah
blah blah at any rate guys yeah I do
think it will be a better battery life
of course you know the ipod touch is not
too bad with battery i have a second
generation and the battery is getting
pretty bad on it right now but of course
it's coming up on two years old so yeah
guys I think the battery will be better
on the next ipod touch when will the
ipod touch 4g come out should be out
September every year Apple has an ipod
event where they will announce new ipods
for example last year's like the ipod
nano ipod touch acceptor etc and yeah
guys they do this pretty much every year
September so maybe next Irwin in
September sometimes it's early usually
it's earlier the middle of September of
course all all I need to be out by the
holiday season so yeah I would expect
that timber should be when it was coming
out um what will be more of a gaming
device or musical device um I think it
will be a gaming device I mean maybe if
it had a microphone which it should if
it has video capability then it might be
a decent you know thing where you could
like sing into it and you know like some
of the auto-tune stuff but really guys
that's more novelty the musical part of
it really it is more for gaming you can
do a lot better gaming than you know
just maybe a couple of you know
cheap-ass they might you know mess with
your voice or imply piano or something
is it worth up to upgrading from ipod
touch 3rd generation to an ipod touch
4th generation it's hard to say we head
up course ipod touch 4th generation
isn't coming out yet and so we haven't
actually seen exactly what it will have
um if all the specs and everything that
I expect they're coming or true then
y'all would think it would be worked out
great um you know if it's not maybe if
it only has like a single camera or
maybe doesn't have the full specs since
not redesigned I mean if it wasn't
really a big upgrade than yeah it
probably wouldn't be worth it but on the
other hand you know if it is as big as
it seems like it will be housed you know
a front facing camera
rear facing camera a lot more upgraded
specs all kind of stuff that I do think
it would probably be a pretty good
upgrade and that's it for this episode
