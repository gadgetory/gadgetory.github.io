has been out for a couple months a big
question is what's the point the thing
is you have to look at wearables like
the Apple watch differently this isn't a
smartphone replacement the biggest
limitation is a simple one you're
working with a small screen even the
larger 42 millimeter watch is sporting a
1.5 inch display and while having a
touchscreen and the digital crown makes
navigating watch OS fairly easy the
simple fact is there's only so much you
can do on a small screen there are apps
available and they're mostly terrible
some of the built in Apple apps are
decent but most are plagued with long
loading times a few apps are relatively
decent but unlike a smartphone you're
not going to want to spend 15 minutes
catching up on Twitter on your watch
it's really meant for short bursts of
use the Apple watch will be getting a
software update later this year which is
speed up asked by running them natively
on the watch but there's no getting
around that there are limited things
that the Apple watch does better than
your phone and you'll still need a phone
because the Apple watch needs to be
connected for everything besides basic
tasks not only that but you'll need an
iPhone 5 or newer that supports
Bluetooth 4.0 as long as you keep your
smart phone on you this isn't a problem
but this also means that a lot of the
things you might want to do on your
watch just makes more sense to do on
your phone so the big question is what
does the Apple watch actually do first
of all it's a watch it's really not too
far removed from jewelry so the looks
are important it might not have the
awesome round screen from the Moto 360
but I do think it looks nicer in person
than it does in pictures it's a nicely
crafted piece of tech that's
surprisingly comfortable to wear the
watch comes in several materials and
colors and the bands are easy to change
and have a decent variety but the
downside is that nothing about this is
cheap one of the most useful things
about the Apple watch is a bit of a
weird one it's the notifications it
might seem like a small thing but
getting a small tap on the wrist to
quickly glance that makes a big
difference in my everyday life instead
of pulling my phone out of my pocket
dozens of times a day
I can handle basic stuff like responding
to texts using voice or archiving an
email with a quick tap the fitness
tracking also works well throughout the
day the Apple watch measures your heart
rate and tracks how many hours you stand
calories you burn and minutes of
exercise you do the essentials are
fairly rock-solid you have a few watch
faces to choose from although the most
useful ones are by far the most boring
you do have to raise your wrist to turn
on the screen but it has a really nice
OLED display and the battery life is
surprisingly
it easily makes it through a full day of
use with a net for two if I go easy on
it what it really comes down to is what
are you expecting to do on a SmartWatch
on one hand the Apple watch is expensive
the apps aren't particularly good and
you're essentially forced to keep it
paired with an iPhone on the other this
still does a lot more than a traditional
watch and for tasks that actually make
sense to do on your wrist the Apple
watch does a good job the big question
though is for you guys what do you want
to be able to do on a SmartWatch
definitely be sure to let me know in the
