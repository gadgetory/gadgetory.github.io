application review guys this is honestly
the kind of game that the ipod and
iphone were made for I'm serious guys
this is the num just a awesome awesome
app basically to just sign up really
quickly it is a game filled with amazing
pixel art but it's a puzzle game based
on the accelerometer guys something to
try i'm just going to show you i'm going
to show you so that's the way to start
the game now let me just pull the camera
back just a little bit look at this
guy's is that just awesome look at that
look at the 3d and believe me guys might
say this hey I can't tell it might not
it's probably coming through the camera
too well but guys the 3d on this game is
just just amazing I'm so guys this
premise is really simple although it's
done perfectly basically what you do is
you take full the accelerometer if you
touch the screen it just pauses so go
ahead and look it again so the whole
point of the game is to just get the
puzzles right now guys basically you
just tilt and you have to get everything
to match up right so did you can see
here I'm sorry guys the 3d on this game
is just so amazing so let me see if I
can figure this out basically what you
do is you need to get everything to sync
up right so think I may be around it I'm
not so sure I can get this right guys
because I'm about there are a hundred
levels in the game and I believe I'm on
level 93 or 94 um one thing about the
game while I'm trying to figure it out
how they were go got it okay oh I'm on
96 I'm guys one thing about the game is
that um I got this last night okay so
I've been through 96 levels very quickly
especially their first prize 60 or 70
you can go through you know it takes you
shouldn't take you 30 seconds get
through that's right now number 97 okay
here's and here's a different kind so if
you guys can see here a very very cool
concept so basically you get all these
together there are all these puzzles are
very different so let's see if we can
get it in closer
I hope sorry guys the camera cuz I have
to tilt so much hopefully you guys can
see pretty good on the camera there we
go and you can see 97 let's go ahead and
do one more so if i can see if we can
find one here we go here's another tight
you see here I almost got there you see
here I mean guys accelerometer and the
3d looks amazing look there at almost
and hang on I'm so close there we go
guys now just take a look at this pic
slaughter really quickly look at the I
mean just it's just such great looking
down on civilians in the Cameron just a
little bit more about it going out of
focus guys just look at it I mean guys
this is probably one of the best looking
apps and one of the most fun apps i've
ever played guys eboy fix pics is the
name it just runs a doll 99 the extra
currently guys I saw literally when I
saw this thing I saw a video of it so
about five seconds of the game play and
I didn't even want finish watching the
video I ran over to my ipod spent two
dollars on this application I have not
regretted at one bit I'm just you see
I've almost finished the game but guys I
mean this is so much fun and you know
through 100 levels i'm i'm sure they
will add more in a later update but even
so guys the 100 levels they include are
fantastic i highly highly recommend you
guys get this game it is excellent just
just so so cool anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
