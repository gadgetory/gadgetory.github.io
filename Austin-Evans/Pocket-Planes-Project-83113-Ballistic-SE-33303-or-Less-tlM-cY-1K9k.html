the first episode of 3 330 three or less
where I go over three apps that cost
under three dollars and three minutes to
start we have pocket planes in the game
you run a fleet of planes through
various airports around the world the
first thing that jumped out at me is the
style the graphics are all pixel-based
and it's easy to work out what you're
supposed to do it even goes as far as
the sounds which are simple yet clearly
let you know what is going on without
needing to look the objective is to
become the ruler of the skies by flying
your planes around the world and
purchasing and upgrading your planes and
airports as a free-to-play game you can
purchase more in Game books to make it
faster to progress but just like Jetpack
Joyride spending money is entirely
optional and you'll be able to fully
enjoy the game for free all flights take
a few minutes to get to their
destinations so you'll be able to manage
other things while waiting or just keep
an eye on your push notifications to see
when they land while the game is a bit
slow at first it picks up after a bit
and it's really quite fun for free in
the App Store it's definitely worth the
download next we have project 831 13
also known as Project Bell I pick this
one up and suddenly an hour of my life
disappeared before I could set it down
there are a lot of great things about
this not the least of which are the
awesome cel-shaded graphics Bell is a
platformer with a heavy emphasis on
combat which combined with the super
fast pace makes an awesome combo the
story is that project Bell was created
to take back the world from the machines
and its toll briefly between worlds with
comic like cutscenes you can swipe to
boost forward up or down as well as
control where bell goes for the most
part you have to focus on getting
through the level and avoiding enemies
and hazards while Bell automatically
shoots if it's getting tough you can use
a powerful attack clear everything out
at the temporary cost of your help which
makes it a bit strategic if you kill
enemies you get that health back but if
you miss that you can quickly die
project Bell is one of the most fun
games I've played in quite a while and i
highly recommend giving it a shot for 99
cents lastly but definitely not least we
have ballistic se there are lots of
great twin-stick shooters in the app
store but ballistic is my favorite for a
few reasons there are two modes waves
and challenges ways is a longer game
that throws wave after wave of enemies
at you and as you progress you unlock
upgrades such as shooting faster making
your shot to try to the other orbs
challenges have you try and survive for
two minutes with
10 upgrades as you can see the graphics
are nothing short of fantastic in better
yet the entire game is as responsive as
it gets no matter how much stuff is on
screen the game never seems to miss a
beat best of all the controls are
top-notch which is usually my biggest
problem with twin-stick shooters on
touchscreens if you enjoy a quick run
through a twin-stick shooter I highly
recommend ballistic se as a recording
this video the app is free however even
for its normal dollar 99 price it's
worth picking up that's it for this
episode of 3 330 three or less if you
guys enjoyed and want to see more
definite be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
catching more videos like this be sure
