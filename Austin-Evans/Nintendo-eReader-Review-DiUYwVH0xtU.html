on a pretty interesting and rare piece
of technology called the Nintendo
e-reader and the Nintendo e-reader was
an add-on for the Game Boy Advance they
really didn't actually make that many of
them especially the United States it was
fairly popular in Japan but they really
it just didn't do two on the United
States now don't even think it was ever
sold in Europe so what this is all about
is it allows you to scan cards such as
this one right here as you guys can see
there are various types of cards to
actually scan using the e-readers and
get various data onto your Gameboy
Advance
it was actually a really pretty unique
idea let me just show you guys how it
works here is just an original Game Boy
Advance I need to do is just kind of
plug it in you see here it's got a spot
for the link cable you just plug it in
and you're going to be good to go like
that now as you can see it's pretty
unwieldy issues you know it's almost
double the thickness of the original
Game Boy Advance um however that was
okay because it was still pretty unique
I know this also does work for the Game
Boy Advance SP
and the I believe the DS Lite although
as you can see here with these others
when you plug it in the link cable does
not actually plug in correctly and that
a big deal really didn't pack anything
other than be able to close it correctly
so let me give you guys a quick demo of
how it works on the Game Boy Advance SP
so what this is all about is of course
just allowing you to scan your various
cards in I just get data and all kinds
of stuff so you can scan the dot codes
which I'll show you guys in a second you
can also communicate so what this was
all about was it allows you to scan a
various cards such as Ashley mediation
I've got one right here so if you
actually could scan card like this I
don't show you guys had that works in a
second but you can scan that through the
e-reader then connect your Gameboy
Advance
over to for example a Gamecube and
unlock content same thing worked for
other Game Boy Advance games you can
unlock various content like I've
actually got a card right here if you
scan this card with one Gameboy pants
can't get to another game boy advance
and you could unlock various things so
it was a really interesting design it
was not perhaps the best executed it was
a little bit unwieldy to have to have
multiple game boys and connected here
and there but it did work however one of
the coolest things about this is it
actually allows you to play like NES
games so originally what comes with is a
a pack of cards with has just a few
cards in it and then you just scan all
the cards no actually a lot unlock a
full NES game on card so I've actually
got one right here
Donkey Kong jr. and let's just play a
little bit I'll show you it actually
works just fine pretty interesting
consuming that's actually from a card so
see here I've not played this a long
time but I know you don't
hoo-ahh already but I'm as you can see
guys that's actually a full nes game
that you can play there were a variety
of the my believers Excitebike actually
I think there are about eight or nine
NES games that were released for the
e-reader but that was really cool so let
me show you guys one more thing about
this you just had to scan the card so if
we restart the Gameboy here and put
Cameron focus I'm go ahead and show you
guys how this works so I will actually
collect most of the cars that you could
get what pokemon cards i'm however there
were various other things for example uh
Animal Crossing that was pretty cool you
can do that as well so let's open this
up and scan some codes so there were a
couple of things I actually have three
here I'm like a mini game for you guys
right now
so with these pokemon cards and you scan
the bottom of it then it would be like
like for example information that kind
of stuff but if there is any cards with
like a code along the left you would
like to unlock stuff so let's scan this
here you just had to do it fairly slowly
but works pretty well there you go
that's one so as you guys can see here
on the screen it will say you have
obviously you have two more so if we
scan two more card which I have right
here allow us to unlock a minigame okay
so we have unlocked this minigame right
here so just give you guys a little demo
of it how it works so we can actually
start it now mostly the minigames were
not particularly amazing in fact I did
not even remember how to play this one
um there you oh we need to punch the
rocks I believe there we go huh which is
pretty cool considering this was a badge
it not work pretty well but any rate the
Evo is a very interesting add-on um you
could do a lot of things with it a
Nintendo was definitely kind of thinking
outside the box I mean even today if
something was released like that that
would be
cool to be able to just you know like a
card of course these are just like any
other card you know there's nothing
special about them it's just you know it
just bit is able to read the little
codes on the bottom but it was very cool
that it allows you to do a lot of things
so the other guys that's it for my
review of the e-reader a very cool piece
of old technology if you're interested
in picking one up eBay is probably going
to be your best bet
like I said outside of Japan they were
not very popular but I got this one when
they quit making them I got for super
cheap but if you guys interested you can
check it out very cool piece of old
technology and it was really innovative
so anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
