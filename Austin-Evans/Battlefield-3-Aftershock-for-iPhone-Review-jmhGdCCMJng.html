here with a review of battlefield 3
after shut for iOS it's closer to a
light version than anything else with
only a single map and no single-player
mode over since it's free you really
can't complain too much so let's take a
look when you launch the game you have a
few options there are three control
schemes to choose from but to be honest
I'm not a big fan of touchscreen
controls for first-person shooters and
this doesn't really do anything to
change my mind
you can also go to the armory and choose
between three guns with a fourth
unlockable if you watch a movie trailer
for active valor where you hit a bigger
snag is just trying to get into a game
it took me up to 15 minutes at times
before I was finally able to join a
lobby although I should mention the EA
has acknowledged the issue and said
they're working on effects since the
problem seems to just be not enough
servers hopefully it should be fairly
simple to get more capacity online the
same problems do exist inside games
while overall the game runs very
smoothly on the iPhone 4s occasionally
it will freeze up or lag which can be
quite frustrating when you shoot an
enemy with a full clip only to find
these already disconnected setting aside
server issues the game looks really
quite good there are nice lighting
effects everywhere and the audio is
solid
controls are no worse than most other
first-person shooters on iOS although
with the default setup it's easy to
accidentally shoot when you're trying to
move when it's running decently gameplay
is pretty good
although the map is almost too big as it
sometimes takes you a minute or two just
to find someone else
overall battlefield 3 aftershock as a
mixed bag right now it's not really
worth a download with the major lag
issues however assuming EA fixes them
then aftershock isn't bad at all
to me this just seems like a teaser for
a full game battlefield 3 on iOS anyone
anyway guys if you enjoyed definitely be
sure to leave the video a thumbs up and
if you want to be notified whenever I
post a new video like this be sure
