look at a lot of laptops this year but
these are my absolute favorites and huge
shout out to Intel for sponsoring this
roundup starting out with we have the HP
Spectre folio now a very recently took a
look at this and it is hands-down one of
the most unique laptops I've seen all
year long first of all we have the
design so it's made out of a hybrid of a
magnesium chassis paired with leather
that's wrapped all the way around and it
looks and feels incredibly premium
unlike a lot of laptops this does have a
standard hinge so you can use it just
like a standard notebook or if you want
you can pop out the magnetically
attached screen and use it here either
in the tent mode we can use the touchpad
or if you want to go completely flat you
have a nice little folio like many of
the other laptops in this roundup it is
powered by an Intel Core i7 eighth
generation processor in this case is the
8500 Y which means that not only is it
incompletely fanless so it's thin and
light but importantly it still does have
the power to run full-fledged Windows
apps what's really cool about this is
that it's an always connected PC with an
Intel modem that is built-in so with an
always connected LTE setup what this
means is that you don't have to go
around and hunt for a sketchy public
Wi-Fi or anything like that it makes a
big difference to the way that you use
the PC and I do feel like this is going
to be something we're seeing a lot more
in the next couple of years the biggest
problem with the Spectre folio is price
with the Mac top version with the core
i7 as well as the LTE modem it is a full
$1,500 but if you want one of the most
unique and coolest laptops that you can
buy right now the spectre folio
definitely fits the bill if you're
looking for something a little bit more
traditional the asou simbook s is
definitely one of my favorites the
Zenbook also has an interesting design
so this is what it suits calls ergo left
as you can see when you open up the
screen it gives a little bit of a lift
to the keyboard now this has
implications for things such as the
cooling but importantly pair with the
awesome keyboard this is one of my
favorite typing experiences of the year
it is so comfy to type on this guy for
long periods this really is the sweet
spot for a thin and light laptop you
have the portability but you also have
the power with that 8th gen Core i7
8550 you and on top of that you have a
pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports which means
that even though it's super thin it's
super light you can get some proper work
done on this guy it's not perfect
especially when you outfit it with the
4k touchscreen battery life is only
decent but when you put the entire
package together this is hands-down one
of my favorite ultra portable laptops of
the year another option is the brand-new
razor blade stealth now we're still well
into premium laptop territory here but
for such a thin and light form factor
we're getting a lot more performance
than you usually expect inside of course
you'll find the 8th gen core i7
processor but it's also backed up by an
NVIDIA MX 150 GPU now it's not
completely unheard of but this is a
pretty unique combination in such a thin
and light laptop which can not only play
some decent games maybe not on ultra
settings but importantly also has the
great build quality and the great
battery life to back it up it also has a
great screen and speakers the touchpad
is awesome and the keyboard is really
solid the important thing here is that
while it does have the power to do some
gaming importantly you're not
sacrificing anything as an everyday
laptop now if we really want to get
overkill with things we have the assume
G 703 which I sadly don't have here
because they asked for it back but this
is hands-down the craziest laptop we've
ever looked at with a $5,000 price tag
overclocked core I 9 processor GTX at
1080 full desktop-class GPU 64 gigs of
ram it's got a full 1.3 terabytes of
raid SSDs I mean this thing is literally
like a nerds dream as long as you're a
very buff nerd who can pick up the very
hefty I can't say it it is not remotely
practical in any way for the quad this
is my favorite laptops of the year how
can I not include the most ridiculous
overkill thing that we've taken a look
at well pretty much everyone a laptop
side next up we have everyone's favorite
laptop the crowd favorite known as the
Apple MacBook Pro so this is slightly
cheating since this is actually brand
new in 2016 however it did get a big
spec bump this year well the six core
Intel Core I 9 inside this is a properly
powerful system now know it might not be
quite as powerful as that g7o 3 but
there's also something that can be
picked up and carried by normal human
people a very important trait of a
laptop it's still got some of the best
build quality in the game and the basics
are pretty much all here with the slight
exception of the keyboard which is just
so-so when you put it all together this
is one incredibly expensive machine but
because we do so much stuff that is
specific to Mac OS specifically with
Final Cut it means that this is actually
one of my most used laptops this year
even though it might not necessarily be
my favorite if we switch over to a
slightly more reasonable price range we
have this the vive book F 510 UA
for just about $500 this is easily one
of the best laptops in the game right
now so one
important things that you should
probably keep in mind is that this is a
standard hard drive configuration for
500 bucks but for only about thirty
dollars you can very easily upgrade it
with an SSD and I definitely recommend
it it makes a huge difference and it
really nicely rounds out the rest of the
package with the Viva book even though
it is a fairly cheap laptop you're not
really giving up a lot and I think
that's very very important at this price
range so you've got an ace gen i5
processor a pretty impressive 1080p IPS
panel got a good keyboard good touchpad
plenty of ports there's really very
little that's wrong this laptop and that
is super super impressive at the price
okay so I am really really cheating with
this one but my next choice is the
Microsoft Surface go yeah you could say
this is a tablet but the way I use it as
a tiny awesome little Windows laptop
even leave base $400 version is built
well and you've got a decent amount of
performance thanks to the Pentium Gold
processor nothing too crazy but it is
enough for a 10 inch laptop on top of
that you've got a lot of the nice
surface features including the fully
adjustable kickstand as well as the
keyboard now yes if you take off the
keyboard it's a tablet so this doesn't
really quite qualify as a laptop but I
mean you should buy the keyboard you
should put it on it should live like
this and then it's eligible to be in my
video look ok I get it's not really a
laptop but I mean the way I use this
thing is just like a laptop it's got a
cut touchpad and a keyboard and I don't
know I actually really like the surface
go I think it makes a lot of sense and
especially because it has things like I
don't know a USB C port something that
some of the other surfaces could maybe
take note on this really is one of my
favorite cheap budget devices right now
especially you consider just how
portable and small and cool it is you
tell I really like the surface go now
say you want to game on a budget well
boy have I got the deal for you the Acer
Aspire fine this is a laptop we actually
took a look at very early in the year
and yet it is absolutely held up all
year long and that is for good reason
this is easily my favorite
recommendation if you want to get into a
low-end gaming laptop at $600 the spec
list is impressive you have a Core i5 8
gigs of ram MX 150 graphics a 256 gig
SSD you even got nice things like I saw
a touchpad and a backlit keyboard the
only real downside here is the screen
which while it is tane
unfortunately not IPs but you can look
past that in 600 she kind of should this
is a very impressive gaming laptop
considering that it shares a similar MX
150 graphics setup compared to that
razor blade stealth you should be able
to game at pretty decent settings again
that ultra but for $600 if you want to
get into an entry-level gaming laptop
the Acer Aspire 5 is still one of my
absolute favorite things I'm taking a
look at this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
