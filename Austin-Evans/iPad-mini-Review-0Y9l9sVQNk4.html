with a review of the brand new iPad Mini
coming in between 7-inch tablets like
the Nexus 7 and the full-size iPad hit
up that like button and let's take a
look to start with let's go over the
design one look at the mini and you'll
clearly be able to tell it's an iPad
although along with the smaller screen
you also get a smaller bezel I typically
use the mini in landscape because of
this
although iOS now ignores accidental
touches which works quite well along the
sides you'll see a small polished edge
which resembles the iPhone 5 and you'll
also find an aluminum back which matches
the color of your device one of the
biggest surprises for me is just how
thin and light it is to put it in
perspective it's closer to an iPhone
than the iPad and white which makes it
easier to hold and carry one of the most
common questions I've been asked about
the Mini is how's the screen there's no
getting around it this isn't Retina
display in the slightest while the panel
itself is quite good with nice
saturation and good viewing angles the
resolution is flat out bad most people
will be able to forget about it after a
little bit of time with the device but
for me one look at even the less than
spectacular Nexus 7 screen and I
immediately start noticing the lack of
details especially in text look past the
screen however and what you'll find is a
tablet that makes the full sized iPad
feel obsolete the size is still big
enough for the normal tablet experience
but it's much more portable iOS and s
are scaled down to fit the smaller
screen which means some things feel a
bit too small but it's something you get
used to overall though iOS is identical
so if you've used an iPad you'll know
exactly what you're getting here you'll
also find stereo speakers built in which
sound quite good and absolutely destroy
the quiet little speaker on the Nexus 7
as far as specs go the iPad Mini isn't
bad powering it is an apple a5 dual-core
processor clocked at one gigahertz and
half a gigabyte of RAM as this is the
same combo powering the iPad 2 and
iPhone 4s it's a bit outdated compared
to the latest and greatest but there's
still enough power to handle most
anything you throw at it next to an iPad
4 you'll notice the difference and it
will be nice to have more horsepower but
as of now it's perfectly acceptable
moving on to the App Store I definitely
have to say that abs are the best part
of the mini after using a nexus 7 for
the last few months I had forgotten what
it's like to use apps and games design
for a tablet practically everything from
the App Store works on the Mini and
there's enough quality stuff here to put
the iPad way ahead of any other tablet
out there
the iPad Mini features a pair of cameras
a 1.2 megapixel shooter up front and 5
megapixels out back quality is identical
to on the iPod Touch 5th generation and
iPad
or which is perfectly acceptable for a
quick shot but seriously don't take
pictures with tablets definitely not
cool
battery life is very impressive even
though the battery is less than half the
size of the iPad 4 you should still be
able to get 10 hours of mixed use and
even more just using the tablet to read
and surf the web the iPad Mini is an
excellent tablet and I don't hesitate to
say it's worth the $330 price of entry
as much as I love the Nexus 7 the mini
outclasses in design and destroys it in
app selection the screen is a sore
disappointment but not a deal-breaker
and performance and battery life for top
notch waiting for a Retina display next
year might not be a bad idea
but if you're buying a tablet right now
the iPad Mini is the best small tablet
period if you're interested in winning a
new iPad Mini be sure to check out my
giveaway here and don't forget to hit
that like button if you enjoyed anyway I
will catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
