at the Apple iBooks application so the
first thing you're gonna notice is that
it is a very nice looking at so it's not
like on the other two where it's just a
list and you scroll through usually have
a bookshelf here and all your books are
actually listed you know just like as if
they were an actual book so this is very
nice and you go ahead and scroll through
here you can search you can change the
view but I definitely like this so go
ahead and just jump into edit you can
also go ahead and do a couple things so
just move your books around or delete
them if you like
and another cool thing is that iBooks
does allow you to go ahead and load up
via iTunes unprotected ebook files so if
you have an ePub file that of course
does that have any copy uh copy
restriction or anything like that you
know it's just totally open can go ahead
and drop it on here and read it just
fine so that's definitely a nice little
feature I'm so let's go and just jump in
to see a journey to the center of the
earth or interior of the earth rather um
so you can see here that we can go ahead
and just scroll through now unlike the
other two it does not default to a full
screen you still have your status bar
out but not a huge deal I'm so you can
see here it does have the very nice one
do it slowly the very nice page
transitions it does a little bit better
than Google ebooks but again this is
kind of a you know a novelty it's not
the biggest deal in the world all over
what I will say is that the formatting
is excellent very very well done in
iBooks and of course this will change
varying depending on which books you
load up some won't look perfect so order
that's just going to be the fact for all
the apps that you use but all the ones
that you preload and all that kind of
stuff they should look pretty good so
you can see here we can go ahead and
scroll through really pretty nice and
snappy it's not too bad well we can just
tap and again it's pretty nice and
snappy so by touching this we can go
ahead and pull up the menu and there are
a few things we can go ahead and scrub
down on the bottom so we can go ahead
and just you know we decide that we want
to go to page you know 1200 1222 we can
do that really quickly but also go ahead
and add a bookmark we wanna remove it
the search feature just like any others
it works pretty well so we can go ahead
and search you know Auto and just click
search and able pretty pretty quickly go
ahead and pull up all the things I mean
all the different pages explain it we
can also search on Google and Wikipedia
so that works really quite nicely
now here's where you can go ahead and
actually customize how it looks so we'll
go ahead and increase the
sighs decrease it choose from a nice
variety of fonts so you cannot customize
the look now let's go ahead and turn on
sepia on and off so if you want to go
ahead and get a little bit of a
different look for your book you can
absolutely do that now another thing
that iBooks has over the other over the
competition channel go ahead and adjust
the brightness of the screen however you
like just straight from inside the app
now this is kind of actually cheating
Apple really does not allow anybody else
to do this and they put it in iBooks so
the other the other applications
couldn't do that they try but not a huge
deal we also go ahead and click right
here and take a look at the table of
contents as well as my bookmarks and
lastly I'm go ahead and just here and
then we can go ahead and just jump
straight out to the library we don't
really quite want to do that yet have a
go so just a little bit alike but no big
deal especially I'll go ahead and show
you there are a few other things so go
ahead and hold over this we do have a
few options we can copy it we can take a
look at the dictionary so by clicking on
this we can see what persuasion means
that's definitely a nice feature to have
a dictionary I don't let's go out and
just do this again we also highlight so
if I want to go ahead and grab let's say
that much whatever I can go ahead and
highlight it note it searched however I
want to do it and of course that does
think over through iBooks through all
through any of your other apps so there
we go that's iBooks the application
itself is pretty good so let's go ahead
and just jump back out here to the
library the reading is really pretty
sawed but one of the cool things is that
it also does have a store so you can go
ahead and download additional ebooks
stretcher inside the app not having to
go through Safari or anything like that
you know it works very similar similarly
to how the App Store works so I'm go
ahead and go through all this it's
pretty simple you can go ahead and take
a look at the books and the prices on
all three apps rather ebook stores are
gonna be roughly the same now sometimes
you might find a little bit cheaper here
a little bit cheaper there so I'm not
really gonna go ahead and get into that
because that's something that constantly
changes however I will go ahead and show
you guys the interface so you can go
ahead and take a look at categories
charge browse search all that kind of
stuff but that's all pretty
self-explanatory you show you what looks
like so I'm go ahead and take a look at
this one and once it loads up again
you'll find this very similar to the App
Store you can go ahead and take a look
tells you the name of it a little
the information such as the publisher
when it was published the size and I in
fact this is actually an e-book with
video in it so that's definitely
something that you're that you're gonna
enjoy and some books alone don't expect
you to see it in very many so we can go
ahead as with others go ahead and just
purchase it we can get a sample take a
look at reviews get some more
information about it so it's pretty
simple so no guys that's about it for my
overview and review of the Apple iBooks
application now I like this one a lot it
you know it's probably the most polished
it works very well and of course since
it is made by Apple it's really nicely
integrated into iOS 4 however there's
one major problem that I have with it
compatibility you know you can go ahead
and get this on your iPhone your iPod
Touch or your iPad however reading it
and other platforms is really not a good
idea it's not really not an option so if
you go ahead and purchase this on here
if you ever buy a Kindle or something
like that don't expect to be able to
read your books on there because you
won't so that's kind of a bit of an
issue and that's why I really can't
recommend iBooks either it's just it's
good if you only have Apple devices and
you know you won't have any issue but I
like if you're gonna be spending a lot
of money on books it's you I like to
have a lot of freedoms go ahead and put
my books on whatever I want
