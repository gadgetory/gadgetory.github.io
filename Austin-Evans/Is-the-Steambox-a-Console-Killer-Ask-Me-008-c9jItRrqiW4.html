here with ask me the show where I go
over all kinds of questions straight
from you guys so let's jump right on in
do you think the steam box will be the
console killer so if you guys haven't
caught up with it valve has announced
the steam box so this is about as close
to a steam console as we're ever going
to see but it's a little bit different
than say going out and buying an Xbox or
Playstation so the steam box is actually
a couple different things wrapped into
one first of all it's the hardware and
unlike an Xbox or unlike a Playstation
or a Wii this is actually something that
is basically open to anybody so you can
go build a steam box and in fact once we
get a little bit more information and a
little bit more fleshed out I'll
probably be building some steam boxes
but basically you just need to be you
know put a certain amount of hardware
together think the first things that
they've shown is like a core i3 and a
gtx 660 so fairly standard PC stuff
however on top of that they also do have
throne operating system steamos which is
a custom version of Linux and obviously
it's going to be supported with no steam
and quite a few games and the steam
library and everything but you know it's
better than just starting from scratch
so those are the main things that
actually make a steam box so you will be
able to buy one from valve there will
also be lots of different kinds of steam
boxes and all kinds of different prices
from very very cheap like 100 200 bucks
all the way up to a couple thousand
dollars for a super awesome gaming PC
and pretty much any of them can be
running steam OS so this essentially is
a cool thing not only for people who
want to buy a steam box but also who
might just want to be playing some games
and I have to buy Windows so good stuff
is it a console killer not really
convinced yet I mean obviously it's not
really even out so we'll have to kind of
wait and see but overall like and what
I'm seeing are you going to make a video
on the oculus rift I've seen it in the
background of your videos and it's
teasing me oculus rift yeah I'm not
really sure what you're talking about
what is your favorite video game console
slash portable that isn't of the current
or next generation that's a tough one it
would probably be between the
PlayStation 1 which was really my first
console and also pretty much the entire
range of game boys definitely the
gameboy color
that was my first Gameboy and I love
that and I played it forever and the
Gameboy dance SP was another one of
those consoles that I played for like 6
or 7 years even after new
versions came out it was just such an
awesome console and in fact I still got
both of those in fact I've got pretty
much all of my original consoles and I
do videos on them every once in a while
but I had to pick just one
probably the Gameboy Advance SP that
thing was so awesome why aren't you
playing GTA 5 right now
do you like the iPhone 5s better than
the iPhone 5 yeah I actually really like
the 5s so with some of you guys who've
been watching the channel for a really
long time no I was actually originally a
really big fan of iOS and I used that
for a long time however about a year and
a half or so ago I switched over to the
galaxy s3 and I've been on Android ever
since however when I got the iPhone 5 I
gave it a shot but I was just so tired
of iOS and it was just really just
wasn't doing it for me so I pretty much
immediately switched back to Android as
soon as I was done with the review
however with the iPhone 5s I've actually
been using this for the last few weeks
and I've got to say I'm really liking it
so that fantastic camera is honestly
short of maybe the Lumia 1020 the best I
found on any phone it also is super
snappy and super responsive and that's
something that a lot of people don't
really give us credit for and I do know
that iOS 7 has some weirdness as far as
like some transitions that take too long
but as far as the actual raw speed of
the phone the iPhone 5s is absolutely
the top of the you know any phone that
I've ever tried and also the size it's
not really my favorite thing it's a
little small but overall I've actually
been really happy with the iPhone 5s
while I stick with iOS we'll see but
just in the last few weeks really I
haven't had any major problems so thumbs
up for the iPhone 5s I've actually been
really enjoying it redheads brunettes or
blondes can I say hull of your boat but
redheads what is your opinion on eSports
and why I got into esports a couple
years ago when Starcraft 2 came out so
if you guys don't know eSports is kind
of like normal sports but with people
playing video games you know I know that
probably sounds really lame if you've
ever watched a gameplay channel or
anything like that it's the kind of the
same genre although obviously eSports
was much more focused on the pro side
with these guys we're actually making
their living playing games whether it's
Starcraft 2 or it's dota or its League
of Legends so yeah I'm actually a big
fan of eSports I think it's really cool
and personally I would probably rather
watch eSports than regular sports what
editing program do you prefer I edit all
of my videos on Adobe Premiere for
Windows and Mac so it's a fan
program that allows me to get a lot of
editing done very quickly does a great
job of just staying out of my way and
also runs very well on everything from
high-end desktops to lower end
ultrabooks and MacBook Airs
it does the trick so that's it if you
guys have any questions you like me to
answer next time on ask me let me know
over on Twitter Facebook or Google+ and
of course all of those links will be in
the description of this video anyway
guys thank you so much for watching if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
this video a thumbs up and I will catch
you guys next time I don't know what
that was how many pushups can you do in
30 seconds alright ready set go 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
