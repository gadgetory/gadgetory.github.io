positron
with the absolute best bang for the buck
graphics card out there a quad core
processor and top-notch SSD all wrapped
up in one of my favorite new cases the
positron is definitely the little
brother of the four thousand dollar
electron for a full ATX chassis it's
actually fairly small but take a look
inside there's plenty of room for future
upgrades with the white and black color
scheme a few hints of blue here and
there and a big window to show the
entire build off the positron looks like
no other PC out there it's got the
performance to back it up to well you
can definitely play games at 1080p with
the positron what it's really aimed at
is Max and games out at 1440p jump into
grid Autosport one of my favorite racing
games on PC and even on Ultra settings
at 1440p you'll still be pulling in just
under 90 frames per second move over to
Battlefield 4 and we're still getting
rock-solid performance with 56 FPS at
1440p Metro last light Redux is an
upgraded version of the already
excellent last light and here we're
still getting over 54 frames per second
on very high settings a new addition to
my benchmarks is Middle Earth shadow of
Mordor a game that's not only quite a
bit of fun but it also looks fantastic
with the optional ultra texture pack
installed the positron is still capable
of a framerate in the mid 50s powering
everything is an Intel Core i5 4460 CPU
for around 200 hours this is the best
processor out there with a quad core
design based on Intel's Haswell
architecture it might only be clocked at
3.2 gigahertz but don't let that fool
you this packs a serious punch and can
easily keep up with our graphics card
the real heart of the build is the EVGA
gtx 970 with 40 gigabytes of memory and
Nvidia is excellent new GM 204 GPU under
the hood this outperforms most of the
highest-end cards out there at a far
more reasonable 350 dollars a big chunk
of our budget is spent on the 970 and it
is 100% worth it not only can easily
handle 1440p gaming but it's not even
that power-hungry it's kind of insane to
think that you can get a graphics card
this powerful and $1000 build for the
motherboard we've got an MSI h97 guard
pro this is a full ATX board with
support for CPUs up to a core i7
6 SATA 3 ports as well as an m2 slot for
an onboard SSD along with 6 USB ports on
the back panel including 4 USB 3.0 on
the memory side the positron is using a
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance Ram
clocked at 16
megahertz this is really all you need
for gaming right now and while I'm
usually not a fan of big heatsinks the
blue nicely matches the rest of the bill
on top of that you can easily add
another eight gigabytes of RAM to the
positron if you ever want to upgrade an
SSD is a must for a build like this so
we've got a 256 gigabyte crucial m X 100
these are my favorite SSDs at the moment
not only are they about as fast as it
gets for a SATA Drive but the fact that
you can pick up a 256 gigabyte SSD for
around $100 it's hard to argue with like
the memory you can also easily add
another MX 100 if you really want to go
overkill on the SSDs we've also got a
one terabyte Western Digital blue hard
drive while SSDs are perfect for
installing windows and your programs on
a hard drive makes a lot of sense for
storing your normal files and it can be
nicely hidden away in the basement of
the case for the power supply the
positron uses a 600 watt corsair CX 600
I use CX series supplies in my builds
all the time because they're dead
reliable and can easily handle even a
powerful build like this this also goes
into the basement of the case it
attaches to the bracket and slides in to
be completely hidden to put this all
together we've got the NZXT s340 unlike
normal ATX cases it ditches the front
mounted drive cages which shortens the
chassis as well as lets you show off all
of your parts with the built in window
the SSD mounts nicely show off your
drives and the cable management is
outstanding for a case of this price
point you can get it in white or black
but I think the white really pops with
the black interior and top panel with
dual USB 3.0 now if you thought I'd like
the GTX 970 well you would be right but
I also really like the s3 40 in 60
really nailed the balance between price
performance and looks the positron is
hands-down my favorite build I've ever
done not only does it look awesome but
being able to max games at 1440p at
nearly 60 frames per second is insane
for $1000 as always I'll have links to
all the parts I use in the description
