an unboxing of new Samsung Galaxy s3 for
t-mobile the galaxy s2 is one of the
most popular Android phones yet in the
galaxy s3 brings some big improvements
so let's take a look the box is simple
and colored based on the phone inside in
this case pebble blue slip off the cover
and inside you'll get some box ception
action pop this one open and you'll be
greeted with the phone itself which in
true a boxing fashion we'll look at in a
minute
continuing on you'll see some paperwork
including the Start Guide warranty info
t-mobile terms and a recycling bag and a
bit of info on Samsung for enterprise
moving to less boring stuff you'll see a
microUSB cable for charging and syncing
a USB power adapter and some decent
looking in your headphones now under the
fun part take the screen protector off
and you'll see the galaxy s3 ready to go
one big thing about the galaxy s3 is
that all versions are very similar the
easiest way to tell them apart is to
look at the carrier logo on the back
speaking of the rear on the pebble blue
version the entire phone has a very
subtle metal like finish which I'm a big
fan of here you'll also find the 8
megapixel camera LED flash along with
speaker Samsung also continues to put
the sleep/wake button on the right edge
of the phone flipping it over to the
left side you'll see the volume rocker
and the curve profile of the phone up
front you'll see the physical home
button and the capacitive back and menu
keys you'll also see the excellent 4.8
inch 720p display as well as a little
look at the performance with Android 4.0
currently the galaxy s3 comes in blue
and white and will soon be available on
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon Sprint and t-mobile in the
US that's about it for my unboxing of
the new Samsung Galaxy s3 I've got a lot
more videos on the phone coming soon so
