the time has never been better to get
into PC gaming at $800 you've got a
system that's perfect for pushing games
at 1080p which is why the Neutron 2.0 is
a great way to jump into building a
gaming PC kicking things off we've got
an Intel Core i5 4460 core i5s have
always been solid choices for gaming
builds and the 4460 is no exception
we've got a quad core has well designed
clocked adapter 3.4 gigahertz this is
more than enough to keep up with
basically any game out there paired with
our CPU is an EVGA gtx 960 graphics card
based on Nvidia's latest maxwell 2
architecture the 960 is supporting 2
gigabytes of gddr5 memory a boost clock
north of 1,300 megahertz
along with three full display ports of
4k ready hdmi 2.0 port and a DVI
connector with EVGA ACX 2.0 cooler you
shouldn't have any issues keeping the
960 running at a solid clock speed tying
things together is the asus be 85 mg r
2.0 motherboard awesome name aside this
is a solid board with support for up to
a core i7 32 gigabytes of memory along
with eight USB ports and six SATA ports
for memory we've got eight gigabytes of
Crucial Ballistix sport memory with two
Dems running a dual channel mode at 1600
megahertz this is plenty of RAM for
today while still leaving two more slots
open for future upgrades an SSD is one
of the best upgrades you can do to your
computer so here we've got a 250
gigabyte crucial B X 100 this might be
one of the most affordable SSDs out
there but don't be fooled this is about
as fast as a SATA Drive gets while still
giving you 250 gigs of storage paired
with our SSD is a one terabyte Western
Digital blue hard drives can't match the
speed of a good SSD they still make a
lot of sense for storing tons of files
and games that you don't want on your
main drive for a power supply we've got
an EVGA 500 watt unit this was my first
time using the supply and I've got to
say I'm impressed
in addition to having tons of headroom
for powering the neutron it has an extra
pci lead and an 80 plus rating wrapping
the bill together is the brand new
corsair 100 our case this is rocking a
full sized ATX layout with a big window
decent cable management options a nice
looking front fascia with dual USB 3.0
port
put everything together and you've got
the neutron 2.0 but let's see how it
performs the big game I wanted to try is
Grand Theft Auto 5 this is an awesome PC
port of an already awesome game and here
the neutron is able to handle it on high
at 1080p at just over 60 frames per
second next we've got middle Earth's
shadow of Mordor which is another game
that's a good benchmark for a PC where
we're getting 68 FPS on very high at
1080p one of my favorite stealth
shooters Metro last light Redux is also
nicely handled by the neutron with just
over 55 frames per second on very high
settings
with a quad-core processor gtx 960
potent SSD and hard drive combo all
inside course tears sell a new 100 are
the neutron 2.0 is a great fit for 1080p
gaming as always I'll have all the links
you need in the description of this
video anyway thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
