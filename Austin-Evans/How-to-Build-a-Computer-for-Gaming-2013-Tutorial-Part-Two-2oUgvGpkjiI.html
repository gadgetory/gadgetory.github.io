here with part two of my gaming PC
tutorial last time we did the prep work
installed the CPU heatsink and RAM into
the motherboard and got it all set up
inside the case now it's time to install
the graphics card here we're using a
Radeon 7850 included is a molex to 6-pin
power adapter which we don't need for
this build a crossfire bridge a
QuickStart guide for installing the card
a disk with some drivers and software
and finally the graphics card itself
just like the motherboard you'll want to
be careful with it and hands up by the
shroud and PCI bracket so set it on the
box before we get it installed in the
case take a closer look and you'll see
the two fans mounted onto the heatsink
but beyond that it's a pretty
straightforward card just remove the
plastic protectors over the PCI
connector as well as your display out
and it's already come over to the case
and remove the thumb screw holding the
covers in place and then pop them out
the back
then remove the screw above it and pull
out the bracket so we have room to
install the graphics card bring the GPU
inside and line it up with the PCI
connector on the motherboard then press
it down until it clicks into place
replace the bracket above the rear slots
and screw it into place now take two
more thumb screws and secure the
graphics card in so it isn't going
anywhere that's it the graphics card is
installed time to drop in the hard drive
in this case a Western Digital caviar
blue come over to the bottom drive cage
and pull out one of the drive rails just
bend the plastic back a bit and line the
four metal pegs inside the corresponding
holes in the hard drive then just slide
the hard drive back into the case until
it clicks into place
The Prodigy makes this incredibly easy
the power supply is up next
included is a bit of paperwork on the
warranty and safety info the power cable
some electrical ties to tidy up our
cabling and finally the power supply
itself and all of the cables first thing
is to remove the four thumb screws
holding the bracket in place
now grab four more screws that came with
the case as we need to attach the
bracket to the power supply line it up
so that each of the four screw holes are
visible and then just like the
motherboard screw one corner in first
followed by the opposite corner and
finally the last two screws to make sure
it's secure like always go back and
tighten each screw once you double-check
everything is lined up now we need to
feed the cables into the chassis
first of all find a 6 pin connector and
bring it through on the right side this
will be plugging into the graphics card
next find the 8 pin CPU power cable and
you should be able to break it into a
pair of 4 pin connectors pull that
through the left side now bring the
remaining cables through the hole on the
left side so we have room to mount the
power supply pull the loose cables out
of the way making sure nothing is wedged
anywhere until it fits flush against the
back of the case make sure the power
supply fan is pointing downward just
screw the four thumb screws back into
the bracket and you get the power supply
installed time to get everything wired
up you should see cables with much
thicker connectors these are molex and
really aren't going to be used here
except for connecting a fan tuck these
back in beside the power supply to get
them out of the way for now
if you grab the side panel you'll find
all of your front panel connectors along
with USB ports first grab the large blue
cable this is for USB 3.0 it needs to be
plugged into the motherboard with all
the rest find the light blue connector
to the right of the heatsink and plug it
in thanks to a notch it only goes in one
way the rest of the cables are a bit
more tricky so keep in mind the little
arrows this means that site is positive
which is important to pay attention to
as we connect everything first grab the
cable labeled HD audio and connect it to
the motherboard behind the graphics card
it might be easier to remove the
graphics card if you can't get at it now
find the manual for the motherboard and
look up the pin out labeled system panel
connector this is the easiest way to see
where the rest of the cables connect but
be mindful of plugging the positive and
negative ends correctly or else you'll
have to go and fix them later behind the
RAM is where you'll find the connectors
I won't go over each and every one but
they just slide into place like the
audio take your time and make sure each
is inserted correctly it'll save you a
headache later if your power button
isn't connected for example at this
point you should have everything from
the side panel connected it is a bit
tedious but no big deal really now find
the lead we ran from your power supply
labeled PCIe which should be a 6 pin
connector plug it into the back of the
graphics card it should click once it's
inserted next up find a large 20+4 pin
cable from your power supply this goes
to the motherboard plug this into the
light blue connector behind your RAM and
again it will click once it's properly
connected next up find the cable with
the long flat ends these are SATA which
are what you'll use to power hard drives
and optical drives thanks to the little
notch these will only go in one way
attach one to the hard drive it doesn't
click so make sure you get it inserted
fully this is the same process if you
want to use an optical drive in your
build except in a five and a quarter
inch Bay grab the CPU power connector we
ran through earlier and if you haven't
yet break it apart as this motherboard
only needs four pins instead of the full
eight click it into place and you've got
the CPU powered and ready to go now grab
the fan header that's wrapped around the
or heatsink and plug it into the
motherboard beside the CPU power
connector make sure the wires are out of
the way the fan you also see a three pin
connector attached to the rear 120
millimeter fan this connects to the
header right beside 2 SATA ports move to
the back of the case to find the second
3 pin for the rear fan here you'll need
a 3 pin 2 molex adapter which I've got
linked in the full build guide pull a
molex lead out from beside the power
supply and attach the adapter then tuck
it back so it's either way then attach
the fans of the adapter and you're done
here find a SATA cable that came with
the motherboard we just need to attach
the hard drive now like the SATA power
connectors these are notched so they're
easy to install plug your hard drive or
SSD into one of the white SATA ports and
then the other end into the hard drive
both ends should click into place now
that everything is cabled up it's a good
time to double-check it's all properly
connected and ready to go come back to
the power supply and plug it into the
wall and flip the switch on connect your
build to a monitor and keyboard and then
reach around to the power button and
give it a shot
you should see all of the fans in the
bill begin to spin and after a minute it
will post and give you information about
your parts on screen if not no worries
just power the system off and double
check everything is connected the last
step is cable management which is
basically just tidying up your wiring
with the electrical ties I won't go step
by step here but basically just group
cables together and tuck them out of the
way once you're done close the side
panels up congratulations you built a
computer if you're interested in more
check out part three where I go over
setting up the BIOS installing windows
and doing some performance tests to see
how well it performs don't forget to hit
up that like button and I will catch you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
