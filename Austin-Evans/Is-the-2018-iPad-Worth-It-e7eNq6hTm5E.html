iPad and at $330 it seems like the one
to get however there's always the
question is it worth it take a look at
the box and it looks like well every
other iPad ever flip it over though and
what you're going to see is that it is
called the 6th generation iPad because
you know iPad 6 doesn't have the right
ring to it
really what this is this is the lower
end iPad that slots below not only the
iPad Mini which for some reason is still
around but also the iPad pro so Apple
actually announced this at their
education event just a couple days ago
and the main idea with this is that the
iPad at least on the lower end is trying
to be a Chromebook competitor now for
schools
I get why Chromebooks are so popular and
there are some advantages to the iPad
especially the pencil support which
we'll get into in a few minutes however
whether this is actually a good ideas a
little bit more questionable open it up
and we see it looks exactly like every
other iPad ever so if this looks a
little bit familiar to you that is
because actually really haven't changed
the design on this guy for quite a while
so previously they did have a lower end
$330 iPad and as far as I can tell
hardware-wise it is completely identical
inside we're going to be getting our
paperwork which I'm sure it's gonna
include stuff like Apple stickers and
other things that you're never gonna
want to actually use we do have the USB
to lightning cable as well as the power
adapter which this guy is going to be 12
Watts which is actually still a little
bit slow for something like an iPad it
actually was going to take a while to
charge but I mean sorry you bought a
$300 I had I just imagine Tim Cook in
his office like yeah sorry if you wanted
to actually charge in less than three
hours you're just gonna have to you know
buy an iPad pro and a lightning to USB C
cable and a macbook charger because
money so for some context this is the
2017 ipad which is exactly what this is
going to be replacing now this is
actually something that we use pretty
much every day around the office so
while we're shooting we'll usually put
like notes up on this or use it to look
up specs and that kind of stuff and if I
put this side-by-side with the 2018 iPad
you're going to see it they look
completely identical besides well the
different colors one of my main
complaints against the 2017 iPad is that
there's actually a kind of fairly large
air gap with the display so it is still
going to be a nine point seven inch
Retina display and it looks fine when
you look at it directly head-on
however unlike the higher-end iPad pros
which have a laminated display which
makes it look like it's pretty right on
the glass take a look at this at any
kind of angle and you're going to see it
the screen looks like it's sunken in now
unfortunately if you take a look at the
2018 iPad it has the exact same screen
finally you look at it dead-on if you
look at it from the side it definitely
looks like there's a huge air gap one of
the big upgrades with the new iPad is
going to be on the inside so where's the
last generation model use the Apple a9
processor from the iPhone 6s this bumps
up to the Apple a10 from the iPhone 7
still not going to be super cutting edge
but it's fast to the iPhone 7 and it's
fast here on the iPad take a look at the
Geekbench results and it's pretty much
identical to the iPhone which is well a
solid thing I mean this is a $300 iPad
one thing you should keep in mind though
is that this still only has 2 gigs of
RAM now for normal apps that's going to
be no problem and it does support a lot
of the same multitasking features as the
bigger iPads however you cannot actually
get 3 apps up at the same time like on
an iPad pro and of course to show off
the power of the iPad we have fortnight
so this runs really well on a wide range
of hardware and the idea that we do have
that Apple a10 processor actually does
make a pretty big difference you're
running it quite on the same level as
something like the iPhone 10 but it
still looks really nice for a lot of
apps you're actually not going to notice
a huge difference with the Apple 810
it's going to be snappier for sure but
it's not like a revolutionary difference
but considering that this is going to be
a 300 hour iPad every little bit of
extra performance is going to be helpful
and of course one of the biggest things
to consider is how long this is going to
be having updates how long it's going to
actually be supported by apps and having
that newer processor does make a
difference especially when you're using
this three four five years from now it's
so we're playing this on an iPad I mean
it totally works but man I think with
this bigger screen I really wish I did
have a controller before they actually
add that controller support at some
point so the screen is decent like I was
saying earlier it doesn't quite match
the iPad pro but I mean come on for 300
bucks I don't think you're really going
to be complaining now some other areas
that it doesn't match the iPad pro end
is with audio quality so you do have
stereo speakers but they're both on the
bottom so they sound decent but I mean
you can cover them both with one hand
but it's going to be totally fine for
casual video watching another new
feature of the iPad is going to be Apple
pencil support which weirdly up until
now has been held back to the iPad pro
now it works exactly as you'd expect so
you can use it to navigate the interface
or you can actually use it to do drawing
and typing if I can actually hit the
correct thing so if I want to just write
out a simple note here it actually is
gotta look pretty decent so the only
thing this is missing is the promotion
display from the iPad pro so that
actually does help cut down latency by
running the screen at 120 Hertz as
opposed to 60 but for most people I
think there's gonna be totally fine for
writing notes and that kind of thing
no one-size the new iPad were a couple
of other accessories but the mostly
aimed at the education market which i
think is kind of the main market that
Apple is sort of aiming for with the
iPad so so many schools right now are
using Chromebooks and I think for most
schools the Chromebooks make more sense
I mean it's a proper laptop you have a
keyboard whereas with this guy you know
if you unplug your Apple pencil what
you're gonna find is no smart connector
so you can't even use the same keyboards
as the iPad pro you're going to have to
rely on something that's going to be
either using bluetooth or you're just
gonna have to use something over
lightning which is just not an elegant
solution sure you can get some typing
down on the actual touch screen but I
think for most kids you can want an
actual keyboard now software wise of
course we are running iOS 11 now there
are pros and cons here I actually do
think that Iowa's 11 was a pretty major
update to the iPad so you get some
things like I actually have the doc you
have the multitasking which all works
well here but again it's fine as an iPad
as something that's going to replace a
computer for some people it's fine but
for a lot of people it's not quite there
yet I actually think the 2018 iPad is
worth it now sure you can get extra
features and bigger screen sizes with
the iPad pro but it around twice the
price on some of the SKUs I don't think
it's gonna be worth it for most people
this is going to do pretty much
everything you need even though it might
not be the most exciting update in the
world and of course the real question is
whether you need an iPad in the first
place though and that one's kind of on
you but I'm curious what do you think
about the 2018 iPad let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
