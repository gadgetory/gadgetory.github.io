fan of tablets the HP slid looks like
it's finally on track to be released
very soon so of course if you've heard
the story you know the HP Slate we've
been hearing that and talking about for
quite a while recently looked like it
was not going to be coming at at all
they said pretty adamantly that June
would be the release date and obviously
June has come and went and we haven't
heard a word about it so probably what a
lot of people thought myself included it
was that since HP bought palm for over a
billion dollars they're going to go
ahead and get rid of the HP Slate and to
do more like a palm sort of tablet
running webos but guys it does look like
that they will be releasing the windows
7 based HP Slate and hopefully pretty
soon I'm so guys this all comes from a
leap HP product page actually on the
website I suppose they were just put it
up a little too early or whatever this
show basically that the HP Slate would
be coming out and then we'll be coming
out with a new name HP slate 500 on so
I'll talk about the specs interesting in
just a minute but that name actually
really kind of sticks out to me as of
course that iPad costs five to six seven
to eight hundred dollars depending on
which one do on it probably the HP Slate
actually will probably be 502 is what
obviously the name implies enough could
be wrong but I believe that that would
make sense is that HP Slate if it's on
par with the iPad as far as price I do
think it will do pretty well so the
specs include has an 8.9 inch
touchscreen now one interesting thing is
that they mentioned that they would be
compatible with the stylus so this
really well could be very helpful if
you're in planning on your writing notes
or especially if you're an artist you
need to know really nicely sized tablet
to draw on in addition it has a 1.6
gigahertz intel atom processor which is
roughly about what most netbooks have
these days so it won't be you know
really all that powerful but hopefully
shouldn't do pretty well so anyway guys
I'm not looking forward to the HP Slate
I was afraid it was good you know it was
totaled honor but it does look like it
will be coming out fairly soon according
to this product page anyway I'm so guys
definitely stay tuned i will definitely
keep you up to date anyway thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
