you how to install windows 8 and in
VirtualBox this is probably going to be
the best method for installing windows
as instead of having to you know dual
boot or you know find an old computer or
you have to deal with partitions and all
that kind of stuff if you just simply
install it in VirtualBox very simply
very easily without any major fuss so to
do this you're going to need a couple
things first is going to be the
VirtualBox software this is entirely
free and you can download it from the
link in the description of this video on
top of that you also need the ISO now
there are two different rule actually
there are three different versions
there's a 32 64 bit if there's a 32 bit
64 bit as well as a 64 bit with
developer tools download whatever one
you want i will be using 64-bit for this
tutorial and just download it again both
links will be in the description so once
you have everything you need go ahead
and open up VirtualBox and click new you
see here it says the new virtual machine
window wizard click Next now here we
need to connect our operating system so
what we're going to do is tell it that
we have Windows 7 so if you have Windows
7 32 bit just click that or 64 bit like
me you click 64 bit alright so now we
need a name so we'll just put Windows it
doesn't really matter too much there
next is a ram now basically the more ram
you can afford the better so for example
i have 8 gigabytes of ram so i can just
go ahead and a lot for gigs to this now
that's not actually going to like take a
four gig block out of your ram or
anything but what it will do is that's
the maximum it can take so if you have 4
gigs in your consistent you probably
won't go like 2 or whatever but that's
entirely up to you i next is to go ahead
and create a boot hard disk so just
click create new hard disk if there's
not I checked and click Next
you're going to need to create the disk
itself this is really simple you can
just click VDI again just now just hit
next to punch and then you have two
options dynamically allocated and fixed
size dynamically allocated which just
basically creates a file on your hard
drive that pretends that it's a hard
drive you can do that but in it'll
change the size if you need more but I
like to do fixed size just because it
seems to be a little bit more stable so
you can certainly do that and you just
decide how big you want and the minimum
is pretty much going to be 20 gigs but I
recommend doing something more like 30
or so you have some more space 40 or
something like that
now this point I need to do is hit the
create button it will take a little
while so maybe take 5 10 minutes
whatever to create your virtual machine
I've already done this so we'll just
skip on to it
and we have Windows 8 let's go ahead and
double-click it and we have the first
run wizard so we'll click Next and find
our installation media so as you guys so
you just hit this little green arrow
thing and select that ISO that we
downloaded hit open and click Next
so says you know selected to make sure
that it is the proper thing which it is
click start so at this point is gonna go
ahead and start booting up figuring out
everything you guys gonna see here it is
working so it's gonna take a little
while to get the files loaded in there
we go so we have the windows developer
preview alright so once you get to this
screen it's super easy just make sure
that the language and everything is
correct click Next
rather click Next again click Install
Now and from here it will take a little
while
obviously you're installing Windows it's
you know three or four gigabytes or
however big it is so what you need to do
is just be patient here allow it to
fully run through I will go ahead and
show you the license terms and all that
kind of stuff and again let's click on
that click Next now instead of upgrading
we go ahead and install a new and since
we only have the one disk just click on
that hit next and it'll take again just
one minute and now it's going to be
copying all our files so at this point
you can safely go away from the computer
go sit and chill and you know it could
take a little while so just God you know
it's chill for a little bit and I'll be
right back as soon as it's done alright
so once it's done installing everything
we just need to do one quick step enable
for it to boot so we need to go ahead
and right-click our windows 8 or
whatever you decide to name your virtual
machine and click settings and then what
you need to do once it loads you need to
come down to storage and you'll see this
it's going to be the yes this one it's
going to be the windows developer
preview what you need to do is come over
to this and remove it so we're going to
go ahead and remove that click ok and
we're going to open up our virtual
machine once again alright so once it's
done loading you will see a screen just
like this so yeah I'm sure you guys can
handle it by yourself oh go ahead and
walk you guys through it show you
exactly what the first boot is like so
we need to create a name so just create
I'll say Austin click Next oops and
click Next and this is of course the
first look that we've had at me Metro UI
which I think it looks really quite nice
anyway guys we are now officially in
Windows 8 so after a little bit of setup
and whatnot we are gonna be good to go
you can see here the interface is
working just fine we can click over
you're come back to our desktop and come
back over to the interface here scroll
through and all that kind of stuff so
guys it's gonna be about it for this
video if you guys enjoyed definitely be
sure to leave a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more Windows 8 videos be
