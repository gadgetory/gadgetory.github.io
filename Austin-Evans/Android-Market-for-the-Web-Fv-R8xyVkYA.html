first look at android market for the web
now google just announced this so i just
give you a tour basically what it's all
allow you to do is you know go through
browse through and download applications
on the web and they will automatically
download to your android device it's
pretty cool so as far as the interface
goes i like quite a bit did you see here
on the top you've got a you know a
featured slider where a few of you know
the major apps along the left side of
the home page you'll find categories
which is gains application etc etc i
also find a list of the best-selling
games and of course you can see featured
along with top paid and top free so with
the top free let's just take a look at a
let's take a look at angry birds I know
once you open it up and of course every
page will be a little different you can
add different things but uh this will be
pretty much what it looks like you'll
see Angry Birds it'll show you the icon
tell you the ratings which has a lot of
ratings you'll have the install button I
can go ahead and see more from the
developer you also see related which is
pretty cool we can actually go go
through here and see other applications
that are similar now up here you'll see
you can see the description you can go
to the website see screenshot so you
know obviously if you don't know what I
mean person looks like can take a look
at those take a look at reviews there's
a lot of stuff here in addition there's
also you can go ahead and tweet it so if
I decide hey I'm going to go tweet check
out this app I can do that you can also
take a look at reviews what's new so for
example if you know you want to see
what's up with the latest updates and
another really cool thing is you can
take a look at the permissions there's a
lot of cool things about the android
market and of course you can buy both
free and paid ones so definitely guys if
you have an Android device check it out
it is market android com just go there
on your browser obviously works with
chrome now I actually do not know if it
works with other browsers of McCrumb I
would imagine it does but I haven't
checked it so you might want to check
that out for yourself anyway guys thanks
