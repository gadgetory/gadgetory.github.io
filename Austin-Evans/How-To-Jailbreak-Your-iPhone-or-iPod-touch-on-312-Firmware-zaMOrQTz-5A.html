state and want to show you guys how to
jailbreak your iPod Touch iPhone the
whole deal pretty much using the new
program Black Rain as you can see here
I've got it all set up and ready to go
so you know what let's just go and jump
right into this okay so before begin
there's a couple things you will want
taking into consideration first of all
this is not for everyone if you have an
iPod Touch first or second iteration
you're good if you have any iPhone as
long as you don't rely on the unlock
you're okay but if you do need the
unlock you really probably shouldn't do
this because to use Black Rain you need
to update it and you will need to
restore it through iTunes and that will
totally destroy your unlock for now so
if you plan on it if you plan on needing
your unlock I would not use this yet
wait for something else to come out or
black rain to be updated or something
but what you should not do this now
likewise if you have an iPod Touch 3rd
generation this will work but you will
need to go ahead and make it a tethered
jailbreak what a tethered jailbreak
means is that any time it turns on and
off not sleep I mean on and off
basically you will lose the jailbreak
and you'll need to rerun this entire
process so if you really want to you
mean it's you can with the iPod Touch
3rd generation but it might not it's not
gonna be I mean it's not gonna be that
great still up to you so anyway so I
have my ipod touch done the purposes of
video I've already done this but
basically you just need to take it and
restore it so I have gone went ahead and
restored it and it will take a while
because it will need to basically
download the three point one point two
firmware and then it will need to go
ahead and wipe your whole device out
takes maybe depending on your connection
3045 minutes whatever to do it you will
lose everything so that's just something
to keep in mind ok so once you've
restored it you're basically about that
so all you have to do is open up Black
Rain now have links to everything in
Black Rain ok so let's go ahead and open
it up go ahead and run that okay so now
let's go ahead and show you guys what
this all does
okay so once you have restored your
device and you have downloaded installed
black reigned you go ahead and open it
up now at this point it's very very
simple okay you just need to make sure
that your device has been restored into
three point one point two firmware and
it is connected via USB to your computer
okay so once you've done that what is it
let's now come over here and click make
it rain now instantly your device will
go black you see here automatically goes
into recovery just a moment and you see
here all this will pop up but instantly
you see that the boot logo will come up
and as soon as you see this you know
what you're done you've got it's
downloading everything right now now I
can see here the jailbreak is done once
the phone reboots this is a simplest
jailbreak ever blah blah he wants you to
donate and unfortunately today like now
basically it's downloading all the
information rebooting and all that kinda
stuff and you only take a moment
and of course you see that all this kind
of stuff will pop up you see iTunes and
but you don't have to worry about any of
that
it's got sit tight look at the boot logo
you see here and yeah guys that's it you
get this is three point one point two
and of course this will work for all
devices with of course the third
generation I touch being a little kind
of unstable but let's leave cuz you got
to you know have a tethered but you know
it still works pretty well so let's go
ahead and should be just bad done shuts
off and here we go
and yeah that's it you know you have all
that but you got your device right here
it's done that just let it wait through
and I will just show you guys at the
last a little bit but you jailbroken
or it's connecting and disconnecting to
my computer which you know it's almost
done and there we go so let's go ahead
and slide that in lock and you can tell
that we have it because there is black
ring now I'm gonna go ahead and show you
guys how the Black Rain is going to work
because instantly you do not have city
and everything okay so I don't actually
have this connected to the Wi-Fi yet but
basically you can go ahead and install
Cydia Rock and IC or any combination of
the three now once you get here
obviously you only want Cydia and if you
want Rock and I see you know go for it
but for now guys you jailbroken that's
it so yeah it's real simple
fantastic jailbreak um you know what
probably the easiest jailbreak I've ever
seen so big pops guy go out to geo hot
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
