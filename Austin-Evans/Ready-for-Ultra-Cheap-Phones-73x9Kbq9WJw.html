for ultra cheap smartphones so in front
of me I had the moto g4 and blue r1 HD
what makes these phones interesting is
now it comes in the box but what's
actually inside these are the first two
phones that come with ads pre-installed
straight from Amazon so the Moto G 4 is
$150 and the blue r1 HD is only $50 the
ads themselves are actually not too bad
so for the most part it's just something
on your lock screen so if you're not
interested swipe it away and it's no big
deal
now if ads really aren't your thing you
can't buy the full price versions of
these phones however you do need to be
either an Amazon Prime member or at
least sign up for a free trial to be
able to get the ad versions of these
phones as far as software goes there are
a few pre-installed Amazon apps but
besides that you're getting a very close
to stock version of Android and on top
of that it is Android 6.0 marshmallow on
both phones you know as far as build
quality goes I think I actually slightly
prefer the blue it for me at least is a
little bit of a nicer size and
impressively it feels as tight if not
even more solid than the Moto there's
pretty much no flex in the chassis even
though it is plastic it feels like a
really well-built phone something you
might wanna consider is upgrading to the
$60 version of the r-1 HD now that give
you double the RAM at two gigabytes but
it also doubles your storage 216 moto G
4 is no slouch either it's actually
feels a little bit lighter mostly
because it's a bit of a large yet thin
phone so with the g4 you get a couple
extra features so first of all you can
actually remove the back and now I can
you swap this out with different shells
this also gives you access to the micro
SD card slot as well as a sense lot
well the g4 does have the advantage in
screen resolution I actually slightly
prefer the color on the r-1 HD it might
not be perfect but not even consider
gets a $50 phone the screen is solid as
far as cameras go the blue has an 8
megapixel shooter where the Moto G 4 has
13 megapixels to work with there's
actually a little bit more detail with
the blue image however I like the
exposure on the g4 more um it's almost
like the Motorola phone is kind of like
softening the detail a little bit
whereas the blue you're getting just a
little bit more noise however there's
just more detail there one interesting
feature of the blue is that not only
does it have if I'm a pixel front facing
camera but it also has a flash but this
super weak that is so soft Wow
is kind of terrible first of all this is
way wider and I mean I look goofy but
the camera did a good job
yeah there's no comparison here the fun
physics camera is way better on the g4
of course the ultimate test for any
smartphone is can't play pokemon go and
i'd say can i didn't say i could i said
the phone can handle it I'm gonna get
this I have done a lot of videos on
cheekbones as you guys have probably
noticed however the thing that really
interested me is that not too long ago
you have to pay a lot of money to get a
decent smartphone over today we're
looking at 150 or even a $50 option
which honestly is good enough for most
people as always I will have links to
both these in the description of this
video and I'm curious what do you guys
think about the rise of ultra cheap
smartphones let me know in comments
below and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
