today we will once again be revisiting
the browser showdown this time we have
several updated browsers to cover we
will take a look at Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox Opera Internet Explorer
and Safari to see which is the king of
the hill so let's take an in-depth look
at all five browsers to see which one is
definitively the fastest before we begin
let me explain a bit about the tests as
always a is a variety of tests to get a
good base of numbers to decide which
browser is the fastest each browser was
fully updated to the latest beta or
alpha release at the time of making this
video with the exception of chrome which
is on a nearly identical beta release in
the case of Firefox and especially
Internet Explorer the browsers are quite
incomplete and I expect much to change
between now and the release all the
tests were run on the same Windows 7
computer with this close to identical
conditions as possible to start out with
iran celtic cannes javascript test the
test was run ten times in each browser
with the highest and lowest scores taken
off in the rest averaged out as you can
see chrome did a great job scoring over
300 points investing opera and Safari by
nearly 100 points any Explorer 9 scored
decently with Firefox taking up the rear
next came the Peacekeeper benchmark
peacekeeper is a great overall browser
test that covers a wide variety of tests
and again chrome came out on top by
considerable margin notching the
impressive score of over 3300 Opera Kay
mixed with a still decent score of 2736
with Firefox Safari and Internet
Explorer following behind the acid3 test
covers how well a browser adheres to web
standards but it's close to being
outdated chrome opera and Safari all A's
the test with a perfect 100
or with Firefox almost there with the
score of 96 an internet explorer with 68
the next test that was run is the Google
v8 benchmark which is a pure JavaScript
test not surprisingly chrome smoke the
competition with offer finishing a
fairly distant second
Safari followed up with Firefox and
Internet Explorer behind it continuing
on we have the SunSpider test this is
one of the best indicators of browser
speed around the test was run as total
of nine times per browser and the
results were just a bit different from
previous tests chrome and opera 1 yet
again but Internet Explorer put up a
good show by beating Safari and Firefox
by a decent margin lastly we have a new
test the spinning images this is a test
from the Internet Explorer test drive
suite and consists of all five browser
logo spinning rapidly on the page the
frames per second of each browser was
recorded and as you might expect from a
test design frenat Explorer it won by a
nice margin putting down a butter smooth
55 frames per second this is due to the
fact that IE 9 can call on the GPU to
run complex tests and this test shows
how much that helps opera while behind
on paper didn't do too badly either
pulling in as stable 33 frames per
second and looking almost the same as
Internet Explorer Firefox ran it very
choppy but Safari and Chrome fell
totally flat managing Amiga 3 and 2
frames per second respectively as web
sites aren't yet coated for hardware
acceleration however this test is moved
for the immediate future unlike the
three previous browser tests while the
winners are clear none of the browser's
are embarrassingly slow like in the past
all five are quite fast and day-to-day
web browsing although as an alpha
Firefox could be a big glitchy and
Internet Explorer well it doesn't even
have a back button yet or a UI at all
really so it's safe to say that these
two browsers will be cleaned up and soon
all five will be solid but there is a
big difference between being fast and
being the fastest
in fifth place by a hair is Firefox not
counting the spinning images test it
would have come in fourth just barely
but counting in the fact that ie 9 will
allow sites to tap them to the GPU of
your computer that will be a big thing
in the future so the edge goes to it
the difference between the alpha build
and normal firefox 3.6 isn't that large
as of yet though PES version 4 nears I'm
sure will be speed up considerably until
then however it finishes last in speed
fourth place goes to Internet Explorer 9
to see a version of Internet Explorer
not in dead last and a speed test is
something I haven't seen in a long time
which is definitely impressive as the
platform preview is picking up speed
with each release it could very well be
on par with Chrome and opera by the time
Internet Explorer 9 is released the fact
that it can also handle hardware
acceleration is also impressive and
could stand to help it in the future
4th place it is solidly in third place
is Safari for Safari really hasn't
changed much since June of 2009 when it
was released but even so it still is no
slouch in speed not long ago it was
neck-and-neck with chrome to be the
fastest but now it's a distant third
place to both opera and chrome it still
is a competent html5 capable browser but
it's going to be until version 5 before
they see it challenged to be the fastest
second place goes to opera 10.53 the
winner of the last overall browser test
opera is out of alpha and is still
nearly at faultless browser in both
speed UI and features however this is a
strict speed test and there's no doubt
that it finished behind chrome in every
single normal speed test I threw at it
it's almost ashamed as opera really is a
fantastic browser and I like it a lot
but in the end it just couldn't keep up
so the winner is chrome which gets its
fastest browser crown back after losing
to opera in the previous test the latest
beta update has brought with it a big
boost in speed making it the clear
winner in the Speed Department the UI
and add-ons certainly don't hurt either
so if you're looking for the fastest
browser around
no farther than Google Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
