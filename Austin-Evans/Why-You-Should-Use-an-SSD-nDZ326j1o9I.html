going over some of my reasons on why you
should get an SSD so if you've been
watching the channel for any length of
time you know I love SSDs they just make
everything better
it ranges but anyway they are really
really good and there are a bunch of
reasons why you should have an SSD on
your computer if you look at computers
today almost everyone is moving toward
SSDs so take for example the MacBook Air
and the MacBook Pro both of these now
only come with an SSD same thing goes
for Windows ultrabooks you're pretty
much always going to find they're going
to come with an SSD as opposed to a
normal hard drive but before we get into
all the reasons why why we just take a
look at what exactly an SSD is SSD is
short for a solid-state drive and this
is another type of hard drive your
computer sees at the exact same way
however it functions in a very different
way more likely the computer you're
using to watch this video right now is
using a mechanical hard drive now this
is basically a series of platters almost
like a DVD although not really but it
has a little on that will read the data
off of the disk now this is great they
have lots of storage and hard drives
have been around for a very very long
time you take a look at an SSD you'll
see this is just a series of flash
memory chips this is the very similar
stuff to what you will find in an iPhone
and iPad even in an SD card for your
camera probably the biggest reason to go
with an SSD is because of the speed an
SSD will be able to boot your computer
in seconds as opposed to minutes and
applications will open almost instantly
as opposed to waiting 10 15 20 seconds
for Photoshop to open and since there
are no moving parts in an SSD that means
it is going to be generally more
reliable so for example if you have a
laptop with a normal spinning hard drive
right now if you drop it or shake it
around there's a very good chance that
something could happen and you could
lose your data on the hard drive whereas
with an SSD it really doesn't matter
SSDs have been around for a while now
however the biggest problems has just
been priced as generally SSDs for the
amount of gigabytes you get or just not
going to compare with a normal hard
drive there are lots of SSDs out there
but some of my favorites includes a
crucial m4 you can pick up a 128
gigabyte version of the m4 for 105
dollars if you want to step it up to 256
gigabytes it's still only going to be
two hundred four dollars another one of
my favorite drives is the Samsung 830
series now this one's going to be a
little bit more pricey however
especially if you're using a Mac I think
it's really worth it
so for 128 gigabytes you can pick up for
about $125 and for 256 gigabytes it's
going to run you about 240
six dollars of course prices on these
things are always changing and usually
going down so I'll have links to the
current prices of everything in the
description of this video once you get
your SSD I highly recommend downloading
ccleaner as usually you're only going to
have 120 or 240 gigabytes of storage
every bit matters and it helps to get
rid of all the kind of junk that's on
your drive that's exactly what ccleaner
does it will delete all kinds of random
temporary files
well not random just anything it's not
necessary since thing goes for system
files that aren't being used so lots and
lots of programs will have unnecessary
files just cluttering up your drive and
all the kind of normal things including
your recycle bin it allows you to easily
uninstall programs all that kind of
stuff best of all it's available for
both Windows and Mac and it's totally
free overall SSDs are awesome I have one
of both my laptop and desktop and it
really makes a huge difference I don't
care if you have the most powerful
gaming PC in the world if you're running
it off of the normal hard drive you're
really missing out I'm curious to know
what do you guys think use an SSD if you
do let me know in the comments I know a
lot of people who look at SSDs and go
why do I want to pay this much more for
this less storage it doesn't who cares
but it really I'm very curious to know
do you guys think that the switch to an
SSD was worth it because for me worth it
100 thousand million percent thousand
million two thing anyway guys if you
enjoyed this video definitely sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
