MacBook Air you may have seen our video
last year where we took a look at why
Apple is still selling this laptop in
2017 and of course they're still selling
at an Apple stores today but my question
is does it actually make sense to pick
up a used model so this is the 2014 11
inch MacBook Air and fun fact this is
actually the exact laptop that reviewed
almost five years ago thankfully video
quality has improved a lot since then
the good thing is the design actually
doesn't feel all that out-of-date so
you're still getting the solid aluminum
chassis which feels good even by today's
standards and you have to remember the
MacBook Air was kind of the first
Ultrabook so even though it might not be
quite as thin as something like the
12-inch MacBook it's still going to be
much thinner than the vast majority of
laptops out there again
it's like $500 on eBay right now so
where you can really tell the MacBook
Airs
age is with the display so the 11 inch
air is rocking a 1366 by 768 panel
definitely not Retina quality and it's
really not great even on a small display
like this the bigger issue though is
that it's going to be a low quality TN
panel color is not going to be great
there's very little contrast and the
viewing angles leave a lot to be desired
honestly it kind of feels like a budget
to maybe 300 on a laptop that you buy
today now don't get me wrong it's not
exactly going to be a deal-breaker but
when you're picking up a MacBook Air in
2018 the low quality screen is
definitely something that you're going
to notice thankfully though something
that hasn't really aged to much are the
rest of the inputs the keyboard is still
better than stuff like the 12-inch
MacBook in my opinion it's got good
spacing it's still going to be backlit
and the trackpad is also better than
most Windows laptops even today so the
only real difference between this and a
newer MacBook trackpad is going to be
that you actually can't click on the
front as opposed to the forced touch
that you get on the new MacBook Pros and
the idea that's just going to be a
little bit smaller
besides that you're getting every little
bit of the functionality and every bit
of the smoothness that you would expect
from a Mac go take a look at the specs
it's actually not going to be all that
much out of date so this is going to be
powered by a fourth-generation hazle
processor most of the mac books had Core
i5
although I did off to upgrade this one
to the i7 mostly because I actually used
to do video editing on this but for the
most part the performance is really not
going to be too far off a modern laptop
and more
normal less super depending tasks like
um don't try to game on your MacBook
gear or don't try to do 8k hgr raw
editing on it but besides that for
normal stuff it doesn't really feel that
much slower one thing you should keep in
mind is that a lot of these MacBook Airs
only had four gigs of RAM it's going to
be usable but if you're able to find a
model with eight gigs out of the box
it's going to make things a lot better
something that I did not do to my
macbook air when I ordered it back in
2014 is upgrade the SSD this guy only
has a hundred and twenty eight gigs of
storage now to be fair it is going to be
a PCIe SSD and it's actually going to be
faster than a lot of SATA drives for any
say the drive that you find today but
with only 128 gigs of storage
you better have lots of external hard
drives around if you want to do anything
serious now believe it or not I actually
used to edit pretty much all of my
videos when I was on the go on the
MacBook Air but things have definitely
changed since then
so instead of shooting on a DSLR at
1080p with a fairly low bit rate instead
now we shoot everything in 4k
we're shooting primarily in ProRes and
it's going to require a lot more data
and a lot more processing power to work
with however I actually switched over to
Final Cut since then which is fairly
well optimized and because we shootin
pro res I think the MacBook Air might
actually stand a decent chance of being
able to edit although it might also
horribly crash and burn so they give you
an idea of what we're working with here
this is pretty much all going to be 4k
pro res so some of it was shot on a red
and some of it was shot on sony fs7
but for the most part it's going to be
fairly straightforward and the good
thing is find out that actually does
work with pro res would be well if we
actually open up the project we're gonna
see here is the performance really is
not going to be bad and mind you this
has been rendered but if I turn up the
volume here that's not bad at all no
this isn't already edited timeline but
if we want to go in and do some color
correction to simulate what it would be
like if we actually didn't have
everything rendered and have it already
start playing back here go to full
screen stopping a couple frames at full
quality but I would say for the most
part this is going to be usable where
it's really gonna slow down though is
when it comes to actually exporting so
no you probably shouldn't go out and buy
yourself a MacBook Air just to go do
some video editing but especially when
you're working with stuff
final cut as well as ProRes which are
very well optimized to work on this kind
of hardware it actually is going to be
usable although I probably won't bring
this guy back out of mothballs to edit
cauliflower videos again one of the nice
things about going with a 2014 model of
the MacBook Air versus an earlier one is
it does have the Intel Haswell
processors now this was the last time
that there was a huge leap in battery
life so when this thing was brand new it
was able to get between 6 to 7 hours on
a charge now today obviously with a
slightly older battery it's a little bit
closer to say four four and a half
considering this is an older laptop with
not and it particularly user replaceable
battery having that kind of life in an
older laptop is going to be super
helpful and of course because this was a
premium laptop at the time it does have
a toe 2.11 AC Wi-Fi you know Ethernet
jack because it's a Apple MacBook from
after 2011-2012 whenever they dropped it
but you're still gonna have fast Wi-Fi
which again it's gonna be pretty much
the same as a current Mac up today there
are two ways of looking at this so on
one hand it's kind of crazy that a
nearly five-year-old laptop has held
almost half its resale value but on the
other hand it kind of makes sense when
you compare this to something like a
brand new 13-inch MacBook Pro which is
way over double the price you've got a
lot of the same features besides the
garbage town display but if you're using
it for lighter stuff you really are
gonna notice a huge difference however
one of the things you are going to be
losing are those newer processors the
better battery life but I think for most
people especially considering the price
it's actually not going to be a bad
pickup so I'm curious would you guys
ever want to pick up a used macbook like
the air and of course for a run the same
money you could get a new budget laptop
but there are going to be pros and cons
on both sides so let me know what you
guys think and if you want to see a
comparison with this than some of our
other budget laptops anyway guys thank
you so much for watching and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
