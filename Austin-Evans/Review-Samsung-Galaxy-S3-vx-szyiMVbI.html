with a review of the Samsung Galaxy s3
for t-mobile as one of the most
anticipated phone launches of the year
there's a lot riding on this but is it
any good also be sure to stay tuned to
the channel because I'm going to be
doing a giveaway of one of these bad
boys here pretty soon
thumbs up for that that okay let's just
do the review to start with let's go
over Hardware the galaxy s3 is rocking a
4.8 inch Super AMOLED HD screen with a
resolution of 1280 by 720 technical
jargon aside it can be summed up pretty
easily the display is huge an excellent
looking text is very clear and colors
really pop thanks to the 306 pixel per
inch screen the size also gives you tons
of room for content which is a huge plus
if you're coming from something smaller
such as the iPhone I still like the
screen on the HTC One X more but at this
point I'm basically splitting hairs
both phones have phenomenal displays the
galaxy s3 comes in two colors blue and
white I have the pebble blue variant and
there are some differences including a
metal like textured finish up top is a
speaker grille notification LED
proximity and light sensors along with
the 1.9 megapixel front facing camera
below you'll find the physical home
button along with capacitive back and
menu keys for some reason Samsung likes
to put the sleep/wake button on the
right edge of the phone instead of up
top like most other manufacturers it's
certainly not a big deal but it is
something to get used to on the left
side is the volume rocker you can also
see they've made it look like it has a
taper with the accent the bottom
contains your microUSB port as well as
microphone flip it around back and
you'll see the 8 megapixel camera along
with LED flash and a speaker one nice
thing about the Galaxy is that you can
still remove the rear cover which is a
feature more phones iPhone could include
here you can also easily get at the
battery micro SIM card as well as at a
micro SD card of up to 64 gigabytes to
add more storage to the phone overall I
like the design there are a few odd
things such as the physical home button
combined with two capacitive ones and
the all plastic build that said being
able to replace the battery and having
our micro SIM helps a lot it all reminds
me a bit of the first Galaxy S it's
nothing spectacular but you won't hear
any complaints out of me as far as
software goes there's a ton to cover so
let's jump right on n the galaxy s3
currently runs Android 4.0.4
aka Ice Cream Sandwich with
triskin generally I'm not a fan of skins
for Android but I get to say TouchWiz
makes a pretty good case for itself with
a ton of unique features some a bit
silly but some are generally great one
thing Samsung really is pushing are
their new motion features these allow
you to do things like call a contact by
bringing the phone up to your ear you
can also mute the phone by flipping it
over the calling of contact is pretty
useful but most of the others aren't as
much as they only work in specific apps
instead of system-wide there are also
other interesting features smart stay
uses the front-facing camera to monitor
your face to see if you're still using
the phone and will show off the display
if you aren't I expected this to be a
gimmick but honestly it works quite well
for the most part and didn't call it any
noticeable battery drain poplu player is
also really cool if you're watching a
video in the default video player you
can press a button and the video will
overlay on top of the screen and allow
you to do anything you want impressively
this only slows down the phone very
slightly and can be moved around
anywhere on-screen do you want probably
the biggest downside is that this
doesn't work with any other video
playing apps but it's still a nice
feature
you'll also find Samsung's answer to
Siri s voice what's the weather going to
be like in Los Angeles tomorrow the
forecast for tomorrow always mostly
sunny
in general it works but the voice is
pretty grating and there's no doubt that
it just isn't up to the accuracy or
level of functionality that Apple's
gotten joke's on the other hand it can
definitely handle tell me a joke okay
why did the chicken commit suicide to
get to the other side the galaxy s3 also
has built-in NFC you can use this to
beam files from Android devices or pay
for things with Google Wallet but
something pretty cool or tech tiles
these are little NFC enabled stickers
then when you tap your phone against
them they can launch an app make a call
or change a setting it will cost you $15
for a pack of five but as you can
reprogram them - pretty neat there are
many more additions but overall TouchWiz
does a good job of adding functionality
to Android without being bloatware as
you can see the phone is still very
responsive right up there among the best
I've ever tested it's powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 system on a chip
with a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor
and Adreno 2 to 5 graphics
select in the US version of the HTC One
X where it differentiates itself is with
a whopping two gigabytes of RAM apps
tend to stay open forever and everything
runs butter smooth the camera is pretty
familiar it's got the same sensor from
the iPhone 4s needless to say it's
excellent as far as smartphone cameras
go and it's also backed up by solid
software the camera app is quick and has
some cool features including burst shot
to take up to 20 pictures in just a
couple seconds as well as being able to
snap 6 megapixel stills or recording
1080p video
all right so I'm now recording using the
front-facing camera on the galaxy s3 as
you guys can see here the quality is not
half bad unlike my hair anyway it is a
1.9 megapixel shooter so of course you
can take stills as well as the 720p
video I know it's definitely nothing
amazing for a front-facing camera it is
not half bad at all to be more than that
for Skype for Google+ chats and you have
taken your hair out in the mirror the
galaxy s3 is available on all the major
US carriers including AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
Sprint Verizon and US Cellular I'm
taking a look at the t-mobile version
however they're all identical beyond a
few preloaded apps and the respective
networks they support t-mobile relies on
HSPA+ whereas the rest come with LTE
I'll be taking a look at a Verizon model
soon to see how LTE impacts battery life
but with this I was able to get through
a day of usage without any issue
whatsoever
speaking of cellular the galaxy s3 does
a perfectly respectable job I have poor
t-mobile service in my area but the s3
was able to hold on to a signal very
well and call quality is really quite
good
there's a lot to be said about the
Samsung Galaxy s3 let's start with what
I don't like which is a pretty small
list s voice is underwhelming the build
quality is good but nothing spectacular
and I still find Android lacking in a
few minor areas compared to iOS on the
other hand the screen is great speed is
top-notch the battery is good enough I
found that the camera it was absolutely
excellent it may not be perfect but I
can honestly say the galaxy s3 has now
surpassed the HTC One X as my favorite
phone out there it really is that good
if you guys enjoyed this video
