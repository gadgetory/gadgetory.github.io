here with a review of the on live micro
console on live is a very different way
of playing games and using an ordinary
console or PC it works by streaming your
games from the cloud using the Internet
as opposed to playing them locally using
some sort of disc like most consoles
today it's like the difference between
watching a blu-ray on a player beside
your TV or streaming it using Netflix
this allows the online console to be
small really small it's quite well
designed with a pair of USB ports for
connecting an optional mouse and
keyboard upfront and generous selection
of ports on the back you'll find HDMI AV
a 3.5 millimeter audio jack optical
audio Ethernet and power not bad for a
console that's roughly the size of a 3ds
what you won't find is Wi-Fi which can
be a problem if your TV isn't near your
router you also get quite a few
accessories with the console including
cables for HDMI micro USB for charging
wireless controller Ethernet as well as
the OnLive controller itself speaking of
I quite like the controller it feels
like a mix between the Xbox 360 and ps3
controllers with a very solid build and
good layout using OnLive is as simple as
it gets
once you create your on live account you
have access to several features the
first is the arena which allows you to
watch other people who are playing games
live since it's all strained this only
takes a few seconds to load and can help
you get a good idea of what a game is
like before picking it up there are also
bright clips where you can save clips
from your games to brag about
pretty cool huh as far as buying games
goes it's all done online through the
OnLive service there are two options
buying the game straight up or getting
the play pack the play pack is like game
fly you pay $10 a month and can play any
of the games in the play pack as much as
you would like not every game on online
is in the play pack but there are quite
a few you also do get a short demo if
you want to give a game a shot before
dropping your cash on it all this is
pointless without talking about the
actual gameplay itself though right on
this front is just like how it runs on
your PC Mac or Android phone or tablet
and almost entirely depends on your
internet connection online recommends at
minimum a two megabit connection and
recommends five megabits this doesn't
entirely sum up what you need however I
have an 8 megabit connection and while
it usually runs reasonably well
if for example someone gets on Netflix
or uses up the bandwidth while I'm
gaming the quality and latency will
immediately drop off quite a bit when no
one is trying to sabotage my games
everything works fairly well considering
that every control you send is being
sent hundreds of miles away to the
nearest online location I'm quite
impressed you will notice some slight
lag between pressing a button and seeing
something happen however it's something
I got used to pretty quickly for most
games it's no problem
however for some fast paced games like
first-person shooters it can be a
disadvantage games are streamed at 720p
an upscaled to 1080p the console and in
general the graphics are similar to what
you'll find in consoles you do get some
slight pixelation and loss of sharpness
but overall it's not bad and it's only
something you'll notice if you're quite
close to the screen on live in the micro
console are very different from any type
of gaming that's currently available you
get a lot of very cool pros including
being able to play any game in seconds
being able to play the same games on
everything from this tiny console to an
underpowered Mac or PC to even some
Android phones and tablets the play pack
is awesome for the price and is honestly
one of the biggest draws to using on
live and finally the console itself is
downright cheap as far as video game
consoles go at only $100 with it
occasionally being offered for free with
the purchase of a big-name title on the
other hand on life is entirely when I
say that I mean entirely reliant on your
internet connection if it's out or even
slow the playability of games will
rapidly fall off you also have to be
tethered to Ethernet or use something
like a Wi-Fi bridge to get a connection
which can be complicated and increased
lag there are also aren't that many
games available for it although there is
a decent selection of top-tier games
with more added all the time overall I
recommend giving OnLive a shot using the
free client for PC or Mac first just to
see if it will run at all if it does
then I can honestly say that the online
micro console along with the play pack
is one of the best deals in gaming if
