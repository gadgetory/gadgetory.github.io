the photon 2.0 so for $5.00 this should
be a pretty solid computer but first we
have to put it together so $500 is an
interesting sweet spot you're getting a
system that's going to be a lot more
powerful than one of the ultra budget
rigs well still not being that much more
expensive than something like a console
for the case we have the thermal take
versa h15 I actually really like this
chassis so not only is going to be
fairly affordable which is definitely
appreciated on a build like this but
you're really not losing a lot so we
have USB three we have a full 120
millimeter fan around back now
importantly especially if this is your
first computer build there's plenty of
room inside so it should be fairly easy
to work on cable management and height
and not be quite so clean and we'll see
in a few minutes but this should be a
great chassis to start with powering the
photon 2.0 is this 500 watt EVGA power
supply this is actually a little bit
overkill for what we need right now
however with that 500 watts of capacity
that means that you have a little bit of
extra capacity if you want to do some
upgrades which is always nice and it's
still an 80 plus certified supply which
means that now is it efficient that also
should be fairly well quality eyes for
the motherboard we have a gigabyte h1
10ma now this is a fairly basic
motherboard to be fair however the most
important thing is is that you have a
lot of future expandability options so
while you can rock this guy for now
which makes the photon a great system
for today over this will support a core
i5 core i7 we can pump up the memory
there's a lot that we can do this is a
great starting point powering the system
is an Intel Core i3 6100 now I'm
actually a pretty good Vanacore I freeze
for gaming builds so especially on the
budget side while you can go AMD I like
the i3 for the expandability options so
here we have 3.7 gigahertz a raw dual
core hyper threaded fury honestly this
is actually fine for pretty much any
game out there with that hyper threading
it allows it to act like a quad-core
processor so most any game should run
fine on the core i3
and we're getting it like 100 bucks so
it's hard to complain remembering we
have a gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix
sport ram now I like this for a couple
reasons
first of all eight gigs of DDR 4 clocked
at 2400 megahertz is totally fine for
anything we want to do today and
amazingly enough it's also ready for
upgrades so because this is a sink
them that means that we have a full
extra slot here if you want to ever
upgrade so for example if you want to
bump this up to 16 gigabytes it's super
easy powering everything is the new EVGA
geforce gtx 1060 graphics card now this
thing is no joke especially when you
consider this is a 500 allah gaming
computer build we're here spending most
of our budget on the card however that's
a good thing graphics cards are easily
one of the most important parts of a
gaming computer so this is a three
gigabyte version of the card however
it's still going to be powerful enough
to handle literally any game out there
so around back you have up to five
display outs so if you want to go multi
monitor crazy you can so you might not
want to game on five monitors at once
and it also shares a lot of DNA with its
bigger brothers the 1070 and the 1080
all in all a great card for the builds
rounding things out we have a one
terabyte Western Digital blue hard drive
now I've used these and a ton of gaming
PC built in the past they're rock solid
reliable while they might not be the
fastest things in the world if you don't
want to go full SSD and this is gonna be
a lot cheaper than that this is gonna be
completely fine however as always I feel
like I've said this like a million times
with this build it's very simple to use
an SSD on top of this to get nine of the
capacity but also the speed however for
now we're just rocking the blue alright
so the photon 2.0 is done however now
comes the fun part
how does it actually perform get into a
game like GTA 5 and you'll see we're
easily capable of running on very high
settings at 1080p with a solid 60 FPS
this is a great example of getting
better than console graphics and a
rock-solid frame rate moving on to a
title which has been a staple of my
testing for a while we have Middle Earth
shadow of Mordor
here again we're easily able to play on
Ultra settings at 1080p at well over 60
frames this is a title you could
probably bump up to 1440p and still be
fine getting into a DirectX 12 game we
have ashes of the singularity this is a
much more demanding title that
especially taxes the CPU but even here
we're able to play on extreme settings
at 1080p with around 38 fps as always
all the links you guys need to build
this will be in the description as well
as a full tutorial on how to put
together a gaming computer and you also
may want to stay tuned to the channel
may or may not be a giveaway going on
pretty soon catch you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
