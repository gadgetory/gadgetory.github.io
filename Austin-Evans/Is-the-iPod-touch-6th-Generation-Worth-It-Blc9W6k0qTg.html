years Apple's finally released a new
iPod touch
but is it worth it pick up the iPod and
the first thing you'll notice is just
how slim it is coming in at a millimeter
thinner than the already sleek iPhone 6
the iPod Touch looks just as good as
ever
design-wise it's basically unchanged
which means it looks a lot like a
smaller iPhone 6 from the protruding
camera lens support layout Apple dropped
the dubiously useful iPod Touch loop and
add a few new colors including space
grey and gold but otherwise it's very
similar we've still got a solid 4 inch
Retina display like the iPhone 5 and 5s
and a standard home button instead of
touch ID which is a bit of a shame the
real change though is inside the iPod is
now rocking the Apple a8 processor from
the iPhone 6 which means it should be
way faster than the last generation run
Geekbench and you'll see it's basically
on par with the iPhone 5s and a full
five times faster than the last iPod 4
gaming performance in 3dmark again
there's a big advantage over last
generation and it even narrowly
outperforms the 5s in real use the iPod
is absolutely snappy absolute
multitasking fly and with it running iOS
8.4 out of the box you've got a couple
new additions like health to track your
fitness gaming is rock solid as well
with demos like epic Zen garden really
showing off the power that's lurking
under the hood demanding titles like
vainglory are no problem for the iPod as
are lighter fun games like Leo's fortune
it might not be a dedicated game console
but the new iPod touch handles games as
well if not better than the iPhone 6 and
6 plus there's also a new 8 megapixel
camera and this is another big step
forward Apple tends to put good cameras
in the iPhone and the iPod Touch is no
exception
things are really nicely detailed even
with the relatively low megapixel count
even without turning on HDR the iPod
does a good job of capturing a lot of
dynamic range in a renders color nicely
with the tiniest amount of depth of
field for things like portraits video
comes out at 1080p and it's good it
likes the smooth autofocus of the iPhone
6 but it has the same impressive
stabilization it also has 120 frames per
second slow motion just like the 5s
which looks good for 720p video we've
also got an updated 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera for that selfie
action the new iPod Touch is also
rocking Apple music right out of the box
just like basically all iPhone apps it
runs fine on the iPod but while this
Green is nice the speaker falls short of
an iPhone at $200 for the 16 gigabyte
model the new iPod Touch is a much
needed update it might not work as a
phone but it's a big step forward and
design and performance compared to
anything else in this price range if you
want 90% of the iPhone experience for a
third of the price it's hard to argue
with the new iPod Touch and it just so
happens that my buddy Jon from TLD and I
are going to be giving away a pair of
these this is going to be a Twitter
exclusive giveaway so be sure to follow
us both on Twitter we'll be announcing
how to enter soon neither guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
