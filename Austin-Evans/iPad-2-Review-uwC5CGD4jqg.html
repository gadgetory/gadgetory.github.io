tablet dating all the way back to the
days of the iPod excited Apple fans the
world round watched as more and more
sources and rumors flew all exclaiming a
brand-new tablet PC that would do two
netbooks and laptops but the iPhone did
to the smartphone market the rumors
covered everything from a touchscreen
MacBook to a 12-inch version of the
iPhone On January 27th 2010 Apple CEO
Steve Jobs finally announced a
long-awaited Apple tablet the iPad with
the release of the iPad 2 Apple has
improved on the original formula of the
impressively popular iPad one in several
key areas right off the bat you'll see
just how thin the new iPad 2 is and a
mere third of an inch thin holding the
iPad 2 is just like holding a thin
notebook the tapered edges of the tablet
slide nicely in your fingers and make
the iPad 2 perfect for just lounging
back and surfing the web or using apps
it is also lighter coming in at a mirror
than 1.3 pounds all of this adds up to a
great experience in using the iPad the
hardware is very clean in true Apple
fashion the front is dominated by a nine
point seven inch IPS display with a
resolution of 1024 by 768 the display
which carries everyone from the original
iPad is slightly lower resolution than
competitors such as the Motorola Xoom
however it still looks great with
fantastic viewing angles you'll also
find the trademark home button which
backs you out to the springboard along
with a front-facing VGA camera along the
sides reside a switch that can mute the
iPad or lock the orientation a rocker to
turn up and down the volume and on the
top you'll find the sleep/wake button
and a headphone jack the back of the
iPad is a solid piece of aluminum which
not only looks great but feels nice in
the hand toward the bottom you will find
a speaker which is surprisingly loud and
clear perfect for watching movies at the
top left there is a 0.7 megapixel camera
capable of shooting 720p HD video
neither camera is particularly great
however they serve their purposes before
face time speaking of face time Apple's
video chatting standard comes with the
iPad 2 with it you can video chat with
friends who have an iPhone 4 and iPod
Touch 4th generation or a Mac with
FaceTime installed it generally works
really quite well and it's certainly a
nice feature to have on the iPad 2 the
iPad 2 runs iOS 4.3 the exact same
operating system from the iPad 1 which
itself is derived from the iPhone it is
very simple and intuitive to use with a
list of your installed applications on
the home screen there are a variety of
pre-built apps that come with the iPad
including photobooth a YouTube
application the iTunes and App Store's
Google Maps the iPod player this is for
a web browser and more in addition you
can download some of the thousands and
thousands of apps available on the App
Store making the iPad 2 the most
compelling tablet as far as apps go
while the interface is great and works
there are features that could be added
Android Honeycomb tablets have a great
variety of widgets that can be placed on
the home screen which is certainly a
feature that the iPad could adopt the
technical specs include a new 1
gigahertz dual-core Apple a5 processor
along with 512 megabytes of RAM and a
power VR SGX 543 MP GPU put together
this means that the iPad 2 absolutely
screams able to load full desktop web
pages in the same time as most laptops
and handle very graphically intense
games despite all this battery life is
really impressive in such a thin package
depending on your usage you can expect
anywhere from 8 to 11 hours of juice on
a single charge typically on the higher
end of that and falling perfectly in
line with Apple's suggestion of 10 hours
so overall what do I think of the iPad 2
well it's a stellar device for viewing
the web playing games watching videos
and so on the much thinner design makes
the iPad 2 great to hold and much
thinner than any other tablet on the
market today well it's certainly not
perfect as the screen could be higher
resolution and the cameras could look
better as if they were made in something
you know not like 1999 overall the iPad
2 offers the best combination of
features and design
on the market today not even counting
the fact that it's considerably less
expensive than many of its competitors</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
