today I'm here with an application view
on actually a pretty interesting
application called jewel falls um you
know guys when I first got this
application I look at and I was like
this seems odd when I first started
playing it it was good but not amazing
but the more play the 1 i'm addicted
it's i just have to show you it's pretty
cool alright so looks so basically you
have there you know go into the main
menu and it's really really simple game
but the more you get into it the more it
just it's just really cool i'm just
going to show you guys on their settings
and instructions and scores basically
it's very simple i do recommend taking a
look at the instructions though on
because there are at first it seems
really simple but the more you get into
it the more you actually that's actually
pretty in depth ok so there's three
different modes there's marathon rush
and time attack you know i'm going to go
ahead and do a time attack and unless
basically the difference is our time
attack is where they've seen fifteen
thirty and fifty thousand points
basically just how long so i'm just
going to show you guys 15,000 points ok
now I'm gonna have to okay now first now
this is one way you can play just I mean
that's totally this the entire game
right there okay now it seems pretty
simple right but there's different
things you know let's just go ahead okay
now if you take one thing goes white if
you see I got a triple multiplier one
two three one two and then there and
then of course you can just wipe your
hand around which is really cool because
it's not a difficult game it's as hard
as you know if you keep your hand on the
screen you say here I'm getting them
their lunch and basically what the
object of it is just simply destroy the
things now I mean guys it's not an
amazing application I mean you know you
never realize you've never been able to
live without it but it's a fun game I
mean it's like it's not hard that's a
problem with a lot of games are just so
hard you know I mean you can spend time
being it this is a really simple virtue
if you guys can hear music
set for a second but it's got some nice
kind of background music and I mean if
you want you just like shut your finger
around and you know just go Tackett
tattoo that mean you use lots of
different fingers and but the fun of it
is just trying to get just going through
and go just swiping through grab and
grabbing them and the way it works was
clear earlier basically what you do is
you can just you know swipe through or
you can basically take it and with your
finger without moving it dragged across
to look up like grab those two I'm glad
that grab those to see this little
multiply multiply of things that come up
basically you get in or two multiplied
your points so it's a really cool
application um no it's very very simple
there's two other modes there we go did
there's two other modes go ahead use
festivus there's two other modes they're
both very simple let's just go and show
you real quick there's rush we should
kind of opposite you have so many so
much time to get the right amount of
points there's a marathon which is just
go forever and basically it's just a
little black like you see little black I
guess Jules what up and basically if you
hit one of those you kind of lose a life
um but guys that's the whole application
right there seemed really simple because
it's totally dead simple but that's it I
mean it's not an amazing application I
mean you can't it's not like you can't
live without it but it's fun definitely
pretty addicting and you know I'm
enjoying it it's cool I mean you can't
fail I mean it's it's just like you just
get better and better which is something
really like been most anything anyway it
is 99 cents currently in the app store
um you know guys I think check this
thing out it's it's cool i mean yeah i
mean ninety-nine cents that's not bad
it's fun i mean i'm i'm just rambling
but it's it's a cool application so you
know check it out anyway guys thanks for
