here it's a video to see exactly how
important a CPU really is for gaming now
it's really tempting when you're
building a new gaming computer go spend
a lot of your budget on a core i5
however is that really necessary one of
my favorite CPUs right now is the AMD
athlon x4 750 K it's essentially just an
810 5800 K with the integrated graphics
disabled however that still means you're
getting a quad core CPU that can clock
up to 4 gigahertz for only 85 bucks on
the other hand we have the Intel Core i5
46 70 K now this is pretty much the
default choice for most gaming pcs
however at $230 it's well over double
the price of the Athlon so is it worth
it to test
I used three graphics cards first of all
we have the Radeon 7770 which you can
find for about $100 and it's a solid
entry-level card moving up to a
mid-range card
there's the Radeon 7870 which will set
you back about $200 lastly for some
complete overkill action we have one of
the fastest graphics cards around a GTX
780 which comes in at 650 dollars to
start let's see how each CPU matches up
with a budget Radeon 7770 in the
firestrike benchmark inside 3dmark we
really don't see much of a difference
with the core i5 narrowly edging out the
Athlon battlefield 3 takes this a step
further where the Athlon actually
slightly edges out the core i5 although
this is basically inside the margin of
error Metro last light which is not only
a very fun game but also basically a
next-gen title gives a slight edge to
the core i5 but it's clear the graphics
card is the bottleneck here as well
lastly we have Crysis 3 and this is the
same story if you lose a couple frames
per second with the Athlon but both CPUs
handle it no problem if you're on a
budget it seems pretty clear that for
almost $150 less the Athlon 750 K is
more than that CPU however what happens
when we bump this up to a mid-range card
with the Radeon 7870 we start to see a
bit more of a difference here in fire
strike as the Core i5 is able to stretch
its legs a bit but even here we're only
looking at an 11% improvement going back
to Battlefield 3 it's clear that it's
hardly CPU bound at all even with a 7870
as we're back into essentially a Thai
Metro last light is the first game to
really
advantage of that extra CPU power is
here we're looking at about a 30%
performance increase interestingly
Crysis 3 remains mostly held back by the
graphics card with just under a 10%
improvement when using the core i5 I
think this comparison was the most
interesting as the athan really did put
in a good showing the only game that saw
a substantial increase in performance
was Metro considering the core i5 is
well over double the price of the Athlon
it kind of makes it a hard sell now for
the fun part testing with the GTX 780 in
firestrike the Core i5 is really able to
stretch its legs beating out the Athlon
easily with a 780 we finally see
battlefield 3 start to get a little
bottle necked but even here both CPUs
handle it on ultra settings at well over
60 frames per second metro continues to
really enjoy having that extra
processing power delivering nearly
double the performance with the core i5
meanwhile Crysis 3 continues to
absolutely destroy GPUs so we see a
smaller gain here with only about 25%
more performance with the core i5
compared to the Athlon overall I'm
impressed with how much you can get out
of an $85 CPU now if you're building
something very high-end something maybe
like a gtx 770 or Radeon 7970
then it definitely does make sense to go
with the core i5 however for a lot of
builds I can definitely see skipping the
core i5 instead going with the Athlon
and using that money you save to pick up
an SSD or maybe a bit of a beefier
graphics card so what do you think is
the core i5 still the clear obvious
choice but do you think the Athlon might
have a place in your next build
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below thank
you guys so much for watching if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to subscribe
to the channel so you're always notified
anytime I post a new video anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
