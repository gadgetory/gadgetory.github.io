as I promised a few days ago I'm going
to go in-depth on all the various new
features and everything that's new and
cool with three point out on this is
probably take me quite a few videos
because three point 0 is has tons new
stuff what I'm going to go through on
this video is we're going to talk to you
guys and show you spotlight search i'm
going to show you guys a little bit
about push notifications i'm also going
to talk to you guys and show you the
improvements to the YouTube application
and that's definitely a lot improved
anyway so let's get this one started
you
okay guys so I'm going to begin with I'm
going to talk about spotlight search
spotlight search if you don't know
basically spotlight search is a
application let's not an actual
application but it's basically is
basically what you do is your on you
when you're on your home screen you
scroll left and basically you will get a
little search box I'm basically you
search you can punch in whatever you
want to search for and basically will
search your entire ipod or iphone I'm
able search music it will search your
mail it will search contact their go
search your apps it's very cool um well
one of the really cool things that comes
along with spotlight search this is this
is not a Miss just kind of thing I'll
just toss in here before you were
limited to nine pages of apps if you had
more they would kind of be on there you
could sink them but it was kind of a
little glitchy and I mean they were in
the back you couldn't use them and when
you delete them sometimes I reappeared
it was kind of little odd now there's
two improvements that thanks to
spotlight search one well this is
there's 11 you have 11 pages in addition
to your little search page so you can
have 12 dots on the bottom but two is
that even if you have more apps than
that then you can easily find them
through spotlight search so let's say
you have 11 pages full of apps but you
know that you have another plus a 20 or
30 is only limited by the space that you
have on your device basically do is you
go over to spotlight search and punch in
plus I have seven days apocalypse that's
on my thirteenth page I won't get to it
but I can't obviously can't get to it
through normally so all I've do is
search it and then it will appear on the
spotlight search I hit it it launches
its simple as that that's something I
really think is really cool just because
I mean I always thought that why would
you be have to be limited by just you
know not having enough pages whatever
and obviously jailbreaking does that
they have used all kinds of workarounds
through that so I'm glad that through
spotlight search you can actually really
improve that anyway so now in general I
do like spotlight search but it's kind
of a little bear I would like it if may
Safari you could like search like your
search or history or in your bookmarks
in Safari that would be cool I'm in
addition it would also be cool if there
was an added like Google search where
you would have liked all your options
but you could also search it through
google on the spotlight search I know
the palm pre has something similar where
you can search all kinds of stuff
through the web and on it and this is
similar but I would like it if it had
those improvements also the mail it
seems little I don't know I'm not sure
it just doesn't seem I don't know for
sure but it doesn't seem like it
actually searches your mail back great
it kind of just searches maybe like the
titles and stuff now go through it
really quickly here and also you the
spotlight search is in clueless urch is
included in some applications such as
you may owe where you can search again
with the mail it only searches the
titles it doesn't actually search the
mail itself so lets you know you can
also do it in iTunes every nine an
iTunes your music playing whatever ipod
or whatever you want call it in the
application you can go ahead and hit
search on the very top and you can
search through that's kind of a nice
thing in general i like I do like
spotlight search and that's one of the
bigger things in three-point oh that
it's just been upgrade and just they've
done a nice job they add google search
and couple small things like that i will
just love it ok guys so the next thing I
will cover is push notifications hi guys
it is this going to be pretty brief just
because push notifications are just
getting started only a couple of
applications or approve or using them
right now and it's not that great so far
that said I'll go ahead and just give
you kind of tell you guys a little bad
push notifications are basically the
next best thing to have running
background applications basically it is
is that all any application that wants
to use it go ahead and send alerts to an
apple server an apple server will send
it to you and basically your ipod will
check it or your iphone will check every
I don't know 35 minutes or whatever
basically the way it works is that let's
say you're doing anything you want like
less I mean it could be on Safari I
don't know about on a game because I
have not really have only gotten to push
notifications
the past several days basically does is
let's say for example AP the AP mobile
back okay that's what I've got okay now
I got one just the other day it popped
up saying that you know some news
basically I can close it or view it and
a lot of some applications good or doing
it right now a lot will be the only ones
i really know of right now or the AP and
the tap tap revenge and that's the thing
i don't really i mean lots of them are
planning on it but it's just it's just a
little early I don't think they're
working quite that great right now just
because I know that they I've only
gotten a couple like i said and i know
that more of them should so i don't know
i mean it's itself it seems like a good
thing but i guess i'm trying to say it's
just not that great right now i will
definitely need to take a look at it
later on and if more apps gated i might
talk about some more later on okay guys
slicing I be coverage today is
improvements the YouTube application I'm
actually was when I was thinking was
going through the three-point Oh back to
upgrade I was thinking about the things
and I knew that you could improve your
you could hook up your account to it and
everything but it really wasn't
expecting much actually I'm pretty
surprised it's actually quite good
basically there's a lot of different
things you can do obviously you can hook
up your account there's a lot bit
there's a lot more I'm gonna actually
that a really nice subscription page
this is a subscription page yeah there's
a nice page basically you can go through
all these descriptions the cool thing is
it shows every single video not just the
ones that you know will disappear you
sure you everyone so if you want to go
through and just look through them all
it's actually very cool there's also the
whole the normal view where you can just
see you know the latest ones and now
this isn't so much have to do with the
application but the cool thing is
they've really really stepped it up on
getting the preparing the video get
processing it for your iphone or ipod
touch um I mean I know it's just maybe
leave my four or five months ago it was
like taking maybe a day or two now it's
general I mean it loosens the videos
uploaded
well then a couple of hours I mean it's
quite good anyway you go ahead and you
can also search through your videos
which is quite nice because I like to go
check from time time see how many views
and all it cost up it's real simple to
open up your application hit it and in
you will see all of it in real time and
also a really nice thing is that you can
actually add to favorites and everything
and it's actually your real favorites in
the same way you can go back into your
favorites instead of having a separate
set on your iPod or iPhone actually have
your own set of favorites which I think
that's pretty cool but one of the bigger
things is that you can actually go into
your more info you can see the more
videos you can rate comment and
everything and you can see the comments
that's something pretty nice just
because the old one just did not really
have that at all obviously you can watch
the videos just the same and just the
same as before it's kind of a small they
may seem small but I mean obviously I
mean that's that's a pretty big deal to
me because I mean I always just had to
go open up safari and scroll through and
you know I have to wait for it load but
the application YouTube application just
loads very streamlined very cool so yeah
that's just about it these just three of
the improvements I will definitely be
covering lots more guys so don't worry
let's see here i will probably I mean
there's cut copy paste I mean there's
all kinds of stuff so guys stay tuned
i'll probably have several more videos
about it hey guys be sure to go check
out sitcom we've got all kinds of iphone
and itouch news jailbreak tutorials and
lots of really good app reviews edition
