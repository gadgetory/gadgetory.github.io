mystery tech
and it's well packaged Oh what house do
so much stuff in here boys
owls what what am I looking at
congratulations on the purchase of your
new Weiser handheld computer so it is
like a poll if Ike it does run palm OS
apparently a gps companion this is a gps
add-on what how do you even attach these
things oh oh there's a whole other box
underneath here this is the Omni Sky
wireless Internet and email service the
following screen you'll be asked to tap
the center of the target Wow touch
screen technology the eye module all
right let's try plugging in a webcam
wait Aang I think I'm gonna do a selfie
on this I mean that that right there my
friends is a real masterpiece but I'm
actually kind of surprised at how much
stuff is actually usable on this I say
usable with some slight asterisks but I
mean we've got a camera we've got what
would have been a really cool wireless
modem we've got a GPS antenna and all
the stuff was pretty easily swappable I
mean no should you buy one of these in
2018 I mean of course not that's
ridiculous but this is actually kind of
cool I've got to say I was actually not
expecting this to work as well as it
does this one's from Jimmy Jimmy okay
this is from twink toys all right it's
like an action figure or something
of courses but that tech there's no part
of this that's tech at all the whole
thing is just a doll there's nothing
mysterious or scary about this at all I
mean does that look scary to you are you
frightened right now cuz I'm just
frightened of how much money was wasted
on something that's not remotely tech in
any possible way just gonna leave this
here for the rest of the video thank you
great it need to be there anyway it's
fine
sports cards this is a baseball card
there's your baseball card for this is
not tech do you miss the most important
part of mystery tech it's not mystery
random stuff it's mystery tech it's the
best thing
Austin Evans baseball card wait there's
an actual player yeah he was drafted by
the Rangers in June of 2000 his name is
Austin Evans in fact he's from Austin
Texas hi hi that's pretty good actually
I will say he actually does mildly look
like me and his signature also kind of
looks like mine how much was this $15
all right hey USB the ps2 keyboard mouse
adapter this is a mysterious am I
missing something here adapter Oh what
are you laughing for so much I haven't
even opened the thing yet you're already
over you're laughing
oh you're staring at the doll you're
staring at this doll this is one of
those reproduction model M keyboard is
it a real one way I guess it right oh oh
I'm excited now that might be a new
record
I actually guessed what it is right oh
dude I feel like I could beat someone to
death with this have you never tried one
of these before
so if you guys are not familiar the IBM
model M is widely regarded is one of if
not the best keyboards of all time dude
this is so clean so this isn't a
reproduction right this is actually an
original one yes oh man wait we just
gotta do it we got do it oh listen to
that
woo because this is an older keyboard it
does use a ps/2 connector which to be
fair some modern pcs specifically a lot
of desktops will support it but for me
I'm gonna need an adapter oh there's a
problem he doesn't smell so good yeah I
heard of Paul did we kill my cool HP
ooh that smells bad team Christmas oho
well that's not good so we were trying
to get my laptop up it was dead and we
plugged a different power adapter in it
and now it smells bad and won't turn on
oh joy they said that this computer was
very hot no no no so with a replacement
laptop let's try the keyboard now so oh
hey we have lights on so at least it's
getting power so it's definitely got a
different kind of feeling than any kind
of standard mechanical keyboard that you
would pick up today
it also has a different key layout I'm
just realizing this is back before you
know the Windows key existed but hey it
works for me with just a simple USB to
ps2 adapter we've got full support you
can pretty much get everything you need
done you've got all your function keys
everything else is almost identical to a
current keyboard okay I gotta say this
is weird it's not the most normal thing
in the world but actually I think for a
lot of people this is legitimately
pretty cool wow that's that's aggressive
that's not another one of these so you
may remember a very special episode of
mystery Tech almost a year ago or we
took a look at the Robo Raptor well this
this is the Robo Raptors special cousin
no one enjoys this Ken everyone is on my
side and doesn't appreciate seeing me
annoyed with some stupid dinosaur robot
right okay there we go
I'm boxed all right what does it do
laughs that's that that okay I can't all
right
good answer good answer oh it likes it
wait wait do they know each other this
is how this works purple dinosaur Robo
Raptor you're alive
hey wait key fight fight fight fight
fight fight fight yeah here we go
nobody's on Robo Raptor he posts Orson
lame-o book oh wait wait
what's gonna happen get him get him
no no this way this this yeah hey go get
him oh yeah it's okay it's okay it's
okay it's okay
the mean-girl dinosaur just doesn't like
you it's fine you tried oh no no after
this this is my box
what is this did you see it
this is just a giant pickle what is this
why does it have your name on it
11:21 17 thanks Kenneth what is this
real pickle and a seal coca-cola bottle
full grown four inches so it's just a
pickle that grew into a coke bottle i
agree Robo raptor I agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
