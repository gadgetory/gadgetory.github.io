a video on a really weird one this is
the Razer mechanical keyboard for iPad
pro yeah it here that you're going to be
able to upgrade your keyboard on the
iPad to actually get a mechanical key
switch so I was on Twitter yesterday
morning and I saw they announced this
why is Razer making a mechanical
keyboard for an iPad I was gonna be
heart there's give you a heart video to
make because none of this makes any
sense to me at all
so first of all we actually have the
keyboard case itself so this is not only
a keyboard but it's also a keyboard case
so if we pump the iPad fro in like this
you have a very very weird manger laptop
so on the back we actually have a metal
kickstand all right you know that
actually does go a long way toward
making the iPad feel more like a laptop
oh this whole thing comes out it's a
little weird how this is magnetic I
guess I get the idea that I want to
separate it and still be able to type on
it I mean that works and maybe if I was
gaming or something I might we'll put
the iPad farther away but it's weird I
kind of feel like it would be nicer if
this was a more complete package I just
saw this you have a Razer logo on the
back of your iPad in case you really
wanna be a poser or something it feels
decent um I don't quite believe their
claim that this is exactly the same as
typing on or mechanical keyboard there
is a fair bit of key travel and you do
get a little bit of that click clack
sort of sound but it's not the same as
typing on proper Cherry MX switches
interestingly this is the exact same
price as the Apple Smart keyboard
yeah no I'm nowhere near as fast on this
it's just there's no real key travel
here one big difference with a smart
keyboard is that it does use a smart
connector there's no need to sync it
there's no need to worry about bluetooth
there's no need to worry about batteries
he literally just snaps together but
that is a lot smaller than this one nice
thing is that you do get backlighting
with the razor keyboard however that
severely hurts the battery life so
without backlighting on you're getting
somewhere in the neighborhood of 600
hours on a charge however if you turn
that light on you're down to 10 hours as
a razor product
would expect this would be good at
gaming however I don't believe any iOS
apps will actually support keyboard
input for gaming yeah there's nothing
here
alright however I'm not going to take no
for an answer so this is the 400 laptop
actually recently just did a video on
let's see if it'll actually bluetooth
how does a Bluetooth thing bluetooth can
you bluetooth can is bluetooth thing a
thing that works mind you I am currently
using a Bluetooth keyboard and a
trackpad ah shoot shoot shoot you
shouldn't actually do this never mind
this is a bad idea but the keyboard is
bloats is in two words if you compare
this to most laptop keyboards and
especially iPad keyboards it is way way
better however everything else about it
kind of falls flat the idea of having a
kickstand is nice but the fact that
doesn't really want to go fully flat
until you really smash it down that's
weird but honestly the biggest club for
me is the fact that it's super sloppy
right so no that's like that's not
something if I'm gonna pay $170 I do not
want my keyboard to do this so what do
you guys think about this keyboard for
the iPad definitely be sure to let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
