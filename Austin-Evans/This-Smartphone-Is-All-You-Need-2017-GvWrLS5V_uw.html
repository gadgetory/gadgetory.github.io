it's lucky that you guys say that
because this video is sponsored by blue
apron you guys check out the link in the
description you'll get your first 3
meals totally for free straight from
blue apron hey guys this is Austin this
is the moto e 4 + and it might just be
all the smart phone you need what makes
this phone impressive is that not only
does it have solid specs for less than
$200 what's really cool about it is that
as guys welcome to a five thousand
milliamp hour battery the Moto e has
been one of my favorite budget phones
for a long time but the e4 Plus promises
to set it up in a big way now part of
the reason it does that is it's now
rocking a full metal build inside the
box there's not a lot so we get a micro
USB cable as well as the 10 watt power
adapter which actually does support
quick charge meaning that you know you
have a giant battery it actually should
be able to charge pretty quickly pull
off the metal back and not only will you
see the SIM card slot as well as your
micro sd but also that giant 5,000
milliamp hour battery I think it's easy
to kind of hear aspect like that and not
realize but this is an enormous battery
for any phone but especially something
like this which has such power sipping
internal what I really like about the
Moto e 4 plus is that it doesn't really
feel like you're giving up much versus a
bigger and more expensive flagship I
mean this guy's rocking a 5.5 inch
display it's got that huge battery the
metal bill you've got a fingerprint
sensor and this all is in a form that
costs one hundred and eighty dollars the
fingerprint sensor is a great example of
a feature that you usually don't find on
budget foam so with the Moto e 4 it's
actually the standard moto one so if you
tap and hold it will lock the phone tap
it will quickly unlock and you can even
use this for gestures so to be fair it's
not all cutting edge so this guy's
rocking on a micro USB port instead of
USB see although I feel like that's not
really a big deal for most people and
amazingly enough is rocking a full
headphone jack which is sadly becoming
more and more rare for phones in 2017
especially as you're not only giving up
much either so the Moto e 4 is rocking a
quad-core Snapdragon 427 processor 2
gigabytes of memory and either 16 and 32
gigs of storage and of course you can
expand that with the microSD card slot
it might not be the most powerful phone
in the world but it is totally fine for
normal usage and we take a look at the
performance inside Geekbench it's pretty
much on par with a lot of the more
expensive phones such as the Moto G it's
one thing to look at benchmarks but it's
another thing to actually
use the phone in the real world where it
feels pretty snappy so whether that has
to do with the fact that this is running
stock Android which makes everything
just a little bit better as far as the
optimization side of things go but
multitasking is totally fine and what
you're getting here is something that
for most people is going to feel very
very similar to a much more expensive
phone it's also fully up to date on
Android 7.1.1 nougat and that's one of
the nice things about Motorola phones
typically speaking they do a pretty good
job of keeping them up to date which is
definitely not something I can say about
a lot of other budget phones though this
guy does come fully unlocked which is
fairly standard for a lot of the Amazon
Prime phones what is cool about this guy
is that not as a support LTE but also
dual band Wi-Fi now yes I'm going to
take a hard turn into nerd town right
now but dual band Wi-Fi is something
that I find it should be on a lot more
devices it makes it a lot more reliable
you've got a fast internet connection it
makes it a lot faster now this is one of
Amazon's prime exclusive phones and
because of that you have a lot of
different options so the base model is
going to run you $180 with 16 gigs of
storage you can bump that up to 32 gigs
of storage for 200 now if you don't care
about the Amazon lockscreen ads that
come with it yes you can save $40 on
both models which may or may not be
worth it depending on how you feel about
that stuff the e4 plus is rocking a 5.5
inch 720p screen now it might not be the
sharpest display in the world I think
it's going to be totally fine for most
people and importantly not only is the
color fairly accurate but it also gets
very bright for the camera the Moto e
for plus is walking a 13 megapixel
shooter this doesn't look bad so color
seems reasonable I don't think it's the
sharpest thing I've seen but there
actually is a fair bit of depth of field
HDR actually looks pretty good here even
though there's a lot of contrast in this
picture it's actually able to keep a lot
of detail oh no you can't show that I'm
sorry that's a that's that's showing off
certain secrets the Moto e 4 also has
1080p video as you can see from this
super smooth shot of mr. kimball Ito
it's actually not too bad I feel like
this is a trend with this phone maybe
it's not the greatest camera or the
greatest build quality or the greatest
screen but put together for $180 it is
really hard to complain well the Moto e
4 isn't totally waterproof it is
supposed to be at least somewhat
water-resistant alright here it goes
well the Moto e for survive probably
well I think though
yep
that looks like it works one water test
later I am really impressed with the
Moto e for plus now yes you can spend a
lot more to get a smartphone that's
going to be a bit better in certain
areas but taken as a whole there's
really not a lot to complain about so as
always I'll have a link to check this
guy out in the description and I've got
to give a big shout-out to blue apron
