of the switch easy colors case for the
ipod touch 4th generation so I've been
using this case for about two weeks now
and I've got to say this is probably one
of my favorite cases I've ever owned one
of the major things about it are the
aesthetics this is a really really nice
looking case so hopefully you can tell
that one of the major things about it is
it does go ahead and cover up the entire
bottom bezels screen by topo head and
fired up so you can see you know it
doesn't cover it up on the top it
definitely does on the bottom and does
have this really cool home button so
I'll actually let me just pull this into
focus here actually is raised up so it's
actual separate home button and it works
really quite nicely I really do like how
it works and how it feels of course it
just adds a really cool element of you
know just to look of it it almost looks
like a you know custom white ipod touch
now let's just go ahead and show you
guys around the rest of the case really
quickly here you can get at the volume
rockers as well as the you know the
sleep/wake button and all of the buttons
are really nicely accessible no issues
whatsoever the camera cutout is pretty
precise in fact well it's very precise
no issues whatsoever there and we'll go
ahead and flip it over to the bottom
here and show you guys I'm gonna find
that it is actually really quite nicely
done as well you can get at your
headphone jack your 30-pin dock
connector and the speaker and actually I
really want to point out that i love
cases that have really tight tolerances
you know it really try it just tends to
you know talk to me about how the build
quality is and that is about as tight of
the tolerances you can get so sort of
the build quality on this case you know
I have no issues whatsoever now of
course it is a silicon case so you know
it's not going to be the best for
protection however I really have any
issues it definitely feels like it's
thick enough where I could you know drop
my ipod touch time or two and not really
have any issues so this case is
available for several other devices in
addition to this I'm it's available for
the second third and fourth generation
of ipod touch as well as the third the
3g the 3gs and the iphone 4 so pretty
much any of the latest ipods and iphones
you will be able to get this case for in
addition is also available in a wide
variety of colors and a lot of them
really quite cool looking so this is
called the milk case this is rather
that's the name of the color but you can
get it in all kinds of just crazy reds
and yellows and yummy
you name it you'll be able to get it in
each case has a little bit of a
different colored home button so you
know they all look really cool and
pretty unique so anyway I do recommend
this case if you have any of these
devices really I've really enjoyed this
case it looks really quite good it also
does come with some pretty cool
accessories so it comes with two screen
protectors pretty nice high quality
screen protectors as well as they it
does come with a couple of little rubber
pieces that you can put in 30-pin dock
connector and the headphone personally I
have not used these I don't really see a
whole lot of point you know trying to
cover it up I mean yeah might be okay
for protection and it's nice that they
included but really not a big deal in my
opinion so if you're interested in this
case you should be able to pick it up
from somewhere around fifteen to
seventeen dollars I will have a link in
the description which you'd have all the
latest pricing information so if you're
interested in a really good-looking case
for your ipod touch or your iphone
definitely take a look at the switch
easy colors anyway i do want to go ahead
and give it thanks to switch easy for
providing this case for me for free to
review for you all anyway guys thanks
