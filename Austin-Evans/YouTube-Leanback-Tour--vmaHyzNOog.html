showing you the new YouTube Leanback
feature this is really cool gotta say
guys basically it well I used to go
ahead and watch all sorts of YouTube
videos or subscriptions playlists all
sorts of stuff all from a really cool
feature where you're not even on the Wii
YouTube website really you're all
watching it just video after video so
kind of like a little bit like TV and
I've got to say this is a really cool
feature
um so before we begin guys is just a
couple things I want to say first of all
you will probably want to put your
browser into full-screen mode
so most time most of the time it is f11
another thing is that you will want to
go ahead don't use your not using your
mouse at all everything is done with the
keyboard so let's go ahead and just show
you so let's go ahead and hit down arrow
key a couple times let's scroll back
over here and show you guys what all the
features are so the first thing is your
theme Jenna mom I'm subscribed to them
so there's that video people who like
I'm subscribed to mystery guitar man he
favored that so guys basically it's a
you know mix of you know your recent
activity feed really so it's not bad
just be honest guys this is a way too
spammy for me I'm not gonna watch every
video that all my subscriber
subscriptions all that kind of stuff who
who write and comment and stuff but it's
a nice feature and I'm sure once you can
go ahead and customize they'll be pretty
good so we gotta go ahead and go on to
the different categories so it's like
autos &amp;amp; vehicles I'm so like here we can
watch a David's Farm video you know and
of course it'll auto play it so as soon
as you get to the end of one video it go
to the next which is a really nice
feature so we have all the different
kinds of categories on YouTube let's go
ahead I'm sure you guys know basically
it's the most popular of every day so I
science and technology come over here
we'll see there soldier knows best etc
etc but one of the cool things is it
also does have support for playlists so
let's go ahead and go to my d3 live
playlist so let's go ahead and just
watch this video so we go ahead and hit
enter right now guys my screen recorder
is not super high quality so let's go
ahead and just get out of all this my
screen recorder isn't super high quality
so just take my word for it it does look
just as fun it's just fine I believe I'm
not sure but it does look like all these
videos are in height are in high
definition so let's go ahead and back
out here so as you guys can see we can
go ahead skip through the videos if I
wanted to I could just hit next video
fast forward
cetera now if I come all the way over
here I could go ahead and open it on the
standard YouTube site now if we want to
hit up we actually pull up a search menu
so let's go ahead and search d3 live so
we do that it will come over here and
create a new panel for d3 live so
basically now that for d3 live is not
something I mean there's only a few
episodes and then a couple of my videos
listed here but ordinarily if you know
if you're searching like iPhone for
example you see a ton of videos about
the iPhone and you can basically just
sit back and watch this would be a
really cool thing like let's say you're
looking for you're thinking about buying
a new laptop we search the name of the
laptop you go ahead and you can start
watching the videos and you can
basically watch a review after you and
boxing's different opinions to really
help you make a decision I think this is
a great feature
so guys that's about it there's not a
whole lot else to it but guys I have to
say this is a great feature
they just pronounced it as a beta and if
you guys want go ahead and test it out
it is youtube.com slash lean back I'll
have the link in the description anyway
