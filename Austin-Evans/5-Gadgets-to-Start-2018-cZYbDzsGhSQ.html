hey guys this is Austin
it is almost 2018 and here are five tech
items to get your year started up right
to kick things off we have the
BitDefender box - you guys have probably
heard of fit defender before for their
antivirus software with the box they're
stepping it up to the hardware side of
things to protect your entire network
but on top of being able to cover things
like your phone as well as your laptop
it also can help protect against your
smart home devices from being attacked
that's quite the flowchart they've got
right here pull this guy out of the box
and it's actually surprisingly light so
there's really not a whole lot to this
guy you essentially get power in you get
Ethernet in and you get Ethernet back
out so after a quick setup we have the
box up and running all we need is the
BitDefender central app for iOS or
Android and from here we can control
pretty much anything so you can see
notifications if it decides that there's
any kind of vulnerabilities in your
network you can also make sure that all
your devices are protected if they need
attention or if they're unprotected
while the box will protect your device
when you're at home on your own Wi-Fi
the included total security software
will also protect your other devices
like Mac Windows Android from threats
when your stay on public Wi-Fi since
this is Hardware level security you can
do some pretty interesting stuff with it
so not only is it going to do its best
to filter out any kind of suspicious
activity but on top of that say you're
on a website that isn't secured and
you're trying to put in your credit card
or your social security number well box
is going to try to catch that and give
you a warning saying hey are you sure
about that
you're also getting some protection
against brute-force attacks as well as
ransomware and because it detects all
the devices on your network and gives
you a full status report say you connect
a old laptop that hasn't been updated in
a while you're going to get a
notification saying hey it's time to
kill the update on that guy Windows XP
is not cool anymore so if you guys want
to check out the BitDefender box - for
yourself like always the link will be in
the description the next item is the
Google home now this isn't brand new
however I've just gotten a whole set of
Google homes for my house and I love
them well there's a lot to like with
Alexa and I'm sure Syria on the home pod
is going to be great if you have like
400 bucks
Google Home has really had a nice sweet
spot between sounding good as well as
having these super useful Google
assistants the real sweet spot for me
though is the Google home mini so these
guys launched at $50 which is a pretty
decent price for what is still a nice
speaker and gives you all the
functionality over for the next little
while
guys are $30 and at that price I've got
like three of them in my house but this
doesn't matter at all to anyone besides
me probably but even though the Google
home does sound better I kind of prefer
the many just because this to me looks
like an air freshener hurt I don't know
I just I don't like the way this thing
looks where is this this is cool you can
just slide this on like a desk or
something and no one would ever really
look twice there's a lot you can do with
Google home but the main things I do is
listen to music do like alarms as well
as listen to a little bit of like
podcasts and some news but for 30 bucks
you should definitely consider checking
this guy out
continuing on the Google train we have
the chromecast ultra now the chromecast
has been one of my favorite ways to
stream video for a few years now but the
ultra is the way to do it in 4k if you
guys caught our iPhone 10 is it worth
the video this is actually how we were
able to test HDR on YouTube so what we
did was we would upload the video to
YouTube wait for it to process for like
three hours and then we would play it
back on a OLED TV using the chromecast
ultra to actually see what it would look
like once it was fully processed this
guy is pretty powerful considering just
how tiny it is it's also really stuck in
there so it is a little bit bigger than
a standard chromecast but really not by
much the same basic idea where you plug
it in via HDMI to your TV there's a
micro USB lead here for power once you
set it up on Wi-Fi it's pretty
straightforward so you get just a bunch
of generic wallpapers at the beginning
but you can stream pretty much anything
to it from the app or from Google home
hey Google Play the latest awesome Evans
video on YouTube
that is so cool so what's really neat
about this is that not only can you
control that with voice as well as of
course from your phone but you can also
have multiple Google homes as well as
multiple chromecast set up in your house
all these gadgets are great however
you're probably going to want an actual
phone to control everything which is
where the Moto e 4 plus comes in this is
the phone actually did a video on a
couple months ago and I think it is Loki
one of my favorite devices of the year
so it's nice is is that for a phone that
cost less than $200 you're getting a
metal build a good screen good camera
fingerprint sensor there's really not a
lot to hate on one area a lot of budget
phones skimp on is the screen and
thankfully the Moto e for Plus isn't too
bad so it is a 5.5 inch panel with the
1280 by 720 resolution no yes that's
going to be a little bit on the low side
but thankfully it's a good panel with
solid color inside the specs might not
look impressive with a snapdragon 427
processor 2 gigs of ram and either 16 or
32 gigs of storage but what really puts
this over the top is the battery this
guy is rocking a massive 5,000 milliamp
hour battery put that in context that's
almost double the size of something like
the iPhone 10 no yes it does mean that
the phone is a little bit chunkier than
it might otherwise be but especially
considering these fairly low-end
internals this guy is going to last
forever but that battery is really what
pushes it over the edge for me this is
hands-down the best battery life I've
ever tried on a smart phone and when you
consider that that's again less than
$200 you should really give the Moto e
four shots but say that a smart phone
isn't what you're looking for this year
well that is where the Acer Aspire d15
comes in I've actually wanted to do a
video on this for a while for one big
reason it is one of the most highly
selling laptops on Amazon period right
now you don't exactly get a lot in the
box though so on one hand we get the
laptop itself with some wonderful
cardboard there's some cardboard
shavings on paper it looks pretty good
so you're getting a core i3 70 100 you
four gigabytes of RAM as well as a one
terabyte hard drive there are some nice
features that separate this from other
budget laptops starting with the display
so it is a 1080p panel and while yes
it's maybe not the best-looking 1080p
screen in the world but it is a lot
better than other laptops in the three
to four hundred dollar price range nice
touches like having a backlit keyboard
as well as a full number pad is nice and
the port selects
is interesting on the website we have a
good selection including a pair of USB
3.0 ports an HDMI VGA Ethernet as well
as USB type-c now on the other side we
get the headphone jack another USB 2.0
as well as the DVD drive because you
know laptops with USB type-c ports and
DVD drives are all over the place remove
three screws and pop off this bottom
panel though in only do we get access to
the hard drive which is actually kind of
slow and I would probably swap with an
SSD but also our memory for gigs is fine
for now it would be really simple to
upgrade this guy to eight gigs Asia
claims this guy has up to 12 hours of
battery life and while the build quality
does leave a little bit to be desired at
350 dollars there is a ton to like with
this laptop I see why everyone keeps
buying them as always links to
everything I talked about including the
box - will be in the description of this
video so I'm curious which of these
products would you guys want to pick up
for 2018 let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
