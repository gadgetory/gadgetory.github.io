This is the Photon 3.0, and at $500,
it really is aimed at
the majority of gamers.
So inside this guy, it is
using an Intel Pentium G4600.
So Pentiums have typically not
had a great rap as far as gaming goes,
and that's typically because
they've been pure dual core parts.
What that means is, is that
when it actually comes
to gaming, a lot of times
games will actually
really require four cores
or at least some Hyper-threading.
In the past, you had to at
least jump up to a Core i3.
However, with this
latest Kaby Lake edition,
you actually do have Hyper-threading
in a cheap Pentium chip.
So for about $30, $40
cheaper than a Core i3.
You're still getting a
3.6 gigahertz processor
and for most games, that's
going to be totally fine.
Alongside it, we have the EVGA
GTX 1050Ti graphics card.
So as you can see in the system,
it might not be the
biggest card in the world,
but don't let that fool you.
This definitely has plenty of power.
If you caught my video on Cryptomining,
you'll know that most
high-end graphics cards
are nearly impossible to find in stock,
and the ones that are,
are incredibly expensive.
But thankfully, the 1050Ti
has been mostly unaffected.
Now a big reason for that is that
while it isn't quite the
best Cryptomining card,
it is still great for gaming.
Thanks to the four gigabytes
of memory on board,
as well as the fairly
low power consumption,
which means that not
only does it nicely fit
in that tiny little card,
but almost more importantly than that,
you don't need to connect
external PCI power.
It pulls everything it
needs from the motherboard.
For a motherboard, we're
using the Gigabyte B250M-EVO.
Now, this is a fairly basic motherboard,
but it does support not
only our Pentium processor,
but all the way up to a Core i7,
so if you do wanna make some
upgrades, that's easy to do.
And speaking of upgrades,
it also does have
an M2 slot directly on the board.
so on top of the SSD and
any kind of hard drives
that you wanna have inside the system,
you can also add a super fast M2 drive
straight to the board.
For memory, we have eight gigabytes
of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM.
So eight gigabytes is going to be
enough to run pretty much any game as is
and of course if you do want
to upgrade to 16 gigabytes,
it's as simple as grabbing one more stick
and throwing it in your system.
It's also going to be
DDR4, 2400 megahertz,
that's pretty much all you need for now.
For the SSD, we're doing something
a little different this time.
So this is a 250 gigabyte WD Blue SSD.
So I've been using WD Blue drives
in my builds for a very, very long time.
This is the first time I've
used one of their SSDs.
To be fair, pricing is
actually pretty solid.
So for about $80 you're going
to be getting 250 gig drive,
which should be enough for most people.
However, if you do need more space,
because it's a gaming PC,
of course you can always
throw a hard drive inside.
On top of that, if you are
building a computer in 2017,
you really should be using an SSD.
It makes such a huge
difference to how snappy
and responsive pretty much loading
everything on the computer is.
When you go back to a hard drive,
it really does feel like a huge downgrade.
For the power supply, we
have a 450 watt EVGA unit.
So this is another part that I've used
in a lot of builds over the years
and for good reason.
Not only is it going
to be fairly reliable,
but it's also cheap and
with power supplies,
those two things don't always go together.
So this guys is going to
be a 80 PLUS Bronze rated
and with 450 watts of capacity,
not only is it enough for the build as is,
you can do some pretty serious upgrades
without having to touch the supply.
For the case we're using
the Rosewill Tyrfing?
So weird name aside, it
actually is a pretty solid case.
So it's going to be full-size ATX,
so there's plenty of room inside
and for about 40 dollars, we're actually
getting some pretty decent value.
So not only does it have
a pair of 120 millimeter fans
but also does have a window to show off
your super cool cable management.
Now yes, build quality
could be a little bit better
but for the price there's
not a lot to complain about.
So the Photon 3.0 really
is aimed at 1080p gaming.
First we have Rocket League.
This is a game that is
not that difficult to run
and as you can see here,
it's absolutely no problem
for the Photon.
We're getting about 140 frames
per second on high settings
and that is with a frame rate cap.
If we actually uncapped that,
we'd probably go even higher.
Next we have Shadow of Mordor.
Now yes, this is a little
bit of an older game.
However, it's really well optimized
and it does hold up
even on higher end rigs
and on high settings at 1080p,
when we're getting in the 80s to 90s,
depending on how much action we have here.
Completely playable.
Another game that's slightly older
but still looks really nice is GTA5.
So again on very high settings at 1080p,
it looks really nice.
And frame rate wise, we're
still doing pretty solid.
So we're keeping in the, generally 50
to 60 frame rate per second range.
Again, super super playable.
The more I use the system to game,
the more I realize just how quiet it is.
I mean, even right beside it,
I can barely hear anything at all.
Another game the Photon
3.0 can definitely handle
is Overwatch.
So here on Ultra settings at 1080p,
we're getting really nice frame rates.
So right now we're
hovering between 90 to 100
and especially with a high
refresh rate monitor
like we're using right
now, it looks really nice.
Plus, Overwatch is just a nice looking
game on Ultra settings anyway.
As always, I'll have all
the links you guys need
to build the Photon 3.0 in the description
and if you are curious on how
to actually build a gaming PC,
I did do a full 2017
tutorial using this system.
So be sure to go check that out
and I will catch you in the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
