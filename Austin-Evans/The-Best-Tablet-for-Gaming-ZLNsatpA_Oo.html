tablet for gaming Nvidia have been known
for the graphics for years but only
recently have they gotten into actual
hardware the tablet k1 originally came
out in 2014 but after some issues with
the battery it's been updated with the
new name price and Android 6.0
marshmallow at $200 you're getting a
tablet that still holds up today with a
nice bright 1920 by 1200 8-inch display
and several accessories like the shield
controller and cover moving up the price
ladder a bit we've got the assist
transformer T 100 H a this is a $300
Windows tablet with one big addition a
keyboard dock with the help of a couple
magnets the T 100 turns into a
touchscreen laptop with a small but
usable trackpad and keyboard it's also
got a solid variety of ports like micro
USB for charging HDMI for using external
display or TV along with USB type-c pair
this with the MacBook USBC adapter and
you've got a full USB 3.0 port for using
something like an external hard drive
the iPad is the most popular tablet out
there for good reason and the iPad Mini
4 has a lot going for it at $400 it's
the most expensive option here that it
absolutely feels its price with an
all-aluminum build it's then while still
supporting features like touch ID it has
a fantastic 7.9 inch Retina display not
only is it the best here on paper but it
also has killer color on viewing angles
it shows up even more expensive options
like the iPad air with Android iOS and
windows covered what kinds of games can
you play on these tablets NVIDIA has
done a lot of work on Android the last
couple years and it shows on the shield
vainglory is the mobile equivalent of a
League of Legends
the Caitlyn has more than enough power
to keep things running smoothly Leo's
fortune is a more casual game that
performs well which shouldn't be a huge
surprise but a nice addition is the
shield controller support this is the
same gamepad from the shield console and
I like it it has built-in Android
controls like back and home but more
importantly it opens up games that
aren't well-suited to just a touch
screen with g-force now you can stream
full PC games this is relying on you
having a good connection but if you do
it's a solid experience pair that with
an Android version of shadow play to let
you record your gameplay and you have a
very cool way of playing and even
streaming your games to twitch the
assuage t100 has the advantage of
running full Windows 10 give you access
to the massive Steam library this is a
tablet so don't expect it to destroy a
gaming PC but hook up an Xbox one
controller and you've got yourself a
decent Little Rock
machine with a mouse and keyboard we'll
have no problem playing lighter titles
like league of legends and even bumping
settings up a bit games like
counter-strike go aren't quite as smooth
even with the graphics on low but it is
playable for a quick game or two the
full PC version of Minecraft also works
here and might not be able to keep up
with a ton of mods but it's not bad the
iPad on the other hand has tons of
titles that are well suited to a
touchscreen but Gardo started out as a
browser game but you can sing just as
many hours into the iPad version by
tapping and swiping Laura Croft Go is
another great example of a fun tablet
game the art style is on point and while
it wouldn't look out of place on a
console it works well here speaking of
telltale has most of their games like
Game of Thrones available on iOS and
while graphically they aren't too
impressive if you've never played titles
like The Walking Dead
you're missing out while all three
tablets can handle gaming inside they
could be much more different the shield
is rocking an NVIDIA Tegra k1 with a
quad-core processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
and a cut-down version of a Kepler
graphics card the t100 is no slouch
either with a quad-core Intel Atom x5
processor 4 gigabytes of memory along
with Intel HD graphics the iPad Mini
uses an apple a dual-core CPU 2 gigs of
ram and potent power VR graphics in
Geekbench 3 the single trader
performance helps the a8 overcome its
lack of quarters where an GFX bench the
killer NVIDIA GPU helps pull out the win
over both the iPad and a soos while it
might be down in raw power it is worth
noting that the t100 not only has twice
as much RAM but also 64 gigs of storage
versus 16 on the others which is
especially important for running full
Windows 10 of course things aren't
perfect
while the addition of the keyboard dock
is a huge advantage the tablet itself
has large bezels and the plastic build
looks fine but the 2/100 feels by far
the cheapest here the screen also isn't
anything special it's a 10-inch 1280 by
800 panel which is totally usable but
it's not as sharp nor is nice to look at
as the others the iPad Mini has the
design battery life and performance to
easily keep up with gaming but at $400
not only is it significantly more
expensive than the others it's also only
a bit cheaper than the more useful iPad
here as by far the cheapest option here
there are some cut corners with the
shield like no microUSB charger included
in the box
throw in the cover and controller and it
quickly approaches $300 but even
factoring in its age there's not a lot
to complain about the software is
essentially pure Android with
legitimately useful additions by Mb
needing little things like the
front-facing speakers go a long way and
making it a nice experience to game on
it might not be perfect but for the
price it's hard to argue with the
shield's k1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
