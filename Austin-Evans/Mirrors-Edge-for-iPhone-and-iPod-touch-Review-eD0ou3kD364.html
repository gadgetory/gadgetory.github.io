of Mirror's Edge for the iPhone and iPod
Touch now this is of course a adaptation
from the consoles and of course the PC
Mirror's Edge which I was a big fan outs
a really really great looking game great
playing game and now of course you can
go ahead and pick it up on the iPhone
and the iPod touch so I'm going to jump
right out in here in here and just go
ahead and do a speedrun now this is
gonna be pretty simple right explain the
controls it's it's pretty unique in it
that it does work pretty well now one
thing I do like are the loading screens
as you can see here you can actually go
ahead and scroll through here basically
what this does is it kind give you a
little bit of background and everything
this story is basically the same
although it's tweaked a little bit but
it's basically the same as what you
would find on the other consoles I don't
get into that I'll just show you guys
some gameplay it doesn't look really
quite nice on you know the iPod and
iPhone screen I'm pretty good so I'm go
ahead just do this now the way it works
is you need to go ahead and run by
you'll automatically run you can go
ahead and just run and jump and all that
kind of stuff so run out of that you
know there there are a bunch of
different things but the cool thing is
that a lot of the feel has been remained
the same so we quite enough that's not
very good but a lot of fields remain the
same you really do need to keep up your
momentum you know if you mess up a
little bit you definitely will cause
some problems like I should slit under
that but I'll try the next one there we
go
and and there are several things jump up
here but real like I said it does
running a lot of the feel the console
you know you need to keep your momentum
up I'm slide any tear and I think we're
almost done here across here up here and
we slide down to roll now this is pretty
simple so you just quit running here and
I'm sorry on that pay attention this
glare so we wall run and barely got it
jump up over here I'm but you can see
here the game runs very nice and
smoothly it looks really brilliant quite
nice nice um so there you go it does
right look very very nice you know it's
not gonna be obviously it doesn't look
as quite as good as it does down you
have the Xbox whatever but this is of
course a different kind of style jump
cross here roll we're doing pretty good
here and there we go we got it didn't do
very well but there you go guys so
that's
Mirror's Edge for the iPhone the iPod
Touch on that this is currently also
$1.00 along with several other EA apps
so for dello this is definitely
something you have to get I've been
having a lot of fun to play through it
got a play through it again now but on
the go so guys if you're interested go
ahead and check it out it's just
Mirror's Edge in the App Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
