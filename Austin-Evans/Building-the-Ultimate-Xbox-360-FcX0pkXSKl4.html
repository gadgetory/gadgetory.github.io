finally build what you guys have been
asking for for months this is the
ultimate Xbox 360 so of course to start
with we have our pristine brand new in
box Xbox 360 4 gig with Kinect I mean
the last part was true when it comes to
building the ultimate console one of the
most important things is to find
something that is compatible with the
most accessories and even though you can
get some stuff for the original Xbox 360
as well as the super slam this is
definitely going to be our best bet
oh boy what a wonderful packing job ok
well the first thing we're gonna find
here is actually one of the weirdest
Xbox 360 accessories the original Kinect
Manstein's gusting leader you see the
level of scratches on this does that
come up on camera it looks like
someone's like rub this thing down with
sandpaper hey at least we got it for
smooth $20 thanks Ken obviously this is
the way you've got to play your Xbox oh
why is it so dirty dude there's like you
can literally see dust like collected
inside the fan here could have found us
a cleaner Xbox
okay so now that we have a slightly
cleaner Xbox the first accessory has to
be Kinect now this is a really weird one
millions they by far the biggest
accessories it was available for the 360
but in some ways it was a pretty big
success but in a lot of ways was kind of
a failure so it came out in 2010 several
years after the Xbox 360 came out and
the idea here is that with a series of
cameras and sensors who basically turned
you into the controller there was this
famous demo at e3 before this was
announced back when it's called project
natal where they had this kid
skateboarding in his room using nothing
but his body as the controller and it
looks super super awesome of course as
with nearly all of these demos it wasn't
quite as good as it sort of seen what
you actually got your hands on it thus
this was picked up for 20 bucks and a
bargain bin somewhere well before we get
to that we have to finish upgrading our
Xbox 360 and the first thing we're going
to do is put in a bigger hard drive so
back in these days Microsoft's old
internal hard drives that you could
install yourself because for some
wonderful reason this Xbox 360 was
shipping with only four gigabytes of
capacity mostly so they could actually
bundle connect in the box which I'm as
you can imagine for a more modern
console not exactly a lot of storage so
if you flip over the 360 there's a
little panel here where you can drop in
a hard drive so this guy is going to
give us 500 gigabytes of capacity
although as always we're gonna go pub
that but it's an easy way of getting a
lot more storage in what is really a
very difficult Xbox to use if you don't
have at least some kind of SSD or HDD or
USB yeah that's all the things right HDD
USB SSD so something interesting is is
that even though the Xbox one doesn't
allow you to install an internal hard
drive the 360 always did so he runs with
the original fat Xbox 360 actually had
these top mounted hard drives which were
really easy to pop on and off but with
the slim they move to this sort of
cartridges design which realistically is
just a two and a half inch laptop drive
that you just slide in something like
that and because of course we're trying
to build the ultimate Xbox 360 I mean
500 gigabytes of capacity is definitely
not going to be enough which is where
the Seagate game drive comes in so this
is a 500 gigabyte SSD now this is
typically meant for the Xbox one as it
does have USB 3.0 and actually is going
to be faster than the internal drive how
/ this is before USB 3.0 so instead
we're hooking up a 500 gigabyte USB 2.0
as a C so that'll lead fast so the Xbox
360 was the last of the major consoles
to stick with only dual layer DVD
support and that was fine for stuff like
the ps2 but when I came to the 360
while most games weren't able to fit on
a single DVD quite a few actually did
need to ship on multiple discs however
unlike the ps3 which had blu-ray support
that was nowhere to be found on the 360
and thus this wonderful ridiculous
accessory was born the Xbox HD DVD
player so for those of you who are not
familiar with the HD DVD format this was
essentially the competitor to blu-ray
back in the day that's the HD DVD name
pretty clever I know are you serious it
looks like a mini fat Xbox 360 I never
realized that I've never actually seen
one of these in person yo I mean it
doesn't match with this at all but that
is so cool so now it's time to connect
this so we've got our power adapter
we've also got our second part of the
power adapter and then it connects via
mini USB this whole thing feels straight
out of 2006 so when it first came out
the HD DVD add-on was a pretty
impressive $200 which still actually
probably would have been cheaper than a
lot of the HD DVD players at the time
but of course it went absolutely nowhere
and thus we have blu-ray and I have a
really ridiculous player that we have a
game for oh sorry they'll actually they
make games for it right so this is only
for movies I forgot do we have a movie
for it
march of the Penguins okay so this is
one of the very few HD DVDs that existed
so one of the only real issues with the
Xbox 360 and the Xbox one of today still
is that they run on double-a batteries
although thankfully we have a way around
that - this is the Nyko
so in addition to giving you two
rechargeable batteries in the box it's
also going to be a little dock we can
actually charge our controllers with it
just feels so weird to be opening up all
these old accessories that have clearly
been sitting around some like Amazon
bathrooms like five years but it's ok
they're gonna have a better life now so
I don't think that's not gonna fit
whatever uh-huh this hole fit so
you can see why this is supposed to look
like if you don't have your giant chat
pad on uh-huh
now with all these accessories connected
to our Xbox 360 one might worry that it
might get a little bit warm perhaps get
a little bit of a red ring of death
perhaps even though there's a slim and
it does actually physically have red
rings to do that with well in that case
we have an inner cooler you know that
wonderful accessory that we've tried on
many many many occasions and has never
done anything let's try it here so the
claim to fame with this one isn't so
much to let the temperatures run a
little bit cooler when you're normally
using your xbox 360 but for when you've
got it in a confined space it's supposed
to direct hot air away from the console
okay so this is a pretty small
intercooler I will say so basically
you've got one fan on the inside which
actually kind looks like a GPU fan and
then I guess it sort of mounts onto the
side something like that seems a little
bit excessive don't you just clip it on
to the side yeah you just clip it on the
side there we go that doesn't look like
the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
and of course because everything here is
mounted via USB I'm gonna use up the
last port on the back of the Xbox I've
got to say that is looking a little bit
more like the ultimate Xbox 360 one film
all right so we've got some decent stuff
here the Xbox is going to be cool it's
going to have an HD DVD experience we're
going to have wireless rechargeable
controllers and a Kinect which is useful
for all kinds of games that are not
called just dance however there's one
last piece that I think it's gonna
really pull this all together so this is
the vault for Xbox 360 and it's a little
bit unusual so if you pop it open here
what you're going to find is that not
only is it all going to be branded with
battlefield 3 but it's essentially a
case for the 360 it's a little bit weird
so they use it as like oh look you can
sort of mount a control on the side of
it make it look all cool but I don't
know why you want this oh oh wow okay
assembly instructions when I say I'm
gonna be building the ultimate Xbox 360
I didn't think I actually had to
literally build it Oh hook
okay well this is the thing and multiple
pieces so it looks like a claymore in a
smoke grenade and so with that we have
the ultimate Xbox 360 and all it's
really ridiculous plastic glory so after
a quick battery change we've got you
know the LEDs working on our supercool
Claymore
so you know that's a thing hey look it's
got me so this is what it looks like
with Kinect when you actually have you
know a working skeleton we also do have
everything showing up so it shows our
500 go by a hard drive as well as our
476 gigabyte SSD and we also have the HD
DVD player which has 191 megabytes free
had so of course we're gonna have to
play a game with this setup and what
better than Skyrim which apparently is
better with Kinect
oh no Trey doesn't open I think our tray
is busted
oh it just took three tries to open up
that's fine that's what you should
expect out of the ultimate Xbox 360 it's
really weird to put a disc in a system
and not have to wait for it to download
and patch and update it just starts
maybe this is the ultimate console after
all so apparently I can use Kinect to
shout voice commands in Skyrim which
doesn't sound particularly useful Wow
what revolutionary Kinect gameplay I'm
really amazed with the the power of this
technology super helpful actually here's
something curious so I've got Skyrim in
the DVD drive right now it shows play
Skyrim but I also now have an HD DVD in
the HD DVD player so how do I actually
get to that my video apps oh oh we found
it there's an HD DVD app oh no I can't
read this disc if it's a game CD your
disc put it in there Xbox 360 disc tray
come on are you serious
my xbox my ultimate xbox it's all
failing me so that my friends is how not
to build the ultimate Xbox 360 with lots
of components which are abuse value or
don't work at all so hopefully you found
this helpful if you did please watch
some of the other building the ultimate
series which I can assure you are much
much better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
