the video going over the new Windows 8
tablets so of course we've heard and
seen a lot about Windows 8 for desktops
laptops all that kind of stuff however
now we're finally getting our first good
look at what Windows 8 is going to look
like on tablets to start with let's take
a look at the assist tablet 600 and this
is very similar to tablets we have today
such as the transformer prime inside
you're going to find an NVIDIA Tegra 3
quad-core processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
as well as a 10.1 inch display with a
resolution of 1366 by 768
if these pics sound familiar that's
because they are this is a very similar
tablet to the assist transformer prime
in fact it even has a very similar
keyboard dock where you can take it and
of course use it normal tablet mode but
if you want to have an actual keyboard a
little bit more battery life trackpad
that kind of thing you can simply
connected like that on the flip side we
have the Acer Iconia w 700 now this is
like very high-end Windows tablet so for
starters it has an 11.6 inch display
with full HD resolution of 1920 by 1080
so what interestingly the W 700 comes
with a cradle so what you do is you can
dock tab in there and adjust it to
different viewing angles depending on
how you want to use the tablet what
really sets the W 700 apart of the specs
inside you're going to find a full Intel
Ivy Bridge CPU this is probably going to
be a Core i5 or Core i7 just like you
would find in an ultrabook like the
MacBook Air on top of that it's also
going to have three USB 3.0 ports HDMI
out as well as a Thunderbolt port of
course all this is not going to come
cheap the W 700 will be on sale later on
this year for priced at anywhere between
800 and $1000 most likely closer to that
thousand dollar mark now of course you
do need to keep in mind that this is
basically a full-fledged laptop without
the keyboard so you have a very high
resolution display you have tons of
power and you even have a thunderbolt
port which is very very impressive in
anything that's not you know a MacBook
now one very important thing to note is
that they're actually going to be two
versions of Windows 8 tablets those
going to be the Windows RT and there's
going to be full Windows 8 now there are
two main types of processors running
these Windows 8 tablets there's going to
be an ARM processor this is exactly what
you're going to find in an iPhone and
iPad and Android phone pretty much any
of that kind of thing if it runs one of
those processors it's going to be
running Windows RT now on the other hand
if it's going to be running a full
laptop chip so for example like Core i5
or even an Intel Atom it's going to
running the full normal version of
windows 8 the biggest difference between
the two is going to be application
support so for example the assist tablet
600 will only be able to run apps that
are specifically designed for Windows 8
on the other hand Windows 8 tablets such
as the W 700 I should be able to run
pretty much any app that you throw at it
as it's basically a laptop inside while
this is something to keep in mind it's
actually not that big of a deal so of
course any ad that's not going to be
optimized for a tablet it's really not
going to work well with touch so of
course you're gonna have to hit on those
all those little tiny buttons with your
fingers I'm sure you can do it but it's
just not going to be anywhere near as
nice as an app that's actually designed
for the Metro UI if you guys are
interested more information on Windows 8
tablets I do have a hands on of an
actual Windows 8 tablet from earlier
this year shows you a little bit about
how it's going to work with the Metro UI
and touch screen and all that kind of
stuff on top of that I just did a video
showing the latest version of Windows 8
of course it's on a laptop but a lot of
those things of course kinda work the
exact same way on a tablet anyway guys
if you enjoyed this video definitely
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
you're interested in more videos on
