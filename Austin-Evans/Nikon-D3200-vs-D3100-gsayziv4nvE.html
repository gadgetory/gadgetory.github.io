here with a comparison between the Nikon
d3200 versus the D 3100 as the D 3100
user for the last year and a half I can
definitely say there are some very nice
improvements in the D 3200 but are they
worth you roughly $150 price premium to
start out with let's take a look at the
camera bodies at first glance they look
identical but Nikon has tweaked every
service and button on the D 3200 some
changes are subtle like the new flowing
line that runs from left to right along
the flash others are a bit more
substantial like the new grip which
gives you a better hold on the camera
something very important in a small DSLR
like this around back you'll see the
live you switch on the D 3100 has been
removed in exchange for a button and the
video record button has been moved up
top below the shutter button the Live
View button is just fine but I did have
an issue with the record button is the
same size in the same spot as the info
and aperture / exposure buttons and even
after a few days of using the camera I
still I still only hit the wrong button
all the time the D 3100 is built
surprisingly well for an entry-level
DSLR and the D 3200 is no exception
one minor noise on the de 3100 is the
absurdly loud SD card or seriously do
you hear that
thankfully the D 3200 has no such
problems as far as ports they both have
HDMI out and a proprietary Nikon port
for GPS on the D 3200 however you can
buy an adapter to give your camera Wi-Fi
to transfer over pictures control the
camera from your smartphone the D 3100
also has mini USB as well as a BL where
the D 3200 has a combo USB and ATL port
along with a 3.5 millimeter microphone
jack the screen on the D 3100 was always
a weak point with a low resolution of
only 230,000 dots it was one of the few
major areas where the low price stuck
out with AD 3200 however there's a new
921,000 dot display which is much better
it matches several the high-end Nikon
DSLRs now the screen works particularly
well on direct sunlight
but both are easily readable in the vast
majority of situations now let's take a
look at image quality the D 3100 sports
a 14 megapixel aps-c sized sensor with
the D 3200 swaps that for a 24 megapixel
sensor the difference in detail is very
noticeable especially when you zoom in
having 24 megapixels is also great for
cropping this is a shot I took with the
D 3200 with a 50 millimeter lens and
there's an F megapixels to see detail
even with extreme cropping beyond the
increased megapixel can
you won't see a great deal of difference
in the D 3100 and D 3200 both they're
very capable shooters that will give you
some very nice-looking files in both
JPEG and RAW the D 3100 has a decent
burst rate of 3 frames per second but
the D 3200 has a considerably better 4
frames of course when you add more
megapixels to a sensor often times you
lose low-light performance the D 3200
does a good job here at the same
settings the D 3200 brings in a slightly
more bright and colourful image and
handles noise just as well if not very
slightly better files stay clean on both
cameras up to ISO 400 and are still
usable for most situations up to ISO
1600 at this point of course there is
definitely visible noise but colors
remain true and detail is still there at
ISO 3200 things still aren't terrible
but noise becomes very noticeable 6400
is really only usable for web use and
12,800 is pretty rough both cameras
support the same 11 point autofocus
system in good lighting it works fairly
quickly and locks on well in low light
it's a bit hit or miss sometimes it can
grab a hole and keep an object in focus
but more often than not you're going to
need to rely on manual focus they share
the same optical viewfinder which isn't
quite full coverage and it's a bit small
but unless you're coming from the d800
you probably won't notice where the D
3200 really shines is in video mode it
now supports 1080p video at 30 frames
per second as well as 720p at 60 frames
the maximum recording time is also up to
20 minutes on the D 3200 compared to 10
minutes on its predecessor the added
resolution on the screen definitely
makes shooting in life.you easier and
having a microphone input is a huge help
you also have manual audio adjustments
as well as having your audio levels
displayed on-screen all right so now
recording using the nikon d3200 and to
help me demo the video mode I have my
Cooke friends am so my setup here is
that the D 3200 just sitting on a tripod
as I trying to try follow this dog
around I am using a 50 millimeter 1.8 G
lens and on top of that I am using the
standard audio from the microphone built
into the camera so some of the cool
features on the D 3200 that you can
adjust all your settings while recording
so for example I'm at 160 is shutter
speed right now I'm go to 180 1/100 125
you see it's a little dark so if I want
just my ISO and go to 400 I go to 800
and then let's say we want to bump the
shutter speed a little higher so you can
do all that and of course since this is
the SLR we can kind of manually focus so
if you want to do like a little rack
focus here BAM there's the dog fully in
focus about the only thing you can
adjust while in video mode is your
aperture so if I want right now I'm at F
one point eight if I wanted to change it
I would have to stop recording leave
live views and adjust the aperture and
go back and delight view over beyond
that you have too much all the manual
control you could want all right so I'm
now using the D 3100 so everything else
is exact same I'm using the same lens
the same lighting and seems in the
pretty much the same spot so probably
the biggest difference is that I have no
real manual control about the best I can
do is I can lock exposure and I can you
know adjust everything around and it
won't change the exposure on me but
beyond that it's pretty much automatic
only probably only the other thing I can
do is this is just the exact same way as
I did with the d3 200 you can leave live
view stop recording adjust your aperture
and go back in it will respect that but
beyond that everything else is pretty
much all automatic with Nikon keeping
the D 3100 around below the D 3200 and D
5100 it remains a stellar camera for
$550 in most cases 14 megapixels are
going to be just fine and while the
better screen on the D 3200 is nice it's
not only worth an extra $150 if you have
a D 3100 don't worry your camera is not
just suddenly at a date on the other
hand if you're seriously interested in
video the D 3200 is absolutely worth it
nikon has been quite far behind canon as
far as video goes over the d3 200 has
made some huge gains here combined with
the impressive megapixel count and
better display the D 3200 makes an
excellent first DSLR if you want to see
