videos showing you how you can not only
speed your internet up but also fix some
random and intermittent problems you
might be having so we're going to do is
switch over to Google Public DNS now DNS
also known as a domain name server is
kindly address book for the internet so
let's say you decide to go to a website
such as YouTube
we punch in youtube.com where your
computer has to reach out to a DNS
server which will then tell your
computer hey where is youtube.com
located and then you can connect and all
that kind of good stuff
now typically this works alright all set
up through your internet service
provider however sometimes you can have
some problems it might not be as fast as
it should be it may not be as secure as
it should be and sometimes it might have
just be working as it should be so to do
this all we need to do is switch over to
the Google Public DNS this is a fairly
simple tutorial it should only take you
a few minutes from start to finish now
to do this you're going to need either a
Mac or PC it doesn't matter which I will
show you how to do it on both you need
to be connected to your internet router
so to start with you need to find the IP
address of your router so to do this on
OS 10 you need to go ahead and open up
System Preferences then come over to the
network tab and then with Wi-Fi or
Ethernet whatever you're connected with
go ahead an click on advanced now you
see a couple of different things here
but just click on the TCP / IP tab now
here you'll see up again a bunch of
extra stuff it rigging or all of it
except for whatever it says with side
router so for my example it's going to
be 192.168.1 so this is the IP address
that I need so for example you might
want to write it down copy and paste it
whatever but just keep in mind that you
need to have it on Windows you need to
go ahead and open up network go to local
area connection and then click on
details again you can see a lot of stuff
here
but all that's important is the IP
address listed beside your gateway so
again quite and copy and paste this
write down whatever but be sure you have
it for this next step once you have your
IP address
go ahead and open up your browser it
doesn't really matter whichever one you
use and go up to the address bar
now instead of typing in a typical thing
like YouTube or Google or whatever when
type that IP address that we just found
so again in my case is 192.168.1 go
ahead enter it and now you should be in
your router setup page now here's where
it might get just a little bit
complicated so what we need to do is
find our dns settings in our router
setup page now pretty much all routers
are going to have different setup pages
so for example I'm using a Belkin router
and this is what I see but you might be
using a Linksys router and see something
entirely different however don't worry
too much all you do is locate the DNS
setting
so example for me is right here on the
left side but again just if you need to
look around a little bit feel free to
just be careful not to go change a bunch
of settings or anything just be sure to
look until you see the DNS settings so
then open this up and if you're prompted
for a password go ahead and enter that
or if you don't have a password you can
skip it or if it doesn't come up it
didn't come up all right so now we just
need to change your settings before you
do this though it's probably not a bad
idea to write down your current DNS
settings so if you ever want to revert
back it's going to be really simple so I
have a couple of options here if you
have an automatic from ISP button go and
check that off you're going to see a DNS
address as well as most likely a
secondary DNS address so for the first
one you just need to type in 8.8.8.8 and
for the secondary e to type in 8.8.4.4
so all that's going to do is redirect
from your current DNS settings over to
the Google Public DNS so once you got
that make sure that you have the IP
address entered correctly go out and
apply the changes in lecture router
restart now what in start browsing the
web and see how much faster your
internet is so for me I notice that
everything loaded about a second or so
faster which i think is a pretty good
improvement anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave
it a thumbs up really appreciate that
and if you're interested in more videos
