the tutorial showing you how you can
jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad
on the latest iOS 5.1.1 firmware now
before we begin there a couple things I
do want to go over first of all this
jailbreak is compatible with most but
not all devices so if this does support
the iPhone 3GS the iPhone 4 the iPod
Touch 3rd generation the iPod Touch 4th
generation and the iPad 1 this does not
support the iPad 2 or 3 and does not
support the iPhone 4s in addition this
is the tethered jailbreak now what that
means is that every time you need to
reboot your device you will need to plug
it back into your computer and rerun
writes note for it to be able to boot
all right so before we begin once you
need a couple of things first of all is
our device itself so for this tutorial
I'm going to be using an iPod Touch 4th
generation hope it works the exact same
way with all the devices that I
mentioned before you should have it
plugged in via USB to your computer and
on top of that you should also have it
backed up so you should not lose any
data in the jailbreak holder it's always
a possibility so it's best to be safe
than sorry so back it up through iCloud
or go ahead and just back it up through
iTunes it doesn't really matter just
make sure that your data is safe and
secure you'll also need an iOS 5.1 i PSW
for your device now even though we are
jailbreaking on 5.1.1 you still need the
iOS 5.1 i PSW you may already have this
on your computer but otherwise you will
need to download it now I'll have a link
in the description which will show you
how to find it or download it which I
already need to do beyond that we're
also going to need bread snow now red
snow is the jailbreaking program I'm
going to use you guys ever drill broken
form unlikely you use red snow and this
is available for both Windows and Mac
and it works the exact same way on both
now you need to open up red snow on the
bottom here you should see your device
is connected if it's not showing up be
sure that it is properly plugged in now
what we do is click on extras and select
IPS though you now select that
five-point-one again not 5.1.1 but 5.1
go ahead and open it it will
successfully identify the build we can
go ahead and continue with the jailbreak
so go ahead and back out and hit on the
jailbreak tab it will take just a moment
to prepare the jailbreak data and we're
gonna be good to go depending on your
device you may have a couple of
different options here however the most
important thing is to make sure that
install city is checked as far as
installing custom bundle goes if you
don't know why that is feel free to skip
it and if you have an iPod touch
enabling battery percentage is very
helpful so once you've got that done go
ahead and click Next now we need to put
our device into DFU mode all right so at
this point we need to shut our device
off before we do that again be sure that
your device is plugged in via USB and
all you do is hold the top right button
until you get the slide to power off so
once you do that go ahead and slide it
you'll see that pinwheel will be sure to
wait until the pinwheel is totally off
before proceeding
entering DFU mode is simple mind you go
ahead and come over to the next tab and
hold the power button for three seconds
now hold the power in the home for ten
and of course red snow will count you
down but I'm right here to show you the
way it's on three two one release the
power button and continue holding the
home button for roughly thirty seconds
or so so as soon as you see that red
snow will give it up so it should be
just another second or two at this point
you're good to go
simply give red snow a few minutes to go
ahead and process all the data on your
device so you will see some lines of
code and all that kind of stuff but
don't worry just give it a few minutes
and I'll be right back as soon as it's
done all right so once it's done go
ahead and slide to unlock and then go
over to your last page you should now
see Cydia however if you open it up it's
not going to do anything and it's got a
white icon so let's go back to red snow
and finish up the last step with red
snow open come over to extras and then
click on just boot now you're going to
need to put your device into DFU mode
just like we did before and you're going
to need to do this every single time
your device is totally shut off once our
device is rebooted we should see the
slide down long so go ahead and do that
and slide over to your second page you
should see that city looks normal again
so go ahead and open this up that's
gonna ask who we are honestly it doesn't
really matter but I usually just put
developer in and then it's gonna go
ahead and load it for the first time
congratulations you're now jailbroken if
you had any issues feel free to let me
know in the comments below I'd be more
than happy to try to help you out if you
