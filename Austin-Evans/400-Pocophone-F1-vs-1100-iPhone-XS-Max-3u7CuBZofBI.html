expensive starting at $1000 in reaching
fourteen hundred and fifty dollars for
the maxed out max if you see what I did
there it's easy to say that this is the
most expensive flagship ever on the
other hand I recently took a look at the
cheapest flagship you can buy the 300
hour poco phone app one even then it's
$400 armor configuration which is what I
have here it is an incredible bargain to
be clear I don't think anyone is cross
shopping these two phones but I also
don't think it's a crazy idea now sure
if you've got the kind of budget for a
high-end flagship like the iPhone by all
means go pick one up I think for a lot
of people if you can get a very similar
experience for a whole lot less why
wouldn't you which brings us to the rear
question of this video can a $400 poco
phone match up to $8,000 plus iPhone
this is probably the strongest case for
the iPhone 10s it has incredibly nice
Hardware Melly is it rocking glass on
front and back but unlike most phones
which are made out of aluminum this has
a stainless steel chassis now of course
that's something that's up to personal
preference some people won't like the
idea that it is going to scuff a little
bit easier specifically with the Silver
Edition but as far as I'm concerned it
looks nice and gives you a nice sense of
heft which feels very premium on the
other hand the poco phone is primarily
made out of plastic now that's not
necessarily a bad thing if you take a
look at the jerry-rigged everything
video he did a really solid test of
seeing how durable it is and it did hold
up pretty well unfortunately though
plastic is never going to feel quite as
premium as stuff like stainless steel on
glass to be fair the armoured edition I
have here is a slight upgrade over the
standard version as the back is made out
of aramid fiber as opposed to plastic it
feels nice and it does give you a little
bit of grip enos to the iPhone lacks but
there's a clear winner here and build
quality it's the phone that cost three x
bar there are some advantages to the
poco phone's hardware however USBC
versus lightning is kind of a wash as
far as I'm concerned what the polka
phone has the iPhone lacks is a
headphone jack and less sure techrax and
you Joe on end the iPhone 10's is gonna
be using a whole lot of dongles on
adapters to listen to music but balanced
line is that you're losing basically any
kind of water resistance with the poco
phone f1
the iPhone has no problems with with a
full ip68 water resistance hey look I
didn't even press the screen it's not
work so you won't find wireless charging
on the poco phone something that is
standard on the iPhone
however the poco bond does have a
fingerprint sensor and be fair both
phones have a pretty solid
implementation of face unlock the Ida
advantage here is if you don't want to
you know stare at your phone unlock it
just easily drop a finger on the button
and unlock it like that let's be real
though the vast majority of people are
going to put these phones in a case
regardless and the build quality is good
enough that neither of them really worry
me all that much now yeah the polka
phone can't quite keep up with the
iPhone but considering how much more
expensive this is yeah I would hope so
usually when it comes to a budget phone
one of the biggest things you have to
sacrifice his performance but I was
actually the strong suit of the poco
phone inside you'll find a snapdragon
845 paired with 6 gigs of RAM and 128
gigs of storage and that's not a perfect
comparison but in context the iPhone
only has 4 gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of
storage on the base model and again it's
$1100
that is really impressive for phones
that's this much cheaper however as soon
as you start trying to do any kind of
benchmarks you're going to find the
polka phone just can't hang with the
iPhone it shouldn't be a huge surprise
finale is the Pogo phone going to be
significantly slower than the 10s but
even the one plus 6 is going to be
quicker even though it has basically the
same spec it's much the same story on
the graphics side the iPhone is a huge
huge leap over what's available on the
Android side full stop and the polka
phone is no exception
surprise surprise this does apply to
real world use so I don't think anyone
would call the Pogo phone slow but
putting side-by-side with the iPhone and
you will notice that there is a
responsive difference responsive
difference responsiveness difference a
difference in responsiveness perhaps a
responsive difference one thing I think
is important to mention is that while
the polka phone is a global phone it's
not necessarily meant for the US market
don't get me wrong it is available to be
purchased here in the US but it doesn't
have full LTE support for all the
carriers it's pretty good on AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile but Sprint and Verizon are a
bit hit or miss this is all a lot more
straightforward than you might think yes
the iPhone is faster and that really
shouldn't be a surprise but we consider
the enormous price difference and the
fact the polka phone can totally hang
with the iPhone
some ways and slightly surpasses it and
others is incredibly impressive
take a look at the screens and you're
going to find that they look very very
similar the polka phone has a slightly
smaller 6.2 inch display whereas the
iPhone is rocking a 6.5 inch panel but
they're actually really close there's no
doubting that both these phones have
quite the knotch I can't complain too
much so both the poco and the iPhone do
have nately their selfie cameras here
but they also do have some face id Tech
feel to unlock the issue here is that
while the iPhone looks pretty much
uniform on the rest of it
the poco does have a pretty large chin
considering that it's at their the price
though I really can't complain too much
run the phone's through our display
tests and what you'll find is something
kind of surprising yes the iPhone has a
terrific display and some of the things
that our test doesn't really show is the
excellent viewing angles as well as the
contrast but that being said color
accuracy and brightness on the poco
phone is right up there in addition to
having a slightly higher screen
resolution the real advantage for the
iPhone is that it's using an OLED panel
versus LCD there's nothing wrong with a
solid LCD like on the poco but you're
not going to get quite as vibrant of a
pictures on the iPhone still though I'm
incredibly impressed with just how close
this gets surprisingly both the iPhone
and poco phone share the exact same size
12 megapixel sensor now mind you there
are some other advantages with the
iPhone including having optical image
stabilization as well as an actual
telephoto lens but on paper they look
pretty close it might not look
particularly exciting but this actually
should be a reasonable test of the
camera now is there a lot of detail on
the tree we've got a lot of vibrant
colors as well as some serious dynamic
range it does seem like the iPhone got
the white balance just a little bit more
accurate detail wise they're fairly
close I will say there's a little bit
more dynamic range on the iPhone here
and it did do a good job with sort of
warming up the image but it's not a huge
difference oh that's a much bigger
difference the iPhone really was able to
pull in a lot of that sky whereas the
Polka foam totally blew it out yeah the
polka phone just does not hold the
shadows as well as the iPhone it also
seems like it's a little bit over sharp
in this photo the iPhone does look a
little bit more natural it shouldn't be
a huge surprise that the iPhone has a
better camera but I'm also curious about
is the video capability this is what 4k
video looks like straight off of the
poco phone f1 so of course you guys can
be the judge for yourself I will say
that there's not quite
the same level stabilization so we can
move a little bit left and right you'll
be able to tell but based on that in the
audio not back on the other hand this is
what you're going to be getting on the
iPhone 10's max here we're recording at
4k 24 frames although it is important to
note that the iPhone will go all the way
up to 60 but first of all you're going
to be getting stereo audio something new
for the iPhone on top of that to my eye
this is going to be a little bit more of
a natural image with a little bit less
sort of crunchiness a little bit less
compression next up we have the
front-facing cameras whereas the iPhone
has 7 megapixels to work with the pokel
phone has 20 but is it actually any good
I will say I like the iPhone colors a
bit more and there is more dynamic range
but I've got to give this one to the
poco phone it's wider which means of
course you're going to be able to on
your selfies if you're super popular
like Ken but almost more importantly
than that it's a nice sharp image those
extra megapixels are definitely doing
something so does the $400 poco phone f1
match up to the $1100 iPhone 10's max
well subjectively the iPhone is a better
phone there is no doubt in a lot of ways
it's actually a pretty significant
difference but in most ways that people
care about
I think the poco phone is right there
and it is incredibly impressive that I'm
even having this comparison right you
might think that of course an iPhone is
going to be way way better but
considering that's nearly three times
the price it is nowhere near three times
