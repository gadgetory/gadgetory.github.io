talking about the two new Playstation 3
Slim's that somebody just announced at
Gamescom today so the first one is the
just the standard PlayStation 3 slim
which is now bumped up from 120
gigabytes to 160 gigabytes I know this
one is actually available in the US
currently right now for $299 however
however if you're in Europe you will
have to wait until October and you'll
have to pay 299 euros so it's a little
bit pricey but it's not too bad
especially considering it you get and
much larger hard drive in addition
there's also a 320 gigabyte PlayStation
Move bundle that will be coming
September now this was actually pretty
interesting it does have the you know
the PlayStation with the three hunting
you bite hard drive and also comes with
your full move bundle as well as a
enclosed copy of the sports champions
game now this one is actually going to
be available in just September 19th in
the United States or September 15th
other over in Europe so it's going to be
a pretty decent deal now the price is
gonna be $399 which is not bad and
should be pretty competitive with the
Xbox 360 slam and Kinect so any other
guys what do you think are you
interested in getting either of these
especially the PlayStation Move bundle
with all of your included the game and
your controller and everything like that
including the nice big hard drive
personally I'm actually really really
considering going ahead this September
and picking up one of them I think I
finally need to get a PlayStation 3 this
looks like a really decent deal to go
ahead and get in on it anyway guys just
let me know in the comments what do you
think anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
