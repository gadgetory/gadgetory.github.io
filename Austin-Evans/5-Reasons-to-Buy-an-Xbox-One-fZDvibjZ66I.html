seen some major improvements and here
are five reasons why you should buy one
in 2018 hey guys Boston reason number
one the Xbox one has seen some massive
improvements think back to 2013 at e3
that year both the ps4 and Xbox one were
officially announced and the Xbox had
some serious flaws to make up for not
only was the ps4 a more powerful console
but the Xbox was also $100 more
expensive it came bundled with Kinect
which at the end of the day ended up
being canceled a few years later it had
a bigger uglier design and to top it all
off Microsoft had all kinds of terrible
misinformation on whether or not it
would actually support used games
whereas Sony had a slightly more elegant
plan thanks since that moment though
Microsoft has essentially been playing
catch-up and I think that's a good thing
for all gamers so think of some of the
things that have changed since the
original Xbox one launched not only have
they seen some major updates to the
software where we've seen three full
revisions of the entire Xbox interface
they also did a lot to improve the
hardware so the not only did they stop
bundling Kinect and eventually kill it
off altogether but when they brought out
the Xbox 1s the hardware pretty much got
rid of all the major problems I had with
the original Xbox one namely the giant
power brick the ugly VCR styling and
they even added some features like an
Ultra HD blu-ray player then came the
Xbox one X last year not only did this
completely blow away none of the
original Xbox one but even the ps4 and
ps4 Pro and performance but for the
first time in over five years Microsoft
could confidently claim they had the
most powerful console you could buy
don't get me wrong I don't mean to say
that the ps4 has stood still in that
same period of time
well you look back at the launch Xbox
one compared to what we had today it is
clear the Microsoft has done a lot of
catching up that brings us to reason
number two exclusives so Sony's early
sales league gave them a massive
advantage and a lot of really cool
exclusive titles for the actual
PlayStation 4 the idea that it was a
more powerful console definitely didn't
hurt things but over the last couple
years especially in 2017 the Xbox team
stepped it up pub G is one
the most popular games in the entire
world right now and the only way to play
it on console is on the Xbox one
yes it's an early access game yes it
does not quite match up to the PC as far
as features and especially performance
however the idea that this is a game
that you can play on even a 200-dollar
Xbox one as it's pretty impressive and
as an early access game it actually has
continued to get a lot better over time
the Forza series has also been one of my
personal favorites so I grew up playing
Gran Turismo
however the yearly releases of not only
the mainline Forza Motorsport games but
especially the really fun horizon games
actually really kept me locked on the
Xbox one ever since the beginning
cuphead definitely took a few years to
come out but the hand-drawn art style
and especially the incredibly tight
gameplay does a good job of making this
not only a good Xbox exclusive but
something that really does stand out on
the platform other games are also on the
way this year including crackdown 3 see
if thieves and hopefully we get a
glimpse at the next Halo game now of
course the ps4 does have a huge library
of exclusives but there's still plenty
of games that are exclusive to the Xbox
one that especially if you've never
played it makes now a great time to pick
one up reason number three is
performance so for the first few years
the Xbox one while a decent upgrade from
the 360 stood no chance at all compared
to the ps4 as far as performance goes it
was significantly less powerful which
meant that mini games ran at a lower
resolution lower settings or both
however all of this changed when the
Xbox one X came out late last year for
$500 you're getting the most powerful
console you can buy period now that even
the ps4 Pro comes close yes sure the ps4
Pro does do a good job of using
checkerboard rendering to upscale images
up to 4k but for the most part this just
does not look as good as the xbox 1x
which will often run games at close to
if not a full 4k resolution you can see
the difference this makes an interesting
change so while on the base end the ps4
games typically do look better than
standard Xbox one but if you jump up to
the 1x and ps4 Pro you're sure the want
X looks better and this is especially
noticeable when it comes to big
multi-platform games now this isn't
always the case sometimes ps4 pro games
can actually look very close to their
Xbox 1x counterparts but with more
memory and more graphics horsepower it's
really hard to argue that the Xbox one X
is not the most powerful console you can
buy today
number four has to do with price well in
the early days the Xbox one was a lot
more expensive that is just not the case
anymore take a quick look through Amazon
and you'll find that the Nintendo
switches around $300 still whereas the
ps4 slim is around 280 but the Xbox one
s is available for as low as $220 and
there are even some pretty decent game
bundles for 230 to 240 now mind you the
Xbox has a smaller 500 go bite hard
drive compared to one terabyte on the
ps4 but it is really simple to upgrade
your storage later on down the line with
a USB based SSD or hard drive now things
do change when you jump up to the pro
versions so the ps4 pro is still pretty
steady at $400 whereas the one acts as
an additional hundred at $500 the $500
one X looks even better when you compare
it to the PC market right now now to be
fair gaming pcs have had a hard year
considering how expensive memory and
graphics cards are but right now it is
just not possible for you to build a
more powerful computer than the Xbox one
X for less than $500 and that brings us
to reason number five backwards
compatibility now back in the old days
pretty much all consoles would at least
be able to play the last generations
games however the last few years in fact
the last 10 years or so very few
consoles have done it with the exception
of the Xbox one now Sony does have
PlayStation now for the ps4 which will
allow you to play a lot of ps3 games on
your ps4 but the issue is is that it is
entirely reliant on streaming so what
you're going to have to do is not only
hope that the game you want to play is
available and their catalog but you're
going to have to pay for it either by
purchasing the game again or paying to
rent it whereas on the Xbox side you can
not only just redownload games from the
360 that you had already purchased but
you can just put the Xbox 360 disc in
let it take a quick download and you're
good to play from a technical point of
view it is really impressive what
Microsoft was able to pull off here
they've essentially built an entire Xbox
360 emulators that runs on the Xbox one
so once you jump into a 360 game it
pretty much is like you're playing on an
actual 360 it reboots into a 360 mode
and you're going to get pretty much all
the features and the games to run almost
the same if not even slightly better
than they did on the original hardware
what's even cooler is that if you have
an Xbox one X you can play some 360
games in full 4k now this doesn't work
for all titles will you
that you're getting a resolution boost
pretty much nine times the original
hardware titles like Fallout 3 in Halo 3
really do look incredible now not all
Xbox 360 games are supported on the one
but there's actually a surprisingly
large library and Microsoft continues to
add more games on a regular basis what's
also cool is that the Xbox one can now
play original Xbox games admittedly this
game library is a lot smaller than the
360 titles but it's a nice addition and
all these are totally usable with the
original discs so unlike a lot of the
other options out there you don't have
to rebuy anything you can just take your
current disc drop in your xbox and
you're good to go
and I think Microsoft deserves some
serious props for making that happen the
Xbox one is definitely not perfect but
if you never gave it a shot now really
is a great time to get into the Xbox one
now curious what do you guys think about
the one and what do you want to see me
take a look at next time on five reasons
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
