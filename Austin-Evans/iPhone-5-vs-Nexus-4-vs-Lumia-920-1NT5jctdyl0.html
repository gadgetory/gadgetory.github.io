here with a comparison between the Apple
iPhone 5 Google Nexus 4 and Nokia Lumia
920 as the flagship phones running iOS
Android and Windows Phone each has a lot
to offer so let's take a look to start
with let's go over the designs the
iPhone 5 hasn't changed too much since
2010 but it still holds up very nicely
he's got a single sheet of glass up
front and a piece of aluminum on back
with a pair of glass windows top and
bottom it's all wrapped up nicely with a
metal band that wraps around the phone
which contains the buttons as well as
doubles as the antenna the word here is
definitely premium the build quality is
unmatched and the fine details really
set it apart say what you want about
Apple but design is something they have
down moving on to the Nexus 4 at first
glance it looks just like its
predecessor the Galaxy Nexus take a
closer look and you'll see it's a big
step forward with an entirely unbroken
front panel without logos or even
physical buttons like the iPhone 4 and
4s the front back were all glass but the
similarities in there the Nexus is a
much larger phone overall and features
some very solid build quality with
gently tapered curves and a soft touch
rubber strip around the edges
the back is covered in a series of
shimmering dots which change depending
on the lighting and give it a very
unique look the Lumia 920 on the other
hand looks nothing like the other two
wrapped in a yellow polycarbonate shell
it certainly draws attention although
you can't opt for more tame colors if
you'd like it immediately gives a sense
of solid miss with a much thicker and
heavier frame and while this isn't for
everyone I like it the front is a bit
awkward with the screen and capacitive
buttons which are offset from the bottom
but it does feature a dedicated camera
button which is a nice addition the
others lack part of the reason the Lumia
is thicker is to house that camera which
is absolutely a high point of the phone
he features an eight point seven
megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization which is a first and
delivers spectacular low-light
performance compared to the iPhone and
Nexus as it runs Windows Phone 8 you'll
find the live tile interface which is a
nice mix between app icons and widgets
that can update on the fly the entire OS
is easily among the most responsive
experiences out there which is a big
plus while there are lots of Android
phones Nexus devices have a couple of
dances with support for major software
updates an entirely unscanned interface
Android 4.2 is definitely one of the
best mobile operating systems out there
with a wide range of apps available and
a customizable interface
it also features top-notch integration
with everything Google which can be a
big plus if you're already in the
ecosystem with email search media and
much much more you can't talk about the
iPhone without mentioning the insane
amount of apps available at over 700,000
that by itself isn't too impressive as
Android has a similar number but the
overall quality really does tend to be a
step ahead
iOS itself while a bit outdated in some
ways compared to the others is still a
solid OS everything just tends to work
and like the hardware there are little
details that add up to make a better
experience if you're a big gamer iOS has
hundreds of excellent titles to choose
from and the iPhone 5 is no slouch when
it comes to power spec wise these are
three very different phones the iPhone 5
is rocking a dual-core Apple a6
processor clocked at 1.3 gigahertz the
Lumia 920 sports a dual-core Snapdragon
s4 processor coming in at 1.5 gigahertz
where the Nexus 4 smashes both with a
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro at 1.5
gigahertz the Nexus 4 also has twice as
much RAM on board at two gigabytes
compared to 1 gigabyte apiece for the
others the phones aren't without faults
however while it does have LTE the Lumia
920 isn't exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T in the
United States more of an issue than that
is the lack of apps take one look at the
top paid apps and you'll see nothing but
random apps you're probably not
interested in even free apps are often
lacking is there's no Gmail YouTube or
any other Google app besides a basic
search app and the list goes on Windows
Phone itself is quite good but you'll be
forced to deal with poor third-party
apps for a lot it's a good phone but
right now it's simply outclassed by the
others with both LTE as well as options
on almost every carrier worldwide the
iPhone 5 is a solid choice but it too
has its faults for starters while iOS is
still leading the way in some areas like
apps and the level of polish it's still
very clearly the same operating system
that launched on the iPhone back in 2007
Notification Center is a port imitation
of what's on Android doing something as
simple as turning off Wi-Fi it requires
you to dig through the settings menu and
the home screen isn't customizable at
all the calendar app changes to show
what day it is but there's no support
for widgets or anything interactive
forcing you to open an app to see what
Android and Windows Phone can display on
your home screen the iPhone 5 is
undoubtedly a good phone but is the best
here you can't talk about the Nexus 4
without mentioning the biggest drawback
no LTE but simply this isn't acceptable
for a flagship phone at the end of 2012
in some areas data speeds can be
reasonable but almost always you'll be
dealing with much slower speeds than the
Lumia or iPhone on the same note while
it's great this an unlocked phone it
only works on
and carriers such as AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
worldwide this isn't much of a problem
but in the u.s. if you're on Sprint or
Verizon you're out of luck all of that
said the Nexus 4 is my pick for the best
of the best in this one Android 4.2 has
come a long way and is in my opinion the
best mobile OS out there the hardware
isn't quite up to the iPhone 5 but it is
unique and thanks to that much larger
screen it's a better option for doing
many things like watching video unlike
practically every other Android phone
out there it's imported directly from
Google meaning you can expect updates
dated first for the next couple years
factor in the absurdly low price and the
Nexus 4 gets the not in this one
disagree with me be sure to sound off in
the comments about which of these is
your favorite and as always be sure to
hit up that like button and subscribe if
you enjoyed if you're interested in more
on each of these phones I've reviewed
them all fully so feel free to go check
those videos out anyway I will catch you
guys in the next one
thing I found strange is that iOS really
doesn't take advantage of the larger
screen the first thing you'll notice is
just how quick and responsive the phone
is no matter how fast you try to go
through the interface it keeps up and
easily matches the best from iOS and
Windows Phone you can also resize the
tiles and rearrange them as much as
you'd like just like Windows 8 you can
customize the colors the entire OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
