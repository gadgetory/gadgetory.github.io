it's Duncan and today I'm here with a
political application called Sentinel 2
now if you've watched many my previous
videos you will know that Sentinel 2
sent in the original Sentinel was
definitely one of my favorite games and
definitely my favorite tower defense
game
well Sentinel 2 has just been released
recently I've had my hands on for why
I've been playing it really getting a
feel for it I gotta say I am very very
impressed so I'm gonna run you guys
through it and show you guys what I
think and I hopefully you guys go pick
it up pick it up - anyway let's get this
one started now before I begin I'm
pretty bad with this but I will remember
it anyway do you see this right down
here this access music if you've seen I
don't bother
do it if you've seen with the
three-pointer when it first came out
they were apples talking about a lot of
different new things they were gonna do
well for the most part they really
haven't delivered or at least that most
of the developers having delivered
you've seen a couple of new features
here and there but this is one of my
favorite features this is where you can
basically go through here and play your
individual songs from your library
inside the inside game so before it was
either all or nothing
it was basically either you go in play
the game and say okay I want to play
whatever song I want whatever song I'm
talking about and then what I do is I
would just use my ipod play it through
that and then usually with the gang we
need to give you a mute feature if the
game did not give you a mutant feature
you couldn't listen to music at all and
that was that so now that there's a nice
mix you can go ahead and listen to music
and you still hear the sound effects as
you can see here I won't show you cuz
copyright and everything but if I were
to hit that and start playing music it
would apply it in the background um it
works quite nice there's still some bugs
and bugs and everything in it but that's
more of Apple's fault than anybody else
anyway okay so let's just go ahead and
show you some of the missions I just go
straight into this one now if you've
seen the original Sentinel
Sentinel 2 will be very very you really
know it what it's about Sentinel to it
there's a lot alike said no one but it's
that's a good thing sent no one was
fantastic
and Sentinel two it's it's really in it
evolved there's new weapons there's new
towers lots and lots of new maps lots of
just a lot of new gameplay I love it and
so let's go ahead and show you guys it's
a tower defense game so there's not a
whole lot and see I grab just bought a
tower try it and drop it in there and
grab another one and put it like right
here and that's that and of course the
first levels are very easy I mean I just
mean no big deal let me zoom in a little
bit and show you guys you can see that
the graphics on this is just excellent
now I got interest canary things so you
can zoom perfectly in as much you want
this is just a really simple one let's
go ahead and update this tower but now
it will be more damage and have a better
range you see enough you can tell that
he's changed this color and that lost
makeup color but looks different and
let's go ahead and and of course is it
seen is this the first one it's almost
like a tutorial that one out there and
we just continue playing now or if this
is the very first level of the means the
very first bit of the personation so
obviously it gets much much tougher they
will be blowing down stuff and it's a
lot of fun now let me show you something
unique I probably won't be able to get
you know that yet but you see here
normally on the bottom you can see that
there are usually where you build your
different towers every time you kill
someone you get money and then as well
as if you don't spend the money you get
interest on it and you build these and
obviously is it's the more you span the
better they're gonna be you know so
pretty like inside that update that one
talking but let me just show you
something cool before there were this
the very far left what an original
Sentinel which was basically drones
which would fly around and repair your
base which I will show that in a minute
it would also collect money for you they
are bad
in Sentinel 2 and there and there's a
lot more to you have these which collect
money for you but the main thing is
accenting all right here these are
automated weapons well sort of but let
me explain well I'll show you in a
minute but like like this one for
example basically the longer you wait
and everything they come I mean I'm
gonna lose or not pay attention but the
longer you wait wait just one second
that will appear and that's automated
missiles to come down from your ship
down and they will attack same thing
with these now if I was to show you one
of those that's very cool
but I mean the longer you wait like that
will fill up then if you don't use that
one then this will fill up let's fill up
and like it's like this one for example
is like the laser beam to come down and
you just drag your finger across the
screen but anyway I had better get
paying attention okay so you here yep
have enough energy to fire a weapon from
this Sigma you see it flashes so right
here let's go ahead and wait for some
some enemies alien whether you wanna
call them to come up and I will show you
guys what it looks like okay let's fire
it off now now you'll see I see these
missed you see those missiles coming in
of course it works a lot better later on
but grabs another tower you know see the
birth when the first level is pretty
easy as long as you know what you're
doing and you see these missiles keep
coming in and they will basically just
look for you guys they're not the most
powerful because I just yes the first
level you got the 2 and the 3 and the 4
but it's pretty cool and then right here
I can fast forward and you can see that
everybody's just flying long and I can
just grab whatever I want
mmm it's pretty cool on this it comes in
handy a lot when you're going because if
you see this I'm gonna wait 12 of 60 so
it goes up for a while let me zoom out a
little bit if you can see now just leave
that alone
oh well as I say that I'm getting killed
ok let's drag this over here now soo
many actually isn't perfect do you see
this right here
this is if you would if they were to get
past this and go along and of course
there's lots of different maps so it
changes but
this is a destructible offense this is
something really cool you I don't really
ever see and of course here comes some
more something and drag some towers in
here and that brigham anyway did you see
this this is a defense because their
object is to go through here and then
this is your base and if they get inside
you they break this wall down and get
inside your basic blues so this right
here is basically destructible defense
now I'm not sure let me go ahead okay so
this just shows you seeing as this is
the first level it's almost like a
tutorial so this is out here is a really
cool thing because actually you know
what I'm gonna say this I'll show it to
you this is like if you when you see
what wait do you see the barrier bonus
and base bonus you get a base bonus for
if this is if your base is unharmed then
you get a bonus if your barriers not and
as you go along
in these can actually come from
different ways you see that they're like
coming from the one way but in some maps
that we come maybe from here and then
here and here
not exactly on this one but when you go
ahead and zoom and cause everyone to get
here but and then as you go along you
get points from these in your bonus and
then it also helps because it just keeps
them and that you shoot on them that
much longer and course I'm losing so let
me show you one of the cool ones that
better not okay well that's just about
it um let me go ahead and back is still
except okay so that's that guessed about
it I can show you there's other missions
there's different things of that you
have scores and there are a lot let me
just show you through I had not gotten
through everything but you see there's
probably 10 there's lots of them and
there's different difficulties and then
there's back different modes as well as
of missions which there's 10 missions
and these are more specific like this
one there's like one one one big boss
that's coming towards you basically
that's you've got only so much money
like $300 or $500 and you've got to stop
him by build it and build a tower and
take it down
like this one all you can use is
Sentinel which I showed you like those
missiles and you have like you basically
have to call in things from The Sentinel
that's all you can do to defend and
there's ten of those
so in general I really really really
like signal to I was a huge fan of
Sentinel and Sentinel - is everything
Sentinel was and it's just that much
better
it is currently 299 in the App Store and
guys definitely I would say check it out
if you're like if you're into tardif
it's getting definitely at least take a
look at it and even if you're not that's
okay
personally I don't like tower defense
games all that much but Sentinel is a
really good one and guys I highly
recommend it it's a ton of fun and you
know you will definitely not be
disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
