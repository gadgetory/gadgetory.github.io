episode of d3 live so today I'm going to
be talking about some of the things I
expect to see next week at e3 a most
notably the Sony in GP as well as the
Nintendo Wii to now do keep in mind
those are both code names i'm going to
be talking a little bit about some of
the names i expect but I take all the
names of the grain of salt we will
definitely find out next week but well
talk a little about some of my
predictions what I expect to see what
I'd like to see a lot kind of good stuff
so the first thing I want to talk about
is the sony in GP which most likely will
be called these Sony PlayStation Vita's
some kind of combination of that but
yeah the next generation in GP PSP to
whether they're going to call it and
then we've already seen some about this
they showed a about two or three months
ago they showed it off a little bit ago
and we already know a lot about it but
what I do expect to see is some sort of
release date hopefully i should be
sitting at this year rather than mixture
as well as a price now as far as the NGP
the video or whatever it's going to be
called as far as the price goes I think
that's going to be a very very important
thing and when they first showed it off
there's a lot of people saying including
myself it's going to be really really
expensive I mean you got a five inch LED
touchscreen you got a rear touchscreen
you've got quad core processing mean
there's a lot of power and a lot of
technology packed into that console so a
lot of us were respecting it's going to
be very very expensive whoever sony has
been pretty much non-stop ever since
that they showed it off that it's going
to be very reasonable it's going to be
priced right there's going to be a lot
they've been talking a lot about the
price and how they think it's going to
be really reasonable so the best way I
can kind of think about that is compared
to the 3ds which courses two hundred
fifty dollars now if they can come close
or match that I think they will be
absolutely golden i think that the NGP
is a lot more hardware it's a lot more
you know technical power and all that
kind of stuff then the 3ds so if they
can get in around that slaw I think
they'll have no problem selling millions
and millions and millions of them up as
far as that the Vita goes that's about
as far as we know of course we know
pretty much everything else course I'm
sure they'll show like some software
stuff and everything but that's going to
be about it as far as that goes now
probably going to be a little bit more
important is the next generation
Nintendo Wii which I'm just going to be
calling way to I'm almost sure they'll
come up with a better name than that but
whatever so the next generation we has
been a long time in the coming a long
time coming
that phrase goes it's been expected for
several years now and there's a lot of
really cool things that we're expecting
so of course this is also officially
confirmed Nintendo has said that he'll
be showing off the next generation of
Nintendo Wii at e3 so the next couple of
days we'll be able to see it but as far
as the specs so what features all that
kind of stuff goes we have no idea but
we have heard a lot about it so let me
go ahead and talk a little bit about
what I think and what I hope to see so
the first thing is is that it should
have some really interesting controls so
as opposed to you know using the you
know the motion controls of the way
which was really the number one reason
why people bought the way in my opinion
anyway this actually seems to will have
some sort of touch screen now as far as
the size the button layout all can't
stop I honestly have no idea we'll have
to wait and see but I do expect to have
some kind of controller with a screen
with some physical buttons as well and
most likely with some motion sensing
perhaps even cameras so that's really
interesting on one hand I think that
having a controller that's basically you
know a lot like the NGP it's got all
kinds of you know fancy touch screens
and whatnot on the other hand though I'm
absolutely dreading going to go down to
my local video game store buy a new
controller it's going to cost like you
know an arm and a leg to buy us but
that's kind of besides the point
hopefully they'll include a couple of
them in the package but who knows but
anyway the control looks to be really
impressive and as far as the console
itself goes is actually you should be no
slouch so pretty famously the wii has
been very very another word i guess
capote it's been very very slow compared
to the playstation 3 and the xbox 360
since it's basically Nintendo GameCube
hardware with just a little bit a couple
of tweaks in here and there I'm the
graphics has been nowhere near their
counterparts and because of that it's
kind of hard to make games if you know
if you decide to make a game you can
make it on xbox can make it on
PlayStation might have it on the pc but
there's no way that that game which is
going to look really nice is going to
run on the wii and what they seem to be
able to change this because the next
generation we the we too should have
much much more powerful hardware now
there has been some leaked specs the
online uh you know quad core processor
and all kinds of stuff like that but
again i don't want to get into the
specifics we will find out next week but
anyway i do expect the next generation
we to be a major major upgrade anyway
for the second segment of d3 live i will
be taking live questions from everyone
in the chat so currently have quite a
few people
right now so let's just take some
questions about the different topics and
see what you guys have to say what do I
think about the OS on the PS Vita that's
a great question from what we've seen
and do keep in mind we've only seen just
a couple of screenshots really not a
whole lot of in-depth stuff I'm not very
impressed of course you know it's going
to be touchscreen it seems to be getting
rid of the standard interfaces we've
seen on the PSP and the ps3 but on the
other hand it looks kind of a little
childish little kind of unfinished if
you will I was just a bunch of big
buttons to just press a big bunch of
colored buttons hopefully that's not
done yet hopefully they will kind of
refine it make a little bit nicer
looking of an interface but from what
I've seen right now I'm not impressed at
all am I going to buy the wii too i
honestly have no idea more than likely i
probably will but I'm what you see I do
i do own the original way and i really
haven't found that much use for it i
mean pretty much the only game i ever
play is super smash brothers brawl and
cage when i watched a little bit netflix
on but mostly it's just collecting dust
for the past couple years and i really
hope that the wii too i I don't hope I'm
almost sure that the way to will be a
lot better as far as for hardcore gamers
like myself but I will definitely have
to wait and say about that do I think
minecraft portable edition will be on
the Vita I certainly hope so of course
you guys aren't familiar with minecraft
fantastic game and it will be coming to
the sony xperia play soon and that'll be
really cool since that's already kind of
hooked up with sony that they were able
to bring it over to the vita but of
course love to what you can see about
that but again yet that would be a
fantastic idea letting the way too will
be more expensive than the first
duration almost definitely consoles
pretty much always every year rather
every generation you know if it's
hundred dollars well the next one's
going to be two hundred dollars or etc
etc so yeah especially with some
touchscreen controllers and whatnot
although expect it would be more
expensive but I don't see anything from
what I've seen besides the controllers
it should be like outrageously expensive
like you know the PlayStation 3 was
super super expensive went first came
out I don't see anything any reason why
would be that expensive I would
definitely expect you to be probably a
good bit more than the weed was with
brand new but I don't think it'll be
we'll see like a eight hundred dollar
way to any time soon are they still
aiming the way to for families instead
of gamer
you know that's a good question um
personally I think they really need to
strike a good balance now you know
before the Gamecube it was pretty much
well it was kind of in the middle that
is kind of a little bit more towards
gamers but with the way they basically
like hardcore gamers like myself they
really did not focus on us at all and
they you know stuff like we fit and
everything which well made them lots of
money most of us who are like again
hardcore gamers we go buy an xbox or
playstation or a pc we don't go find our
way and go play you know gears of war
and that kind of stuff so what Isaac an
engineer willing to do is strike a fine
balance they don't need to lose all
those families who like oh let's go play
the way I mean that's a pretty big deal
that you know they were able to get all
kinds of people who never play video
games in their life getting excited up
video games so you need to keep that
audience but on the other hand they
really can do a lot to cater to people
like me probably cater to people like
you who want to play you know some
action games racing games first-person
shooters you know that kind of games hey
