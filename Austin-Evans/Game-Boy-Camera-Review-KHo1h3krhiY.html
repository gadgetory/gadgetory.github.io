the Game Boy camera the Game Boy camera
was a really interesting little
accessory for the original Game Boy you
know it actually had a lot of first
imploding it was actually all the way
back in 1988 Guinness World Book of
Records smallest digital camera so of
course this does not look like a
particularly small digital camera these
days but again back in 1998 that was
pretty cool especially considering you
can just hook it up to Game Boy so
before we begin the review and go over a
couple of the key things about this I
was released in 1998 and of course known
as the Game Boy camera or pocket camera
if you're from Japan the camera
resolution was less than stellar as you
guys might imagine it took a 128 by 112
was a resolution which I don't know like
probably point 0 0 1 megapixel I don't
know exactly the math but very very low
resolution pictures and on top of that
it's shot in 4 colors black dark gray
light gray and white well I think it was
the greens in the Game Boy but you guys
get the you know get the idea for colors
128 by 112 not the best picture in the
world but this is a digital camera this
is back when your digital cameras were
not on every cell phone and all that
kind of stuff so it's a pretty cool
stuff so it should show you guys how to
do it
I am going to be using with my Game Boy
like but it does work for pretty much
any Game Boy you want I can plug in here
right
so wait works you just plug it in like
anything else I'm you can go ahead and
have it you know pointing to you and you
know do some self-portraits or whatever
or you can twist it around and start
taking pictures of you know various
things in front of you so it's really
pretty cool and I'll be demoing it with
the Game Boy Advance
SK best purely because it's much easier
to record the screen than an original
Gameboy but of course do keep in mind it
does work for pretty much a Game Boy or
whatever now this is a pretty unique
system I won't lie or write it I guess
it's not a system it's more of an
accessory but first thing you'll notice
is the awesome music
yeah anyway that's one thing the game
became was very interesting it was a it
was certainly it was interesting I'll
just leave it that I'm you guys can see
there's a wide variety of things you can
view your photos I don't actually have
any on right now I'm there games that
you can play I'll show you guys that in
a minute but the one really cool thing
about this is that it had tons and tons
and tons of things you could do with it
so you can see here menus were kind of
cool the music is like totally it it's
kind of a very interesting thing but
it's pretty cool I'm so a couple things
you can do items magic for example items
will allow you to do your self timer or
time lapse again the eyes these menus
and everything or just I mean they're
just so bizarre but it's in a cool way
meas it's really interesting but let's
just go straight to shooting now again
it's going to be kinda hard because
again using with the gameboy advance but
let's see if I can show you guys here if
I can turn it around and put this in
front of the camera it's gonna see here
there's the bottom of my camera and
there's my fingers I'm in fact let's
take this off screen and take a picture
really quickly here so I'm just going to
take a picture of me alright so I gotta
flip it upside down but you guys can see
there there's a beautiful beautiful
picture of me
the like I said guys the quality is less
than amazing but what you could do if I
flip it over to the right side as you
can see there are options to save cancel
you can also adjust the brightness and
contrast but let's go ahead and use that
picture and back out so we get all out
of all this and come over to the view
option now again these menus or there's
something else but let's go into album
and pick out that picture now if we
click the select buttons or a few
options here if you had the original
Gameboy printer which unfortunately I do
not you can go ahead and print these out
on the really cool printer paper very
very cool stuff on the other hand you
can go to paint which will show you guys
in a second you can choose your
different frames so if I want you know a
Nintendo frame or any of these frames
like err I want Mario a theme that looks
great um there's also you can put a
comment on it delete it stamp or pain I
don't you guys show you the paint really
quickly here so the paint
it works is if I want to start drawing
doodling all over my photo just hold
down the a button start messing around
with the d-pad and as you can see
absolutely amazing work of art there and
I don't want to say that but anyway you
know I do not want to say I'm fine I'll
step out here um yes so do one exit
anyway let's back out of this so there
he goes as that's the camera itself
pretty cool but something else that
really was really really cool as I said
she had some some pretty cool games on
so if it the game game it'll go into
space fever now if I shoot either of
these in fact I will they actually
allows you to open up to different games
so I'll go back and just second but this
is really cool lunch to make chiptune so
again ok so that's kind of weird and
again the the designer thing was really
weird with this thing but what you to do
is let's say I want to crank up the
tempo turn up the volume some I think
you should go in here and choose the I
mean just all kinds of really cool stuff
I mean it I'm not even I don't I'm gonna
try to show you guys because that's a
little bit beyond me but very very cool
stuff I'll go ahead and jump out of here
and show you guys the space fever game
there's also one other game it's kind of
similar to the Game &amp;amp; Watch but we'll
ignore that the way it works is you just
ignore this first two and then you just
start as hard just playing for the
camera I'm gonna turn down a bit so
basically it's just a cool game I
believe this was an arcade on that
Hampton shirt whoa and I died
alright well guys that is about it for
the my review of the Game Boy camera a
very cool accessory I definitely really
really nice to have such as you can find
one in good condition of course you know
older stuff like this always tends to
get beat up and whatnot but I was really
lucky I was able to pick this up looks
pretty much brand new as any guys that's
about it for my review of the Game Boy
camera like I said really cool accessory
if you guys are interested in picking
them up they're not too expensive these
days but you can pick one up with the
Game Boy printer assuming the Game Boy
printer works will allow you to promote
your photos and all that kind of stuff a
really cool little accessory for the
original game boys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
