chicken a very fun casual game for the
iphone ipod touch and ipad the premise
behind the game is that you need to drop
a chicken down into a nest while
collecting as many bugs as possible in a
short time to do this you use a variety
of objects including fans springboards
balloons and more the gameplay is fun
and typically brief with each level
usually taking under a minute making
this perfect and true casual game style
for short play sessions when you have a
spare moment drop the chicken does a
good job of making you think as you
progress through the game it gets
progressively harder and harder with the
addition of bombs tricky drops and more
it's fairly open ended as well as you
have full freedom over mini objects to
determine how the chicken will drop and
bounce its way to victory the level of
Polish is impressive easily on par with
popular apps such as cut the rope and
angry birds menus are quick allowing you
to jump from level to level quickly game
center support isn't included yet
however it is coming soon you also will
find a rather robust set of options
including changing the graphics for
better battery life there's no doubt
that the art style really adds a nice
amount of charm to the game especially
on devices with a Retina display music
is also a hike one with the simple
catchy tune playing throughout your game
overall I'm quite impressed with drop
the chicken the developers have followed
the extremely successful model of many
other popular casual games well adding
even more polish and rock solid gameplay
to the mix the game is just hitting the
App Store worldwide as you watch this
review for 99 cents and a pre-release
copy was provided to me for free by the
developer if you're into casual games
then i recommend taking a look it
