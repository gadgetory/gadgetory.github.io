today I'm here with some really cool
news the Apple tablet has just been
announced literally just seconds ago so
I'm go ahead and give you guys a full
rundown on the iPad don't ask name but
yeah it is the iPad and I'm going to
give you guys the full specs pictures
the whole deal it just looks excellent
anyway let's get this one started okay
so I hope you guys don't mind I just
finished up so I'm here going through
some of the specs everything first of
all it has got a nine point seven inch
screen just like a lot of people thought
so it's about the same form factor one
major major thing is that as a lot of
people expected it does run run a
version of the iPhone OS although it is
very custom it looks kind of a lot like
the unlock screen you got slide to
unlock it's like it's like that big and
some stuff like that but it's not bad
and it looked it does look pretty good
likewise you've got the icons just like
on your iPod or iPhone and you know you
press them just like that except that
there's and there's only about a few
icons for a huge screen which it
actually looks pretty nice so let's go
ahead and run through some of the specs
as a lot of people speculated it does
run a custom PA semi chip it runs at 1
gigahertz which is really really fast in
the demo you can definitely see that the
Apple tab let me it was just fly I mean
it was really impressive going through
here it's got a solid-state drive
it's either 16 32 or 64 gigabytes which
is pretty much what we expected
now obviously the name is iPad sorry
guys and jump around a little bit here
but obviously the name is iPad remember
a lot to say about it personally I'm not
very fond of the name but there's so
much great about this tablet I don't
care if it was the I picture I don't I
mean it's really great ok so go through
here they demoed a lot of apps and it's
a really important thing probably the
main reason why they use the iPhone OS
was so that previous a normal apps that
you can run your iPhone or iPod Touch
will run on the iPad and they demoed it
and it looks really good basically they
showed a normal app can run on small
screen which I believe is probably about
320 by 480 a the same resolution is on
an iPod or iPhone and so it looks very
small on the screen but you can also
blow it up
and make it full screen too another
thing is that all apps in the app that
you right now will work on the iPad so
you don't have to wait for everyone to
update the apps they'll work right now
that said people can update apps make
sure that they work better so that you
will have your one like app that will
work on the iPad and iPhone perfectly or
the room will also most likely be apps
just for the iPad so now that opens a
lot of possibilities because obviously
the iPad is much much more powerful than
the iPhone they showed some apps they
showed need for speed they showed Nova
and the graphics were better but they
weren't amazingly better but as they
said there they only had about two weeks
to work on them so once we see an app
that's fully made for the iPad it's
going to be really impressive I'm sure
now speaking of apps that are only for
the iPad they announced a full suite of
I work for the iPad they went through a
lot all kinds of different ones nothing
all that exciting but it's still pretty
impressive and definitely something for
businesses and stuff where you can
actually have this and it will really
take the place of the laptop though
obviously it's going to be a little bit
different you can do word processor and
everything and speaking of word
processor one really cool thing is the
keyboard a lot of people were
speculating how to do it it's a nine
point seven inch tablet so you actually
can and you saw Steve job doing it you
can't actually type on just like a
keyboard which is just great so there's
a lot of things but basically there's
two big things
no that I the name it through the first
bit I was like the names iPad okay
that's not horrible it really does look
like a photoshopped iPhone I'm really
really serious as a nine point seven
inch and seriously it looks like they
just stretched it but the main thing
though is the price and the 3G yes it
does have 3G and the 3G is excellent it
does run HNT so I know a lot of you guys
but there's the prices are just
ridiculous so on a 3G iPad you can get
on a CT you can get 250 megabytes for
$15 a month now obviously if you know
about price plans and stuff like that
generally that will run me forty to
fifty dollars in other places so 15 is
really good that said 250 megabytes will
go very fast I mean that's you know
that's a couple videos and I mean you
know it would not be a big deal for you
to go through that in one day so the
main plan is an unlimited and that is
only $30 a month which is just unheard
of I don't even know most most wireless
broadband they don't even offer
unlimited and they do it's going to be
just just a huge sum so for $30 that is
just excellent and it gets better
this is offered with no contract
whatsoever that is just unbelievable so
you get an iPad with 3G and then if you
say okay you know what I'm going on a
trip or I think I need the 3G this month
call up AT&amp;amp;T get hooked up give me
basically $30 and you will have
unlimited 3G for the whole month you're
not sitting you can do that and you can
just have it paid every month or you can
just do it as you like there's no
contract and the iPad is unlocked as
well so obviously these deals are
fantastic on AT&amp;amp;T but if you like you
can go to other other carriers which is
just and that was that was a huge shock
but the best shock of all and guys
honestly it is just the price now
there's going to be six models of the
iPad okay they're going to be divided up
into the sizes so one's going to be 16
gigabyte a 32 gigabyte and a signal to 4
gigabyte and then those three models
were going to be divided in two with
Wi-Fi it's Wi-Fi N or with Wi-Fi and 3G
okay so with Wi-Fi and 3G will cost you
600 $29 for 16 a debate for Wi-Fi and 3G
with a 32 gigabyte it will be another
107 29 and with 64 gigabytes there will
be 829 829 is the absolute most
expensive you can pay for this but it
gets better if you cut out the 3G
altogether you want to just get the
cheapest iPad you can get you can get
with Wi-Fi
sixteen gigabytes of storage for $499
that's insane
everyone me included figured seven to
eight hundred dollars in the back you
can get a iPad and you know obviously
it's one guy sixteen gigabytes and no 3G
but still I mean it's got everything
else so that only $500 that's just
insane and the same way was a 3G to
another hundred dollars for 32 gigabyte
so beat $5.99 and another 100 for 64
which is $6.99 so that is just just
excellent I really think the iPad if I
was like that's not bad
then they showed then they show the 3G
everybody Wow and make sure the prices
honestly guys this thing is going to be
huge I mean I I'm just so surprised um
yeah that's just about it there was a
few other things like battery life which
looks to be really quite good it they
say ten hours might not be it probably
won't be ten hours but it's still going
to be really quite good for that but you
guys that's just about it that I had at
you Santa named iPad is looking just
amazing uh for $499 something that Rico
does ebooks does iTunes full touch
screen nine point seven inches I mean is
it's just it's just unreal I mean then
this is going to be huge and I honestly
just excited just beyond belief it looks
excellent
so guys definitely stay tuned I will be
having a lot more videos on more in
depth than me they did a lot more about
the apps and all kinds of stuff so stay
tuned I will be covering it a ton more
as well as an overview and all kinds of
stuff but as a first look man guys the
iPad looks excellent anyway thanks for
