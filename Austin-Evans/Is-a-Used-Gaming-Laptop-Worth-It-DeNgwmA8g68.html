of budget gaming laptops on the channel
but today I have something a little bit
different in mind so this is a 2014
Alienware 13 and back when it came out
it cost well over $1000 today though I
was able to pick it up on eBay for only
500 and ignoring a little bit of
cosmetic damage what you're getting here
is the surprisingly decent gaming laptop
on the other hand we have this the Acer
Aspire 5 now I am a huge fan of this
laptop I've already done a whole video
on it and the gist of it is for $600
you're getting a quad-core processor
nvidia graphics 8 gigs of ram as well as
a full SSD but does it make sense to
save your hundred dollars and get a used
option one look at the Alienware and
you'll be able to tell this used to be
$1,000 plus laptop now it does have some
minor scuffs and scrapes on the outside
but importantly on the inside it's going
to be clean and it's got all the good
stuff including a 13.3 inch 1080p panel
that looks surprisingly decent
impressively this actually even has a
windows precision touchpad something
that a lot of even modern computers are
barely starting to adopt now for the
most part it's solid I don't think it's
all that thick or heavy however you are
going to be making a couple of
compromises when you buy a used system
it's only like the Acer well you're not
going to have to deal with it the idea
of having a brand new laptop is
definitely a big advantage but there
also are some disadvantages to having
something a little bit on the cheaper
end so even though Acer was able to cram
a ton of high-end specs into this guy
it's sort of at the cost of some build
quality and some design things so for
example it's very plasticky there's some
like screenflex and on the right side
instead of having USB 3.0 ports you have
a pair of USB 2.0 ports and sure there's
still going to be USB C and USB 3 on the
other side but there's just little kind
of cost-cutting measures here and there
that do start to add up but the
important thing to keep in mind is this
is a brand new laptop that comes with a
full warranty if it comes broken you can
return it
whereas with something like the
Alienware you're going to kind of be on
your own if something goes wrong on the
Acer we're also getting a 1080p panel
this time at 15.6 inches however it is a
lower NT and display and honestly it's
actually my biggest issue with the
laptop I can live with pretty much all
the rest of the stuff like slightly
flimsy build quality but the screen is
barely acceptable it would really be
nice if they had an upgrade and actually
makes the Alienware display looks pretty
nice
Pearson now the keyboard is going to be
fine you get a full number row as well
as a number pad as well as you're going
to be getting backlighting and it
technically does have a windows
precision trackpad
but the touchpad itself isn't so great
what you're really buying this laptop
for are the really impressive specs at
the $600 price point with the Alienware
now are you going to be getting three
USB 3.0 ports as well as Ethernet
there's also going to be HDMI mini
DisplayPort as well as the Alienware
graphics amplifier ports now this is
something that's actually even found on
current Alienware laptops and you can
think of it as an old-school version of
Thunderbolt 3 so back before is it easy
to be able to put an external GPU and
connect it to a laptop instead Illinois
made their own graphics amplifier which
you actually can still find on eBay for
around a hundred bucks or so you know I
don't know if I would necessarily want
to do it with this particular Alienware
13 but if you ever want to upgrade with
some graphics options even an older
laptop like this does have the ability
to do so now we need time you buy
something used the price is going to be
a huge factor so four or five hundred
dollars we were able to pick up not only
the Alienware 13 but it also came with
some key upgrades including 16 gigs of
ram as well as a 500 gigabyte Samsung
850 Evo SSD inside you'll find a dual
core i5 4210 u so this is a Haswell chip
from a couple generations ago you can
essentially think of it as an ultrabook
CPU not exactly what you want to find in
your gaming laptop whoever thankfully it
is going to be backed up by some pretty
decent graphics the nvidia geforce gtx
860m well it won't make a big difference
for gaming that 16 gigs of ram and SSD
does make a big difference from normal
day-to-day use but when it comes to
actual gameplay on this guy while the
cpu is going to be a little bit of a
bottleneck the GPU should be capable of
some pretty decent modern games put the
two side-by-side and Geekbench and
you'll see that they new eighth
generation Core i5 in the Acer Aspire 5
absolutely runs of rings around the
Alienware
however jump over to the GPU side of
things and it's actually surprisingly
even so not only in the times pi
benchmark but as well as in fire strike
you're going to be getting very very
similar performance first up we have
csgo and here we're running at high at
1080p now we're getting a pretty decent
60 to 80 frames per second here and this
is one of the easy ways to be able to
tell that you're not supposed to walk
around the corner Cisco's actually a
pretty good game to test though because
while we
have that solid GPU we're going to be
missing a little bit on the CPU side now
csgo even though it's easy to run at
fairly low frames especially when you
get up and they like the ATS hundred 150
whatever the case is it actually is
really helpful to have that solid CPU
but so far it's actually not too bad
move over to the aspire 5 and on those
same settings at 1080p medium we are
getting a noticeable bump in framerate
so right now actually averaging about a
hundred which is pretty impressive and I
think something else is kind of nice is
that the Wi-Fi chip in this laptop
actually seems to be a little bit more
robust so especially because we're kind
of a little bit farther from the normal
point it actually does smooth out some
of the latency as well next up because
it is 2018 after all we have fortnight
battle royale so again here at 1080p
this time I'm medium settings we're
getting decent frame rates in the 40s to
upper 30s now it's not going to be the
most smooth playable experience in the
world but if you do want a little bit
more framerate it's easy to knock down
the graphics a little bit or even bump
the resolution back down to something
like 720p I'm surprised that I hadn't
really noticed a lot of CPU limitation
yet now I'm sure if this did have a
quad-core CPU or even a faster dual-core
chip we're probably getting slightly
higher frame rates but it's actually not
a crazy pairing with this 860m it does
seem to be reasonably balanced although
I'd like a little more power of course
if you guys want to know more about
Fortnight I actually did do an entire
video on it and how it can run on pretty
much everything from a super high-end
gaming PC all the way down to a 200 all
a laptop well if you've really try hard
at least well the nice things about
Fortnight is that it does actually look
nice almost regardless of what setting
you're running on I mean come on you can
run it on your phone it doesn't look
that bad but here 1080p medium settings
on the PC we're getting a pretty nice
looking experience move over to the Acer
and with those same settings and for
tonight yet again we are seeing a slight
performance improvement so as opposed to
being in the high 30s and low 40s or
mostly in the upper 40s here not a
massive change but it is something
you're going to be able to notice if I
don't fall off this close next up we
have pub G a game that is not
particularly nice to lower end hardware
I think this is actually spot we're
going to see the dual-core CPU struggle
here well that's not encouraging it's
able to play the game I mean we're
seeing some of the neighborhood of 25
frames per second now but the stuttering
is really bad
it's weird I feel like this game should
be
playable but right now I mean this is a
stuttering mess technically it's running
and I mean again my framerate it's not
too bad showing like 35 36 right now but
there's something very very wrong here
yeah even reloading the game on very low
settings restarting everything we're
still getting that same stuttering issue
technically this actually is slightly
below the minimum spec for pub G so I
guess it can't be too upset but come
over to the Acer and we have no such
problems so I did turn into graphics
down to 720p on low but we're getting a
pretty consistent 45 to 50 frames per
second and thankfully none of those
weird stuttering issues this is much
much more like it
it's kinda disappointing really so I
like the Alienware it's a good laptop
but at the end of the day you're
probably gonna want to play games like
pub G and well sure the GPU is not too
bad I do feel like that CPU does let it
down don't get me wrong I really didn't
want to like the Alienware 13 but with
options like the aspire 5 at $600 it
makes it very very difficult to
recommend most gaming laptops that are
going to be used now this guy isn't too
far off with a lack of a higher-end CPU
really does hurt it's going new is
always going to be a safer bet so not
only do you get that brand new chassis
but you get the warranty you don't have
to worry about any kind of weird
blemishes on your used laptop it's going
to be a safer bet but if you do go used
my main piece of advice would be be very
careful what you pick so the idea of
going something that's going to be
slightly newer versus slightly older
especially in laptop terms can mean a
huge performance difference pick your
choice wisely at minimum I would go with
a quad-core processor and don't skimp on
the graphics either
similarly the 860m inside the Alienware
isn't going to be too bad but a lot of
times with gaming laptops you can spend
a little bit more money to get a lot
more performance so I'm curious would
you let you ever want to pick up a used
gaming laptop let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
