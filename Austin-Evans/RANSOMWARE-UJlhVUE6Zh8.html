something that you never want to see so
you probably heard of ransomware it is
absolutely everywhere right now and one
of the biggest attacks was actually on a
hospital system in the UK where hundreds
of computers were not only made
basically useless but more importantly
there were tons of documents on patients
information test results and they were
all essentially lost this is not an
isolated incident it is happening
worldwide and not only is it affecting
normal people's computers but it's also
attacking things like banks and gas
stations pretty much anything that they
can get its hands on but what is
ransomware so this actually isn't a new
thing the viruses of course have been
around for pretty much as long as
computers have been but ransomware is a
slightly different take on it generally
malware isn't this malicious so sure if
you get a virus you might have pop ups
or your computer might be a part of a
botnet but what ransomware does is it
literally hold your files ransom until
you pay and even if you pay there's no
guarantee that you'll actually get any
of your information back once infected
the ransomware will start looking
through all of your files so we'll find
things like pictures video music
documents pretty much anything you can
get its hands on and start encrypting it
and once these files are encrypted and
it doesn't take long they're basically
totally useless to you unless you have
the key which they just so happen to
have and will offer to unlock for you
for a very reasonable fee generally
speaking once you have actually had your
files encrypted there's really nothing
you can do about it rinse and we were
like this has been around for a few
years now what's different is that
there's a new much more dangerous
version of it around want to cry
originally this was an exploit found by
the NSA called eternal blue where they
presumably used it for super secret spy
stuff however one of their servers was
actually leaked and lots of their tools
were available publicly including this
one where bad things started happening
paternal blue is an exploit in windows
networking that is especially dangerous
because you don't need to be doing
anything wrong to be affected so you
take that and you combine it with
ransomware and you have a very dangerous
combination the good news is that
Microsoft has already released a patch
to deal with this exploit but to show
you how big of a deal this is they even
released an emergency patch for Windows
XP which came out in 2001 if your
computer is fully up to date you are
safe from want to cry
but of course third loss and lots and
lots of computers that are not fully up
to date so some countries have huge
percentages of peace
running pirated Windows that might not
be getting updates there are plenty of
companies that can't just immediately
update 300,000 pcs with a new patch and
of course some people just don't get
around to updating their computer very
often to demonstrate what happens if you
are infecting over we're going to
purposely put want to cry on this
computer now the main thing I want to
see is first of all can you do anything
about it
spoiler alert no but also I just want to
see what the process is if you actually
aren't affected so I have a few files on
this computer right now so for example I
have a WordPad document I have an image
but keep in mind one a cry will go after
pretty much anything that it's on your
PC so you can imagine if this is my
personal computer with all of my
documents all my everything it will
pretty much attack whatever it can get
its hands on so what I'm going to be
doing is actually manually triggering
want to cry
generally if this is you and you were
infected in the wild you wouldn't really
have to do anything it would just show
up on your computer attack all your
files and you wouldn't even know
anything was going on in the background
but let's find out what happens when you
were attacked by wanna cry all right
let's give this a try oh wow yep that's
doing stuff at the mêlée doing stuff so
you see task manager heating up CPU
stuff is all over the desktop I see the
original files we also see the encrypted
versions interesting so if this happens
to you you immediately turn your
computer off but you can see it's
writing a ton of stuff to the disk right
now getting up a favorite of CPU and of
course your desktop is just littered
with all the crap oh it did it all right
what is it safe if you need your files
you have to run the decrypt software run
and follow the instructions
hmm do we want to do it well yes yes we
do let's see what happens
there we go what happened to my computer
your important files are encrypted many
of your documents photos videos and
databases are no longer accessible
because they've been encrypted I love it
can I recover my files sure we guarantee
that you recover all your files safely
and easily but you do not have enough
time so if I send them $300 worth of
Bitcoin it will call back to home and
say hey you did it
well decrypt all your files that's all
totally fine except who knows as they
actually want to do that that was quick
now of course there weren't a ton of
files on this computer but you can see
I've gotta try to open up maybe like the
file or anything it just brings it it's
like a dot win cry file ok so if I try
to open it up yeah it's all complete
garbage
so it's encrypted there's no way I'm
doing anything with that thankfully this
version of want to cry is mostly been
taken care of at this point but there's
always going to be another big exploit
that will come out of nowhere so please
keep your computers up-to-date keep your
phones tablets toasters whatever the
case is keep it up-to-date anyway let me
know what you guys think about wanna cry
and all this crazies in the comments
below and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
