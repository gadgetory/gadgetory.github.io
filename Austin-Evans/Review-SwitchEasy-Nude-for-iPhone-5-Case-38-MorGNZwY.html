here with a review of the switch ez nude
for the iPhone 5 pop open the box and
inside you'll find the case with quite a
few accessories inside the dummy iPhone
are a pair of covers for your lightning
port and headphone jack to screen
shields for the front of the iPhone 5
and one shield for the rear and a
squeegee for applying the screen
protector along with a microfiber cloth
dropping your iPhone into the case is
simple just press it in from the side
until it snaps the nude as you may have
guessed from the name is a super slim
one millimeter thick case for adding as
little bulk as possible
there's no lay on the table design
although the include screen protectors
should help while it's great that the
case is so thin it's also an F
particularly durable feeling which isn't
a huge surprise this is more for scratch
protection than drops around back you'll
see plenty of clearance for the camera
and flash and on bottom you'll see the
exposed speaker and ports which can be
protected if you want by the covers
you'll still have access to the
microphone and speaker but nothing else
along the right side is nothing but a
small switch ez logo and up top you'll
see the covered sleep/wake button it's
not the easiest thing in the world to
hit but it is raised up a bit and has a
decent amount of feedback the left side
is where you ran into problems the mute
switch has plenty of space to get at but
the volume buttons are poorly designed
on the case I have here the top button
works fine but the bottom volume key has
zero feedback it works fine generally
but it's annoying with each button
feeling entirely different with few
iPhone 5 cases out right now you don't
have a ton of choice especially if
you're like me in like minimalist cases
as always switch ez includes great
accessories but the poorly working
volume buttons are enough to make me
think twice about recommending this some
people have reported 0 issues with other
colors of the case I can only review
what I have in front of me and I feel
you can do better than the switch ez
nude if you found this review helpful be
