useful video full of consumer advice
about hey guys Lawson and today I have
the brand new Nvidia shield so you may
remember this this is the original
Nvidia shield unless you really liked it
however there's a new version that's
just come out but the big question is is
a 200 all gaming console worth it what's
interesting is the shield actually
shares a lot of common DNA with the
brand new Nintendo switch so honestly
this is probably going to be a more
powerful option not only does it support
both 4k and HDR but as you'll see the
new sun version also adds two new
features so this guy is running android
TV now that's actually probably my
favorite sort of Smart TV interface that
I've tried not only is it fairly snappy
and easy to get around but it also is
fairly powerful you can do things like
actually multitasking as you watch video
and there's some new things with the new
nougat version which this is preloaded
with also that is really small are you
serious I mean I don't think anyone
thought the original shield was all that
large the fifth thing is absolutely tiny
Wow are we expecting that I mean in
pictures it looks almost exact same but
we actually put them side-by-side
there's a huge huge difference I guess
it makes sense so there is another
version of this actually can come with a
500 gigabyte hard drive and I assume
that that's probably going to be a
little bit bigger than this but right
now we'll talk about something that's
not that much bigger than a normal
streaming box like an Apple TV
you're really not losing much because of
the small size either so we still have
two USB 3.0 port Ethernet HDMI the
biggest loss is the lack of a micro SD
card slot but honestly with the shield I
prefer to just plug in a USB Drive for
extra storage anyway something that
wasn't included in the original shield
is the actual remote so this was
something like $50 on the previous
version however it's really nice to have
this actually included as much as this
is a gaming device because a lot of
people myself included probably end up
spend more time watching Netflix so
having a dedicated remote at night there
also is a brand new controller and this
is an interesting looking controller
would I get going for the sort of
faceted look but it's such a weird
choice to not smooth out the grip I mean
it actually doesn't feel bad I really
wasn't a big fan
of the previous shield controller so I
do think this is an improvement and I
guess once you kind of get it settled in
your hands you or I don't notice but
that's such a unique call to do that I
know I don't hate it it's definitely
unique at $200 the Nvidia shield is an
interesting value proposition so for
this kind of price you can pick up a
used Xbox 360 or ps3 and a ton of
terrific games and on the flip side of
things I use Xbox one or ps4 is not
going to be that much more expensive
meant to be for you to have that 4k HDR
support honestly especially on the media
side
I think Android TV pretty much beats all
of the consoles and it does have some
fairly decent gaming chops with games
that run natively games are specifically
made for shield as well as things like
GeForce now as well as streaming from
your personal PC but the real question
is how does all that stuff actually come
together so the older shield can do or
is place in party game
more specifically jackbox Oh No is your
guest here I am I think I know at all I
do not think I had that oh thank gosh
being in the video really Christine Kurt
of the Nvidia shield is the ultimate
party game device inside the shield is
using the Tegra x1 processor from its
predecessor all that might not seem like
an upgrade because it really isn't most
importantly not only is this more
powerful than any other streaming box
out there but it still got a lot more
horsepower than suddenly I can Xbox 360
or ps3 so one of the things that you can
find on the shield is portal and knows
this is not some dumbed-down mobile
version this is a full port of the
proper PC portal experience when you
think about it the shield really is
about as powerful as a lot of game pcs
who are out at the time of portals
release so sure you're not getting the
full 4k ultra setup with mouse and
keyboard and all the kind of fun toys
but to be honest you're really not
losing a lot either it's pretty much the
full experience especially if you've
never played portal before definitely
worth a look
I make it I make it can I make it oh
yeah I can make it there are also more
traditional Android games such as Real
Racing 3 now on the surface yes this is
basically the same game that you can
play on your phone however once you
actually get it up on a big-screen TV
and you have this controller it really
does kind of change the experience and
speaking of this controller it's good so
you know at first I was a little unsure
but after playing with it for a few
minutes it immediately jumps out to me
as maybe not quite on par with something
like the Xbox one which is definitely my
sort of favorite controller out it's
really not far off the sticks are nicely
weighted the grips are nice even the
sort of hexagon shape doesn't really
bother me
there's also Resident Evil 5 for the
shield and as you can see it's a it's
fun it's really easy to play and I'm not
dying a lot right now um this is a
direct port of the Xbox 360 and the ps3
version of the game and what might not
be the most technically advanced game in
2017 it's decent if you have any ammo
which I currently don't in addition to
the native titles for the shield you can
also stream full PC games using GeForce
now this is very much is relying on your
internet connection but if you have a
decent one it can be a good way of
adding a lot of titles to the shield
well it might be a little bit of an
older game the Tomb Raider reboot is
still a lot of fun and considering that
we're running at 1080p ultimate settings
here on a PC it does not look bad at all
so I think one of the things that
especially in the early days of game
streaming was a little bit sketchy was
the latency but it's actually not bad I
would want to play Call of Duty or
battlefield on it or something it's a
little bit more casual it's completely
usable so there are plenty of GeForce
now games you can pick from including no
man skies if you really want to play
them in sky on your Nvidia shield that's
totally an option but there's a few
different ways of doing it whether you
can actually subscribe and get a few
free games or actually just purchase
them it might not be the greatest way of
playing games in the world however if
you have a desktop PC with a modern
NVIDIA GPU you can actually stream it
over your local network so games that
you already have owned and you play on
your gaming PC you can use the shield to
play on your TV in addition to gaming
the shield makes a solid media box so on
top of that 4k and HDR support you have
all the staples like YouTube and Netflix
and Amazon but on top of that the
multitasking is solid so I can be
playing a game jump right back out to
menu and you have additional things such
as
we'll assistant which is pretty much
only found on the Google pixel right now
there's a lot of cool stuff with the
shield for $200 while the shield might
not be the best upgrade if you have the
previous generation it's still one of my
favorite ways to streaming 4k video on
the gaming set of things that game
stream really does make it useful if you
do have a pc compatibl if not well a lot
of the games were interesting it's not
quite compelling enough to make it worth
it for me you'd probably be better off
to picking up a console but definitely
be sure to let me know what you guys
think in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
