of the Gameboy Advance SP every Gameboy
Advance SP was a marginal upgrade from
the original Game Boy Advance of course
they do play the same games they support
all the same sorts of things
the main difference however was that the
Gameboy fans SP had a lot of key
improvements namely the fact that it did
have a flip-out screen with protected
controls it also did have well it was
fairly the files not parallel it was
quite a bit smaller as you can see here
but also did have two other major things
namely the fact that it did have a
backlit screen which was a huge huge
help in addition to the fact that does
take rechargeable batteries so all is
really conspired to make the Gameboy
Advance SP a really really great console
so I'm going to break down exactly why
as you can see here the Gameboy Advance
SP with a definite departure from
previous Gameboy design you know with
the folding clamshell design the backlit
screen with all the different and
provements that they made in fact very
similar to what they did with the
Nintendo DS I'm indeed the 3ds as well
you know it's they had very similar
designs although of course the DS wasn't
identical but you can definitely see the
similarities so I'd like to give you
guys a little walkthrough of the SP here
um pop not a whole lot um made have that
same sort of Gameboy plastic G your mind
scratched up just a little bit but
certainly played this thing like
everyday for like three or four years I
kind of expect that um over here you do
have two indicator lights for when it's
on with it for once for the battery so
it will either be green or orange
depending on how the battery is and then
the other one will just go ahead and
show you if the battery is charging or
not over here we do have the on/off
switch
now over here we go ahead and pull out
the Game Boy game now this is where you
go ahead and insert the game cards that
support Game Boy Advance games as well
as Game Boy and Game Boy Color games
although the older games do protrude out
a little bit but not a big deal I'm
coming around here you'll see there's a
volume slider again there's a first for
a Game Boy however one thing you'll
definitely notice is missing is a 3.5
millimeter audio jack so no way to plug
in headphones to the Game Boy Advance SP
which was one of the only real downsides
to the
in Seoul I'm coming round on the back
you'll see you should go ahead just flip
it over this way you'll see that very
small election Ellen our triggers uh
they weren't the greatest but most
gameboy games weren't really relying on
it so it wasn't the biggest deal you
have a couple of places for accessories
to mount and when put a peg over here
you'll see that this is the where you
plug in the charger and this is where
you go ahead and plug in the link cable
not a whole lot on the back you know you
should go ahead this is where the
rechargeable battery is that's pretty
simple you just need to go ahead and
undo one screw to get it let's go ahead
and open it up you'll see here it's got
a nice size screen definitely a very
nice sized screen this is very very good
and in fact I'll go ahead and lie that
for you you can see here the backlight
go ahead and turn it on and off it does
work fairly well um go ahead and down
here we do have a light that does enable
and disable the backlight and in newer
versions of the SP now there's really no
easy way to tell immediately I'm I do
have one of the older versions but this
would actually go ahead and go through
different mode selectors as far as on
the screen unless we do have the
directional d-pad the a and B buttons
these start and select and finally the
speaker as you can call the Game Boy
Advance SP was more of an evolution than
a revolution now of course it did bring
a lot of really important enhancements
namely that screen the really nice
folding design as you can see here it's
a bit chunky by today's standards but
does fit nicely in your hand
easily you know fits in a pocket no
problem however the rechargeable battery
the folding design and the banquet
screen really were the hallmarks of why
you want to buy a Game Boy Advance SP
over the original Game Boy Advance
everything else like I've said still
applies although you do lose out on that
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
but at for Game Boy games there's very
rarely you know the music not really
going to be good enough that you're
gonna want to listen to on headphones
however you know it was kind of a bit
annoying that they removed it so there
you go guys that's about it there's not
a whole lot to say about the Game Boy
Advance SP that hasn't already been said
personally it remains to be one of my
favourite consoles ever I play this
thing to death it's just such a great
console the game will advance in general
has so many great great games
you know it just was really really great
to be able to play in the dark you don't
have to worry about buying you know two
three four sets of rechargeable
batteries a week you know if you really
want to start playing through a game you
know there's so many great things about
the Gameboy Advance SP that I have no
problems whatsoever in recommending this
to you as probably the best way to play
any game boy game ever made now there's
not a whole lot to look out for on these
uh you can go ahead obviously for the
standard you know wear and tear this
one's not perfect but now I've used it a
lot one thing you do want to pay pay
attention to is the rechargeable battery
see how long it lasts now I will say
that the rechargeable batteries were
pretty robust on these I've used this
one like I said I got this one back in
2003 and I'm still on the original
battery of course it doesn't last all
that long maybe about 45 minutes per
charge still that's very impressive
considering the hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of hours I've logged on
this so you can't go ahead and pick up a
replacement batteries they aren't too
hard to find and they're not all that
expensive but definitely do keep that in
mind if you're going to go ahead and
pick one of these up otherwise there's
not a whole lot to worry about the
Gameboy Advance SP is a very very solid
console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
