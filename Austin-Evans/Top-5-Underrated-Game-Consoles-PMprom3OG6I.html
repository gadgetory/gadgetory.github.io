a lot of great consoles over the years
but here are my top 5 most underrated
kicking things off we have the Nintendo
GameCube from 2001 as the 4th home
console from Nintendo the Gamecube had
some big shoes to fill
it had fairly powerful hardware so much
so when it came time to make the Wii
Nintendo largely just reused the specs
of the Gamecube it had a solid lineup of
games as well including the always great
first party Nintendo titles like Luigi's
Mansion on the fair few third-party
games this is important as one of the
major problems with the Wii and Wii U
was a lack of major games like Call of
Duty leading a lot of people to go buy
an Xbox or Playstation it also shipped
with a fairly controversial controller
that's aged fairly well so much so that
when Nintendo launched smash 4 on the
Wii U they started selling the 13 year
old GameCube controllers again as the
first Nintendo console to drop
cartridges the game keep uses mini DVDs
which are a lot smaller than a
traditional disc but only had one point
5 gigabytes of capacity compared to up
to 8.5 gigs on the Xbox and ps2 and it
was ultimately the ps2 that hurt at the
most
so like a massive 155 million consoles
compared to just 22 million for the
Gamecube still though it holds up is one
of the most underrated consoles ever
coming in at number four we have the
Sega Saturn from 1994 Sega was all over
the place in the 90s the Genesis put up
a serious fight against the Super
Nintendo but then they released a series
of weird add-ons before moving on with
the Sega Saturn even though the Saturn
was the worst selling Sega console it
actually had a lot going for it it
featured a design it was ahead of its
time with dual CPUs ten years before
this became the norm on consoles which
was a big deal it gave the Saturn the
power to play games straight from the
arcade like Daytona USA in Virtua
Fighter the dual CPUs gave it a lot of
theoretical power compared to the
PlayStation 1 but it was incredibly
difficult for developers to take
advantage of unfortunately things went
wrong almost immediately Sega did a
surprise launch four months early
without letting some stores know
prompting them to drop the Saturn or
indeed Sega altogether oops
couple this with the lack of big-name
titles like Sonic and Sony's new console
outsold the Saturn by a massive 10 to 1
ratio the Saturn was a great console but
things just didn't work out for Sega
this time next at number three we have
the Sony PlayStation Vita from 2011
Nintendo just launched the 3ds the
follow-up to the massively successful DS
sunny was coming off the PSP the first
handheld to really challenge Denton doe
ever it's rocking a big high-resolution
5-inch touchscreen with some of the best
physical controls ever put on a portable
and even cool features like a rear
touchpad there's just one problem a
little thing called smart phones came
along with most people already having a
decent gaming device in their pockets
portable consoles have hit some serious
issues the 3ds has handled their
transition reasonably well thanks to its
library of excellent first party titles
like Mario Pokemon and Zelda but the
Vita hasn't been so fortunate it has
some decent games especially Japanese
titles but in North America the big
games like minecraft or nearly all
available in other platforms it still
has some life in it but Sony's been
focused on things like ps4 remote play
and PlayStation now instead of pushing
major titles to the Vita it's a shame
because the Vita really was awesome but
it was the wrong console at the wrong
time at number two we have the Nintendo
Wii U from 2012 the Wii U yeah like the
Saturn Nintendo had just come off the
enormous ly successful Wii and
immediately into big problems the big
draw of the Wii U is the tablet like
gamepad which is legitimately cool but
most people thought it was an accessory
for the original Wii rather than an
all-new console to add insult to injury
where the wheat was priced significantly
lower than the Xbox and PlayStation the
Wii U was only slightly cheaper than the
technically superior Xbox one and ps4
mostly due to the expensive gamepad
that's included with every Wii U like
the Wii it's been hamstrung by a lack of
third-party support making the Wii U
almost entirely reliant on first party
Nintendo games thankfully there have
been quite a few terrific titles such as
smash 4 and splatoon with an install
base of less than 10 million consoles
it's behind both the Xbox one and ps4
even with an extra year head start
Nintendo has already started talking
about the next console the NX which we
should find out more about next year the
Wii U is shaping up to have one of the
shortest and most disastrous console
runs ever which is a shame because it
really is a good console unfortunately
that's just not enough coming in at the
number one spot is the infamous sega
dreamcast from 1998 the dreamcast had so
much potential say you learn from the
overly complicated saturn and designed
to clean easy to work with console that
had a big head start on the other
consoles of its generation it brought a
lot of first as well including a
built-in modem for
online play years before it became
popular with the vmu it brought an early
second screen experience way before the
Wii U the devil does a memory card for
the system and some games were powered
by Windows three years before Microsoft
launched the Xbox it even had several
big games like Crazy Taxi and Sonic
Adventure which were a big step up
graphically than anything available at
the time the drink has had a big
successful launch but surprise surprise
Sony pulled the rug out from under Sega
with the hugely popular PlayStation 2
the already weak Sega crumbled in less
than two years after they launched the
Dreamcast in the u.s. Sega entirely
pulled out of the console business and
the rest is history
