and I'm going to find out if it's any
good
I recently did a video on back-to-school
laptops and while there's some pretty
solid cheap options some of you guys
wanted to see me go even farther which
is where the RCA cambio comes in $120
this is the cheapest brand new laptop
tablet thing I could find so take a look
at the box it actually doesn't look too
bad so we have an 11.6 inch screen 2
gigabytes of memory as well as 32 gigs
of storage it does come pre-loaded with
Windows 10 I like on the box that shows
it has four different modes laptop mode
display mode tablet mode and
presentation mode but it's a two-in-one
not a foreign one cardboard quality it's
gonna be a fun video I have a good
feeling about this one
so why actually you know what it's
really heavy that's actually not too bad
this might be the cheapest plastic I
have ever seen so it has somewhat large
bezels but it actually is for good
reason because of that they're able to
fit what looks to be a full size
keyboard although the trackpad is a
maybe just a little bit small purports
this guy has a mini HDMI a micro USB
port headphone jack power button a full
sized USB as well as a tiny windows even
though we'll be plastic and the build is
definitely cheap on this guy it actually
doesn't feel too bad in a hand the
weights about right it's nicely balanced
and there's sending a lot of flex I mean
sure I wouldn't want to pay $300 for it
but if you can get past the actual build
it's not that this guy actually doesn't
have the worst specs in the world so
it's powered by a quad-core Intel Atom
processor 2 gigabytes of memory 32 gigs
of storage and Ivan 11.6 inch display
like this unit or most of the can
dealers I've seen have a 10.1 inch
screen so what exactly can you do with a
$120 laptop well normally I would try to
do a few standard things I do with all
laptops however mr. Jimmy champagne has
some other thoughts in mind you have a
list of demand yeah but not for me okay
but from the god shut up just on the god
as a photo let your focus yeah yeah
let's just focus on on Kent back so yes
it can edit photos shots from the guy
play one game a csgo this is a
revolutionary gaming experience I feel
like after everyone plays to go with
this for the first time they'll never be
able to go back from the gods play
minecraft competition
alright so can I actually say that with
Minecraft this is actually kind of
playable I mean yes I have to turn the
graphics settings down and lower the
chunks but it's actually not that bad of
course the biggest problem is this
trackpad has no left and right click
dedicate option so I just have to like
tap to click which is not great shut up
just from the god
watch 1 HD video Wow Mellie does this
work we actually play 1440p YouTube okay
alright I mean it's a 720p screen so
challenges from the god drop us in touch
screen and MSP as for the press this was
Ken a kid she had to curious the Ken is
super cool and you wear his hat slightly
sideways and then we've got a big brown
because ken is never happy he doesn't
believe in me there you go
successfully painted within a paint a
very true live picture of mr. ken delito
many many tests long arduous tests then
other gods please your head is tired of
the frame right now so may test later
are the gods pleased with the power and
performance of the RCA cambree oh
actually you got it all but one it was
csgo that we couldn't do right yeah that
yeah I mean and you were able to play
csgo so 15 frames per second with the
trackpad is exactly the way that
everyone should play csgo so should you
buy the RCA $120 Windows laptop tablet
dang it actually isn't that bad no it's
not be gracing the world and if you can
afford spend another $100 you're gonna
get something that's a lot better but
it's better than I expected so what do
you guys think about this guy
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
