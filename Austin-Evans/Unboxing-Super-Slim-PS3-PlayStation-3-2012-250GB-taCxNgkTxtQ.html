here with an unboxing of the new super
slim PlayStation 3 with a major redesign
and two new bundles to choose from let's
take a look at what you get as always
you'll find a seal keeping us out of the
box but a small incision will make quick
work of it pop open the top and you'll
see box ception inside is nearly
identical box without the Uncharted
branding I imagine this is what you'll
be able to pick up when you're able to
get the super slim ps3 without a bundle
so let's start again
cut the tape on this box and pop it open
to finally get at the good stuff
included is your standard PlayStation 3
controller mini USB cable to charge it
power cable for the ps3 which thankfully
still isn't an external AC adapter and a
standard video cable no HDMI
unfortunately keep going and you'll see
an incredibly helpful diagram on how to
transfer data from your old ps3 included
with this bundle as a DLC code for dust
five one four and 30-day free membership
to PlayStation Plus you'll also find the
full blu-ray for Uncharted three Quick
Start Guide safety guide and a pamphlet
on video game ratings exciting huh the
PlayStation itself comes in a giant egg
carton I mean protective packaging pull
off the sides and the foam wrapping and
finally we have success taking a look at
the ps3 you'll quickly see it's much
smaller than even the slum PlayStation 3
the biggest difference is up top where
you'll find the optical drive is moved
press the eject button and the
spring-loaded top panel slides back it
works fine but feels a bit cheap and
plasticky and the overlapping parts on
the top don't look amazing
the rest of the system is similar to the
ps3 slung up front or a pair of USB
ports and around back is Ethernet HDMI
optical audio AV out and the power
connector you'll also find Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth built in the console will
stand on its own but it's not too stable
so it's still a good idea to buy a stand
for it
one thing you'll quickly notice is that
the new ps3 is a major fingerprint
magnet just like the original version if
you're looking for a new ps3 this is a
solid choice with a bigger hard drive
and good bundle games like Assassin's
Creed 3 but they are been hard to come
by right now I had luck finding one on
Amazon so I'll drop a link in the
description if you're interested if you
