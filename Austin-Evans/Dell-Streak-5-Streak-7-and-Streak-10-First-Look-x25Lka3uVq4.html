today I'm here with a video on some new
information about dell's new lineup of
tablets now we've all known for quite a
while about the dell mini five that are
smaller tablet but now that it's going
to we got a lot more information as well
as it is going to be joined by two
bigger brothers this streak 7 is the
streak 10 so stay tuned i'll be go ahead
and give you guys a full round down and
what we know what we expect release
dates awesome good stuff anyway let's
get this one started ok so this all kind
of came about with a post on engadget
who basically got a scoop on a lot of
the really cool stuff i'm about to tell
you guys about so let's just go ahead
and begin with probably one of the most
important things which is the name
previously we knew that dell mini 5 was
we they attended it it's going to be the
first of several tablets well it's
actually not going to be called the dell
mini 5 which didn't really make any
sense in the first place because they
obviously they have the dell like mini
10 which are the netbooks you know you
don't want to get these confused so now
the new name is going to be the dell
streak 5 and we've heard a little bit
about this so it makes sense and it's
going to be as i said for joined by the
streak 7 and the streak 10 now no really
amp new information about the dell mini
the dell streak 5 okay so the next thing
we'll cover is the streak 7 and the
street 10 now we don't have a ton of
information on this yet but what we do
know it we have a small we have a kind
of low resolution picture but what we do
know is that they are especially a seven
a 10 inch tablet and of course the ipad
is a 10 inch tablet so that should kind
of give you an idea of the size and that
they're going to be coming out the end
of the streak 7 should be coming out
towards the end of this year and the
strict n should be coming out early next
year so of course that's obviously
seriously subject to change it could be
a lot later probably it will be a lot
later this kind of interesting to see
the dell is actually working on it now
all of these we are many specs at that
is yet but all these seem to be running
the same sort of android custom android
and faith the dell is created it seems
to the scale up pretty nicely from the
five to the seventh to the 10 but of
course nobody tested so it's kind of
hard to say now we don't have a whole
lot of information like I said guys but
these do look pretty legit annadelle
loosed a statement saying we
continuously develop and test new
products and but we have many
announcements and we aren't comment on
speculation or rumors obviously you know
but it does look like I mean that's if
they don't say no kind of my book guys
pretty much yes but so yeah guys that's
just a quick overview of the streak 5 7
and 10 they're all looking pretty solid
I'm really liking the fact that they
actually have a 7-inch tablet of course
the 10 inch tablet looks to be at the
moment the best choice but i like the
idea that they're actually experimenting
around with different sizes i'm sure
they'll be different prices as well it's
kind of you know experimental around a
little bit first of other things idea of
a 7-inch tablet will be really good you
should have enough screen space where
you can actually do some moderate work
and everything enjoy your movies etc
it's also not going to be really really
large like maybe the ipad i wouldn't
call it really large um but it's not
going to be you know requiring like a
big bag or anything like the laptop bag
or anything it should be small enough
where you can put it in like a pouch or
something it should work maybe I guess
that's all we know about the new dell
streak models would you stay tuned we'll
take a look at any new information
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
