a video on some slightly different
headphones so these are the sign by Auto
C now what makes these a little bit
different from the normal style
headphones is that they not only have
the standard three-and-a-half millimeter
jack but it also has a lightning cable
it definitely looks like the iPhone 7 is
going to be dropping the headphone jack
in favor of using lightning headphones
and bluetooth headphones so in theory if
you plug this in to an iPhone or an iPad
you're going to be getting a higher
quality signal to the headphones now
I've actually tried some Lightning
headphones in the past you guys can
check out that video they were
interesting but it was hard to really
know exactly how much of the difference
was because it was a lightning cable
versus just the headphones themselves so
I'm really curious to find out does it
actually make a difference to audio
quality if you plug in via lightning
ultra-thin diaphragms Andrew is this is
this English some of it so it says it
has three times larger drivers than
normal headphones is that even a thing
or it can be the bigger the driver the
more electricity you need to drive it so
here's the thought since these are
lightning I'm assuming the Lightning
port could probably push more power than
normal three-and-a-half millimeter I
would think you could - right unless you
have like an amp or something yeah yeah
so that's what the amps doing it's
actually pushing more electricity
through to power the drivers when you
haven't so actually having three times
larger drivers might be a real thing it
might be a real thing by the way in case
you guys are curious andrew is actually
a sound guy so we've got the lightning
cable right up front the lightning end
we also have the audio controls a
microphone I'm assuming this is where
the DAC is wow these are actually feel
really nice I mean it's just literally
metal and leather everywhere all right
and it looks like we have some
accessories here oh and we also have the
standard three-and-a-half millimeter
cable so this is definitely not a
scientific test but I'm going to be
using Spotify with the normal 320
kilobit mp3s
I mean you can definitely go higher end
you can get uncompressed black 16 good
stuff but for me I'm not really going to
do that I'm just gonna listen to normal
mp3s on my phone so I want to see if I
can tell the difference here
so the first thing I merely notice is
that I'm having to crank my phone all
the way to full volume to get any kind
of real volume out of these headphones I
say I'm actually not that impressed with
the cable there's a lot of emphasized
highs especially a lot of emphasize the
lows but there's not a whole lot of
anything in the middle 3.5 ml cable is
actually not doing a whole lot for me so
let's switch to like I should really
listen to right the Lightning right now
Wow immediate difference night and day
yeah huge difference before lightning
headphones um first of all night at full
volume so that's nice but yeah their
actual mids
here these went from being kind of meh
sort of headphones to like the Lightning
completely wakes these up I feel like my
head's inside the music I gotta say I
was expecting there to be a huge
difference I've listened to 3.5
millimeter headphones on this phone and
lots of other phones before and they've
sound totally fine I definitely do think
even though they include this cable this
is not the way you really should listen
these headphones these are headphones
that really do need it the very least
plug into like a DAC and an amp to get
like some proper power today I feel like
he's like whispering my ear right now
this is a really extreme case of showing
lightening headphones just because
losing to them with lightning sounds
awesome
they sound like really really nice
headphones plugging them with the normal
headphone jack they don't sound too hot
like honestly
they sound like 30 or 40 dollar
headphones so it's interesting I think
the Lightning definitely helps I'm not
totally convinced I mean I think these
are still very high-end headphones that
purse a $50 $100 pair of headphones that
you're going to see this much of a
difference but to be fair this sounds
pretty awesome can specially especially
considering them listening to mp3s on a
phone so what do you guys think about
lightning headphones have you tried them
what do you think about Apple removing
the headphone jack definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
