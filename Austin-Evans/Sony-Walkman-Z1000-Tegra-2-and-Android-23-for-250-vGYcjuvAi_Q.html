from CES 2012 with the hands-on demo of
the Sony Walkmans z1000 blend take it
away hey Austin welcome to CES taking a
look at the z1000 with a 4.3 inch w QVGA
inch screen you can see it's the Android
2.3 platform one thing about this piece
is of course Walkman is the mainstay of
Sony and no it's not dead this is
something that's still very much alive
but with the Android 2.3 functionality
obviously we've got smooth performance
but yet we're still building our
reputation on audio and video
performance so with the audio playback
simple touchscreen performance you can
touch your artists and go ahead and
bounce in and play your track the z1000
has been well received at the show
everybody's liking the form factor now
granted the question gets asked why why
not well simple answer you know this is
an entertainment piece so one thing one
strategy that Sony is pursuing for 2012
and it's huge is a multi screen strategy
so the idea of tablet you know Xperia
phone Z series walkman TV having that
music unlimited debt video unlimited in
the background so the point being is
you've got the ultimate portable
entertainment in your pocket and on the
go so really cool piece of course video
playback and I'll grab a video here so
we can take a quick look but the whole
idea as well is this has a micro HDMI
connection so you can connect this to a
TV if you want to play games you can
share you know absolutely with it with
the marketplace there's no limit to what
you can or can't do with this NVIDIA
Tegra 2 processor so it's got excellent
horsepower especially for a 36 inch or
40 inch screen so you name it it's got
it all built in from the audio side of
course this is still going to be our
pride and joy yeah s master MX digital
amplification of course s master was
seen before and our home audio gear and
several other devices before but the
whole point that we've actually put the
best of the best in this device from an
audio performance like I said I've heard
nothing but good things to show
how about price or release date price
you're gonna see it starting at 249 for
8 gig and working its way up now as far
as release day early March alright thank
you very much thank you sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
