with the tutorial showing you how to
test your gaming computer so of course
when you do a custom build there's a lot
of advantages of course you're saving
money you're building yourself all that
kind of fun stuff but one thing a lot of
people neglect to do is actually test to
make sure that everything is working
properly it's not enough to just install
windows have it boot and make sure that
it works and go hey you're all done
there actually are a couple of tools
that you can use to ensure that
everything is going to be working
correctly the first thing I always test
is the CPU now this is basically the
brain of your computer so if there are
any problems here you're definitely to
find them sooner or later so basically
the way to do this is to use the program
prime95
and i will have a link to it as well as
everything else in the description of
this video
now prime95 is a very simple program
what it does is it will max each and
every one of your CPU cores to 100% this
does several things so for starters to
make sure that all the components are
working correctly so this means the CPU
is able to be clocked all the way to its
maximum speed it means that the
motherboard is delivering the power to
the CPU correctly it also means that
your power supply has enough juice to go
ahead and run everything that it needs
to
since the CPU is running at 100% we're
also going to be able to test the
temperature so of course processors can
get very hot and you're going to need to
have some good cooling involved as far
as the CPU cooler itself as well as
proper airflow through your case so to
test this we're going to install
something else which is called core temp
now this is as the name implies going to
tell you the temperature of every single
core in your CPU so to test open up core
temp and take a look at the idle
temperature reading on your CPU so make
sure that you're not doing anything on
your computer and that the room that you
are testing in is about the same
temperature that it is going to be
normally now open prime95 and select the
blend test once I get started you should
immediately see your CPU temperatures
begin to climb now what are they in is
going to be a little bit different
depending on how you set up your build
so if you have a standard build no
overclocking I would generally run
prime95 for 10 to 15 minutes and then
take a look at the final temperature
however if your overclocking not only
you're testing to see the temperature
but you're also making sure that your
overclock is stable so with an overclock
I generally run prime95 for a minimum of
6 hours and in fact if you want to run
it for 24 hours that's all good while
prime95 is running you should keep a
couple things in mind for starters what
is the temperature of your CPU so
generally 80 degrees Celsius is the
maximum that I'm comfortable with now
you can run them hotter for example most
Intel CPUs are closer to 100 degrees
Celsius before they start running into
problems however 80 degrees Celsius is
very high
as is and really ideally you should find
your CPU somewhere between fifty to
sixty degrees Celsius you should also
keep an eye out for any kind of crashes
or blue screens so if you're
overclocking this isn't a big deal you
just need to tweak your settings some
however if you aren't overclocking
you're just using a standard build and
you're getting consistent blue screens
or crashes and prime95 this could mean a
couple things
for starters make sure that your
temperatures are not really high so for
example if they are going above 100
degrees Celsius or something like that
that can cause some issues but if your
temperatures are okay and you're still
running into crashes this could mean
there's some kind of system failure
whether it be your CPU RAM or
motherboard once you're done testing
your CPU now let's go ahead and take a
look at your graphics card so for this
we're going to be using another program
called fir mark now this is very similar
to prime95
and that's going to allow us to max out
the GPU to see if there are any issues
this works basically the same way
open up fir mark and then begin a stress
test you should see the GPU utilization
go up to around 100% and you should also
see the temperatures begin to climb
unlike with prime95 however where we're
testing the both the stability as well
as the temperatures we basically just
want to test the temperature on the GPU
so go ahead and keep an eye on the chart
so it will actually tell you exactly
what the temperature is so basically
just keep an eye on this until it
actually starts to begin to level out so
generally it's going to be around 60 to
70 degrees and it should only take about
10 to 15 minutes however again with the
GPU you can run it a little bit hotter
so 80 degrees to 85 degrees is usually
my cutoff although again these Jing's
can generally run up to close to 100
degrees Celsius you should also keep an
eye out on the display are there any
kind of glitches or missing textures or
anything that looks out of the ordinary
if so this could be a problem with your
GPU now typically you're really not
going to have any problems like this so
if you do see something out of the
ordinary it's something to keep in mind
but if you do see it it's like some
glitches or some random textures it's
not something that would just
immediately go through your graphics
card away from but it is something to
keep in mind so once you're sure that
your CPU and your graphics card are both
running well you're not having any kind
of crashes or any issues like that
the temperatures are well within reason
then you're going to be good to go and
you have a fully working gaming computer

to check out some of my other videos
including the 600 or gaming PC build if
you enjoyed be sure to leave this video
a thumbs up and if you're interested in
