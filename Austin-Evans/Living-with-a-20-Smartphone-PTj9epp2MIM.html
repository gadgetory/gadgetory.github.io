$20 smartphone this is the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol pixel it's because when I
buy a 2000 smartphone I buy a $20
smartphone oh yes this thing is tiny 4G
/ Wi-Fi capable 3.4 inch touchscreen
display Android 4.4 KitKat
and a 2 megapixel camera / video
recorder I mean as much as I'm making
fun of it this is a full fledge mart
phone that cost me $20 alright so since
there's no back on the phone I'll keep
digging battery is eleven hundred and
fifty mili amp hours that's actually not
terrible I mean it's really small but
matches things pry not Rock any kind of
crazy specs okay so now that's assembled
it's not terrible I mean definitely
plastic it doesn't feel cheap I mean I
can kind of like flex a little bit my
hands it feels sturdy it feels like it's
not gonna fall apart get started let's
do it
this keyboard is tiny Wow this is a
small phone you know what this is
actually about the same size of the
iPhone 4 I guess I just been using two
big phones lately first thing I'm
noticing the screen feels weird is it
actually plastic oh it totally is
plastic I also like the giant buttons
wait what that's a menu button that's
not a multitasking button what okay so
now that were activated I'm actually
really curious to see what's running
inside this thing all right we've got a
dual-core processor that's actually not
that bad a half a gigabyte of RAM and
two you bytes of internal storage
ooh 320 by 480 screen alright so
basically this phone is straight out of
like 2010 whoa all right level let's
let's take a picture this hmm yeah the
video action going on here
hey guys my face is blown out oh man
this is a cutting edge you know I still
do keep coming back to it doesn't feel
that bad all jokes aside obviously this
is not going to destroy like a galaxy s7
or something but for $20 I don't expect
much out of a smart phone I mean the
fact that it has a touchscreen and runs
Android for 20 bucks is pretty solid
now comes the real test can I actually
live with this thing for basic stuff
like Twitter it's totally fine I've been
using it all day and it's absolutely
usable the biggest hurdle is just
readjusting your expectations the screen
is small and low res and it's just not
very fast you all have to recalibrate
yourself to expect things to take a
couple extra seconds versus what you're
used to when you consider how cheap it
is it opens up a lot of possibilities
even if you only want to use it on Wi-Fi
your one Spotify download away from
having a pretty solid iPod replacement
the battery life is also decent it's
down to about thirty percent after a
full day of use which is better than
some full fledged smartphones
the one thing that really isn't
salvageable though was the camera it is
basically straight up unusable you're
really not going to want to use this
unless you absolutely have to
going into this I really wasn't sure
what to expect this is definitely not
going to replace your current phone
however it has a lot of interesting
potential as a secondary device for $20
you're getting a full fledged Android
device not sure it might not be the
latest and greatest
however Android 4.4 is still fairly well
supported and it should be able to use
most of the apps in the Play Store is
the Pixy blitz for everyone absolutely
not
however if you've never tried Android or
you just want a secondary smartphone you
could do a lot worse so what do you guys
think about a $20 smartphone let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
