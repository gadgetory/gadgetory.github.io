here with a recap of the blackberry 10
launch so not only did they announce the
brand new operating system but they also
announced a pair of new phones to go
with it so let's take a look starting
with the phones they announced one with
a keyboard which is going to be the q10
and one with AD the keyboard which is
going to be the z10 so I think the z10
is going to be more than mainstream
option it does have a 4.2 inch touch
screen as well as a pretty good-looking
design it is packing some pretty decent
specs however so that 4.2 inch display
has a resolution of 1280 by 768 giving a
very high pixel density comparable to
what you would find on the iPhone and
some other high-end handsets and on top
of that it also is powered by a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor they
weren't exactly specific on what this is
but my money would be on a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 you'll also find two
gigabytes of RAM on board as well as 16
gigabytes of storage built in now
something I think a lot of people are
going to like is that the back plate is
removable so that means that you can go
ahead and swap the battery the SIM card
as well as at an SD card of up to 32
gigabytes as far as the cameras go it
sports an 8 megapixel shooter around
back with 1080p video recording as well
as a front facing camera with 720p video
if you're looking for a keyboard the q10
is where it's at so this looks much more
like a typical blackberry and if I trust
them to do anything right it's
convenient awesome physical keyboard
however this actually does look pretty
nice is if you flip it over to the back
as a special glass woven material which
blackberry was very very eager to kind
of talk about and say how amazing it is
it's probably not all that special but
does give it a very nice look to the
device this is also powered by a
dual-core processor unfortunately they
weren't very specific as far as the
specs go so a lot of the stuff we'll
probably find out a little bit later as
the z10 will be coming out much sooner
than the q10 however what you can't
expect is a 3.1 inch touchscreen of
course with a resolution of 720 x 720
which again should actually be a very
nice screen the start of the show is
definitely blackberry 10 so they pretty
much removed everything as far as the
old blackberry OS and I've taken a few
bits from the playbook OS but for the
most part this is all new and it looks
good not amazing but it looks good so
the first thing that struck me is I was
watching all the demos was it looked
very smooth now of course this is
something that we pretty much take for
granted in iOS for Android Windows Phone
these days but it is good to see that
looks very smooth and a lot of the
gestures in the multitasking we're
actually really impressive one thing you
won't find on any blackberry 10
smartphone is a home
button so instead everything is really
optimized to work with gestures for
example if you want to do some
multitasking you swipe in from the
bottom you want to check your
notifications you swipe in from the left
and it seemed to work pretty well on top
of that is also really optimized for
one-handed use so for example the
keyboard which they showed off of course
the touch version of it looks really
responsive and way way ahead of anything
else that's out there so for example you
could just not do any spaces and it
would be very very smart as far as
figuring out what you're saying one of
the big things they were talking about
is blackberry hub which basically
integrates all kinds of information into
a single spot now this is hardly a new
idea however it looks like they did a
really good implementation with this
version so basically it takes a lot of
different information for example
facebook twitter linkedin but also takes
other things for example calls emails
texts calendars it all puts it into one
spot so if you want to look up some
information on one person maybe like a
contact to whatever will populate all
the rest of the information it'll all be
available in one spot so for example you
can look up a person's email address
shoot them an email then tweet something
go check on linkedin all from one spot
and it looked really nice and smooth bbm
also now has video chatting built-in so
it looks pretty much like FaceTime
nothing all that revolutionary but it is
a kind of a nice feature to add and on
top of that something I'm a little bit
more excited about is the fact that you
can screen share using BBM video chat so
this is actually something really cool
of course screen sharing has been around
on the desktop with skype and that kind
of thing but being able to actually do
that from your phone is really cool it
also looks like apps are going to be
well taken care of so bb10 will be
launching with over 70,000 now of course
most of these are probably not going to
be all that high quality however you
will find quite a few of the standard
things you would expect including
twitter facebook skype kindle and much
more on top of that it also does have
support for android apps sort of so
basically it ships with an android 2.3
virtual machine so when you want to do
an android app you can kind of make it
work but of course running in a virtual
machine probably not going to give you
the best performance but the possibility
of using android apps is there the
blackberry z10 will start to go on sale
around the world over the next couple
months so for example in the UK it
actually goes on sale tomorrow however
you for your live in canada can i have
to wait till next month and for the
United States going to have to wait
until March where we'll be launching
both on AT&amp;amp;T as well as verizon for two
hundred dollars on a two-year contract
anyway guys I'm curious to know what do
you think about blackberry 10 as well
new phones personally the q10 really
doesn't do it for me I'm kind of given
that physical keyboards a long time ago
how did the z10 looks like something
that I would be actually interested in I
definitely do play doing a review on it
as soon as I can get my hands on one but
then I definitely be sure to let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below if you guys are interested in more
feel free to check out some reviews I've
done up some other high-end smartphones
lightly if you enjoy definitely be sure
to leave this video thumbs up and
subscribe for more blackberry 10 content
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
