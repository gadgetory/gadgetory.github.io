the video talk a little bit about the
new mini iPad yeah you're me right mini
I'm a joke here and we've heard rumors
about a smaller iPad for a long time now
I'm pretty much ignored them so far it
was the same way with the iphone there
was so many rumors about an iphone nano
or an iphone micro or some smaller
version of the iphone and of course we
never saw that and i doubt we ever will
however this ipad thing might actually
have a little bit to it while the
current ipad selling very well there
definitely is a lot of room below it so
take for example the amazon kindle fire
that is sold very very well and it's
only two hundred dollars now to mention
the fact that Google is most likely
working on a nexus tablet for two
hundred dollars samsung I has a Galaxy
Tab two hundred fifty dollars you
definitely see that a lot of the price
points have shifted much much lower of
course Steve Jobs once famously said
that 7-inch tablets were too small for
people with normal sized fingers well I
can't believe that to an extent but a
couple of things that have changed he
was religion talking about the first
samsung galaxy tab which was before even
that tablet version of Android was out
on top of that a seven point eight inch
tribal is quite a bit larger so CES this
year I took a look at the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 7.7 which 7.77 point it's pretty
close and I actually really liked it I
found that the screen size was a very
nice compromise between a small 7-inch
tablet and the full-size nearly 10 inch
tablet of the iPad or removing the
retina display instead using the seven
point eight inch screen with the same
resolution of the iPad one and two apple
would say by absolute fortune on top of
that it would give them a nice lower
option so of course you have the ipad 3
at five hundred dollars you have the
ipad 2 which is a decent step down for
four hundred dollars you could have
something like this which would be
somewhere around three hundred dollars
and perhaps have a little bit less
feature so more likely we'd only have
eight gigabytes of storage and maybe
i'll find a couple of corners to cut we
would definitely get apple in a much
lower price point than the rat right now
according to this report the new mini
ipad be on sale sometime in the next
three to six months for price of
anywhere between 250 and 300 dollars now
I'm very curious to know guys what do
you think I know you're ever gonna have
a lot of really good opinions so do you
think this is a great idea you think
Apple should definitely go for it you
think it's a terrible idea and Apple
would never even consider this anyway
guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up probably appreciate that and if
you're interested in more videos like
this be sure to subscribe so we probably
known as the iPad Mini or the new new
small mini I
so probably known as the new iPad nanny
many dead well there's no doubt that the
ipad 3 is selling millions and millions
of millions of millions of millions and
millions and millions of milk a lot of
people are going to look at a tattle and
go okay well there's the ipad for five
hundred dollars we can get the samsung
galaxy nexus tab thing what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
