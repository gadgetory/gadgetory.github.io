here with what to expect on the iPhone
5s so of course the iPhone 5 has only
been out for a little while however
there are already a lot of rumors and a
lot of information about the next
generation of iPhones let's take a look
just like the iPhone 3GS was an upgrade
from the 3G and the 4s wasn't upgrade
from the for the iPhone 5s should be an
upgrade from amazingly enough the iPhone
5 so as I try to get away from that
terrible joke some of the major
improvements have to do with the camera
so the iPhone 5 and 4s basically had the
same camera with 8 megapixels now it
actually really wasn't all that bad at
all however there definitely had been
some improvements in the last couple
years so expect Apple to improve this to
a 13 megapixel sensor in the iPhone 5s
Apple is also rumored to be improving
the flash on the new iPhone so if you
guys have ever used the flash on your
phone you probably have noticed that
it's terrible so I don't think I've ever
actually gotten a good picture using the
flash on my phone so how Apple plans to
fix this I'm not entirely sure some of
the rumors indicate that the size of the
flash or at least the size of the cutout
for the flash will be a lot bigger so
maybe they'll add multiple LEDs or
something
but hey I will be very happy if there's
actually a usable flash on a phone the
iPhone 5s should also be quite a bit
faster so I expect to see an Apple a7
chip set inside so more than likely this
will stay dual core as for iOS they're
actually really isn't a lot of benefit
from going to something like quad-core
although it is a possibility with huge
phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
around I'm probably not the only one who
wishes the iPhone screen would get a
little bit bigger however if you're
hoping for that don't hold your breath
for this year as it's mostly expected to
be the exact same design from the iPhone
5 including the same forage display now
like I said there will be some tweaks
and it may look just a little bit
differently but for the most part
expecting the same hardware to carry
over to the iPhone 5s where it gets
interesting is that we may actually see
more than one new iPhone come out so for
years we've been hearing rumors about a
supposed cheap low cost option of the
current iPhone so while the 5 and the 4s
are great they are very expensive phones
and if Apple could create a cheaper
iPhone without being actually cheap they
could actually do really well so this
phone which I'm gonna call the iPhone
see even though that's definitely not
gonna be the real name but just as a
placeholder so this iPhone C will
supposedly be a little bit wider a
little bit taller and about a millimeter
thicker it's also going to ditch the
glass and metal construction which of
course is very expensive on the iPhone
4s and 5 for something that's a lot more
plastic oriented
as far as the Lascaux imagine an iphone
3gs mixed with an iphone 5 so it still
should have a lot of the same thing so
expect a 4-inch display probably still
retina maybe slightly low quality but
basically the same thing a lightning
port headphone jack all the kind of
standard things but it won't be quite as
powerful supposedly the iphone c will be
running a qualcomm snapdragon processor
now this is interesting as pretty much
every single Apple device out there runs
some kind of Apple design processor
whether it be an apple a 4 a 5 or a 6
however if they did go with Snapdragon
this would mean a couple things for
starters it would be much cheaper as
they were combining three chips down
into one which could reduce is on both
complexity as well as cost beyond that
it would also deliver a clear difference
in performance between the standard
iPhone and the iPhone C is of course
they don't want it to be anywhere near
as powerful as their flagship phone all
of this combined would make the iPhone C
a much cheaper option than the current
iPhone 5 and indeed the iPhone 5s
however I would definitely take
everything I just said about the iPhone
C with a pretty major grain of salt now
well it wouldn't make sense to have a
cheaper version of the iPhone for
countries like China India and even here
in the United States where people want
something that's just a little bit
cheaper it's definitely not done deal by
all means as far as the possible release
date for the iPhone 5s and iPhone C my
best bet would be somewhere between
September and October now some people
think it may be earlier something like
June or July
well that's possible I definitely think
that Apple is probably going to stick to
a yearly schedule as opposed to changing
an app and bringing it back to the
summer anyway guys I'm curious to know
what do you think about the iPhone 5s
and iPhone C I think the 5s is pretty
much a lock they're not gonna be doing
anything all that radical in my opinion
however with the iPhone C I give that
one about a 50/50 shot of actually
seeing the light of day but the big
thing is guys what do you think would
you be interested in iPhone C do you
think it's the right move for Apple
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below if you guys are
interested in more feel free to check
out my what to expect on the new Samsung
Galaxy s4 if you guys enjoyed be sure to
