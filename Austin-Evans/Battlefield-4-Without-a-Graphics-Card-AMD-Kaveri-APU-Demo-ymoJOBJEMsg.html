here the AMD APU 13 developer summit
we're going to be taking a look at a new
product the AMD Kaveri apu so joining me
is Adam who's the product manager so if
someone who hasn't maybe heard about the
announcements yesterday what exactly is
Kaveri all about Kaveri is our brand new
revolutionary architecture essentially
we've changed everything in the APU from
the CPU side to the GPU side so Kaveri
its core is basically what it's a
quad-core CPU along with a correct so
there's a four course of our new
steamroller cores in there and there's
up to eight different GCM compute units
so GCN is essentially the same graphics
technology that's in our new graphic
cards so basically what we're looking at
here is it's a quad-core CPU and it's
also got well it's basically a Radeon
graphics card kind of thrown into one so
what can we look forward with Kaveri as
opposed to previous generation ap use
like what kind of performance and all
that sort of thing we're not disclosing
performance right now but we've seen
with the battlefield that we can
actually enjoy high resolutions of
gaming than we could before we'll be
able obviously to to push forward on the
compute front as well so as far as the
gaming stuff goes so you just show this
little bit of battlefield 4 so take us
through how exactly this Kaveri handle
battlefield 4 right now we're seeing
battlefield 4 with an optimized build of
battlefield 4 so essentially just the
regular retail release we're seeing
about 30 frames per second at 1080p
medium settings obviously you want
faster frame rates you would lower the
resolution or whatnot and hopefully
there's there's new stuff to come as
well we've also talked about mantle and
mantle is something that will also work
on our ap use and that will come out
later and will hopefully see some
further enhancements and gains on that
so who would you say kaveri is really
aimed at like as far as gaming goes like
do you think this would be a good good
idea for someone who's maybe trying to
get into entry level gaming definitely
on the mainstream user the the user who
plays the latest games and is on a
budget certain types of MMO games
there's definitely a whole wide breadth
of different types of gaming
applications out there that gamers who
would buy this would see a definite
advantage of but we're really seeing
this as well as a reach into that
mainstream audience that is using their
computer for beyond games so they're
using it for productivity they're using
it for content creation so they're doing
a little bit of work on their PCs and
they're looking for something at a
really good price and really with a
Kaveri ap there's it's really second to
none awesome so as far as Kaveri when
are we going to I should be able to go
out and buy these so we've announced at
our apu a developer summit that will be
launching these january 14th so it's
within a couple months perfect all right
hey thanks very much it's awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
