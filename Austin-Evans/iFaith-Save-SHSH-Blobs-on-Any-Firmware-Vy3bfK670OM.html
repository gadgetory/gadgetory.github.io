showing you how to backup your sh sh
blobs using I faith now I baked this a
little different from something like
tiny umbrella and that it allows you to
pull your sh messagebox
from your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad as
opposed to needing Apple to have be
still signing it and now there are
definitely some big advantages to using
this method for example let's say you're
on an older firmer like for point 0.1 on
an iPhone and you are unlocked now
that's great news obviously you're going
to be unlocked on that firmware but
let's say that there's some problem then
you know you need to restore your device
well if you don't have the sh-sh box
because obviously Apple is not signing
them anymore you're going to be forced
to update to a new firmware and lose
your unlock and of course there are lots
of other reasons why you might want to
stay on older firmware or need your old
sh-sh blob so what this allows you to do
is capture the sh-sh blob from whatever
firmware your device is running right
now and save it so you can always get
back to that firmware this is very very
nice if you weren't able to grab the
sh-sh-sh blob for example maybe you
bought a new iPhone and it came with an
older firmware that you need or well you
know there's all kinds different reasons
so let me give you guys a quick tutorial
and showing you how to use this now
before we begin there is one thing I do
want to mention now this is going to
work on several devices it's going to
work on the iPhone 3GS the iPhone 4 the
iPod Touch 3rd generation the iPod Touch
4th generation the iPad 1 and the Apple
TV 2 now I'll be giving you guys a demo
on iPod Touch 4th generation but of
course the process is the same for all
devices except for the Apple TV and
there are a quick tutorial to show you
guys that so let's go ahead and again
the first step is is to go ahead and
plug your iPod iPhone iPad whatever be
sure to play it into your computer and
make sure that iTunes is closed down
everything like that and then you're
going to need to download ID baith which
I will have a link to in the description
of this video so wouldn't open this up
here take just a moment to load and then
once it does you guys can see here it's
a just really simple interface just tell
you that it's not for commercial use so
that's fine click OK
I'll give it one moment to just process
your advice and then you will have a few
options on the first which is some built
signed IPSW now that's what you want to
do later on but we're not quite there
yet we need to get our sh sh blocks
first you can show available caches so
whatever your sh sh is are saved you can
see that one nice thing about i'faith is
that instead of using the standard sort
server where you
you see it in Cydia is actually saved on
a separate server that i hate's know
whose of course the developer for this
program does have so not only can you
save it on your computer but it's also
going to be safe on a separate server so
that's really nice there's also I read
built-in of course most of you guys know
what I rebus will won't get into that
but it is built into IP so let's go
ahead and click dump sh-sh blogs now
before we get I do want to mention one
more thing of course while this supports
pretty much all firmwares from three
point one all the way to four point
three point three this also will work on
non jailbroken devices so for some
reason you're not jailbroken you still
want to stay on an old firmware this
will work no problem so it doesn't
matter all types of devices all that
kind of good stuff it will work just
fine so go ahead and click proceed let's
go and we are not dumping an apple tv2
so the first step is it's come over to
our device and we need to shut it off
now again make sure that it is already
plugged in iTunes is all closed in and
everything and then just go ahead and
hold the power button until it shuts off
and what we're going to be doing is
entering our device into DFU mode I'm
sure most of you guys have done this
before you've ever jailbroken very
simple but I will go ahead and walk you
guys through so once you see your device
is totally off there's no pinwheel or
anything we can click start we're going
to need to hold the power and home
button for five seconds or 10 seconds
rather so ready set go
holding them and then we will just hold
them for 10 seconds and then as soon as
it says we can we will release the power
button and continue holding the home
button and then let the program take
over from there alright so we're done
with the power button I'm gonna continue
holding the home button ok it says about
30 seconds there we go so as soon as you
see this program pretty good to go so we
can just let it sit here for a while we
need to set our device down and now
that'll take a few minutes to go ahead
and capture all of our sh sh 2 blobs
ok so this is done it will ask you for a
place to save your sh sh blobs this is
very important while it will be stored
online of course you can use it through
there um it's really nice to have it
saved on your computer so you just pick
any ol place I'll just pick my desktop
save it up gonna take just one moment
now well now it'll go ahead and save the
cache to the server so there you go
it'll say it's all done keeping them in
a safe spot even email them to yourself
and now we can click OK click OK once
more and then if that's all you need to
do you just wanted to back it up you're
good to go
alright now if you'd like to make sure
that it did work and click show
available caches on server give it one
moment and it will actually go ahead
pull up
pull it up on your cert on the server as
you can see here it shows I do have four
point three point three which is what I
just did saved if I wanted to I go
through if I had other blobs like you
know older firmers whatever I could do
that anyway guys that's it for my
tutorial showing you how to backup your
sh sh blobs using I faith so if you have
