video for you I like to thank everybody
who came out to d3 live I just filmed an
episode I felt like two hours a lot of
fun and it was a complete disaster
so guys yeah I'm back has some gum
surgery and if I still sound a little
thing that's why but uh so yeah just on
d3 live
we just found a ton fried novella bunch
and well guys everything fails the
camera battery died the sky calls failed
no one could hear me and I was messing
up every ten seconds it was frankly
pretty hilarious so guys enjoy the fail
you guys can watch much of my bloopers
because I've actually about every d3
live episode blooper saw includes some
of them so you guys can laugh some of
the funny stuff guys don't like stay
tuned I've got a review of this laptop
I'm really excited to give you guys a
laptop review got a lot of videos coming
for you guys so just stay tuned
enjoy the fail and normal videos will be
coming back very soon thanks guys 3 3 2
1 hey guys and welcome to episode number
5 of d3 live so guys before we begin let
me just apologize in advance
I've had some gum surgery recently so I
might come just a little bit finally
finally this it's not a word that's or
that just just the sale just go through
the roof I mean you know it'd be it'd
basically be just as good as you know I
like a flip all sudden you know you
didn't have a full iPod touch in it so
guys that's that now something that I
actually don't think that I think I've
figured it's worth mentioning is the
front face
yeah I will make over you on iOS 4
jailbreak
yeah warmup
we surprised we said but I guess what
I'm trying to say is I'm not so sure so
guys that's my pretty much my full round
down of the iPhone 4 and blufor time a
month or two but yeah they didn't say
any specific release date thanks to the
call okay let's go ahead and take
another call so guys if you wanna go
ahead and call him be good
having everything right
okay guys so that's it for this eventful
fail episode of d3 live I'm like thank
you guys for watching I do always do
this every week I've done it every week
and fail okay guys so that's it for this
week's shortened edition of d3 live like
to thank you for watching and if you
liked feel free to subscribe I do these
every week fail or not like this week
that was dumb okay guys so for the
second segment of d3 live I will be
taking live Skype calls I'm here in
front of blogtv that bunch of people in
the room right now and so they're gonna
be calling me with live Skype questions
let's wait and take one so that's kind
of go ahead and call hello are you there
yeah
how much question man then question huh
swayed and he started it
okay guys so for the second segment of
d3 live I'm taking live Skype calls I'm
doing this all in front of vlog TV so
got a bunch of people on here they're
gonna be calling me in Wednesday
go ahead and answer a couple questions
hello Jonathan are you there yeah hey
what's your question
okay that's a blooper that is totally
purr
now the last thing will we will three
two one now the last thing we will be
covering today is HTC's latest
smartphone the Wildfire now this one I
will go start out with saying this is
only for our my European friends okay
guys so the first step obviously is
going to be installing it now I will
note before but again infinii board does
cost two dollars but let me tell you
guys this is a very very subtle wasted
okay that was awesome
and do prove I didn't do a blooper video
this week I said you have better ID I
need to do an entire blooper video
instead of doing that's a good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
