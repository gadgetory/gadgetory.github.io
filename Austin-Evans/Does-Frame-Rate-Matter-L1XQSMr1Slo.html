obsessed with frame rates but do they
actually matter any video this one
included is nothing more than a series
of still frames that are playback
quickly so for this video you should
pick these 60 frames per second option
that way you can get the full effect of
what I'm talking about so this is 15
frames per second as you can see it
looks a little choppy a little weird I
mean yeah you can see that this is video
but it almost looks like some kind of
like dream sequence
now we're 24 frames per second now this
has passed the point where your brain is
looking at the individual stills and
perceiving them as motion so 24 frames
is much more common in things like TV
shows and specialty movies and now we're
moving on to 30 frames per second now
this is probably the most common for web
content it's pretty much what all of my
videos are in and here you'll see the
motion is nice and smooth that looks
pretty natural now we're at 60 frames
per second here you can see the motion
is much more smooth almost at the point
where it's a little bit distracting now
while 60 FPS video is not that common
you will see it a lot in things like
game play things become even more
noticeable the more motion there is
that's why while 30 frames works for
most things
switching to 60 can work better for fast
paced action like sports another big
area where framerate is important is for
gaming now I do lower frame rates look
distracting they can have a real effect
on gameplay it's one thing to watch a
movie or TV show another when you're
controlling something on screen low
frame rates not only look choppy but add
a sense of lag to your gameplay most
displays top out at 60 frames however
something like this a sous monitor can
handle up to 144 frames per second when
you hook it up to a gaming PC with a one
millisecond response time in theory this
should almost completely eliminate any
sense of lag or choppiness
but how much of a difference does it
actually make to find out I invite a few
of my friends to sit down and play a
game at a few different frame rates to
see if they could actually tell the
difference why oh Jesus
10-minute PS is Bolton if I'm flying I
wouldn't know it cuz it feels like I'm
just bumping along yeah it's super seals
not even laggy but just feel slow does
this a sick joke this sucks awesome why
do you make me play this smooth is gonna
be the keyword in this video can we get
a smooth counter going it's like really
jumpy it's not smooth like it's playable
in the sense that I can do things but
first off this is just burning my eyes I
don't wanna play anymore
not a fan of ten frames hey this is
there uh that's so much better
oh my gosh this is
world's different this is so much
smoother whoa this still sucks like it
depends on the game you're playing too I
think I think some games dude plus 30
it's ok but you can definitely notice in
this one that it's not as smooth as it
could be yeah you know what watching
that thing move out there looks a lot
more natural it's just it's just a lot
smoother this still looks like n64 right
here like it's usable but that's about
the most you can say it's not good all
right 60 frames ok can fit stretch and
move it's a lot smoother when I move
feels like need for speed ah that's
better
a lot smoother than 30 was like mean I
mean the jump to 10 to 30 was more
noticeable because 10 is that painful
you can definitely tell looking at 30
versus 60 it's really responsive and
really fast but I kind of want to puke
60 is really good it doesn't make me
feel queasy or anything that's a common
complaint with people who don't play
yeah I mean this is just the standard
right now for a reason I never played I
won a 40 for us this is gonna be
interesting
oh my god oh my god this is great so
smooth look at all the crumbling so
smooth everything is coated in butter
even though I'm flying so that does make
any sense there's no friction the
murders of the chickens
I like 144 it's great I can tell that
it's faster but it still feels about the
same as what 60 was like I feel like
difference between 30 and 60 was you
know not as noticeable as 10 to 30 and
then same for this like it's it's
smoother but I don't think it's as
drastic of a change at least to my eyes
I'm happy with 144 awesome glad that you
have me participate in your video cuz
I'm really enjoying it thank you
everybody for watching subscribe to
Austin Evans and I'll see you guys later
and if you're doing some sort of
reaction game like a drought like a need
for speed or like a shooter or something
then you might be tempted to spend the
extra and see things in what seems like
hyperspeed so what do you guys think is
a sweet spot for frame rates let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
