stack up versus Android five years later
to find out we've got the iPhone 4s and
Samsung Galaxy S 2 as the best of the
best in 2011 it's interesting to see
just how well they've aged the first
thing you'll notice is how much bigger
the galaxy has to is I have the US
t-mobile variant here which sports a big
for the time four and a half inch screen
compared to the tiny three and a half
inch screen on the iPhone that said
while the AMOLED screen on the galaxy
isn't bad the write-in display of the
iPhone looks a lot nicer at 326 pixels
per inch it's identical to the iPhone 6s
and while displays have gotten better in
the last five years there's really not
much to complain about except for the
size the iPhone feels tiny by today's
standards where the galaxy is much more
comfortable while the s2 is a decent
looking phone back in the day it has an
h2 well you do have a removable back
which gives you access to a micro SD
card slot and removable battery as a
five-year old phone be able to swap a
fresh battery and easily is a big
advantage it's fairly thin but the
plastic build is taking a beating over
the years and it shows this iPhone has
been nicely taken care of but there's no
denying the appeal of glass and metal
this is still one of my favorite phone
asides ever with a nice heft in the hand
and an expensive feel even though you
can pick up a 4s for cheap these days
it's clear that this was once a 6m
dollar phone something that surprised me
is the software the Galaxy S 2 tops out
on Android 4.1 jelly bean which came out
in 2012 where Apple actually still
supports the iPhone 4s as it's fully up
to date on iOS 9 while it probably won't
get updated much beyond this it's really
impressive to see a phone supported for
five years
he's an excess line usually gets updates
for two or three years and the s2 only
got a single year of updates mind you I
OS 9 is an exactly buttery smooth on the
4s but it's at least usable while
jellybean is still stuck in 2012 it's
not all bad Google has steadily moved
more and more apps into the Play Store
which means you're able to use the
latest versions of things like Chrome
unfortunately a lot either will work on
4.1 or can't be updated apps like
Twitter that work are few and far
between having iOS 9 helps the iPhone a
lot things like Spotify work just fine
and although you'll notice some slowness
and snapchat it's totally usable more
demanding games are going to be a
problem but lighter titles like
minecraft work just as well as with new
phones as long as you lower your
expectations for speed there's not much
you can't do on the 4s
one thing is definitely proved in the
last few years are the cameras both
phones have eight megapixel sensors that
are decent but nothing special as long
as there's enough light both the iPhone
and Galaxy s2 can deliver a nice image
but the s2 doesn't handle color
very nicely and iPhone gives better
dynamic range on the other hand the
front-facing VGA camera on the 4s is
pretty terrible where the s2 has an
actually usable selfie camera video is
1080p across-the-board and here there's
not much comparison 4s has far better
stabilization in color or the s2 gets
shaky and blows the highlights out
easily the Galaxy has two more than
anything shows just how far things have
come in the last five years things have
also improved in the iPhone camp but the
4s is held up impressively well which
would you go for let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one
it feels this in the have ever gonna cut
