today I'm here with a video I get asked
about a lot is how do you make your iPod
screen show up on your computer like
this it's a very simple just doesn't
take any time but I'll get set up and
you'd be good to go I mean as you can
see here show the whole deal there's a
little bit laggy and glitchy but it
still works very well and now it's not a
big deal
basically show you guys how to use VNC
to you know
sync your computer and your iPod so you
can you know use it in screencasts or
you can actually use you know actually
physically use it by using a mouse to
move it's it's pretty cool but yeah so
yeah let's go and get this one started
okay so let's go ahead and get this
started it's very simple very easy you
don't you know have to be an elite
hacker or lever to get this done
basically you're just going to need to
do a couple things and you'll be ready
to go going to need to download a
application in Cydia and then I need to
download an application on your computer
I don't know if this is for Windows the
this is the demo showing you guys on
Windows you can't do this on Mac but if
you're using a different program it's
slightly different so I recommend if you
have a Mac probably look for a Mac
specific tutorial but I you can use it
on either way whatever so once you have
once you have you know your computer and
your iPod or iPhone
it does not matter that basically go
ahead and open up cydia
now before I begin I will know one thing
you do have to have your both your
computer and your iPod or iPhone
connected to the same Wi-Fi network okay
just you know just a heads up on that
guys so yeah let's go ahead and get hit
go ahead and get you guys ready to roll
so basically open up cydia and hit
Search okay now once you hit it you're
gonna need search VNC but it's not spelt
the way you think V EE n see why okay
I'll have the link to when I think I'll
have it written down in the description
exactly how to say that but it's VNC so
once you have it go ahead and let it
load up and you won't have to add any
kind of special sources you you should
all you have to just have to search it
and it should come right up then once
you know just go ahead and look at you
can read through it but it's not that
important and just go ahead and install
it it's pretty simple so now once you
have it installed
don't be an icon whether it runs in the
background so once you have installed
yeah you'll be done with your iPod for
right now then we go ahead and go over
to your computer
okay guys so once you have VNC installed
on your iPod or iPhone you go ahead and
come over to your computer and basically
you just need to download this program
called tight VNC very simple come down
here and like I said I'll have links
always in the description and so you
need to go ahead and just download tight
VNC the current version is
point three point one zero go ahead and
do it you just do it by going to the
download page just first thing you see
here just do the self installing package
and just real simple just go ahead click
it right install and you'll be good to
go
so once you have tight VNC installed
then you're about ready to go so let's
go ahead and do the final step okay so
once you have type B and C installed
doesn't take just a second and you have
this page it's very simple totally you
don't have to do anything basically but
you need to enter the IP address of your
iPod or iPhone no-brainer you do need to
be sure that it is connected to your
Wi-Fi network but and you just need to
punch in your IP address if you don't
know how to do that it's very simple
open up your iPod or iPhone and hit on
settings okay then go ahead and go into
Wi-Fi and then it will show the list of
networks whichever one that you're
hooked up to which like I said should be
the one that is connected it's your
computers case to go ahead and hit that
little blue arrow and then the first
thing that you'll see it will say IP
address new usually like a 1 0-0
ba-ba-ba-ba just a few things so in this
case you know you put like 1 0 0 I'm
just gonna give you guys an example then
the first thing be like 3 4 5 or
whatever then be like 1.1 that be sure
to put the dots in there and then once
you do it you go ahead and hit connect
so one second guys let me go ahead and
get mine hooked up and yeah way to the
next step ok so once you punch in your
IP address and you do need to make sure
that you got right go ahead punch in
your IP address and go ahead and hit
connect you will see a little pop up on
your iPod or iPhone that says you know
incoming connection from your IP address
accept or deny go ahead and accept it
and basically this is it you see you
have your VNC window right here and you
know you can go ahead
obviously it's recording the screen or
you can use your mouse you see right
here grab it and pull it just by using
your mouse just very cool now there
sometimes you can have problems it is a
little bit glitchy sometimes
occasionally it won't connect so you'll
either have to
when it doesn't connect check your IP
address make sure the IP addresses or
you know punched in right and also
sometimes just no shutoff tight VNC
reboot your iPod or iPhone usually
that'll fix it it can be a little
glitchy little you know a little odd
sometimes but you know 95% of the time
it should work just fine now I will say
that it's not fast I mean you see here
if I scroll across it takes a second to
you know to go ahead don't so don't
expect miracles I mean you know if
you're just sitting there you know
showing you're just you know basic stuff
like you know you're not really you know
doing a lot of I know intense stuff
that's you know was gonna be refreshing
a lot because it will be pretty slow but
besides that you know you guys are good
to go feel free to you know use this in
a screencast like I'm doing right now or
you know you can just have your iPod or
iPhone across the way and begin control
it from your computer or you know just
show off to your friends to do whatever
you want don't you guys that's it that's
how to control and show your iPod or
iPhone screen from your computer so yeah
anyways thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
