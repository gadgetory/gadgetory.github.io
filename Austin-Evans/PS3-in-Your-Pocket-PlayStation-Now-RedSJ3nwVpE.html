at CES 2014 taking will get PlayStation
now what PlayStation L is all about is
allowing you to stream ps1 ps2 and ps3
games all sorts of consoles that
normally wouldn't be able to play those
games so if you guys remember a couple
years ago Sony bought the streaming
service Gaikai so basically the way this
works is that there's a render farm
somewhere and there's a million like
places threes all hacked up together
into a server however they decide to do
it but basically all the heavy lifting
is done on the server somewhere
it's just streamed over the internet it
allows you to play a PlayStation 3 game
on a Playstation 3 but you can also do
it on ps4 or PS Vita or in theory even a
phone or one of their new bravia 2014
tvs so especially a really cool concept
so here at their booth they have a demo
station so I was able to play God of War
ascension on a Vita it was all wireless
and actually worked pretty well so I
definitely could tell there was a little
bit of lag which obviously so when you
hit a button instead of just going
straight to the Vita it's got to go out
to the Internet gonna be rendered and
sent back so there's always going to be
a little bit of latency it absolutely
does depend on what your connection is
like so talk about the Sony folks
they're saying that you're going to need
roughly about a 5 megabit per second
connection it's going to be streaming
about 720p since they are ps3 games but
it is going to vary at the moment
they're planning on launching with some
ps3 games and ps2 and PS one would
follow later now unfortunately you won't
be able to just play every single game
that's ever been made so from the start
of it looks like it's just going to be
Sony owned games so some like the
exclusives however they are talking
about a couple of ways you can actually
get these games so on one hand you could
rent them so let's say I want to play
God of War for a weekend I could rent it
for so you know how much ever it is
going to be PlayStation 4 or Vita or
whatever there's also a subscription
service which allows you to play pretty
much any of the games that they have
available for a set price so kind of
imagine like Netflix for video games so
very very cool stuff we'll see how it
all pans out but it should be released
on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 3 and Vita
a little bit later on this year so what
do you guys think about PlayStation now
I think it's actually a pretty cool idea
is something that you do have a decent
internet connection as being able to
play anything from ps1 to a ps3 game on
your TV or Vita or whatever is actually
a really cool things but definitely be
sure let me know what you guys think in
the comments below before we get out of
here though I'm going to give a big
shout out to Squarespace for power
