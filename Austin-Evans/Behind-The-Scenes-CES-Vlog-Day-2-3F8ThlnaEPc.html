dancy there we go strike man having fun
all right so we're following the world's
most complicated what's in your bag B so
which is sir mr. Brownlee would you like
to go over exactly what we're doing and
how okay so a little bit over just a
little I mean this is typically like a
normal vlog camera right and just just
to see 100 like no big deal
it's got like trying to get our white
balance there's a light here which casts
a tiny little shadow there's not a white
over here they're getting at colors
right yeah of course I mean if the
colors are not right look we're having
some serious issues it's gonna be a
really fancy setup but the bag is
incredibly uninteresting so what it's
really about is excitement it's all the
fun goodies inside camera yeah I love
this light here just like because we
rant because we only have a monopod and
then a tripod so we're like okay
whatever you do I just throw a light
there all right so since someone took a
very long time to fill in their video so
now we're like for the LG press event so
we're making a run out here it's not
quite as warm except it's going to fit
well I mean it's warm in New York it's
warmer than it was yesterday it was 19
so it's technically 20 it's technically
20 degrees warmer okay so are we taking
the tram
all right waiting on the tram all right
so we kind of just did LG sort of um we
just got stuck in the overflow room
because we were late and it was full but
it wasn't too exciting I mean why they
show they just showed some TV stuff for
the most part 4k 4k 4k 4k 4k 4k and wait
there's more
OLED curved 4k buzz words excitement UHD
UHD oh okay I guess you can't complain
too much about that so what are we doing
now monster yes do you have any idea
where monstrous yeah cool okay so this
is a foolproof plan we've got this in
the bag but on the other hand it's
pretty nice view actually okay so this
is perfect I
so my bag I just all your awesome gear
everything just happened to be in the
way marques on it it's not yeah so how
long do we actually have until the next
thing now and a half so we're going to
be sitting around here for a while but
we have literally where you're first in
line because nothing else really all
that interesting is going on next so we
just had some Starbucks and grab
something to eat and now we're going to
yeah there you go and now we're going to
be exciting so you're gonna edit that
fancy video we filmed this morning right
yeah so we made a what and what's in our
bags
although ended up just being m√°rquez's
don't know what's in my bag yeah see
okay let's see we're gonna do a live
video right now got a scarf whoa very
pretty my mom got a few for Christmas
I'm impressed already it's there you go
I also have this mobile charger case
which I hate ech detect like or you
won't like it
Oh like I'll just be looking at my phone
and it'll go just right out of my hand
no traction whatsoever so I brought it
in case I don't have an outlet are you
stealing stuff I don't know what's going
to set okay so what exactly happened
today what happened today
flustered presenting a huge Samsung and
they just walk off the stage and a whole
internet decided yesterday
it was it was so painful to watch oh who
is this guy
where did he come from sir sir there's a
pretty good numbers reproduction here
what are you doing getting a shot where
you go
not turning around no no we're gonna
wonder how long we could sit behind you
before you would actually notice I was I
was doing my dick reporting yes real
questions like where's the SD card slot
yeah that's it incredibly important
hi are you sucking on my bag as I
thought I felt no I'm saying cuz I cuz
I'm very anti tough but I did that video
yeah everyone's like waiting to steal
your bag out definitely there we go

see I eat very healthy yes yeah don't
talk about what I ate before this or
yeah or how to look at grant how much
lemonade I don't address equal amount of
