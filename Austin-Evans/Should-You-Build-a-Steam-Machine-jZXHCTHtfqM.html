coming soon I wanted to find out should
you build one unlike a normal PC that
runs Windows a steam machine is based on
steam OS a custom version of Linux by
valve that's built around big picture
mode steam OS is totally free and easy
to install you can download it from the
steam site throw it on a bootable USB
Drive and it takes care of the rest
I installed steam OS on the firmly on
which is outfitted with a core i3 8
gigabytes of RAM at gtx 750ti and a 250
gigabyte SSD the system requirements
aren't too bad basically any computer
from the last few years should be able
to handle it
while steamos is still in beta it's
miles better than it was the last time I
tried it back in 2013 not only is the
installation process dead simple but big
picture mode has gained some serious
polish you can navigate the interface
with the steam controller which will be
included with the official steam
machines but it also works with game
pads like the ps4 controller along with
a mouse and keyboard it's nicely
designed for use on a TV but you're
still mostly limited to gaming there is
a web browser which is a lot better with
a mouse and keyboard but you're mostly
going to be inside the steam store and
your games the good news is since steam
OS is based on Linux you're not locked
down to big picture mode jump into the
settings and you can enable access to
the Linux desktop from here you can get
into the terminal and go crazy but for
entertainment like watching video it's
nowhere near as easy as describing the
YouTube or Netflix apps on a console
since this is valve that we're talking
about gaming is the big draw of a steam
machine the library isn't massive since
even though you're using steam not all
games support steam OS but there is a
decent selection including big upcoming
titles like Batman Arkham Knight Metro
last light Redux has been a staple of my
benchmarks for a while and it runs well
on steamos
well as long as you have a keyboard and
mouse it didn't work too well with a
controller some games like left 4 dead 2
don't even have a controller option but
once you get into the game is
essentially the same as running on a PC
trying a newer game like Borderlands the
pre-sequel had no issues at all with the
ps4 controller and ran surprisingly well
this is definitely one of the most
polished steam OS releases I've tried
dying light is available and while it
might not look quite as nice as on a
higher-end PC running Windows it's still
a solid experience one area where steam
machines have no problem is with indie
games there are a lot of titles like
don't starve the word great on steamos
beyond the native games you can also
stream games from
Windows PC running steam when connected
to the same network the experience is
rock-solid for most games like shadow
Mordor with a solid 60 FPS it's an ATP
you will notice some compression
artifacts especially in fine detail like
text but the latency is almost good
enough to play 20 games like csgo well
almost
so should you build a steam machine
considering it's free and supports a
decent selection of games it's really
not bad but there's no doubt the Windows
is still the way to go with your serious
about PC gaming so what do you guys
think about steam OS let me know in the
comments below and if you want to see a
video on one of the official steam
machines when they come out definitely
be sure to subscribe to the channel
anyway guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
