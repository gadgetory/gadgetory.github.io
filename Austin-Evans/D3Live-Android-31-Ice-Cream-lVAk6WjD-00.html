the latest iteration of android 3.1 ice
cream so what's new and this latest
delicious flavor of Android well there's
a couple of things and most notably is
that it's going to combine gingerbread
and honeycomb together in a single OS so
if you haven't been keeping up there are
of course two major versions of Android
right now honeycomb which is for the
tablets income rather it's android 3.0
fishel ii but that's what you will find
on the variety of tablets such as the
motorola xoom the LG there's i have the
tmobile g slate quite a few other
tablets and on the other hand if you
take a look at the phones the latest
iteration is android 2.3 gingerbread now
definitely i'm going to start messing up
these code names the one night in a
minute but the last one is gingerbread
for the phones now that both of them
absolute pros and cons but what ed but
Google is going to do with android 3.1
is going to combine them so you know
you'll be able to get ice cream on both
your phone and on your tablet I'm going
to try to stop saying this because I'm
gonna really mess it up but a light the
latest version of Android really seems
to be a convergence it's going to bring
a lot of the features from honeycomb to
the phones let's love what what that
means is a major UI overhaul now not
really that the Android UI is all that
awful or anything like that but what
this is going to do is it's going to
bring it a lot more in line with the
kind of the tron styling of honeycomb
and put it on the phones as well as on
the tablets now something else doesn't
seems to support is 720p video using
adobe flash player so in fact one of the
biggest things that why i started
talking about this is because adobe on
if you go into the android market a
couple of days ago i'm actually we're
talking about you need 3.1 which of
course that was a little bit of a snafu
there but basically what it's going to
be is with 3.1 you can download flash
player which will have full support for
hardware acceleration which allow you to
play 720p flash videos no problem on
most phones most tablets i met
everything of course but on most of them
i sort of guys that's about the major
things there are four so going to be
other major features that will be
announced one thing that's probably this
very very likely to happen is google
music we've been hearing a lot about
that of course the specifics and all
that kind of stuff will probably be
announced at Google i/o I believe two
weeks or so from now okay so for the
sake
segment of d3 live I will be taking live
questions from everyone in the chat so
we've got about 50 people in the room
right now some go ahead take some
questions and watch everyone troll me
and get the names wrong do I think and I
do I think 4.3 ice cream is going to be
the best android OS I think 3.1 ice
cream is going to be a great OS Android
is great I'm actually really considering
switching over to Android we're not
switching over but I'm really considered
getting myself an android phone and
using it full-time but yeah I think that
3.1 ice cream is going to be really
great is the 4.3 honeycomb cool what's
the best improvement in 4.3 ice creams
you guys can see there if you're not
watching slide they are trolling me like
crazy but that's okay because it's cool
what's the best improvement in my
opinion would probably be is the UI
overhaul um you know I don't know
exactly what it's going to look like
well of course like I said we'll
probably see that in the next week or
two but most likely it will be I'll take
a lot from honeycomb honey yeah honey
comb right what are the current
three-point Oh release is and bring a
lot out of the phones now guys this is a
little bit of an informal d3 live um I
they're trolling me so hard I can't even
pay attention but it's I'm going to
blame google for coming up with all
kinds of names and stuff um this 4.3
honeycomb come with ice cream yeah it
does okay enough enough of the questions
