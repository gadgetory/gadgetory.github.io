new Radeon our X 480 I've got to give a
big shout out to AMD for not only
sponsoring this video but also for
inviting me out to Macau for tech day
this year the star of the show is the
new rx 480 it's $200 this promises
serious performance for the price but it
represents an interesting shift now the
GPUs are ready to take advantage of
smaller process nodes AMD is opted to
focus on mid-range cards in the 100 to
200 price point one of the ways they're
doing that is with VR but we knew that
this holodeck like experience was on its
way
the minute the GPU got powerful enough
to be able to render you know fully
immersive realistic scenes the RX 480 is
fully certified to work with both the
oculus rift and HTC vive which
significantly brings the cost down on
building a PC that can handle virtual
reality so one of the things about
virtual reality that's actually really
important is keeping a steady framerate
so when you're in the virtual world this
is all I can see right now I look down I
see my fake body this is giant space
station and it's immersive and something
that is super easy to break the
immersion is that the performance is not
up to par but the cool thing is this is
a completely identical experience to
playing on a five six seven dollar
graphics card there's more to the 480
than just VR though the GPU is capable
of recording gameplay at up to 4k
without hurting your performance unlike
before where you would take a small but
sometimes noticeable hit this also
applies to streaming with programs like
OBS and it also can help put 4k at up to
120 frames per second or even up to a 5k
display using a single cable while
usually reference cards aren't as
popular as more extreme coolers I think
the RX for ID looks pretty solid it has
a dimpled finish up front with a single
surprisingly quiet fan toward the back
with the TDP of 150 watts it only needs
a single 6 pin PCI II power cable and
around back you'll find three
DisplayPort 1.4 ready ports along with a
single HDMI 2.0 to pump out some serious
pixels
it also supports HDR displays which are
hard to appreciate on a youtube video
but if you have a newer high-end TV it
makes a noticeable difference you can
also put two together in crossfire which
is becoming more interesting with
DirectX 12 multi adapter and they also
had an Rx 480 setup a tech day with the
razor core connected to the razor blade
stealth / Thunderbolt 3 battlefront was
totally playable of course the biggest
question is how does the 480 actually
perform
launched there are four and a GU bite
versions I have the reference model with
eight gigs of memory but there will be
non reference models available a little
later in the year I did all my testing
inside the neutron 3.0 which is an
upcoming $750 build with the 480 along
with the core i5 6500 you guys can check
out the full video for the rest of the
specs the first benchmark is the 3d mark
firestrike test which gives us a solid
baseline to start with considering the
GTX 970 is $100 more expensive it's
nearly at I where the $330 r9 390 is
able to pull out a small lead getting
into an actual game we have Grand Theft
Auto 5 which can still be fairly taxing
when you turn the resolution up running
on ultra settings the RX 480 is right
behind the 390 and narrowly outperforms
the still powerful 970 Middle Earth
shadow of mordor is another solid title
that the 480 does well in still edging
out the GTX 970 while delivering just
under 60 frames per second at 1440p
moving over to a DirectX 12 game and
ashes of the singularity this plays well
to AMD's dx12 strength with the 480
pulling away especially when you compare
to the 285 which really struggles here
it's pretty clear that the 480 has
absolutely no problem with 1080p Ultra
gaming and even 1440p is totally
playable but how about 4k it's actually
sort of doable I tested the cards on 4k
Ultra settings and while only shadow of
mordor is even close to being playable
if you turn down the settings you can
make it work the thing is this is a $200
graphics card it wasn't long ago that
1080p at this price point was all you
could hope for but the RX 4 ad can
easily handle 1440p and beyond
along with Virtual Reality speaking of
Andy was cool enough to hook me up with
an extra 480 to give away to you guys
all you do is make sure you're
subscribed to the channel and leave a
comment down below and I will pick a
winner in one month so what do you guys
think about the RX 480
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
