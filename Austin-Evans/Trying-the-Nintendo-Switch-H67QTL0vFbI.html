Nintendo switch of it in New York City
to take a look at the brand new console
of course the big shout to Nintendo for
inviting us out here and let's go take a
look
the idea of the switch is very different
from traditional Nintendo consoles so
well the way you did have a tablet it
was more of a controller there's really
nothing going on on the tablet itself
instead everything was being beamed from
the actual console whereas here the
switch is the console the switch is
rocking a 6.2 inch capacitive 720p
touchscreen it's actually a really nice
looking display and of course in the
demo lighting it's hard to really get a
great sense of it but it looks sharp it
looks colorful it looks bright a big
step up over the Wii U so we don't have
the exact specs on it right now however
according to Eurogamer it's an under
polished version of the Tegra x1 this is
the same processor that's inside the
Nvidia shield what that means is while
it's definitely going to be a really
powerful system and more powerful than
the Wii U is not going to be on par with
something like the Xbox one or ps4 it
looks like it has two modes one for when
it's running on battery power and one
when it's docked to a TV so the battery
power mode runs at about half the clock
speed of the dock mode which does make
some sense would you consider that's
pushing at 720p display versus a 1080p
TV however depending on the game that
could mean a performance difference in
fact it should it's a lot slower than
your battery life it's decent Nintendo
claims the range between two and a half
and six nap hours on a charge which is a
really really big range so to give a
little bit more context they say that
when you're playing Zelda pretzels a
wild you should expect around three
hours on a charge not great but it's
decent and the cool thing is the switch
now uses USB type-c which means that you
can use a battery backup or even a
generic charger and completely be able
to use it on the go
the switch talk itself is fairly
straightforward so it takes advantage of
that USB type-c connector to not only
charge the switch but it also takes the
video and runs it out via HDMI there are
a couple of other features like you have
a couple of USB ports on the switch dock
so if you want to plug in something I
can eat the net adapter you can do that
but for the most part it is a very
straightforward adapter dock thing the
switch still uses physical media for
games but instead of this you know you
gain cards like the 3ds so you also do
have 32 gigabytes of storage built in
and you can expand that via microSD but
don't expect to keep an entire game
library on your switch so if your name
is Ken and you're really into waifu
games you'll probably be really pleased
to know that the switch is now region
free no matter what country you're
playing games from they all work Ken
please don't ruin my video right now
don't no no no no come back come back
I'm sorry I'm sorry I said not waifu
games theorem there are more platelets
of switch the more I really kind of
understand why it's such a weird hybrid
between a handheld and a proper game
console so it has a toe 2.11
AC Wi-Fi and you can play traditionally
online which you can also play up to 8
switches locally with multiplayer that's
not something you would normally do with
a console once this time you and seven
buddies got a bunch of Xboxes together
and had a LAN party the online component
of the switch is a little bit unclear at
this point so at launch it should be
fairly similar to the Wii U you can do
online multiplayer and not much beyond
that however later this year it's going
to get some amazing new features such as
voice chat and lobbies and other things
that Xbox Live has had for a very long
time it also shares a yearly
subscription with xbox live which is
wonderful I'm not totally against this I
think Nintendo has been really weak on
the online side forever so the idea that
they start charging maybe it's going to
be a more upgraded more robust service
but we'll have to see if it's come with
some other perks like you get a free NES
or SNES game each month which you
actually may or may not actually be able
to keep and there's some smaller things
like you get discounts but the big thing
is is this actually going to be worth
the price and we'll have to find out
later this year and you're making can
work really hard right now I'm just
getting close don't we it was that
autofocus it was like Kenneth bleed oh
well the switch has a touchscreen what
really pulls it together are the joy
Kong controller so he can either be
attached to the sides of the switch you
can use them independently or you can
use them together as part of the
accessory I'm surprised how much I like
to joy Khan controllers by themselves
not attached to anything
as most people kind of separates them
because you're not really losing
anything and you can move your hands in
a sort of weight
I'm pleased having my hands together on
a controller this is actually
surprisingly nice but we're ready we can
actually attach these to the grip
accessory so we just slide it in it
clicks into place you can see it pops up
right there and there we go so now we
should begin with the grip the grip
itself doesn't really do a whole lot of
doesn't add any additional control so
everything is still on the actual joint
on itself
and see what food pitches over to the
fish display makes me have to switch in
tabletop mode running mario kart 8 a lot
so the idea here is that we can take off
either one or both of the controllers so
for example if I wanted to two-player I
could hand someone the other controller
trying to reach me while you shoot that
seems really tricky I sneeze like a bad
idea I think controller right now so the
joyed con controller by itself is small
it almost reminds me of an NES
controller so what happens is because of
switch display 720p all the games will
run at 720p obviously on actual display
but when you actually hook it up through
the dock to a proper TV you can go up to
1080p for example Mario Kart does run at
1080p 60 each game takes advantage of
the controls a little differently so
some rely almost entirely on the motion
control so you put one in each hand you
punch some games will allow you to use
it sideways more like an NES controller
and still other games can use it more
like a traditional controller when you
actually have it in the grip for the
most part it works really well so you
have NFC in one of the controllers they
each have the HD Rumble feature which
has actual individual haptic feedback
and different partials a controller and
what was really cool was just how easy
it was to dock so you can fly it right
into the actual switch take it off using
separately it's all using a single
button on the back it seems very robust
let's actually plugged in but super easy
to take off Nintendo definitely did the
controller's right here on the game side
of things there's a lot coming out for
the switch this year however at launch
it only has four title luckily one of
those is the Legend of Zelda breath of
the while I got to spend about 20
minutes playing it and it looks good so
technically it's very similar to the Wii
U version I didn't have them both
side-by-side to compare but they look
very similar the switch might be running
at a slightly higher resolution on the
TV but for the most part you're getting
a very similar experience if anything
the performance might be a little bit
better I also got to try arms which is
the game that's coming out the spring
and no it's not about these arms it's
about the arms of the game I guess I
don't know it's a cool game it's very
very simple so it's literally all the
motion controls with a couple of buttons
on the actual joique on so essentially
you have one each hand and you punch so
you can use them left and right to be
able to walk around and jump and all
that kind of stuff but for the most part
it really is about throwing punches
whether they're straight with a curb
whatever you do it's emulated in the
actual game it honestly reminded me a
little bit of wheat sports a game that
is very different really shows off what
motion controls can do
come on I have a ton of debt but of
course I don't get to play it for a few
minutes so we'll have to see when it
actually comes out there's also splatoon
too now I actually didn't get to play a
lot of the original splatoon but from
what I did I really enjoyed and splatoon
too seems very similar so you get
additional characters additional weapons
but for the most part it's a very
similar game just poured it over to the
switch a lot of cool games coming out
for the switch including Mario Kart 8
deluxe a brand new super mario odyssey
game
there's Skyrim as well as FIFA however
almost all these are coming out later in
the year at launch you're really going
to be mostly playing Zelda well I mean I
won't leave the Nintendo to switch
launches on March 3rd for $300 so that's
a decent price point my opinion yes you
can get a ps4 or Xbox one for cheaper
however this which is a completely
different value proposition it very much
is a gaming tablet that you can talk
with your TV versus the other way around
so what do you guys think about the
switch honestly I've got to say I'm more
impressed I was going to be specifically
by the controllers but that will be sure
to let me know what you guys think in
the comments below anyway guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
