here with Tec I like now this is a
series all about my favorite tech and
how I use it so if you're looking for a
full in-depth review you can check out
some of my older videos where I reviewed
a lot of this stuff but the difference
here is that this isn't so much a full
review it's just the kind of stuff that
I really like using and you're kind of
interesting or creative ways that I like
to use it I want to share with you guys
to kick the series off we're gonna be
talking about the iPad Mini which is not
only my favorite tablet but I would
actually say this is my favorite gadget
right now there's a lot of cool things I
like about this little tablet for
starters I love this size so I've used a
lot of tablets obviously I do a lot of
reviews and stuff so I used the iPad 2
the iPad 3 the iPad 4 and all of them
were pretty good and I used it
especially the iPad 3 I used that for a
while but none of them really clicked
with me they are a little bit too big
too bulky it's just a little bit of an
awkward size that didn't really like and
that's the same problem I have with the
Nexus 10 the Microsoft Surface the big
10 inch tablets they just didn't really
work for me I mean as far as spec wise
goes it's not all that impressive it's
basically just an iPad 2 and a smaller
shell with a little bit of a smaller
screen however when you put it all
together the weight which is a lot
better so I mean I could carry this
around and hold it all day long and
never get tired the size I mean I'm
holding it in one hand I mean try to
hold the Microsoft Surface upright in
one hand and see how long that lasts you
I actually didn't really like the iPad
Mini all that much when I first got it
the lack of a Retina display is very
noticeable I mean if you've ever used an
iPad 3 or 4 this screen will look bad
I'm just gonna say it right up front so
I first got it it was just like hmm but
as I started using it more and tried to
give it a fair shake I actually kind of
started looking past that it is still a
solid panel it's got good color good
contrast good viewing angles all the
normal kind of stuff the resolution just
really isn't there so a lot of text and
a lot of things just don't look anywhere
near as crisp and detailed as on the
iPad 3 and 4 what it really comes down
to for me is just how much the iPad Mini
gets right so battery life is a great
example of this usually I get between 10
and 12 hours on a charge which is easily
enough to get me through a few days of
use on top of that because it is so
small and it is so portable I like to
take it with me a lot of places so for
example anytime I'm flying or going
anywhere it's always in my bag because
if I want to watch a movie or read a
book or whatever it's always there even
something simple is running out and
grabbing some lunch a lot of times I'll
take the
iPad Mini because hey why not at first I
got a standard 16 gigabyte iPad Mini
however after I started using it and
realizing how much I liked it I sold
that one to get this one which is a 32
gigabyte black version with Verizon LTE
so having 32 gigabytes of storage is
nice on a tablet for me as for example I
just finished watching the entire season
of Walking Dead or at least catching up
on it on the iPad Mini and on top of
that having LT he had LTE has been an
absolute lifesaver for me so when I was
at CES I was using it to upload all my
videos and in fact just the other day my
internet just totally went out and I had
work to do so basically turn on LTE
start doing everything from the iPad
Mini no sweat
if you're interested more feel free to
check out my last video where I went
over the top 5 video game failures of
all time if you enjoyed definitely be
sure to leave this video a thumbs up and
if you're interested in more videos like
this be sure to subscribe anyway guys I
will catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
