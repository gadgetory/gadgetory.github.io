the review of the 2012 MacBook Air 11
inch I was a big fan of the previous
generation air and the latest model
bring some salt improvements but are
they worth it externally the computer
looks nearly identical to the last year
which isn't a bad thing at all the build
is entirely aluminium with a wet shape
that gives it one of the thinnest
profiles of any laptop you can buy best
of all the 11 inch air is still totally
usable as the keyboard and trackpad are
full-sized while the 135 pixel per inch
display can't touch the 220 PPI on the
retina MacBook Pro it rains very good
for a laptop of this size powering the
screen is a Core i5 or Core i7 processor
with intel HD 4000 graphics as the
latest ultra-low voltage CPUs from Intel
you'll find that there's plenty of
performance while still running cool and
being easy on the battery I won't go too
in depth on the performance but if
you're interested in the details feel
free to check out this video I made
measuring how fast the air is and what
kind of games it can handle just like
the last two versions the MacBook Air
comes standard with an SSD I've talked
about what SSDs are all about before but
to sum up quickly a solid state drive is
a collection of chips that replaces a
normal spinning hard drive an SSD is
generally more reliable as there are no
moving parts to break and are around
four to five times faster in the real
world this means the air is extremely
snappy the computer boots in just over
13 seconds and programs fly open much
faster than with mechanical hard drive
for an 11 inch laptop battery life isn't
half bad with watching a few HD YouTube
videos writing this review and Google
Drive and listening to music I was able
to get just over five hours on a charge
one thing that's entirely unchanged from
the last air is the keyboard and
trackpad combo the backlit keyboard is
great bordering on excellent if only it
had a bit more travel the trackpad on
the other hand is basically perfect and
is right up there with the macbook pro
as the best trackpads I've ever used
it's large for any computer but
especially for an 11 inch laptop and the
glass surfers works very well with the
various multi-touch gestures in OS 10
speaking of OS 10 as of recording this
review the MacBook Air comes pre-loaded
with 10.7 lion if you've used any recent
Mac you'll know what you're getting and
what we're very soon OS 10.8 mountain
lion will be out newer errors will come
pre-loaded with this but if you buy one
with line you'll get a free upgrade once
it's available there's some slight
changes with the ports on the left side
you'll find MagSafe 2 for charging which
works exactly the same as before but
with a new thinner
magnetic connector beside that is a USB
3.0 port and there's also the headphone
jack and a microphone on the right side
is the Thunderbolt port that doubles as
a mini DisplayPort along with your
second USB 3.0 I mostly use the air as a
portable video production machine and it
works well here obviously you wouldn't
want to spend all day using After
Effects on it but it can absolutely
handle a decent amount of editing
another thing that's very important to
me is how quiet it runs as the air is
usually how I record my audio the last
gen kick the fan app pretty quickly
however thankfully the new air with the
core i5 stay silent for much longer the
fan only firing up audibly when doing
heavy lifting you can order the air with
quite a few options the basic
configuration costs $1000 for four
gigabytes of RAM core i5 and 64 gigabyte
SSD $100 more will get you 128 gigabytes
of storage and another $100 will double
your RAM to 8 gigabytes which is the air
I'm using now you can also order a core
i7 for an additional $150 and bump the
SSD up to 256 kilobytes or 512 gigabytes
for three hundred and eight hundred
dollars respectively the options you
choose are up to you but one important
thing to keep in mind is that you really
can't upgrade the laptop after you buy
it the RAM is completely non removable
and the SSD uses a special connector so
it's best to get any upgrades up front
you can always want more on products and
the air is no exception
while the extreme thinness is great I
would gladly trade a few millimeters for
an included SD card reader and another
USB port the battery life is solid but
nothing spectacular and while it's more
than fast enough from 98% of users
having a bit more power can make editing
better and gaming more viable all that
said the MacBook Air is a fantastic
computer the size is perfect for me the
keyboard and trackpad are phenomenal and
with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt
you won't like anything for high-speed
connectivity with the new Ivy Bridge
processors and the option to get eight
gigabytes of RAM I wish list is steadily
disappearing well it's not a massive
upgrade from the last generation I can
easily say that the 2012 MacBook Air
remains an excellent choice if you're
interested more on the MacBook Air feel
free to check out my unboxing as well as
take a look at the game performance and
speed test here if you enjoyed

thumbs up and if you're interested in
