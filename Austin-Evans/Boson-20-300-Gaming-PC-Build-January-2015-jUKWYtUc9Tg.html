building a gaming PC one of the
drawbacks is that they're usually more
expensive than a console that's where
the boson 2.0 comes in at just three
hundred dollars Meli are you getting a
great first PC that's simple to build
but it's also easily upgradeable later
on the heart of the boson 2.0 is the AMD
a6 7400 k a dual-core 3.9 gigahertz
Kaveri apu with some solid built-in
graphics there's also one a seuss a 78 m
ii motherboard which has everything you
need including a pci 3.0 slot which will
come in handy later on even though this
is a budget build we still got a full
eight gigabytes of g.skill 1866
megahertz ram which is important to keep
that apu fed we've also got a one
terabyte Western Digital caviar blue
hard drive to give you plenty of storage
and a 450 watt Rosewill power supply
this is included with the Roseville FB
mo1 micro ATX case which is hard to beat
for the money and wraps up the build
nicely since we're working with one of
AMD's Kaveri APU s we've got a few cool
features like true audio and mantle
support along with the easy ability to
upgrade later on you can add a graphics
card such as the r7 240 to take
advantage of dual graphics or even go
all out with something like a gtx 750ti
you can also overclock the 7400 k if
you'd like just don't expect huge gains
on the stock cooler of course what's
really important is how the computer
actually performs jump into League of
Legends and we're able to play at max
settings at 1080p no problem
minecraft is also totally playable 1080p
although here you will want to turn down
the render distance just a bit get into
a more demanding game like red Autosport
and you're looking at medium settings at
720p BioShock Infinite is also totally
playable 720p and medium settings
running all of this on an APU means
power consumption isn't too bad either
with low power peaking it's just under
100 watts the boson 2.0 is not about
maxing out games at 4k but it is good at
though is playing a lot of the most
popular PC games out there for only $300
now as always I'll have links to
everything you need in the description
of this video if u want sneak peeks at
future PC builds
