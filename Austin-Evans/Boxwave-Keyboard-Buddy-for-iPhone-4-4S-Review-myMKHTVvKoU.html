iOS Vlad come here to do a review on the
box wave keyboard buddy for Duncan three
three three oh three so this is the Box
Wave keyboard buddy for the iPhone 4 and
the iPhone 4s this will work on your
Sprint AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon iPhone Ford in
for s's there's also one for the 3GS and
they do come in different colors there's
a black one and a white one so about too
many colors but there's also a vertical
version of this so if you think of
something like the Palm Pre which has a
vertical keyboard instead of a
horizontal keyboard like this one then
you can also get that one that one is
available on Amazon as well anyways the
third-generation keyboard buddy just
came out this is the second generation
what makes the third generation
different is that it has a backlight
keyboard everything else is pretty much
the same it just has a backlit keyboard
which is really awesome because it's
really hard to type in dark areas or the
dark or nighttime on this keyboard
because you just can't see the keys I
know they're white and they should stand
out but they don't so with the backlit
addition it's not a problem anymore
be sure to check it out it's fifty eight
ninety five on Amazon it's normally like
eighty ninety dollars so it's a heck of
a deal so I'm going to show you guys
what this thing basically does it's a
physical keyboard for your iPhone 4 and
4s and 3GS and all the other devices
they support you can just pop it right
in there as you can see it just pops in
real easily it's actually harder to take
out then put back in it's not too
difficult though and we'll just slide
the keyboard back in for a second let's
not open my camera and as we can see
right here on the side we have open
volume buttons plus the silent switch
which is good because it works on all of
the devices the Sprint and the AT&amp;amp;T
iPhones meaning the GSM and the CDMA
iPhones and then up here is what I love
because you can fit any headphone switch
into the headphone jack up here which is
really helpful
I hate when cases cover that up because
you just can't put every headphone jack
in there and then also the sleep button
up here is naked which is good too so
that's pretty awesome back here you have
the camera with a lot of room for flash
you shouldn't have any
problem taking pictures with the flash
with this case you have an icebox wave
logo right there and then on this side
we have nothing then on the bottom right
here as we can see we have the duct
connector open and then you have the
mini USB at the bottom right there which
you will use to charge the Box wave
keyboard buddy now you don't have to
charge it for too long it keeps a pretty
good charge I think it lasted like two
weeks or something like that for me and
then it died but seriously guys just
charge both at the same time just make a
habit of putting both cords in the dock
connector cord and the mini USB at the
same time and you'll have no problem and
you also have the switch for the box
wave keyboard buddy and the connect
button which you will use to connect to
your iPhone 4 or 4s or any other device
so your speakers are open as well
everything's good nothing really on the
front you just slide out the keyboard
buddy and you have a physical QWERTY
keyboard now you have things like the
home button which you can go ahead and
press that DoubleTap that and you should
be able to go to spotlight right there
but I just forgot I was not connected
yet so I'm going to show you guys how to
connect this thing you just go into the
settings and currently I'm on airplane
mode just go to general and you can go
to bluetooth you need to turn your
Bluetooth on and you need to turn this
thing on now just go ahead and press
that little connect button you'll see
the blue little LED light right there
and there's our keyboard we can go ahead
and tap on that and now it's connected
now when you connect this thing for the
first time it's just going to tell you
to type like four numbers up on the
keyboard and press Enter
and then you'll connect the Bluetooth
keyboard it's pretty much the same thing
as typing in a code when you activate a
Bluetooth headset on your device so now
we have the keyboard we can go ahead and
press the home button I guess I don't
need to be pressing this one anymore
it's too bad that there's no jailbreak
for the 4s because you can use things
like SB rotator which will allow you to
rotate your springboard icons and you'll
have a whole landscape iPhone it's a
little bit laggy and all apps aren't
landscape which kind of sucks so there's
a lot of bugs when you're using it in
full landscape mode so that's why you
just kind of have to use the keyboard
when you're typing text messages
and typing long things so let's go into
the Notes app now that we have our
keyboard connected we can go ahead and
just press the space button let's go
into landscape mode here we can do
something like hey I'm on done in I know
the numbers are gonna suck three three
oh I guess you have to tap the function
button every time you press a number but
that's okay that's not too difficult you
get used to it hey I'm on Duncan three
three three oh three what's up
viewers what's up everyone just wanted
to say that tip typed it with an X so
it's really easy to type on this thing
it's not a hassle you really do get used
to it the backlit Edition is probably
gonna be awesome
I'm gonna try to get a hands on of that
one because I really want to test it out
so you also have things like play button
and Next button previous button and you
can also tone down your brightness by
holding down the function button and
kind of just toning down the brightness
there which is pretty useful and it's
really easy to do you just kind of have
to press both buttons and it does it and
then you can do things like play music
which plays like instantly after you
press it as you saw the little play
button popped up on my status bar so it
is a cool keyboard if you guys want to
check this thing out it has a lot of
battery life and like I said it's on
sale at Amazon I'm sure there will be a
link in the description below be sure to
check it out they recently moved the key
they recently moved the spacebar to the
middle which helps a lot it used to be
kind of on the side so it's pretty
awesome it's made by box wave it's
called the keyboard buddy check it out
guys and as always be sure to check out
