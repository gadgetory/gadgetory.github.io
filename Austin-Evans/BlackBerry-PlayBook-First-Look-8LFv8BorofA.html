look of the blackberry playbook so
they've just a Nisshin dancing this and
I've got to say it is a really really
impressive looking tablet looks like a
pretty big step up from the ipad
encourage any two other tablet is
available today so some of the specs
include it does have a 7-inch display
with a resolution of 1024 x 600 and i've
said before and i said again i think
about the 7-inch screen that's about the
sweet spot for tablets so that
definitely is a pretty good news there
in addition it also does have a custom
blackberry tablet OS so like I said
totally custom for this product and
actually does look quite nice is
somewhat resembles webos and with the
fact that it is very very heavy on the
multitasking side of things you actually
are able to swipe through all your open
windows and this is really a nice
looking interface now continue on to
some more of the specs it does have a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor so again
big step up from what you might find in
the iPad or perhaps the galaxy tab it
also doesn't have a whopping one
gigabyte of RAM and it does have two
high definition cameras a 3 megapixel
front-facing camera that shoots 720p
video and a rear-facing 5-megapixel
camera that shoots a whopping 1080p
video now some of those pegs those are
really impressive I mean if you take a
look at the rear facing camera for
example on most cameras and fun but
rather on both phones and tablets these
days you're barely struggling cap 720p
so to see them take the jump to 1080p
that's that's pretty impressive indeed
the entire thing is really nice-looking
with it also does have full support for
html5 as well as flash and also will
have a sinking sort of thing so you can
actually go ahead and remove stuff from
what from your blackberry phone to your
blackberry tab which makes sense so guys
no word on price or release date just
yet although I doubt that you know the
release date won't be that hard as the
product looks pretty much complete but
overall looks really quite solid now it
will be available initially only as a
Wi-Fi model however in the future they
do plan on having both a 3g as well as a
4g variants definitely good news there
anyone guys invent Lee curious to know
what do you guys think of this
personally I'm impressed with it now if
it turns out to be
as good as they say the software is
probably the only real question mark on
my mind but from what I've seen it
doesn't really you know looks really
nice and easy to use but of course we'll
have to wait and see get some hands-on
of it anyway so definitely leave your
comments leave your thoughts in the
comment section below because I'm very
curious to know if you guys are
interested in this or you get stick with
your ipad mini galaxy tab whatever
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
