here with a review of the iPhone 5s as
always Apple makes the unboxing
experience nice as with a quick pop of
the lid you've got your new iPhone I'll
go over it in more detail in a sec but
you've also got some paperwork and Apple
stickers the ear paws with a mic and
volume controls along with the 5 watt
power adapter and the lightning cable
for charging and syncing at first glance
it looks similar to the iPhone 5 and you
won't hear me complaining about that
it's got a fantastic aluminium and glass
build with sham furred edges which look
and feel great in the hand the biggest
physical difference is with the home
button Apple has included a fingerprint
scanner in it this time around and touch
ID is one of the coolest features of the
new iPhone after a quick setup to teach
the phone your finger you can then
unlock the phone just by pressing your
finger against the home button not only
is it much quicker than typing in a
passcode but you can also register up to
five fingers if you want to let someone
else use your phone for example it also
works to let you purchase apps by
tapping your finger on the home button
and it's a feature I'd love to see
expanded in more places
the iPhone 5s also comes pre-installed
with iOS 7 which is the first major
overhaul since 2007 it's a good upgrade
in my opinion the entire operating
system has a fresh coat of paint with
lots of transparency and new animations
there are a few rough edges here and
there and some animations just take too
long but it nicely shows off one of the
big improvements of the 5s the Apple a7
processor but simply it's the fastest
phone I've ever used everything from
multitasking to web browsing is battery
smooth and even while installing apps
uploading pictures and multitasking
several apps at once I still couldn't
get it to stuttered the benchmarks back
this up thanks to the new 64-bit CPU and
beefier graphics it doubles the
performance of the iPhone 5 and 5c and
even out speeds other Android and
Windows phones
the camera has also seen a fairly major
upgrade this year while it's still an 8
megapixel shooter the sensor is 15%
larger thanks to bigger individual
pixels and it's really only second to
the Lumia 1020 when it comes to image
quality some of the pictures from the
phone are flat-out awesome with
incredible color and detail it's
reasonably good in low-light although
not quite up to the HTC One here
and with the improved dual tone flash it
has a slightly better job getting color
right in super low-light the camera
interface is fast and responsive with a
slider to pick what mode you want to
shoot in including a super fast burst
mode you just hold down the shutter and
it will fire 10 frames per second for as
long as you like and then you can just
keep the best few pictures or use all of
them if you want video is also solid
since there's no optical image
stabilization it's not as smooth as it
could be if you've got a steady hand it
takes some of the best 1080p video you
can get on a smartphone a new trick is a
120 frames per second slow motion video
mode at 720p I thought it will be a
gimmick at first but it's actually
really cool
as the guys has been using bait Android
phones for quite a while coming back to
the small four-inch screen on the 5s
with a bit of a struggle the display
itself is still retina and pretty solid
with good color and contrast however
considering it's 2013 a 4-inch screen on
a flagship phone really just doesn't cut
it
battery life is reasonable as I was
consistently able to get a full day of
use out of the iPhone however that's
about it a longer day or if I get into
some heavier use and it will call it
quits early overall the iPhone 5s is
really impressive while the screen size
might not be ideal overall it is easily
one of the best smartphones period right
