video going over a pair of brand new
phones the HTC One X as well as the LG
optimus 4x HD as a long names aside
these phones are special for one single
reason there's some of the first phones
to be shipping with a quad-core
processor now one of the things to
consider with quad-core especially on a
phone is you're going to be your battery
life now of course you know having
quad-core fantastic you had tons of
power everything's gonna run Willie
smoothly multitasking all that kind of
stuff it's going to be great however
it's not gonna be great for long you
could be on your phone for 20 minutes
and the battery's going to be dead
holder that letter shouldn't be an issue
with these phones as they both have the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip now like I said it
is quad core but actually it's not
technically actually has five whores so
it has four quarters and they can be
clocked up to 1.5 gigahertz however it
has a fifth companion core which is
called someone more like 500 megahertz
so much much slower and you know when
you're not really needing to do anything
all that graphically intense or anything
like that the four cores are off you're
just using the single low-power so for
example if you're doing Twitter Email
you know your lockscreen very very
simple things that will take care of it
so let's talk about the phones
themselves so the first one is going to
be the LG optimus 4x HD now again long
name aside this is going to be the new
flagship for LG and it has a lot of
really cool specs so to go along with
its Tegra 3 chip it's also going to have
a gigabyte of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage going to have a 4.7
inch 1280 x 720 IPS display and probably
most important it's going to ship with
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich it'll
also have a 20 150 million power battery
which combined with the Tegra 3 should
be plenty of battery life it'll also
will have a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera and they make a pixel rear facing
camera so overall it looks let be a
pretty good phone probably my only
slight reservation about it has to do
with the fact that LG has put their skin
over it so of course like I said it
doesn't Android 4.4 to their skin / and
general I have really been a big fan of
the LG skin on Android 2.3 I definitely
haven't tried it out on Ice Cream
Sandwich yet so I'm not going to judge
but overall hasn't been my favorite skin
still have to see how it goes you guys
are interested in picking this one up if
she'll be available quarter to this year
in Europe and sure we brought to an
American carrier probably under a
different name with some tweaks and that
kind of thing the next phone is going to
be the new HTC flagship you One X and
this one isn't quite official yet
they're already been some leaked images
and all that kind of stuff
been generally looks to have very
similar specs with another 4.7 inch 720p
display the NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core
technically processor and it's going to
also have android 4.0 with sense 4.1 top
it looks to be really solid flagship for
HTC now again it's got another skin on
top of Android helper I did actually
like sense I do still prefer the vanilla
Android but if I had to pick a skin it
would probably be sense but of course I
can't take a video talking about quad
core android phones without mentioning
the samsung galaxy s3 now this one is
going to be a little bit farther off
Samsung has said that the successors of
the galaxy s2 will be launched a little
bit later on this year however we've
definitely heard some rumors and stuff
about it and probably most notable thing
is something that samsung said just the
other day so they've launched a brand
new XE knows I'm probably saying it
wrong but they're brand new processors
in dual as well as quad core form and
now their original processors in the
galaxy s2 were really really fast they
still remain very fast today and of
course make a quad cores just could be
that much faster so what do you guys
think are you interested one of these
quad core phones or you may be looking
to see how battery life and LTE and all
that kind of stuff goes or are you
finally your current dual or single core
phone definitely let me know in the
comment section below hey guys if you
enjoy definitely be sure to leave the
video a thumbs up I really appreciate
that and of course you're interested in
