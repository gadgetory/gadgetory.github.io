checking out the LA Auto Show I feel
like a kid right now I have been doing
Auto Show in forever and it's just like
shiny toys all around so this is the
Audi s3 I guess he's getting in some
trouble on this I like the color too
like the metallic finish I'd have tried
back like that I I might need a minute
guys
so something I'm noticing is Gran
Turismo 6 over and Hyundai Gran Turismo
6 over and Chevy there's like a lot of
video games here I'm not going to play
any of them of course BMW has been
making you know fantastic gas cars
forever here's a seventh series one of
the coolest things about BMW especially
in the last year or so is the AI
division so they have two models right
now the i8 which is this very
cool-looking supercar as well as the i3
both of these are primarily electric
cars
however they have gas engines this has a
three cylinder motor the i8 in
particular I think is an incredible
looking car I mean you've got super low
it's super it's super cool it's a
supercar it's super super super good for
the first time ever and M for that
orange is sharp
I like that orange a lot just the N
division this is the fun stuff this is
what makes me excited
and here is an m235i this is a little
bit more in a Austin kind of money to
the very nice looking car I mean the
front end looks classic BMW you've got
the badge you've got the kidney grille
fish you look at it from the side it's a
really cool looking car
so you have the swag walk with the swag
jacket it's kind of insane to look at
just how small the cockpit is this is
basically just an engine
big tires big wings wrapped around you I
mean just that's crazy
20:15 zo6 convertible this is this makes
me happy
in all the right places so this is not
only the first zo6
on the new Corvette chassis but we're
also looking at convertible this has the
full arrow on it so you can see like
we've got carbon fiber we got a spoiler
we've got all the side skirts we've got
all that kind of stuff
probably diffuser back there got a quad
exhaust so this is the new LT 4 v8 so
this is inside the zo six monster
monster engine it's actually not that
big if you look at it not that tall
considering that this has 650 horsepower
it's actually pretty impressive alright
guys so I found literally the coolest
car and the entire Auto Show it's behind
this it's back here it's the new mx-5
miata I just love the look of this car
if you look at it it's so low to the
ground up front it's got the nice little
hips over the rear tires review units
Mazda him yep so this is the 2015 Subaru
BRZ
so actually the first impression here is
this feels like much more like a cockpit
than pretty much any of the other cars
I've been it wow it's actually pretty
impressive it's got a fairly small matte
screen but a car like this should be
having fun you shouldn't be doing
you go where you want to go believe in
yourself super bearsy so this is a
Hyundai Genesis has been cut in half so
this is usually kind of gimmicky but
it's always really cool to be able to
see there's a ton of engineering that
goes into one of these things I mean be
able to see like the obviously the
engine and stuff but it's just it's a
really really cool deal to be able to
see like look it like behind the dash
look like all the intricate stuff that
you never think about in a car I mean if
you look underneath you see like the
gearbox and the exhaust like there's so
much to a car that people never let pay
attention to so this is actually a
really cool thing all right where to
next so this is the airstream Autobahn
and you know pretty good way to get
around so in the back here now I do have
some more super comfortable seats but we
also have a refrigerator I'm just saying
I any one of these so while I might not
hit the auto show every day I have been
