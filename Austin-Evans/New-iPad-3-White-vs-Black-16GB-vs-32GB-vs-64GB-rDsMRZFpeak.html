here with a comparison to help you
decide which of the new iPads is best
for you first off as you can see here
the new iPad comes in both white and
black just like the iPad 2 this only
applies to the front as the sides and
back have an identical aluminum finish
regardless of color well this is mostly
up to what you think looks best there
are a few things to keep in mind
generally I found the white model is a
bit easier to keep clean with a nine
point seven inch glossy screen the iPad
isn't absolute fingerprint magnet but
white tends to hide the smudge is better
on the other hand the white bezel tends
to be a bit distracting especially while
watching videos I really like the look
of the white iPhone but on the much
larger iPad to me it doesn't look quite
as nice
of course it's entirely up to you as far
as which you think looks better but I'll
be sticking with the black iPad next up
is storage the iPad comes in 16 32 and
64 gigabyte capacities for $4.99 $5.99
and $6.99 for Wi-Fi models with the 4G
options coming in at an additional 129
dollars each
whether you need 4G or not is up to you
but choosing which capacity to go buy
can be tricky especially because there's
no way to expand the memory at a later
date if you decide you need more storage
one of the biggest improvements the iPad
is the Retina display since it has
quadrupled a resolution that means apps
are quite a bit larger than earlier iPad
models combine that with full 3d
high-definition games which can easily
talk about one gigabyte or more in space
disappears quickly especially once you
load up photos video and music if you're
a light user and mostly plan on using
your iPad for web browsing and the
occasional game or two 16 gigabytes
ought to be fine for the majority of
people though I recommend picking up the
32 gig iPad while it's definitely
possible to use the 16 gigabyte and just
constantly delete apps when you're done
you can fill up your entire storage
space with just a few apps in the 1080p
movie if you're serious about using your
iPad the 64 gigabyte option isn't a bad
idea either although it's $700 that's a
bit hard to swallow if you enjoyed this
video be sure to leave it a thumbs up if
you want to see more videos on the new
iPad hit up this playlist where I have
all of my iPad courage along with new
videos as they're posted</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
