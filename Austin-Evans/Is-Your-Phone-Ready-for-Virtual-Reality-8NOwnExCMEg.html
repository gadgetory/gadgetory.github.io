headsets like oculus rift and Sony
Morpheus or promising big things but
what can you do with just your phone to
find out I gather three of the best
mobile VR headsets Google cardboard
Zeiss VR one and Samsung gear VR unlike
a traditional virtual reality setup that
requires a computer these are fully
standalone as they're powered by a
smartphone take a look at Google
cardboard and you'll see just how simple
one of these headsets can be you put it
together like origami it's essentially
just cardboard a couple lenses and a
magnet to work as a button it supports
most Android phones and with version 2
it also works with larger phones along
with the iPhone since I've had a lot of
experience with VR headsets I wanted to
see what a couple friends who had never
tried VR thought so this okay so just
look in it
it's like I'm looking in a movie theater
right now like I'm sitting in a movie
theater I'm actually seeing what I would
usually see and what's just like a good
just reach up and grab it
like it is that close to me it's like a
3d movie I don't know I don't know any
other way to put it it's like I'm
actually here watching it like in the
screen I'm dizzy right now how like
insanely detailed that was I almost fell
over just looking at it so that might be
a little a safety hazard
considering just how simple cardboard is
it's pretty incredible what you can get
out of it a big part of these headsets
are the phone you're using and will let
screens like in the Galaxy s6 edge we
used here tend to get the best results
and high resolution screens make a big
difference to the clarity next we've got
Zeiss VR one this is a more finished
product with an actual head strap and
considering we're talking about Zeiss
some top-notch optics
unlike cardboard there are actual trays
to mount your phone which for the moment
only supports the iPhone 6 in galaxy s5
but they've also released the specs if
you feel like 3d printing your own trade
so go ahead and put the headset on okay
Rhino in their autistic
this is cool I wanted to like a little
uh old ruins so I'm wiping the sweat off
my face because it's really hot I think
if they had more insulation in here and
you don't feel as hot the entire time I
feel like you'd be more fun because this
is completely sealed all the way through
here so yeah I think the screen was a
little better too especially the quality
the quality screen was a lot better than
this one this is kind of like it's kind
of kind of like playing a PlayStation 3
versus PlayStation 1 while having apps
available on both iOS and Android is a
big plus
iPhone 6 really isn't a great match for
virtual reality the screen just isn't
high resolution enough and the lack of
any control other than looking around is
a bit of a letdown next we have the most
well polished headset here the Samsung
gear VR for galaxy s6 this is by the
guys over an oculus and it shows not
only is there a dedicated touchpad for
control but this actually connects to
the s6 with a micro USB port and
features a silent fan to keep things
cool while playing all this isn't saying
oh oh wow okay this is like a lot
clearer it's like I want a robot this is
insane oh my gosh oh oh gosh okay that's
that's that's very I don't know I feel
like if you're really creative you can
make that cardboard one just as good as
one the Samsung I mean just glue some
padding on there and put a strap on it I
feel like it would just be just as great
but I mean it's the best one I've seen
over go out of the three at least
because it's the clearest at $200 the
gear VR is not only the best headset
here but rivals things like oculus and
Morpheus in my opinion there's not an
enormous library of content yet but even
things like watching video is incredible
the screen is just detailed enough to be
able to enjoy a movie in your own
private theater and if you pick up a
controller you can play some decent
games on it as well the absolute best
virtual reality experience will be on
headset scarred by pcs for a while but
there's something to be said about
having a headset that's powered by your
phone that's not only cheaper but
totally untethered cardboard is a great
way to give mobile VR a try but if you
have a Galaxy s6 or s6 edge the gear VR
is seriously impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
